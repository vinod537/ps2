6062,Sanofi's Libtayo Receives the US FDA approval for Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (mCSCC),FDA approves Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) as first and only treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma,"The approval is based on the results of P-II EMPOWER-CSCC-1 study and P-I study 1423 (two advanced CSCC expansion cohorts) assessing Libtayo in patients with mCSCC, locally advanced CSCC or Combined CSCC enrolling ≥163 candidates
 P-II EMPOWER-CSCC-1 study & P-I study 1423 Results: ORR (47%, 49%, 47%); CRR (5%, 0%, 4%); PRR (41%, 49%, 44%), showing its safety and efficacy
 Libtayo is a fully human mAb targeting PD-1 receptor and approved for CSCC in the US with recommended dose 350 mg IV infusion over 30 min every three weeks"," Libtayo is the third anti-PD-1 approved in the U.S.
 CSCC is the second most common skin cancer in the U.S.
PARIS AND TARRYTOWN, NY – September 28, 2018 – The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has approved Libtayo®
(cemiplimab-rwlc) for the treatment of
patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced
CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. Libtayo is a fullyhuman monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1
(programmed cell death protein-1) and is the first and only treatment specifically
approved and available for advanced CSCC in the U.S.
“Today’s FDA decision is great news for patients with advanced CSCC, who
previously had no approved treatment options. This is especially true because
these patients are no longer candidates for curative surgery or radiation,” said
Michael R. Migden, M.D., a lead investigator in the pivotal CSCC clinical program
and Professor in the Departments of Dermatology and Head and Neck Surgery at
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “Libtayo is an important
new immunotherapy option for U.S. physicians to help address a significant
unmet need in this patient group.”
CSCC is the second most common form of skin cancer and is responsible for an
estimated 7,000 deaths each year in the U.S. It currently accounts for approximately 20
percent of all skin cancers in the U.S., with the number of newly diagnosed cases
expected to rise annually. When CSCC invades deeper layers of the skin or adjacent
tissues, it is categorized as locally advanced. Once it spreads to other distant parts of
the body, it is considered metastatic.
“By following the science, we identified early on that advanced CSCC was a
promising target for investigation with Libtayo,” said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D.,
Vice President of Global Clinical Development and Head of Translational Science
and Clinical Oncology, Regeneron. “We are proud to offer patients in the U.S. this
first and only treatment for advanced CSCC and remain focused on advancing
our clinical research investigating Libtayo as a potential monotherapy and
combination therapy in other cancer types.”
Libtayo was evaluated by the FDA under Priority Review, which is reserved for
medicines that represent significant improvements in safety or efficacy in treating
serious conditions, and in 2017 was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status
for advanced CSCC. Breakthrough Therapy Designation was created to expedite the
development and review of drugs that have the potential for substantial improvement in
the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions.
“In the U.S., CSCC accounts for one in five skin cancers, and the number of new
diagnoses is increasing,” said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer,
Sanofi. “We believe Libtayo has the potential to make a difference for U.S.
patients with advanced CSCC, as it helps to fill a critical gap in treatment options.
We are committed to bringing this important medicine to patients in other
countries around the world as quickly as possible.”
The recommended dosage of Libtayo is 350 mg administered as an intravenous infusion
over 30 minutes every three weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Libtayo is available as a single-dose 350 mg vial.
Libtayo is expected to provide significant value for patients with advanced CSCC and
those who care for them. The U.S. list price, or wholesale acquisition cost, is $9,100 per
three-week treatment cycle. Actual costs to patients are generally anticipated to be lower
as the list price does not reflect insurance coverage, copay support, or financial
assistance from patient support programs.
Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to helping U.S. patients who have been
prescribed Libtayo access their medication. The companies have launched Libtayo
Surround™ to help patients understand how Libtayo may be covered by their health
insurance plans. Additionally, Libtayo Surround is designed to help eligible patients who
need financial assistance with their prescription. For more information, please call 1-877-
LIBTAYO (1-877-542-8296), Option 1, or visit www.Libtayo.com.
Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global business unit of Sanofi, and Regeneron will
market Libtayo jointly in the U.S.
Pivotal advanced CSCC clinical program and results
The FDA approval of Libtayo was based on a combined analysis of data from an openlabel, multi-center, non-randomized Phase 2 trial known as EMPOWER-CSCC-1 (Study
1540) and two advanced CSCC expansion cohorts from a multi-center, open-label, nonrandomized Phase 1 trial (Study 1423). Together, the trials represent the largest
prospective data set in advanced CSCC.
The major efficacy outcome measures for the integrated analysis of EMPOWER-CSCC1 and the two CSCC expansion cohorts were confirmed objective response rate (ORR),
as assessed by independent central review (ICR), and ICR-assessed duration of
response (DOR). The efficacy analysis was conducted when all patients had the
opportunity for at least six months of follow-up.
Combined efficacy results (n=108) from EMPOWER-CSCC-1 and the two advanced
CSCC expansion cohorts from the Phase 1 trial were as follows:
Efficacy Endpoints* Metastatic
†Only includes patients with complete healing of prior cutaneous involvement; locally advanced CSCC
patients in EMPOWER-CSCC-1 required biopsy to confirm complete response.
For the combined safety analysis (n=163) of EMPOWER-CSCC-1 and the two advanced
CSCC expansion cohorts, the most common adverse reactions reported were fatigue
(29%), rash (25%) and diarrhea (22%). Libtayo was permanently discontinued due to
adverse reactions in 5% of patients; adverse reactions resulting in permanent
discontinuation were pneumonitis, autoimmune myocarditis, hepatitis, aseptic
meningitis, complex regional pain syndrome, cough and muscular weakness. Serious
adverse reactions (SAEs) occurred in 28% of patients. SAEs that occurred in at least 2%
of patients were cellulitis, sepsis, pneumonia, pneumonitis and urinary tract infection.
Cemiplimab-rwlc development program overview
Cemiplimab-rwlc is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global
collaboration agreement.
In April 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review the Marketing
Authorization Application for Libtayo for the treatment of patients with metastatic CSCC
or with locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for surgery. The EMA review
process is anticipated to be complete in the first half of 2019. There are currently no
EMA-approved treatments for advanced CSCC. Regulatory applications in additional
countries are also being considered for submission later in 2018.
In addition to advanced CSCC, cemiplimab-rwlc is being investigated in trials in nonsmall cell lung cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer along with trials in
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, melanoma, colorectal cancer, prostate
cancer, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These
potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated
by any regulatory authority.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS

6065,Eagle Pharmaceuticals and USAMRICD Signs an Agreement for Ryanodex (dantrolene sodium),Eagle Pharmaceuticals Enters into Agreement with USAMRICD to Evaluate Neuroprotective Effects of RYANODEX Secondary to Nerve Agent Exposure,"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) and Eagle collaborates for evaluating the neuroprotective effects of Ryanodex
 Eagle will bear the research study cost and will be conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), allowing government laboratories to partner with private industries or academia for R&D projects
 If approved post research study, Ryanodex will be a novel neuroprotective treatment for amelioration of neurological damage due to nerve agent exposure","WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.–Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: EGRX) (“Eagle” or the “Company”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), the nation’s leading science and technology laboratory in the area of medical chemical countermeasures research and development, to conduct a study to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of RYANODEX® (dantrolene sodium).
The study will be conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), a written agreement that allows government laboratories to partner with private industries or academia on research and development projects. Eagle will bear all costs associated with the study.
While the standard treatment of atropine and oxime is essential after exposure to a nerve agent, these drugs are not neuroprotective. If approved, RYANODEX would represent a first of its kind agent as a neuroprotective treatment for the amelioration of neurological damage due to nerve agent exposure. Nerve agent exposure often results in death.
“We are delighted to be working with the U.S. Military on this important study to evaluate RYANODEX as a neuroprotective therapy in nerve agent exposure, a potential new indication for the drug,” said Scott Tarriff, Chief Executive Officer of Eagle.

6067,MeiraGTx Acquires Vector Neurosciences to Strengthen its Neurology Portfolio,"MeiraGTx Announces Acquisition of Vector Neurosciences, Gains Phase 2 Gene Therapy Program for Parkinson’s Disease","Vector’s acquisition is an all-stock transaction including its novel P-II drug candidate AAV-GAD evaluated for Parkinson’s Disease
 The acquisition focuses on developing candidate AAV-GAD and providing novel treatments for neurological disorders
 AAV-GAD is a gene therapy candidate delivering glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) gene, currently in P-II for Parkinson’s Disease and has also received FTD from the US FDA","LONDON and NEW YORK, — MeiraGTx Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:MGTX), a vertically integrated, clinical stage gene therapy company, today announced that it has acquired Vector Neurosciences Inc. (“Vector”) in an all-stock transaction. As a result of the acquisition, which was signed and closed October 5, 2018, MeiraGTx has expanded its portfolio of clinical stage product candidates to include adeno-associated virus encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase (AAV-GAD), a gene therapy product candidate ready for continued Phase 2 clinical development for Parkinson’s disease. A prior Phase 2 clinical trial of AAV-GAD was completed and was the first successful randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial of its kind for a gene therapy product candidate targeting a brain disorder.

“This strategic acquisition gives us an exciting mid-stage product candidate with promising, sham-controlled clinical data and expands our portfolio of potential therapies for neurodegenerative diseases,” said Alexandria Forbes, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of MeiraGTx. “We are excited to continue moving AAV-GAD through clinical development and look forward to potentially offering a novel therapy to patients with Parkinson’s disease.”
“With demonstrated expertise in gene therapy clinical development and manufacturing, we are very pleased to work with the talented team at MeiraGTx to continue the development of this novel gene therapy product candidate. AAV-GAD has the potential to transform the treatment of Parkinson’s disease patients, providing hope for patients with limited treatment options,” said Michael Kaplitt, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder of Vector.
About the AAV-GAD Phase 2 Clinical Results
In a blinded Phase 2 clinical trial of AAV-GAD in patients with medically refractory Parkinson’s disease, 45 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either AAV-GAD gene therapy delivered by injection into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on both sides of the brain or bilateral sham surgery. Subjects were followed for one year and all results remained blinded until the final treated patient reached the 6-month primary endpoint. The trial met the pre-specified, per-protocol primary endpoint, with a significant improvement in the off-medication motor section of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part 3 compared to baseline. There was also a significant difference in the degree of improvement compared with patients in the sham arm. Other endpoints also showed significant improvements in AAV-GAD treated patients compared to patients in the sham arm.

The primary outcome measure was the 6-month change from baseline in double-blind assessment of off-medication UPDRS motor scores.
At the 6-month endpoint, UPDRS score for the AAV-GAD group decreased by 8.1 points (SD 1.7, 23.1%; p<0.0001) and by 4.7 points in the sham group (1.5, 12.7%; p=0.003).
The AAV-GAD group showed a signiﬁcantly greater improvement from baseline in UPDRS scores compared with the sham group over the 6-month course of the study (RMANOVA, p=0.04).
Significant difference in the response rate between groups, with responders being defined as patients achieving a 9-point or more improvement in UPDRS, which may be deemed clinically meaningful.
At six months, 50% of AAV-GAD treated patients were responders compared with only 14% of patients in the sham arm.
At 12 months, response rates were 63% and 24%, in AAV-GAD and sham arms respectively.
A significant improvement in complications of medical therapy as measured by the UPDRS part 4 was observed in the AAV-GAD group at both six and 12 months, and not in patients in the sham arm at either time point.
A significant decline in duration of disabling dyskinesia was observed only in the AAV-GAD treated patients.
A significantly greater number of AAV-GAD treated patients showed more than one hour increase in the time spent in a good condition on medication (“ON” time) compared with patients in the sham arm.
AAV-GAD was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse events related to the therapy and no speech or cognitive complications were observed. The most commonly reported adverse events were transient mild or moderate headache (7 in treated arm vs. 2 in sham arm), nausea (6 in treated arm vs. 2 in sham arm) and worsening of Parkinson’s disease (0 in treated arm vs. 8 in sham arm). The results of the trial were published in the March 2011 issue of The Lancet Neurology, the August 2014 issue ofJournal of Clinical Investigation and the April 2017 issue of JCI Insight, building upon publications of the Phase 1 trial data in The Lancet and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
In addition to these positive clinical outcomes, flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) analyses provided objective biological confirmation of improvements in abnormal brain networks associated with Parkinson’s disease following AAV-GAD gene therapy. These results were observed in patients treated in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. Blinded analyses demonstrated significant improvements in abnormal thalamic metabolism, a key node in the movement circuitry, in the AAV-GAD treated patients. This pattern of brain network activity was not seen in untreated hemispheres or patients in the sham arm. Furthermore, a specific pattern of brain network activity was identified in those subjects with clinical improvements in the sham arm which was different from the pattern observed in AAV-GAD responders.
About AAV-GAD
AAV-GAD is an investigational gene therapy medicine designed to deliver the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) gene to the subthalamic nucleus in order to increase production of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GABA, therefore it is believed that increasing subthalamic nucleus GAD expression through gene therapy will result in normalization of motor circuits and improve symptoms in Parkinson’s disease patients without affecting other brain regions that can be responsible for complications of existing therapies. AAV-GAD has received Fast Track designation from the United Stated Food and Drug Administration.
About Parkinson’s Disease
Affecting nearly one million Americans and 10 million worldwide, Parkinson’s disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease and is the 14th-leading cause of death in the United States. It is associated with a progressive loss of motor control (e.g., shaking or tremor at rest and lack of facial expression), as well as non-motor symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety). There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease and 60,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States alone.

6068,Celgene to Present Results of Two P-III Trial SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B for Ozanimod to Treat RMS at ECTRIMS 2018,New Analyses from Pivotal Phase 3 Trials of Oral Ozanimod to Be Presented at ECTRIMS 2018,"The two P-III trials SUNBEAM (N=1346) and RADIANCE (N=1320) involves assessing of two doses of ozanimod PO (0.92 & 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 & 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI) vs 1L Avonex in RMS patients for @12 mos. & @24 mos. respectively
 P-III SUNBEAM & RADIANCE Part B results: early & advance RMS (1 &0.5mg vs IFN): ARR@12mos. (0.149,0.217; 0.200, 0.277 vs 0.285,0.363); mean number of gadolinium-enhancing(GdE) (0.263, 0.278; 0.458, 0.32 vs 0.656, 0.915); mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions (2.952, 2.514; 3.744, 2.903 vs 4.633, 4.710)
 Ozanimod is PO sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1P1) and 5 (S1P5) receptor modulator indicated to treat RMS, UC and Crohn’s disease. Avonex (IFN) is a interferon beta-1a used to treat MS","Ozanimod showed effects on cognitive processing speed in a post hoc analysis of 12-month data from SUNBEAM™ pivotal trial

In separate post hoc analysis of pooled data from phase 3 RADIANCE™ Part B and SUNBEAM trials, ozanimod reduced annualized relapse rates and MRI lesions at 12 months in patients with a disease state defined as early relapsing multiple sclerosis compared with patients with more advanced disease

SUMMIT, N.J.Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) today announced the results of two post hoc analyses of data from the phase 3 SUNBEAM™ and RADIANCE™ Part B trials, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of ozanimod, a novel, oral, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1P1) and 5 (S1P5) receptor modulator, versus a first-line treatment, Avonex® (interferon beta-1a) (IFN), in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). These findings will be presented at ECTRIMS 2018.
“Slowed cognitive processing, which is common in multiple sclerosis, often impairs quality of life for people living with this chronic condition,” said Bruce Cree, M.D., Ph.D., M.A.S., Professor of Neurology at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Weill Institute for Neurosciences, Clinical Research Director at the UCSF MS Center and an author of both analyses. “The findings from these new analyses suggest that, when compared to interferon, ozanimod has a beneficial effect on processing speed.”
SUNBEAM evaluated two doses (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI respectively) of oral ozanimod in 1,346 patients with RMS treated for at least one year. A post hoc analysis of 12-month data from SUNBEAM to be presented today examined the effect of ozanimod on cognitive processing speed, based on performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Benefits in SDMT score at month 12 were seen with ozanimod versus IFN (difference: 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62, 2.56 for ozanimod 1 mg and 1.2; 95% CI: 0.19-2.13 for ozanimod 0.5 mg). More patients exhibited clinically meaningful (≥4-point) improvements in processing speed at month 12 with ozanimod 1 mg (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.55) and 0.5 mg (1.2; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.40) versus IFN.
A second post hoc analysis on annualized relapse rates (ARR) and MRI lesions examined the effect of ozanimod in patients with early RMS compared with patients with more advanced disease. Early RMS was defined based on a composite baseline profile, including 3 years or less since diagnosis, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 3.5 or less, and the use of one or no disease-modifying treatments. In the pooled phase 3 studies, two doses of oral ozanimod (1 mg and 0.5 mg) were evaluated compared with IFN in 2,659 patients treated for two years.
For patients with early RMS (n=1,392) in this analysis, ARR was lower at 12 months with ozanimod 1 mg (ARR=0.149) and ozanimod 0.5 mg (ARR=0.200) compared with IFN (ARR=0.285). ARR was also lower with ozanimod versus IFN in patients with more advanced RMS (n=1,267) (ozanimod 1 mg: 0.217; 0.5 mg: 0.277; IFN: 0.363).
Ozanimod also showed a reduction of MRI lesions in both early and more advanced RMS in this analysis. For patients with early RMS, the mean number of gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) lesions at 12 months was 0.263 with ozanimod 1 mg, 0.458 with ozanimod 0.5 mg and 0.656 with IFN. For those with more advanced RMS, the mean number of GdE lesions was 0.278, 0.323 and 0.915, respectively. Similarly, the mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months for patients with early RMS was 2.952 for ozanimod 1 mg, 3.744 for ozanimod 0.5 mg and 4.633 for IFN. For patients with more advanced RMS, the numbers were 2.514, 2.903 and 4.710, respectively.
“These analyses provide additional encouraging data for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis, from its potential to influence cognitive processing to showing results in patients with either early or more advanced forms of the disease,” said Jay Backstrom, M.D., Chief Medical Officer for Celgene. “Ozanimod has the potential to offer the multiple sclerosis community a new oral option for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis, and we continue to work with regulatory bodies in the U.S. and EU in our efforts to bring this treatment to patients.”
In the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 5 percent) that were higher with ozanimod than with IFN were upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, increases of alanine aminotransferase and increases of gamma-glutamyl transferase.
Ozanimod is an investigational compound that is not approved for any use in any country.
About SUNBEAM™
SUNBEAM is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ozanimod (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI respectively) against weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex®) over a 12-month treatment period. The study included 1,346 people living with RMS across 152 sites in 20 countries.
The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR during the treatment period. The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months, number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 12 and percent change from baseline in brain volume at month 12.
An analysis of the time to onset of 3-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.
About RADIANCE™
RADIANCE Part B is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ozanimod (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI respectively) against weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex®) over a 24-month treatment period. The study included 1,320 people living with RMS across 147 sites in 21 countries.
The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR over 24 months. The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 24 months, number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 24 and percent change from baseline in brain volume at month 24.
An analysis of the time to onset of 3-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.
About Ozanimod
Ozanimod is a novel, oral, selective, sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1P1) and 5 (S1P5) receptor modulator in development for immune-inflammatory indications including relapsing multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
Selective binding with S1P1 is believed to inhibit a specific sub set of activated lymphocytes from migrating to sites of inflammation. The result is a reduction of circulating T and B lymphocytes that leads to anti-inflammatory activity. Importantly, immune surveillance is maintained.
Selective binding with S1P5 is thought to activate specific cells within the central nervous system. This has the potential to enhance remyelination (when the body is able to repair damaged myelin after inflammation is reduced) and prevent synaptic defects. Ultimately, neurological damage may be prevented.
About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves. The myelin damage disrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Ultimately, the nerves themselves may deteriorate — a process that’s currently irreversible. Signs and symptoms vary widely, depending on the amount of damage and the nerves affected. Some people living with MS may lose the ability to walk independently, while others experience long periods of remission during which they develop no new symptoms. Multiple sclerosis affects approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. and approximately 2.5 million people worldwide.
Relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is characterized by clearly defined attacks of worsening neurologic function. These attacks — often called relapses, flare-ups or exacerbations — are followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remissions), during which symptoms improve partially or completely with no apparent progression of disease. RMS is the most common disease course at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 85 percent of patients are initially diagnosed with RMS, compared with 10-15 percent with progressive forms of the disease.

 The agreement focus on expanding immunomodulation portfolio for developing multiple immuno-oncology therapeutics
 The licensed technology is based on the viral genome sequence of the measles vaccine strain used to immunize globally and can also be used for killing tumor cells","Themis to expand measles vector immunomodulation portfolio into oncology indications–
Vienna, Austria, – Themis announced today that it has entered into a license agreement with Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH, the technology transfer agency of the Max Planck Society in Germany, granting it exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapies based on an oncolytic measles virus platform that was jointly developed by the Eberhard-Karls-University Tübingen and the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
“This is a transformative step for the company and will broaden our immunomodulation platform into oncology. It also greatly complements our existing patent portfolio around the measles vector technology for infectious diseases,” commented Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis. “We believe the long standing expertise of Prof. Ulrich Lauer’s virotherapy research group at the University Tübingen in advanced oncolytic approaches together with our measles virus product development capabilities provide a strong foundation to rapidly develop differentiated immuno-oncology therapeutics.”
The licensed technology is a modified measles virus based on the viral genome sequence of the established measles vaccine strain, which has been used to immunize billions of people worldwide. The measles virus itself has innate anti-cancer properties, for example, mediating tumor cell lysis, T cell activation and specific tumor cell targeting. Furthermore, it can also be engineered to include a tumor killing payload, making it a major building block for an effective oncolytic virus immunotherapy.
Themis established a robust cGMP manufacturing process for its measles vector technology and built a broad pipeline with both proprietary and partnered infectious disease vaccine candidates. The lead program in Chikungunya is anticipated to enter Phase 3 development in the near- to medium-term. Themis believes that today’s licensing deal with Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH will further expand its innovative technology platform to include novel oncolytic virus-based immunotherapy applications.
About Themis
Themis is developing immunomodulation therapies for infectious diseases and cancer. Through advanced understanding of immune system mechanisms, the company has built a sophisticated and versatile technology platform for the discovery, development and production of vaccines as well as other immune system activation approaches. Initially focused on preventing infectious diseases, the company has demonstrated the potential of its versatile platform through the rapid progression into Phase 2 clinical development for a vaccine against Chikungunya, a debilitating disease with global outbreak potential. Funded to date by leading Europe-based VCs, Themis has also gained prestigious non-dilutive funding for emerging infectious disease indications. The company will apply its platform and commercial manufacturing capabilities to diseases with high market potential both alone and for its partners.

About Adalimumab
Adalimumab is an injectable, biologic medication which inhibits Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF). This can cause inflammation in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. By specifically binding to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other disease symptoms.

6075,"At ESMO'18, Pfizer Presents Results of PALOMA-3 Trial Results of Ibrance and Fulvestrant","Pfizer Presents Overall Survival Data From PALOMA-3 Trial of IBRANCE (palbociclib) in Patients With HR+, HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer","The PALOMA-3 Trial involves assessing of Ibrance (palbociclib) + fulvestrant vs PBO + fulvestrant in women having HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer for 2L
 PALOMA-3 Trial results: mOS (34.9 vs 28.0 mos); mPFS (11.2 vs 4.6 mos); median CT (17.6 vs 8.8 mos.)
 Ibrance PO is CDKs 4 and 6 inhibitor indicated for HR+, HER2- advance or mBC and has been prescribed to 160,000 patients with approval in 85 countries worldwide","Results Presented at the ESMO 2018 Congress (European Society for Medical Oncology) and Simultaneously Published in The New England Journal of Medicine

 NEW YORK—Pfizer Inc.(NYSE:PFE) today announced detailed overall survival (OS) data from the PALOMA-3 trial, which evaluated IBRANCE® (palbociclib) in combination with fulvestrant compared to placebo plus fulvestrant in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy. In the study, there was a numerical improvement in OS of nearly seven months with IBRANCE plus fulvestrant compared to placebo plus fulvestrant, although this difference did not reach the prespecified threshold for statistical significance (median OS: 34.9 months [95% CI: 28.8, 40.0] versus 28.0 months [95% CI: 23.6, 34.6]; HR=0.81 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.03], 1-sided p=0.0429). These data will be presented as a late-breaking oral abstract during the Presidential Symposium at the ESMO 2018 Congress (European Society for Medical Oncology) in Munich, Germany, and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
“Delaying the need for chemotherapy is a central goal of treatment for women with this disease. These new data from PALOMA-3 show that adding IBRANCE to fulvestrant led to a substantial improvement in this important area”

The difference in median OS demonstrated in this analysis (6.9 months) is consistent with the improvement previously demonstrated for the primary endpoint of median progression-free survival (mPFS). In the updated PFS analysis for this study (non-prespecified), the combination of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 6.6-month mPFS improvement compared to placebo plus fulvestrant (11.2 vs. 4.6 months; HR=0.50 [95% CI: 0.40-0.62], p<0.000001).1 Overall survival is a secondary endpoint of PALOMA-3, and the trial design was not optimized to detect a statistically significant difference in OS.
“It’s noteworthy that the magnitude of progression-free survival benefit observed in PALOMA-3 has translated to a similar difference of nearly seven months in overall survival, which is clinically meaningful. This is particularly significant given the challenges of demonstrating overall survival in this disease setting, where post-progression therapy is often substantially longer than time on study,” said Massimo Cristofanilli, M.D., associate director for Translational Research at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, as well as senior investigator of the PALOMA-3 trial. “The overall survival data, coupled with the previously demonstrated progression-free survival benefit, are encouraging for patients.”
At the time of this analysis, follow-up was 44.8 months and approximately 60 percent (n=310) of events had occurred in the 521 patients enrolled. Patients on both arms received up to 10 lines (range 1-10) of post-progression treatment.
The trend toward OS favoring the IBRANCE plus fulvestrant arm was observed across most subgroups, with hazard ratios consistent with the overall population. In addition, for the overall population, the difference in OS was associated with prolonged time from randomization to first use of chemotherapy post-progression, an exploratory endpoint (HR=0.58 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.73], 1-sided p<0.000001). Median time to chemotherapy was 17.6 months (95% CI: 15.2, 19.7) for patients who received IBRANCE plus fulvestrant, twice that observed in patients who received placebo plus fulvestrant (8.8 months [95% CI: 7.3, 12.7]).
“Delaying the need for chemotherapy is a central goal of treatment for women with this disease. These new data from PALOMA-3 show that adding IBRANCE to fulvestrant led to a substantial improvement in this important area,” said Nicholas Turner, M.D., Ph.D., professor of molecular oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, as well as principal investigator of the PALOMA-3 trial. “The difference in overall survival and prolonged time to chemotherapy demonstrated in PALOMA-3 further support the role of IBRANCE in combination with endocrine therapy as a standard of care in HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer.”
“Looking at the data from the PALOMA-3 trial and across the PALOMA program, IBRANCE has transformed the treatment landscape for this disease,” said Mace Rothenberg, M.D., chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We are proud of the compelling body of evidence supporting the use of IBRANCE in this setting, and the difference this medicine continues to make in the lives of patients.”
The most common adverse reactions in PALOMA-3 included neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue and nausea. No new safety signals observed with longer follow-up were identified as part of this final OS analysis.
About IBRANCE® (palbociclib) 125 mg capsules
IBRANCE is an oral inhibitor of CDKs 4 and 6,2 which are key regulators of the cell cycle that trigger cellular progression.3,4 In the U.S., IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women, or fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy.
IBRANCE currently is approved in more than 85 countries and has been prescribed to more than 160,000 patients globally.
The full prescribing information for IBRANCE can be found at www.pfizer.com.
IMPORTANT IBRANCE® (palbociclib) SAFETY INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION
Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-2 (80%) and PALOMA-3 (83%). In PALOMA-2, Grade 3 (56%) or 4 (10%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, Grade 3 (55%) or Grade 4 (11%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3. Inform patients to promptly report any fever.
Monitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE, at the beginning of each cycle, on Day 15 of first 2 cycles and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.
Based on the mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. IBRANCE may impair fertility in males and has the potential to cause genotoxicity. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise women not to breastfeed during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.
The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (80% vs 6%), infections (60% vs 42%), leukopenia (39% vs 2%), fatigue (37% vs 28%), nausea (35% vs 26%), alopecia (33% vs 16%), stomatitis (30% vs 14%), diarrhea (26% vs 19%), anemia (24% vs 9%), rash (18% vs 12%), asthenia (17% vs 12%), thrombocytopenia (16% vs 1%), vomiting (16% vs 17%), decreased appetite (15% vs 9%), dry skin (12% vs 6%), pyrexia (12% vs 9%), and dysgeusia (10% vs 5%).
The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (66% vs 2%), leukopenia (25% vs 0%), infections (7% vs 3%), and anemia (5% vs 2%).
Lab abnormalities of any grade occurring in PALOMA-2 for IBRANCE plus letrozole vs placebo plus letrozole were decreased WBC (97% vs 25%), decreased neutrophils (95% vs 20%), anemia (78% vs 42%), decreased platelets (63% vs 14%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (52% vs 34%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (43% vs 30%).
The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were neutropenia (83% vs 4%), leukopenia (53% vs 5%), infections (47% vs 31%), fatigue (41% vs 29%), nausea (34% vs 28%), anemia (30% vs 13%), stomatitis (28% vs 13%), diarrhea (24% vs 19%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 0%), vomiting (19% vs 15%), alopecia (18% vs 6%), rash (17% vs 6%), decreased appetite (16% vs 8%), and pyrexia (13% vs 5%).
The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were neutropenia (66% vs 1%) and leukopenia (31% vs 2%).
Lab abnormalities of any grade occurring in PALOMA-3 for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant were decreased WBC (99% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (96% vs 14%), anemia (78% vs 40%), decreased platelets (62% vs 10%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (43% vs 48%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (36% vs 34%).
Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If patients must be administered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of IBRANCE and should be avoided. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers. The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure.
For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the recommended dose of IBRANCE is 75 mg. The pharmacokinetics of IBRANCE have not been studied in patients requiring hemodialysis.

 Tafinlar + Mekinist used for targeting multiple kinases in serine/threonine kinase family-BRAF & MEK1/2 and the combination is currently approved in 60 countries","Extended follow up results confirm leading BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination Tafinlar + Mekinist continues to show relapse free survival benefit
Cure rate modeling which estimates fraction of patients who may not relapse was 54% with adjuvant Tafinlar + Mekinist compared to 37% with placebo
Updated COMBI-AD data results simultaneously published in Journal of Clinical Oncology
Basel, – Novartis announced today a new data analysis of COMBI-AD, a phase III multi-center study evaluating Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) in combination with Mekinist® (trametinib) in stage III adjuvant resected BRAF V600-mutant melanoma. With extended study follow up, Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist continued to show more than 50% risk reduction in relapse free survival (RFS) versus placebo in patients with resected BRAF V600-mutant stage III melanoma. The updated COMBI-AD data was also used to generate a statistical cure-rate model that estimated the fraction of patients who may not relapse. The cure rate was 54% (95% CI, 49%-59%) in the Tafinlar + Mekinist arm compared to 37% (95% CI, 32%-42%) in the placebo arm[1]. These data were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology in Munich, Germany (Abstract #LBA43) today and simultaneously published in The Journal of Clinical Oncology.
A separate biomarker analysis was conducted to identify predictors of clinical outcome and treatment response. These analyses showed that subgroups of patients at a higher risk of relapse could be defined based on specific immune gene expression signatures (GES) and tumor mutation burden (TMB). Exploratory analysis of RFS in the treatment vs. placebo arms in all TMB/immune GES subgroups suggested that specific subgroups may have a greater RFS benefit, but the predictive value of TMB and immune GES warrants further validation in a prospective study[2].
“In addition to confirming prior relapse free survival results in the adjuvant setting, this biomarker analysis of COMBI-AD provides important information about the prognostic and potentially predictive value of TMB and immune gene expression signatures in resected BRAF V600-mutant melanoma patients,” said Georgina Long, BSc., PhD, MBBS, FRACP, Medical Oncologist, Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney.
In the phase III COMBI-AD global study, at median follow-ups of 44 months (Tafinlar + Mekinist) and 42 months (placebo), the three- and four-year RFS rates were 59% ([95% CI, 0.55-0.64]) and 54% ([95% CI, 0.49-0.59]) in the Tafinlar + Mekinist arm and 40% ([95% CI, 0.35-0.45]) and 38% ([95% CI, 34%-44%]) in the placebo arm, respectively (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.40-0.59]). RFS was also analyzed by subgroups defined by baseline disease stage by the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th and 8th editions and included nodal metastatic burden, and ulceration status. A cure rate model estimated that the fraction of patients who may not relapse was 54% (95% CI, 49%-59%) in the Tafinlar + Mekinist arm compared with 37% (95% CI, 32%-42%) in the placebo arm[1]. The fraction of patients remaining relapse free long term was estimated using a Weibull mixture cure-rate model. No updated safety analysis was performed as all patients have completed treatment at the time of the updated RFS analysis[1].
“The data generated from the COMBI-AD study have the ability to transform treatment decisions for patients with BRAF V600 melanoma,” said Samit Hirawat, MD, Head, Novartis Oncology Global Drug Development. “Not only do the results from the extended analysis continue to provide confirmation of the long-term benefit with adjuvant Tafinlar and Mekinist, but the comprehensive biomarker analysis of the largest adjuvant dataset to date highlight important prognostic information to identify patients at higher risk of relapse.”
The BRAF gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes and provides instructions for making a protein that helps transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell’s nucleus. This protein is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which controls several important cell functions. Specifically, the RAS/MAPK pathway regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration) and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Chemical signaling through this pathway is essential for normal development before birth. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. During cancer treatment, targeted therapies may inhibit the mutation from occurring, thus slowing the growth of the cancer tumor[3].
About COMBI-AD
The COMBI-AD study evaluated Tafinlar + Mekinist among patients with stage III, BRAF V600-mutant melanoma without prior anticancer therapy, randomized within 12 weeks of complete surgical resection. Patients received the Tafinlar (150 mg BID) + Mekinist (2 mg QD) combination (n = 438) or matching placebos (n = 432). In the initial primary analysis, and after a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the primary endpoint was met in that the combination therapy significantly reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 53% vs. placebo (HR: 0.47 [95% CI: 0.39-0.58]; median not yet reached vs. 16.6 months, respectively; p<0.001). The combination treatment group also saw an improvement in a key secondary endpoint of OS (HR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.42-0.79] p=0.0006, which did not cross the predefined interim analysis boundary of p=0.000019 to claim statistical significance).
Other secondary endpoints in the initial primary analysis where the combination demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit included distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (HR: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.40-0.65]), and freedom from relapse (FFR) (HR: 0.47 [95% CI: 0.39-0.57])[4]. In a separate analysis, Tafinlar + Mekinist also demonstrated benefit regardless of baseline factors, including disease stage, nodal metastatic burden, and ulceration[5]. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with other Tafinlar + Mekinist studies and no new safety signals were reported. Of patients treated with the combination, 97% experienced an AE, with 41% having grade 3/4 AEs and 26% having AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (vs. 88%, 14%, and 3%, respectively, with placebo)[4].
Based on updated data with median follow up of 44 months (Tafinlar + Mekinist) and 42 months (matching placebo), the 3- and 4- year relapse-survival benefit maintained at 59% (95% CI, 55%-64%) and 54% (95% CI, 49%-59%) in the dabrafenib plus trametinib arm and 40% (95% CI, 35%-45%) and 38% (95% CI, 34%-44%) in the placebo arm, respectively (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.40-0.59]). The relapse-free survival benefit among the combination arm was observed across all patient subgroups, including stage III A, B and C. The estimated one-year, two-year, three-year, and four-year RFS were consistently higher than placebo (one year: 88% vs. 56%; two year: 67% vs. 44%; three year: 59% vs. 40%; four year: 54% vs. 38%). The combination treatment group also saw an improvement in the secondary endpoint of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (HR: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.42-0.67]). No new safety analysis was performed[1].
About Melanoma
There are about 280,000 new diagnoses of melanoma (stages 0-IV) worldwide each year[6], approximately half of which have BRAF mutations[3]. Biomarker tests can determine whether a tumor has a BRAF mutation[7].
Melanoma is staged by how far it has metastasized. In stage III melanoma, tumors have spread to the regional lymph nodes, presenting a higher risk of recurrence or metastases[8]. Patients who receive surgical treatment for Stage III melanoma may have a high risk of recurrence because melanoma cells can remain in the body after surgery; almost half (44%) of patients receiving placebo per the COMBI-AD study had a recurrence of disease within the first year[4],[9]. Adjuvant therapy is additional treatment given after surgical resection, and may be recommended for patients with high-risk melanoma to help reduce the risk of melanoma returning[9].
About Tafinlar + Mekinist
Tafinlar + Mekinist target different kinases within the serine/threonine kinase family-BRAF and MEK1/2, respectively-in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which is implicated in melanoma and NSCLC, among other cancers. When Tafinlar is used with Mekinist, the combination has been shown to slow tumor growth more than either drug alone.
Tafinlar + Mekinist have been investigated for the treatment of a variety of cancers as part of an ongoing clinical trial program. Tafinlar + Mekinist are approved in more than 60 countries, for uses including:

as monotherapy and in combination for the treatment of subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600 mutation
in combination for the adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage III melanoma with a BRAFV600 mutation, following complete resection
in combination for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with a BRAFV600 mutation
in combination for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ATC with a BRAFV600 mutation
Approved indications vary worldwide. Please refer to local labeling for indication language in a particular country.
Tafinlar + Mekinist Combination Important Safety Information
Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, may cause serious side effects such as the risk of new cancers, including both skin cancer and nonskin cancer. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider immediately for a new wart, skin sore, or bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in the size or color of a mole.
When Tafinlar is used in combination with Mekinist, it can cause serious bleeding problems, especially in the brain or stomach, that can lead to death. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider and get medical help right away if they have any signs of bleeding, including headaches, dizziness, or feel weak, cough up blood or blood clots, vomit blood or their vomit looks like “coffee grounds,” or red or black stools that look like tar.
Mekinist, alone or in combination with Tafinlar, can cause inflammation of the intestines or tears in the stomach or intestines that can lead to death. Patients should report to their health care provider immediately if they have any of the following symptoms: bleeding, diarrhea (loose stools) or more bowel movements than usual, stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness, fever, or nausea.
Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause blood clots in the arms or legs, which can travel to the lungs and can lead to death. Patients should be advised to get medical help right away if they have the following symptoms: chest pain, sudden shortness of breath or trouble breathing, pain in their legs with or without swelling, swelling in their arms or legs, or a cool or pale arm or leg.
The combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist can cause heart problems, including heart failure. A patient’s heart function should be checked before and during treatment. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they have any of the following signs and symptoms of a heart problem: feeling like their heart is pounding or racing, shortness of breath, swelling of their ankles and feet, or feeling lightheaded.
Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause severe eye problems that can lead to blindness. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they get: blurred vision, loss of vision, or other vision changes, seeing color dots, halo (seeing blurred outline around objects), eye pain, swelling, or redness.
Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause lung or breathing problems. Patients should be advised to tell their health care provider if they have new or worsening symptoms of lung or breathing problems, including shortness of breath or cough.
Fever is common during treatment with Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist, but may also be serious. In some cases, chills or shaking chills, too much fluid loss (dehydration), low blood pressure, dizziness, or kidney problems may happen with the fever. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they get a fever.

 Bimekizumab is a novel mIgG1 Ab neutralizes IL-17A and IL-17F. The above mentioned results are presented at ACR/ARHP18","In the first presentation of long-term data for UCB’s investigational molecule bimekizumab, late-breaking results from the Phase 2b BE ACTIVE study showed promising response rates that increased up to Week 24 and were maintained to Week 48 across disease manifestations in psoriatic arthritis
Findings continue to underscore the potential value of bimekizumab’s unique dual neutralization of IL-17A and IL-17F
Results presented today as part of late-breaking oral session at the American College of Rheumatology/Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ACR/ARHP) Annual Meeting
Brussels, Belgium – – UCB, a global biopharmaceutical company, presented long-term data for the first time from BE ACTIVE, showing that response rates across musculoskeletal and skin manifestations with bimekizumab continued to increase in the dose-blind study period after Week 12, through Week 24, and were sustained to Week 48 in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients.
“The results observed with bimekizumab are impressive, as they demonstrate the potential long-term maintenance of deep response in rigorous skin and joint outcomes,” said Christopher T. Ritchlin, MD, MPH, University of Rochester Medical Center. “The results from BE ACTIVE support the substantial value of neutralizing IL-17F in addition to IL-17A in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a serious, chronic disease with a broad range of musculoskeletal and skin symptoms that can make it difficult for patients to perform many everyday activities, often negatively impacting overall quality of life. Despite the availability of new treatments, a substantial proportion of patients fail to achieve adequate control of their signs and symptoms and there is therefore an important need for new therapies that can provide meaningful relief across the broad range of disease manifestations.”
The study achieved its primary endpoint, with 46% of PsA patients who received bimekizumab experiencing at least 50% improvement in PsA signs and symptoms (ACR50), versus 7% with placebo, at Week 12. These results were generally consistent regardless of prior exposure to an anti-TNF and were maintained to Week 48 across doses.
At Week 48, ACR20/50/70 response rates were 70%/55%/43% for the 160 mg dose, 73%/57%/46% for the 160 mg dose with a loading dose, and 76%/63%/39% for the 320 mg dose. In addition, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) response rates at Week 48 were 70% for the 160mg dose with and without a loading dose, and 85% for the 320mg dose.
“We are highly encouraged by the 48-week results of BE ACTIVE for patients with psoriatic arthritis, the first presentation of long-term data from our comprehensive clinical trial development program for bimekizumab. These data build on the significant potential value demonstrated by bimekizumab for underserved patients with diverse diseases, including psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis,” said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Head of Immunology and Executive Vice President at UCB. “These data further validate the importance of the neutralization of IL-17F in addition to IL-17A and highlight the potential for this targeted approach to deliver meaningful outcomes for patients with autoimmune diseases. BE ACTIVE serves as a prime example of our drive to discover and deliver innovative science to specific patient populations with unmet need, such as those living with psoriatic disease.”
BE ACTIVE, a 48-week, Phase 2b, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study assessing the dose response, long-term efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with PsA, randomized 206 patients to five dose regimens to receive either placebo or bimekizumab every four weeks by subcutaneous injection for 12 weeks. Patients then transitioned to a dose-blind period where all patients received bimekizumab treatment for 36 weeks. The patient population included both TNF-naïve patients, as well as those who had been previously exposed to an anti-TNF biologic.
The study also evaluated several other endpoints, including the number of patients who achieved minimal disease activity (MDA), which continued to increase from Week 12 (29-46%) to Week 24 (37-60%) across dose ranges (160mg to 320mg). Response rates were then maintained through Week 48 (46-60%) across the same dose ranges.
Serious adverse events were reported in 4.4% of patients at all doses at Week 48. Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported adverse event (12.1%). Oral candidiasis was reported by 4.9% of patients and did not lead to discontinuations.
UCB is also studying bimekizumab in other disease areas, including psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab have not been established, and it is not approved by any regulatory authority worldwide.
About Bimekizumab 
Bimekizumab is an investigational novel humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that potently and selectively neutralizes both IL-17A and IL-17F, two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes. IL-17A and IL-17F have similar pro-inflammatory functions and independently cooperate with other inflammatory mediators to drive chronic inflammation and damage across multiple tissues.
Previous early phase clinical studies in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have suggested that bimekizumab’s unique dual neutralization of both IL-17A and IL-17F may provide a new targeted approach for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.i,ii,iii Preclinical results in disease-relevant cells have shown that neutralizing IL-17F in addition to IL-17A reduces skin and joint inflammation, as well as pathological bone formation to an extent greater than inhibition of IL-17A alone.ii,iv,v
About Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)
Psoriatic arthritis is a serious, highly heterogenous, chronic systemic inflammatory condition affecting both the joints and skin, with a prevalence of 0.05% to 0.25% of the population and 6% to 41% of patients with psoriasis.vi Symptoms include joint pain and stiffness, skin plaques, swollen toes and fingers, and persistent inflammation of the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone (enthesitis). Up to 40% of people with PsA can suffer from joint destruction and permanent physical deformity.vii,viii 
About BE ACTIVE
BE ACTIVE is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study of bimekizumab compared with placebo in adult patients with PsA. The study included a 12-week double-blind treatment period, after which patients transitioned to a 36-week dose-blind treatment period. The total duration of treatment was 48 weeks.ix
The study included 206 patients with PsA, who met classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis (CASPAR) and were having symptoms for at least six months prior to study screening, three or more tender and swollen joint counts ≥ 3 at baseline. Subjects also had to have active psoriatic lesions or a documented history of psoriasis.ix
Patients were randomized into five dose regimens to receive either placebo or bimekizumab every four weeks subcutaneously for 12 weeks. After Week 12, patients receiving placebo or bimekizumab 16 mg were re-randomized (1:1) to receive bimekizumab 160 mg or 320 mg; all other patients continued on their previous dose (dose-blind period). Patients were given the option to enter an extension study at Week 48.ix
The primary outcome measure evaluated in the Phase 2b BE ACTIVE study in patients with PsA was the percentage of patients who achieved at least 50% improvement in signs and symptoms at Week 12, as measured by the ACR50 response. An ACR50 response is a standard measure of at least a 50% improvement in the number of tender and swollen joints and a 50% improvement in at least three of the following: the patient’s global assessment of disease status; the patient’s global assessment of pain; the physician’s global assessment of disease status; health assessment questionnaire disability index; serum C-reactive protein levels. ix
Additional outcome measures assessed at Week 12 in BE ACTIVE include ACR20 and ACR70, a 20% and 70% improvement, respectively, in the ACR criteria; PASI90 and PASI75, a 90% and 75% improvement, respectively, in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Safety variables include incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawal due to AEs and change from baseline in clinical laboratory variables.ix

6078,Roche's Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) Receives FDA Approval for Influenza in Patients Aged â‰¥12 yrs.,Roche announces FDA approval of Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) for influenza,"The approval is based on P-III CAPSTONE-1 study assessing Xofluza vs PBO or oseltamivir 75 mg (bid for 5days) in the US & Japan (N=1436) and P-II study in otherwise healthy people with the Flu
 P-III CAPSTONE-1 study results: (Xofluza vs PBO): reduction in flu symptoms by >1day (54 hrs vs 80 hrs); (Xofluza vs oseltamivir) duration of symptoms (54 hrs. vs 54 hrs)
 Xofluza PO is a novel single dose, that inhibits polymerase acidic endonuclease. Roche gained WW rights to develop and commercialize Xofluza from Shinogi (Except Japan & Taiwan)","First and only single-dose oral medicine approved to treat the flu
Xofluza significantly reduced the duration of flu symptoms compared to placebo
First novel proposed mechanism of action to treat the flu in nearly 20 years
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Xofluza™ (baloxavir marboxil) for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza, or flu, in people 12 years of age and older. Xofluza is a first-in-class, single-dose oral medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action that inhibits polymerase acidic endonuclease, an enzyme essential for viral replication.[1-2] Xofluza has demonstrated efficacy against a wide range of influenza viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1) in non-clinical studies.[3-5]
“Xofluza is the first new flu medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action approved in nearly 20 years, and we’re excited to offer a convenient treatment option that reduces flu symptoms by more than a day with a single oral dose,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “If patients see their doctors within 48 hours of symptom onset, one dose of Xofluza can significantly reduce the duration of flu symptoms.”
The flu is one of the most common, yet serious, infectious diseases, representing a significant threat to public health. Globally, annual epidemics result in 3 to 5 million cases of severe disease, millions of hospitalisations and up to 650,000 deaths worldwide.[6-9]
Xofluza was approved based on results from the phase III CAPSTONE-1 study of a single-dose of Xofluza compared with placebo or oseltamivir 75 mg, twice daily for five days, in otherwise healthy people with the flu, as well as results from a placebo-controlled phase II study in otherwise healthy people with the flu. Xofluza significantly reduced the duration of flu symptoms compared to placebo, and demonstrated similar efficacy compared to oseltamivir.[10] In clinical trials, Xofluza was safe and well-tolerated with a side effect profile similar to placebo. The CAPSTONE-1 and phase II study results were recently published in the 6 September 2018 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.[10]
About CAPSTONE-1[10]
CAPSTONE-1 was a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xofluza in 1,436 people age 12 and older in the US and Japan. The primary endpoint of the study was time to alleviation of symptoms. The study found the following results:
Xofluza met its primary endpoint compared to placebo:
Significantly reduced the duration of flu symptoms by more than one day (median time 54 hours versus 80 hours; p<0.001);
Similar efficacy results were seen between Xofluza and oseltamivir in relation to duration of symptoms (median time 54 hours versus 54 hours).
The most common adverse events reported were diarrhoea (3.0%), bronchitis (2.6%), nausea (1.3%) and sinusitis (1.1%), and all of these adverse events occurred at a lower frequency than placebo. The study was conducted in the US and Japan by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.
About XofluzaTM (baloxavir marboxil)
Xofluza is a first-in-class, single-dose oral medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action that demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of influenza viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (e.g. H7N9, H5N1) in non-clinical trials.[3-5] Unlike other currently available antiviral treatments, Xofluza is the first in a new class of antivirals designed to inhibit polymerase acidic endonuclease, an enzyme essential for viral replication.[1,2]
Roche recently announced that the global phase III CAPSTONE-2 study assessing the safety and efficacy of Xofluza in people at high risk of complications from the flu, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), met the study’s primary objective and showed superior efficacy in the primary endpoint of time to improvement of influenza symptoms versus placebo.[11] Xofluza will also be further studied in a phase III development programme including paediatric populations, post-exposure prophylaxis and severely ill hospitalised people with influenza, as well as to assess the potential to reduce transmission in otherwise healthy people.
Xofluza was discovered by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and is being further developed and commercialised globally in collaboration with the Roche Group (which includes Genentech in the US). Under the terms of this agreement, Roche holds worldwide rights to Xofluza excluding Japan and Taiwan, which will be retained exclusively by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Xofluza was approved in February 2018 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the treatment of influenza types A and B in adult and paediatric patients, and is being commercialised in Japan and marketed under the brand name Xofluza®.
About Roche in influenza
Influenza, or flu, is one of the most common, yet serious, infectious diseases, representing a significant threat to public health. Globally, annual epidemics result in 3 to 5 million cases of severe disease, millions of hospitalisations and up to 650,000 deaths worldwide.[6-9] Roche has a long heritage in developing medicines that contribute to public health. We are committed to bringing innovation in the field of infectious diseases, including influenza. TamifluTM (oseltamivir) has made a significant difference both to the treatment of seasonal influenza as well as in the management of recent pandemics, and we are proud to have brought this innovative medicine to patients. Although vaccines are an important first line of defence in preventing the flu, there is a need for new medical options for prophylaxis and treatment. Current antiviral drugs have limitations with respect to efficacy, convenience of dosing, and resistance. Roche is committed to addressing the unmet need in this area through its agreement with Shionogi & Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialise Xofluza.

 Results: Acc. To FreeFlo, CoveredSeal configuration: no instances of access or deployment failures (74.7%, 25.3%); mean procedure and fluoroscopy times (88.7 ± 53.4/12.2 ± 8.8 mins); low rates of peri-operative mortality 2.3% & secondary procedures at 2.3%; Type Ia endoleaks 1.2%
 Valiant Navion structure is based on Valiant Captivia system with improved performance, having CoveredSeal & FreeFlo configurations offering two graft options for patients with TAA, BTAI, PAU, IMH, TBAD","(GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) –Next-Generation Thoracic Endovascular Repair (TEVAR) Device Expands Applicability to Broader Range of Patients
DUBLIN – – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the Valiant Navion(TM) thoracic stent graft system for the minimally invasive repair of all lesions of the descending thoracic aorta, including thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAI), penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers (PAU), intramural hematomas (IMH), and aortic type B dissections (TBAD).
Until now, patients with small iliac arteries were considered ineligible for thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) or required adjunctive procedures to accommodate calcification and tortuosity concerns. Valiant Navion allows for the potential for more patients to receive a percutaneous procedure and overcome these anatomical concerns, enabling a less invasive approach to treatment compared to surgical cut-down (open) procedures.
“Our focus at Medtronic continues to be on advancing the treatment of complex aortic disease to improve outcomes and extend life,” said John Farquhar, vice president and general manager of the Aortic business, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “This FDA approval now makes it possible for more patients with thoracic aortic disease to receive endovascular repair. This therapy is truly a testament to our more than 20 years of clinical and engineering insights, and we look forward to making it available to those in need.”
The Valiant Navion system is a lower-profile evolution of the market-leading Valiant(TM) Captivia(TM) thoracic stent graft system, which has treated more than 100,000 patients globally. Valiant Navion is built on the design philosophy of the Valiant Captivia system for improved performance and increased patient applicability. The system also features both CoveredSeal (proximal covered) and FreeFlo (proximal bare metal) stent configurations, providing physicians with two graft options to treat varying patient anatomies and pathologies.
“A significant reduction of the delivery system profile enables physicians to better facilitate the endovascular treatment of patients with smaller, tortuous, and calcified access vessel arteries,” said Ali Azizzadeh, M.D., the U.S. principal investigator for the Valiant Navion IDE study. “Furthermore, the challenging anatomical and comorbid baseline characteristics and resulting clinical evidence of the global investigational device exemption (IDE) subjects support this design.”
Approval was based on 30-day primary endpoint analysis of 87 subjects consecutively enrolled in the international, multicenter, prospective investigational device exemption (IDE) study analyzing the safety and efficacy of Valiant Navion in subjects with TAA and PAU. The study included a challenging real-world patient population with 37.9 percent female enrollment and 71.3 percent subjects with severe to life-threatening systemic disease (ASA physical status classification III/IV). The results demonstrated efficacy, with:
– FreeFlo configuration implanted in 74.7 percent of procedures with no instances of access or deployment failures at implant in the full study cohort.
– The new CoveredSeal proximal configuration implanted in 25.3 percent of procedures with no instances of access or deployment failures at implant in the full study cohort.
The majority of procedures (50.6 percent) were performed through a percutaneous access approach, leading to operational efficiency with mean procedure and fluoroscopy times of 88.7 ± 53.4 minutes and 12.2 ± 8.8 minutes, respectively.
Through 30 days, data showed low rates of peri-operative mortality at 2.3 percent (2/87) and secondary procedures at 2.3 percent (2/87). The rate of Type Ia endoleaks was 1.2 percent (1/87) at one-month imaging follow-up.
Approximately six out of 100,000 people globally experience a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), a blood-filled bulge or ballooning of the aorta that runs through the chest and can lead to a life-threatening rupture and hemorrhage if not treated. Most people with TAA do not have any symptoms; however, risk factors include smoking, obesity, heredity, injury, or other disease.

 P-III PANORAMA trial results: Development of VTCs (3%, 4% vs 20%); CI-DME occurrence (8%, 7% vs 26%); Collective occurrence of VTC & CI-DME (11%, 10% vs 41%). The avg. no.of IV @8wks &16 wks. are (8.9 & 5.5) respectively
 Eylea IV a prefilled syringe is a VEGF inhibitor formulated for eye. Regeneron has submitted its sBLA in diabetic retinopathy based on 24 wks. results under the US FDA with PDUFA date 13 May, 2019","First trial in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy to show both a reduction in vision-threatening complications and in development of diabetic macular edema
Both every 8-week and every 16-week dosing groups met primary and key secondary endpoints at one year
EYLEA supplemental application for treatment of diabetic retinopathy, based on previously announced 24-week results, currently under FDA review with an action date of May 13, 2019
Regeneron also provides update on EYLEA pre-filled syringe regulatory submission
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the Phase 3 PANORAMA trial evaluating EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection in patients with moderately severe and severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) met its one-year (52-week) primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. On the primary endpoint at one year, 80% and 65% of patients receiving EYLEA on an every 8- and every 16-week interval (after an initial monthly dosing period), respectively, experienced a two-step or greater improvement from baseline on the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, compared to 15% of patients receiving sham injection (p<0.0001). Regarding the two key secondary endpoints, which achieved statistical significance based on the pre-specified hierarchical analysis, treatment with EYLEA also reduced vision-threatening complications (VTCs) by 82%-85% and the development of center-involved diabetic macular edema (CI-DME) by 68%-74% compared with sham injection.
The development of VTCs (proliferative diabetic retinopathy and anterior segment neovascularization) was 3% for the EYLEA every 8-week group, 4% for the EYLEA every 16-week group, and 20% for the sham injection group (p<0.001).
CI-DME occurred in 8% of the EYLEA every 8-week group, 7% of the EYLEA every 16-week group, and 26% of the sham injection group (p<0.001).
These events collectively occurred in 11% and 10% of patients receiving EYLEA every 8 weeks or every 16 weeks, respectively, compared to 41% of patients receiving sham injection (p<0.001).
“Blindness caused by diabetes is one of the most feared consequences of this disease,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “In this trial of patients with diabetic eye disease and normal vision, it is notable that without treatment more than one third of patients developed a vision-threatening complication or diabetic macular edema within one year. EYLEA was able to reduce these complications by 68%-85% even with every four-month dosing, and moreover was able to reverse the anatomic severity of the disease. These results point to the potential value of earlier intervention in diabetic retinopathy and may in the future change the way retina specialists treat this disease.”
The average number of injections in the first year was 8.6 (of 9 planned) for the EYLEA every 8-week group and 5.5 (of 6 planned) for the EYLEA every 16-week group.
Adverse events were consistent with the known profile of EYLEA. Serious ocular treatment-emergent adverse events in the study eye occurred in 0 and 1 patients in the EYLEA treatment groups and 1 patient in the sham injection group. Ocular inflammation occurred in 1 patient in each EYLEA treatment group and 0 patients in the sham injection group. Anti-Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC)-defined arterial thromboembolic treatment-emergent events occurred in 4 and 2 patients in the EYLEA treatment groups and 5 patients in the sham injection group.
Regulatory Update on EYLEA Pre-filled Syringe
Regeneron also announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a complete response letter (CRL) regarding the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) Prior-Approval Supplement (PAS) for the EYLEA pre-filled syringe. The CRL requested additional information regarding manufacturing and supply processes and the completion of a usability study evaluating a single injection of the EYLEA pre-filled syringe in approximately 30 patients. Regeneron expects to compile all the requested information and resubmit the PAS in early 2019 and continues to expect a 2019 launch of the EYLEA pre-filled syringe.

PANORAMA is an ongoing, pivotal, double-masked, randomized, two-year trial that enrolled 402 patients and is designed to investigate EYLEA for the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR in patients without DME, compared to sham injections. Details on trial design include:

Three treatment arms – An observational sham injection group and two EYLEA treatment groups. EYLEA was dosed every 8 weeks (following five initial monthly doses) or every 16 weeks (following three initial monthly doses and one 8-week interval).
Primary endpoint – The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a two-step or greater improvement in the diabetic retinopathy severity score (DRSS) from baseline for the combined EYLEA treatment groups at week 24, and for each EYLEA treatment group separately (every 8-week group and every 16-week group) at week 52. The DRSS is a systematic grading scale to assess the severity of diabetic retinopathy based on photographs of the retina following a dilated eye exam.
Secondary endpoints – These include assessment of whether EYLEA reduced VTCs (proliferative diabetic retinopathy and anterior segment neovascularization) or development of CI-DME, as well as its impact on other anatomic effects, visual acuity improvement, and safety.
One-year results from PANORAMA will be submitted for presentation at a future medical congress. Six-month PANORAMA results were previously reported in March 2018. A supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy based on 24-week results was accepted for review by the U.S. FDA with a target action date of May 13, 2019. Regeneron also plans to submit the 52-week results to the FDA.
The safety and efficacy of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy in patients without diabetic macular edema (DME) have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.
A separate ongoing trial sponsored by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network known as Protocol W is also evaluating EYLEA for the treatment of NPDR in patients without DME.
About Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
Approximately eight million people live with DR, a disease characterized by microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina often caused by poor blood sugar control in people with diabetes. The disease generally starts as NPDR and often has no warning signs or symptoms. NPDR may progress to PDR, a stage of the disease in which abnormal blood vessels grow onto the surface of the retina and potentially cause severe vision loss.
DME can occur at any stage of DR as the blood vessels in the retina become increasingly fragile and leak fluid, potentially causing visual impairment. In the U.S., approximately 1.5 million adults are diagnosed with DME, while approximately 3.5 million people have DR without DME.
About EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection
EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye. It is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels (vascular permeability) in the eye by blocking VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PLGF), two growth factors involved in angiogenesis. In the United States, EYLEA is the market-leading FDA-approved anti-VEGF treatment for its approved indications and is supported by a robust body of research that includes seven pivotal Phase 3 trials.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR EYLEA® (aflibercept) INJECTION

EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.
Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.
Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.
There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.
Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.
The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.
INDICATIONS
EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in patients with DME.

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Esperion (NASDAQ: ESPR) today announced completion of the Phase 3 LDL-C Lowering Development Program of bempedoic acid and positive cumulative results. The program consisted of four, pivotal, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies to evaluate the LDL-C lowering efficacy and safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid 180 mg compared to placebo in high cardiovascular risk patients including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) patients.
The Phase 3 program included 3,621 high cardiovascular risk patients taking maximally tolerated statin (which could include no statin) who required additional LDL-C lowering. The Program achieved its efficacy endpoints and other key measures at 12 weeks for bempedoic acid, including:

On-treatment LDL-C lowering of an additional 18 percent to 31 percent (vs. placebo, p<0.001), and in the intent to treat analysis, LDL-C lowering of an additional 17 percent to 28 percent (p<0.001).
Reductions of 19 percent to 33 percent in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), an important marker of the underlying inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease.
Reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 0.19% to 0.31% vs. placebo in the subset of 1002 patients with diabetes
Safety and Tolerability of Bempedoic Acid
In the Phase 3 LDL-C lowering development program, adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the bempedoic acid arm as compared to placebo were:

3-component MACE: 1.9 percent for bempedoic acid compared to 2.3 percent for placebo
4-component MACE: 3.8 percent for bempedoic acid compared to 4.2 percent for placebo
5-component MACE: 4.0 percent for bempedoic acid compared to 4.6 percent for placebo
In the Phase 3 program, bempedoic acid was observed to be safe and well-tolerated. The vast majority (>80%) of patients were studied for 52 weeks. Across the program there were no clinically relevant differences between the bempedoic acid and placebo treatment groups in the occurrence of:

Adverse events (AEs) with 73 percent in each group;
Serious adverse events (SAEs) with 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively; SAE neoplasms were balanced at 1 percent in both arms.
Discontinuations due to AEs with 11 percent and 8 percent, respectively;
Fatal adverse events were very low overall at 0.8 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively (compared to a 1.8% fatality rate for people 65-74 year olds according to the CDC).• No fatal adverse events were determined to be related to study medication.
• CV deaths were balanced between the study arms (0.4% vs. 0.3%) as was sepsis (0.1% in both arms).
• The bempedoic acid arm included a case of gas poisoning and a case of pancreatitis resulting from a pancreatic pseudocyst.
About Esperion’s Global Pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C Lowering Program
Esperion initiated its global, pivotal, Phase 3 clinical development program in January 2016 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and consistent, complementary LDL-C-lowering efficacy of bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or who are at a high risk for ASCVD, with hypercholesterolemia who continue to have elevated levels of LDL-C despite the use of maximally-tolerated statins and ezetimibe, leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events. The program includes five studies in approximately 4,000 patients, four for bempedoic acid and one for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill.

Two pivotal studies evaluating bempedoic acid (Studies 1 & 2) in 3,008 patients with ASCVD and/or HeFH on maximally-tolerated statins, with top-line results reported in May 2018 and October 2018, respectively;
Two pivotal studies evaluating bempedoic acid (Studies 3 & 4) in 613 patients with ASCVD, or at a high risk for ASCVD, considered statin intolerant, with top-line results reported in May and March 2018, respectively;
One pivotal study evaluating the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill (053 Study) in 382 patients with ASCVD, or at high risk for ASCVD, on maximally tolerated statins, with top-line results reported in August.
Esperion plans to submit New Drug Applications (NDAs) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bempedoic acid and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill for LDL-C-lowering indications during the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, Esperion plans to submit Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) during the second quarter of 2019.
Bempedoic Acid / Ezetimibe Combination Pill
Through the complementary mechanisms of action of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis (bempedoic acid) and inhibition of cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe), the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill is our lead, non-statin, orally available, once-daily, LDL-C lowering therapy. Inhibition of ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) by bempedoic acid reduces cholesterol biosynthesis and lowers LDL-C by up-regulating the LDL receptor. Inhibition of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) by ezetimibe results in reduced absorption of cholesterol from the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing delivery of cholesterol to the liver, which in turn upregulates the LDL receptors. Phase 3 data demonstrated that this safe and well tolerated combination results in a 35 percent lowering of LDL-C when used with maximally tolerated statins, a 43 percent lowering of LDL-C when used as a monotherapy, and a 34 percent reduction in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).
Bempedoic Acid
With a targeted mechanism of action, bempedoic acid is a first-in-class, complementary, orally available, once-daily ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) inhibitor that reduces cholesterol biosynthesis and lowers LDL-C by up-regulating the LDL receptor. Similar to statins, bempedoic acid also reduces hsCRP, a key marker of inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease. Completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies conducted in almost 4,800 patients, including approximately 3,100 patients treated with bempedoic acid, have produced an additional 20 percent LDL-C lowering when used with maximally tolerated statins, up to 30 percent LDL-C lowering as a monotherapy, 35% in combination with ezetimibe when used with maximally tolerated statins, and up to 48 percent LDL-C lowering in combination with ezetimibe as monotherapy.
The effect of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined. The company has initiated a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) to assess the effects of bempedoic acid on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiovascular disease (CVD) who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and considered “statin intolerant.” The CVOT — known as Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes — is an event-driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study expected to enroll approximately 12,600 patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk at more than 1,000 sites in approximately 30 countries.
Esperion’s Commitment to Patients with Hypercholesterolemia
High levels of LDL-C can lead to a build-up of cholesterol in artery walls (known as atherosclerosis), potentially leading to cardiovascular events, including heart attack or stroke. In the U.S., 78 million people, or more than 20 percent of the population, have elevated LDL-C; an additional 73 million people in Europe and 30 million people in Japan also live with elevated LDL-C. There are approximately 13 million people in the U.S. with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who live with elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally-tolerated lipid-modifying therapy — including individuals considered statin intolerant — leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events. More than 6 million patients with ASCVD and/or HeFH on maximally tolerated statins require less than 30 percent additional LDL-C lowering to achieve treatment goals.
Esperion’s mission as the Lipid Management Company is to deliver once-daily, oral therapies that complement existing oral drugs to provide the additional LDL-C lowering that these patients need.
The Lipid Management Company
Esperion is the Lipid Management Company passionately committed to developing and commercializing convenient, complementary, cost-effective, once-daily, oral therapies for the treatment of patients with elevated LDL-C. Through scientific and clinical excellence, and a deep understanding of cholesterol biology, the experienced Lipid Management Team at Esperion is committed to developing new LDL-C lowering therapies that will make a substantial impact on reducing global cardiovascular disease; the leading cause of death around the world. Bempedoic acid and the company’s lead product candidate, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill, are targeted therapies that have been shown to significantly lower elevated LDL-C levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia, including patients inadequately treated with current lipid-modifying therapies.

 Lilly will get hold of Dicerna’s GalXC RNAi technology as well as development and commercialization rights to new developed drugs in fields of cardio-metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration and pain
 Dicerna’s GalXC RNAi technology is an attempt to enhance development of next-generation RNAi-based therapeutics, with SC delivery of therapies across multiple therapy areas, including rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases and viral infectious diseases","Companies will collaborate on RNAi research for cardio-metabolic, neurodegeneration and pain targets– Dicerna to receive an upfront payment of $100 million and an equity investment of $100 million– Dicerna eligible to receive up to approximately $350 million per target in development and commercialization milestones, plus royalties

INDIANAPOLIS and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: DRNA) today announced a global licensing and research collaboration focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of potential new medicines in the areas of cardio-metabolic disease, neurodegeneration and pain. The companies will utilize Dicerna’s proprietary GalXC™ RNAi technology platform to progress new drug targets toward clinical development and commercialization. In addition, the partners will collaborate to move beyond the current technical paradigm in order to generate next-generation oligonucleotide therapeutic agents.
RNA interference (RNAi) is an emerging new approach to drug discovery, focused on a biologic process in which certain RNA molecules inhibit the expression of disease-causing genes by destroying the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of those genes. RNAi has the potential to treat diseases by silencing some of the most well-validated, yet previously inaccessible drug targets.
“At Lilly, we go to where breaking science meets unmet medical needs,” said Daniel M. Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly senior vice president and chief scientific officer. “We are excited to collaborate with Dicerna and utilize their RNAi expertise to study targets that up until now have proven to be very technically challenging. RNAi has the potential to treat an array of diseases that are of strategic importance to Lilly. Together with Dicerna, we aim to employ this emerging modality for greater success in drug development.”
“The collaboration with Lilly provides an exceptional opportunity to leverage our proprietary GalXC platform in order to generate new medicines for cardio-metabolic diseases, and to establish a presence in new fields including neurodegeneration and pain,” said Douglas M. Fambrough, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Dicerna. “Lilly, with its demonstrated leadership in each of these fields, is an ideal partner for extending the range of Dicerna’s proprietary GalXC technology, which is designed to silence the expression of disease-driving genes. We are eager and ready to expand and advance our pipeline of innovative GalXC-based therapies, including both proprietary and partnered programs.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Dicerna will receive an upfront payment of $100 million, as well as an equity investment of $100 million at a premium. Dicerna is also eligible to receive up to approximately $350 million per target in development and commercialization milestones, as well as tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single to low-double digits on product sales. Dicerna will work exclusively with Lilly in the neurodegeneration and pain fields, and on select targets in cardio-metabolic diseases. The two companies anticipate collaborating on more than ten targets.
This transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The transaction will be reflected in Lilly’s reported results and financial guidance according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). There will be no change to Lilly’s 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance as a result of this transaction.
About RNAi
RNA interference (RNAi) is a biologic process in which certain double-stranded RNA molecules inhibit the expression of disease-causing genes by destroying the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of those genes. It reflects a new approach in the development of specific and powerful therapies. Rather than targeting and binding to proteins to inhibit their activity, RNAi exerts its effects one step earlier in the gene silencing process by targeting the mRNA, the instruction set that directs the building of the protein. By attaching to this instruction set, RNAi is believed to have the ability to attack any target, including disease-causing genes that are beyond the reach of conventional antibody and small-molecule modalities. Additionally, RNAi-based therapeutic approaches hold the potential to offer more convenience for patients via infrequent dosing and a long duration of effect.
About Dicerna’s GalXC™ RNAi Technology Platform
The proprietary RNAi technology platform called GalXC™, invented by Dicerna, aims to advance the development of next-generation RNAi-based therapies designed to silence disease-driving genes in the liver. GalXC-based therapies are processed by the Dicer enzyme, which is the natural initiation point for RNAi within the human cell. Using GalXC, Dicerna scientists attach N-acetylgalactosamine sugars directly to the extended region of the proprietary Dicer substrate short-interfering RNA (DsiRNA) molecules, yielding multiple conjugate delivery configurations that allow flexible and efficient conjugation to the targeting ligands while stabilizing the RNAi duplex. Dicerna believes this stabilization will enable subcutaneous delivery of RNAi therapies to hepatocytes in the liver, where they are designed to specifically bind to receptors on target cells, potentially leading to internalization and access to the RNAi machinery within the cells. By using the Dicer enzyme as the entry point into RNAi, the GalXC approach seeks to optimize the activity of the RNAi pathway so that it operates in the most specific and potent fashion. Compounds produced via GalXC are intended to be broadly applicable across multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases, viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases.
About Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative, subcutaneously delivered RNAi-based therapeutics for the treatment of diseases involving the liver, including rare diseases, viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Dicerna is leveraging its proprietary GalXC™ RNAi technology platform to build a broad pipeline in these core therapeutic areas, focusing on target genes where connections between target gene and diseases are well understood and documented. Dicerna intends to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapeutics either on its own or in collaboration with pharmaceutical partners. For more information, please visit www.dicerna.com.

6083,Henry Ford Health System Signs Development and Commercialization Agreement with G3 Pharma for its Galectin-3 inhibitors,G3 Pharmaceuticals Signs Exclusive License and Option Agreement for Treating Diastolic Heart Failure (HFpEF) by Inhibiting Galectin-3.,"Henry to get an exclusive option to license US patent application 14/654,140 for Galectin-3 inhibitors and will acquire minority equity in G3 Pharmaceuticals
 The focus of the agreement is to advance therapies for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) without no approved treatments
 Galectin-3 is a protein for oral use and is indicated for the treatment of diastolic heart failure also known as HFpEF","Galectin-3 inhibitors offer new hope for an important unmet medical need
BURLINGTON, – G3 Pharmaceuticals, a development-stage biopharmaceutical company located in Burlington, MA, today announced the signing of an exclusive license and option agreement with Henry Ford Health System, based in Detroit, MI, for development and commercialization of galectin-3 inhibitors for treatment of diastolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction or HFpEF.
The agreement grants G3 Pharmaceuticals the right to elect an exclusive license to US patent application 14/654,140 (allowed) and its continuations and related patents. In conjunction with this license and option regarding galectin-3 IP by G3 Pharmaceuticals Henry Ford Health System will acquire a minority equity position in G3 Pharmaceuticals.
Heart failure is a common and serious condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s nutrition and oxygen needs. Heart failure is typically classified in two forms: heart failure due to a weak heart muscle (HFrEF) or heart failure where the heart is too stiff to sufficiently relax and adequately fill with each heartbeat. This latter form is known as diastolic heart failure, or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). An estimated 3.2 million Americans over the age of 20 have HFpEF, representing approximately 50% of all heart failure. HFpEF is associated with poor quality of life, high health-care resource utilization, and high mortality. The risk of HFpEF increases sharply with age. Hypertension, obesity, and coronary artery disease are additional risk factors. There is no approved therapy for treatment of HFpEF.
“This recently allowed patent provided an important opportunity to expand our galectin-3 related IP portfolio,” said Pieter Muntendam, MD, President and CEO of G3 Pharmaceuticals. “The combination of composition of matter IP and indication or pathway-specific IP is generally desired but rarely achieved in the biopharmaceutical space.”
“HFpEF represents one of the largest unmet needs in cardiovascular medicine, with its epidemic proportions and no effective therapies,” said Bertram Pitt, MD, Professor of Medicine Emeritus at the University of Michigan School of Medicine and one of the co-founders of G3 Pharmaceuticals. “The effects of galectin-3 inhibition are the strongest ever observed at Henry Ford Health System in the heart failure animal model in over 20 years of testing numerous treatment strategies, giving us hope and optimism about this novel therapeutic option.”
“Henry Ford Health System is pleased to work with G3 Pharmaceuticals through its cardiovascular research division, directed by Dr. Hani N. Sabbah, to help to further develop this technology and make it available for patients with heart failure,” said Mark E. Coticchia, Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer of Henry Ford Health System.
About Galectin-3
Galectin-3 is an unusual protein, which was first discovered in the 1970s. It is characterized by its ability to bind to special complex carbohydrates through a site on the protein known as the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Galectin-3 is found in all species from the round worm to humans. Its role throughout evolution was to protect the animal after major injury through the formation of fibrotic sheets. In modern man, with access to medical care, massive injury is no longer left to natural healing but is typically treated surgically. However, smaller injuries, such as a heart attack, micro injuries caused by hypertension, or activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), can activate the galectin-3 fibrosis formation in the heart, kidneys, and lungs. In this way, a protective system that was vital during evolution has now become a cause of important disease. The CRD offers a path to inhibiting galectin-3 by certain complex carbohydrates. Natural and synthetic research compounds have been found to bind galectin-3 and, in doing so, neutralize its activity. G3 Pharmaceuticals is pursuing the development of novel, semi-synthetic pharmaceuticals galectin-3 inhibitors for oral use.
About G3 Pharmaceuticals
G3 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately held biopharmaceutical company located in Burlington, MA. The company was founded by thought leaders in the fields of galectin-3 biology, cardiovascular pharmaceutical development, and carbohydrate drug synthesis and manufacturing. The founders have played a material role in advancing the understanding of the role of galectin-3 in cardiovascular and renal disease, and in the exploration of pharmaceutical inhibition of galectin-3 by carbohydrate compounds. Publications related to this galectin-3 research by the founders have been cited over 2,000 times, illustrating the importance of these contributions to advancing the science that forms the foundation of G3 Pharmaceuticals.

6085,Sandoz's Hymiroz (adalimumab-adaz) Receives the US FDA Approval for Treatment of Chronic Autoimmune Diseases,Sandoz receives US FDA approval for biosimilar Hyrimoz™ (adalimumab-adaz),"The approval is based on the non-inferiority data demonstrating its biosimilarity in terms of PK, immunogenicity and safety meeting all 1Eps & results of ADACCESS study confirming its safety & efficacy with referred biologic
 Hymiroz’s (a TNFi) approval is third FDA approval for Sandoz which is indicated to treat RA, JIA in patients ≥4 yrs. of age, PsA, AS, adult CD, UC and plaque psoriasis (Ps)
 On 11 Oct, 2018 Sandoz resolved all global IPR litigations with AbbVie regarding adalimumab biosimilar and is expected for sales on 23 Sep, 2023 in the US","Holzkirchen, Germany, October 31, 2018 — Sandoz, a Novartis division and the pioneer and global leader in biosimilars, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its biosimilar, Hyrimoz™ (adalimumab-adaz). The FDA granted approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in patients four years of age and older, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and plaque psoriasis (Ps).1

 

“Biosimilars can help people suffering from chronic, debilitating conditions gain expanded access to important medicines that may change the outcome of their disease,” said Stefan Hendriks, Global Head of Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz. “With the FDA approval of Hyrimoz, Sandoz is one step closer to offering US patients with autoimmune diseases the same critical access already available in Europe.”

 

The FDA approval of Hyrimoz was based on a comprehensive data package comprising analytical, preclinical and clinical research demonstrating that Hyrimoz matches the reference biologic in terms of safety, efficacy and quality. A randomized, double-blind, three-arm, parallel biosimilarity study confirmed the pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and safety of Hyrimoz. The study met the primary endpoint, demonstrating bioequivalence for all primary pharmacokinetic parameters. A confirmatory efficacy and safety biosimilarity study (ADACCESS) demonstrated therapeutic equivalence in the sensitive indication of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis, with a similar safety and immunogenicity profile to the reference biologic.2,3,4

 

Rheumatoid arthritis is among the most common types of arthritis and affects approximately 1.3 million adults in the US.5 Psoriasis is the most prevalent autoimmune disease in the US, and according to recent studies, as many as 7.5 million Americans—approximately 2.2 percent of the population—have psoriasis.6

 

Sandoz is well-positioned to lead the biosimilars industry based on its experience and capabilities in development, manufacturing and commercialization. Hyrimoz is the company’s third approved biosimilar medicine in the US. Additional biosimilars for oncology and immunology indications are expected to launch globally across major regions by 2020.

 

About Hyrimoz™ (adalimumab) 

Adalimumab, the active ingredient in Hyrimoz, is an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein that is overproduced in certain autoimmune conditions—including rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis—causing inflammation and tissue destruction in joints, mucosa or skin. In some cases of autoimmune disease, the immune system damages the body’s own tissues. Hyrimoz targets and blocks the protein that contributes to disease symptoms.7

On October 11, 2018, Sandoz announced a global resolution of all intellectual property-related litigation with AbbVie concerning all indications of the proposed Sandoz biosimilar adalimumab for the reference medicine. The license enables patient access in the US to Hyrimoz (or Sandoz adalimumab or Sandoz biosimilar) as of September 30, 2023. As the pioneer and global leader in biosimilars, this settlement helps remove uncertainty regarding when our biosimilar will be available.

6086,Roche Reports Results of Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro in P-III CLL-14 study for CLL patients,Phase III data showed that Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro reduced the risk of disease worsening or death in people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with co-morbidities,"The P-III CLL-14 study involves assessing of Venclexta (venetoclax) + Gazyva (obinutuzumab) vs Gazyva + chlorambucil in 432 1L CLL patients
 The study included 1EP as PFS and 2EP as OR, CR, DOR, OS and demonstrated reduction in risk of disease worsening or death with no new safety signals observed. The study is conducted in collaboration with German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG)
 Venclexta/Venclyxto is a novel inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein, jointly developed & commercialized by Roche& Abbvie in the US. Gazyva/Gazyvaro is a mAb used to bind CD20 and approved in 90 countries with chlorambucil for CLL","The phase III CLL14 study compared Venclexta/Venclyxto in combination with Gazyva/Gazyvaro to standard-of-care Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil
Data will be submitted to health authorities and presented at an upcoming medical meeting
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the randomised phase III CLL14 study, which evaluated fixed-duration Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax) in combination with Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab) in people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and co-existing medical conditions, met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS; as assessed by investigator) compared to standard-of-care Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil. The results showed that no new safety signals or increase in known toxicities of Venclexta/Venclyxto or Gazyva/Gazyvaro were observed with the treatment combination.

“People with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia continue to need more treatment options because some patients are unable to tolerate chemotherapy regimens due to their underlying health,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “CLL14 is the first study to show superior progression-free survival for Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to a standard-of-care regimen. We will work with health authorities to bring this potential chemotherapy-free treatment option to people who need it as quickly as possible.”

Data from the CLL14 study will be submitted to global health authorities. Venclexta in combination with Rituxan® (rituximab) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of people with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy. Venclyxto in combination with MabThera® (rituximab) has recently been approved in Europe for people with previously treated CLL, who have received at least one prior therapy, based on results from the randomised phase III MURANO study.

A robust clinical development programme for Venclexta/Venclyxto is ongoing in several types of blood cancer, including acute myeloid leukaemia and multiple myeloma. Gazyva/Gazyvaro continues to be investigated in combination with approved and investigational Roche and non-Roche molecules in CLL and follicular lymphoma.

Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax) is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the United States and commercialised by AbbVie outside of the United States.

About the CLL14 study
CLL14 (NCT02242942) is a randomised phase III study evaluating the combination of fixed-duration Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with coexisting medical conditions. 432 patients with previously untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive either Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro (Arm A) or Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil (Arm B). The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee, best overall response, complete response, duration of response, overall survival, event-free survival, time to next CLL treatment, minimal residual disease status and safety. The CLL14 study is being conducted in cooperation with the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), headed by Michael Hallek, MD, University of Cologne.

About Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax)
Venclexta/Venclyxto is a first-in-class targeted medicine designed to selectively bind and inhibit the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other tumours, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from dying or self-destructing, a process called apoptosis. Venclexta/Venclyxto blocks the BCL – 2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.

Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the United States and by AbbVie outside of the United States. Together, the companies are committed to research with Venclexta/Venclyxto, which is currently being studied in clinical trials across several types of blood and other cancers.

In the United States, Venclexta has been granted four Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the FDA: in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL); as a monotherapy for people with relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion; in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for people with untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; and in combination with low-dose cytarabine for people with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. A supplemental New Drug Application has been submitted to the FDA for Venclexta, in combination with a hypomethylating agent or in combination with low dose cytarabine, for the treatment of people with previously untreated AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

Venclexta/Venclyxto is approved in more than 50 countries. Roche and AbbVie are currently working with regulatory agencies around the world to bring this medicine to additional eligible patients in need.

About Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab)
Gazyva/Gazyvaro is an engineered monoclonal antibody designed to bind to CD20, a protein expressed on certain B-cells (a type of white blood cell), but not on stem cells or plasma cells. Gazyva/Gazyvaro is designed to attack and destroy targeted B-cells both directly and together with the body's immune system. Gazyva is marketed as Gazyvaro in the EU and Switzerland.

Gazyva/Gazyvaro is currently approved in more than 90 countries in combination with chlorambucil for people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in more than 80 countries in combination with bendamustine for people with certain types of previously treated follicular lymphoma and in more than 70 countries in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.

Additional combination studies investigating Gazyva/Gazyvaro with other approved or investigational medicines, including cancer immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors, are underway across a range of blood cancers.

About the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG)
Founded in 1996 and headed by Dr. Michael Hallek, the GCLLSG has been running various phase III, phase II and phase I trials in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with the goal to provide optimal treatment to patients suffering from this disease. Among those were landmark trials like the CLL8 and the CLL11 trials which led to the current standard-of-care in CLL. For many years, GCLLSG has been aiming to improve not just the treatment of younger and physically fit patients, but also that of elderly and less fit patients. These patients are generally underrepresented in clinical trials although they constitute the majority of CLL patients treated by doctors in daily practice. The GCLLSG is an independent non-profit research organisation supported by the German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe). www.dcllsg.de

 P-III MURANO study results: mPFS 83%; no. of events (32 vs 114); ORR (93.3% vs 67.7%); CR/CRi (26.8% vs 8.2%); MRD-negativity in peripheral blood, bone marrow (62.5%, 15.5% vs 13.3%,1.0%)
 Venclyxto is a novel inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein, developed by Roche & AbbVie and is currently approved in 50 countries","Approval is based on randomised phase III MURANO study showing that fixed duration of treatment with Venclyxto plus MabThera is well tolerated and reduced risk of disease progression or death by 83% compared to a current standard of care
New combination provides a chemotherapy-free option for treating people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia whose disease has returned after previous treatment
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has approved Venclyxto® (venetoclax) in combination with MabThera® (rituximab) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy.

“There are approximately 30,000 people living with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in Europe, an incurable blood cancer that becomes harder to treat with each relapse,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are pleased that, thanks to this approval, Venclyxto plus MabThera will provide a new chemotherapy-free option for people with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, helping them to live longer without their disease progressing compared to a standard-of-care therapy.”

This approval is based on results from the randomised phase III MURANO study which showed that a fixed duration of treatment with Venclyxto plus MabThera significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death (progression-free survival [PFS] as assessed by investigators [INV], primary endpoint of the study) by 83% compared with bendamustine plus MabThera (BR), a current standard of care (HR=0.17; 95% CI 0.11-0.25; p<0.0001). PFS assessed by independent review committee was consistent. In addition, minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity in peripheral blood at the end of combination treatment was 62.4% with Venclyxto plus MabThera compared to 13.3% with BR. Being MRD-negative means no cancer can be detected in the blood and or bone marrow using a sensitive test. In Europe, MRD is used as an indicator of a patient achieving longer endpoints such as PFS and overall survival. The most commonly observed side effects of Venclyxto plus MabThera included low white blood cell count (neutropenia), diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infection.

Venclyxto was previously granted conditional marketing authorisation in the EU in December 2016 as a single agent for the treatment of CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in people who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor. Today’s EU approval follows the US Food and Drug Administration approval in June 2018 of Venclexta® in combination with Rituxan® for the treatment of people with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy. Additional submissions of the MURANO data to health authorities around the world are ongoing.

Venclyxto is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the United States, under the brand name Venclexta, and commercialised by AbbVie outside of the United States.

About the MURANO Study
MURANO (NCT02005471) is a phase III open-label, international, multicentre, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of fixed duration Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax) in combination with MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) compared to standard of care bendamustine in combination with MabThera/Rituxan (BR) in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Patients on the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan arm received six cycles of Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan followed by Venclexta/Venclyxto monotherapy for up to two years total. Patients on the BR arm received six cycles of BR. The study included 389 patients with CLL who had been previously treated with at least one line of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan or BR. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator (INV). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (with or without complete blood count recovery, CR/CRi), minimal residual disease (MRD) and safety.


*Data at median follow-up of 24 months

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade in patients receiving Venclyxto in the combination study with MabThera were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract infection. Death occurred in 11% of people who received Venclexta/Venclyxto plus MabThera/Rituxan compared to 16% for BR.

About Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax)
Venclexta/Venclyxto is a first-in-class targeted medicine designed to selectively bind and inhibit the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other tumours, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from dying or self-destructing, a process called apoptosis. Venclexta/Venclyxto blocks the BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.

Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the United States and by AbbVie outside of the United States. Together, the companies are committed to research with Venclexta/Venclyxto, which is currently being studied in clinical trials across several types of blood and other cancers.

In the United States, Venclexta has been granted four Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the FDA: in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL); as a monotherapy for people with relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion; in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for people with untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; and in combination with low-dose cytarabine for people with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

Venclexta/Venclyxto is approved in more than 50 countries. Roche and AbbVie are currently working with regulatory agencies around the world to bring this medicine to additional eligible patients in need.

About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in the Western world.[1]
CLL mainly affects men and the median age at diagnosis is about 70 years.[2] In Europe, the incidence of all leukaemias is estimated to be almost 95,000[3] and CLL is estimated to affect around one-third of all people newly diagnosed with leukaemia.[1]

– First medicine in the EU to treat the CFTR protein defect in patients who have one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of one of 14 mutations that result in residual CFTR activity –

LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) Limited, today announced that the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization for SYMKEVI® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) in a combination regimen with ivacaftor (KALYDECO®) for the treatment of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 and older who either have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, or one copy of the F508del mutation and a copy of one of the following 14 mutations in which the CFTR protein shows residual activity: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. In addition, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products recently recommended the maintenance of orphan designation for tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor.
“The authorization of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is welcome news for European CF patients, their families and everyone involved in their treatment and care. This new medicine is especially important for patients with residual function mutations and those who do not tolerate ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor),” said Harry Heijerman, Professor and Head of Department of Pulmonology at University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands.
The EU Marketing Authorization was based on results from two pivotal Phase 3 studies, EVOLVE and EXPAND, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2017. Results showed treatment with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor provides benefits across different CF populations, including statistically significant improvements in lung function, as determined by absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1); with a generally well tolerated safety profile and a lack of increased respiratory adverse events compared to placebo. The improvements in lung function showed a mean absolute change in ppFEV1 compared to placebo of 4.0 percentage points (P<0.0001) and 6.8 percentage points (P<0.0001) in EVOLVE and EXPAND respectively. The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients who received tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in pooled, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies were headache and nasopharyngitis.
“Today marks an important milestone for many CF patients in Europe, including those who so far have had no available option to treat the CFTR protein defect responsible for their disease,” said Reshma Kewalramani, MD, Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “With today’s Marketing Authorization, we are rapidly moving towards treating 90 percent of CF patients.”
Tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2018 and by Health Canada in June 2018. It is marketed as SYMDEKO™ in the U.S. and Canada.
About CF
Cystic fibrosis is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia.
CF is caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF. There are approximately 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene. Some of these mutations, which can be determined by a genetic test, or genotyping test, lead to CF by creating non-working or too few CFTR proteins at the cell surface. The defective function or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cell in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the build-up of abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death. The median age of death is in the mid-to-late 20s.
About tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor
Some mutations result in CFTR protein that is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and that generally does not reach the cell surface. Tezacaftor is designed to address the trafficking and processing defect of the CFTR protein to enable it to reach the cell surface where ivacaftor can increase the amount of time the protein stays open.
For complete product information, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics that can be found on www.ema.europa.eu once posted.
About EVOLVE and EXPAND
Data from the two Phase 3 studies EVOLVE and EXPAND were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2017, the studies enrolled approximately 750 people with CF ages 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation or with one F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity. Across both studies, patients treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor experienced statistically significant improvements in lung function, as determined by absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1. The treatment was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse reactions (≥10%) experienced by patients who received tezacaftor/ivacaftor with ivacaftor in the pooled, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies were headache (14% versus 12% on placebo) and nasopharyngitis (12% versus 10% on placebo).
About orphan designation for medicines
Orphan designation is granted by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products to treatments which either address an existing unmet need or can provide significant benefit for people with life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases, affecting a small number of patients.

 In 2016, AbbVie and BioArctic ($80M upfront) entered into a global collaboration to develop & commercialize BioArctic’s Alpha-Synuclein Ab Platform to treat Parkinson Disease
 BAN0805, a leading BioArctic’s Alpha-Synuclein Ab indicated for Parkinson Disease progression, while its IND is under process to onset its first clinical study in 2019","BioArctic’s partner AbbVie exercises its option to license the alpha-synuclein antibody portfolio for Parkinson’s Disease
Stockholm, Sweden – BioArctic AB (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) announced today that the company has received a Notice of Option Exercise under the Research, Development, Option and License Agreement dated as of September 15, 2016 between AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and BioArctic. The option is subject to filing and clearance under the US Antitrust legislation.
BioArctic and AbbVie, a global biopharmaceutical company, in 2016 entered into a strategically important collaboration to develop and commercialize BioArctic’s portfolio of antibodies directed against alpha-synuclein for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other potential indications.
Parkinson’s disease is the second most-common neurological disease in the world, and is expected to grow from approximately 6.2 million patients to 12.9 million by 2040.1 While mutations in alpha-synuclein gene are strongly linked to the development of Parkinson’s disease in a very small number of patients with an inherited form of the disaease, alpha synuclein accumulation in the form of toxic aggregates and intracellular deposits (Lewy Bodies) is a key neuropathological feature of the more common sporadic Parkinson’s disease.
BAN0805 is the most advanced of the BioArctic alpha-synuclein antibodies, that are being developed as a disease modifying treatment of Parkinson’s disease with a goal to potentially impact disease progression. Preparation of an IND-application is ongoing in order to start the first clinical study with BAN0805 in the US 2019.
Subject to antitrust clearance, the option to exercise the license triggers a milestone payment of MUSD 50 and the total aggregate value of the license agreement is up to MUSD 755, plus royalties. Previously MUSD 80 have been received.
“AbbVie has shown a strong commitment to Parkinson’s disease and I am proud that they have chosen to exercise the option to license BioArctic’s alpha-synuclein antibodies. I am looking forward to continuing the successful partnership with the ambition to deliver a new innovative disease modifying treatment to improve the quality of life for the large number of patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease,” said Gunilla Osswald, CEO at BioArctic.

About Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system that is associated with reduced levels of dopamine in the brain. Tremor and movement disturbances are the pathological hallmarks of the disease, but it is also characterized by dementia, depression, sleep disturbance and other symptoms. As the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease affects a large number of individuals and their families. Many who fall ill are still at working age resulting in considerable financial consequences for the individual and society. Patients with Parkinson’s disease suffer from an extensive loss of nerve cells in a part of the brain associated with movement. These nerve cells contain the so called Lewy bodies consisting of aggregated misfolded alpha-synuclein that are associated with cell loss. Alpha-synuclein aggregates can also be released from the cells and travel to neighboring cells, whereby the disease is spread from one area of the brain to another. Research has shown that mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene lead to Parkinson’s disease.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee (PDAC) and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (DSaRM) jointly voted (17 yes, 1 no) that data support the favorable benefit-risk profile of ZULRESSO™ (brexanolone) injection for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) when administered by qualified staff in a facility that has been certified under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program. The committees based their joint recommendation on the safety and efficacy data from three placebo-controlled clinical studies.
“We are pleased the FDA Advisory Committee agreed that the benefit/risk profile of ZULRESSO supports this novel approach to treating PPD, reflecting the need for an innovative treatment option that may rapidly alleviate suffering for women with PPD and their families,” said Jeff Jonas, M.D., chief executive officer of Sage. “This is another step forward in Sage’s effort to maximize patient benefit by bringing game-changing new treatments to the market.”
ZULRESSO is the first medicine under FDA review specifically for the treatment of PPD, the most common medical complication of childbirth. It is estimated that PPD affects approximately one in nine women who have given birth in the U.S. and 400,000 women annually. Symptoms of PPD may include sadness, anxiety, irritability, withdrawing from friends or family, having trouble bonding with her baby and thinking about harming herself or, more rarely, her baby.
Sage will further discuss the advisory committee’s outcome during the company’s next financial results conference call on November 6, 2018 at 8:00 AM ET. The live webcast can be accessed on the investor page of Sage’s website at investor.sagerx.com. The conference call can be accessed by dialing 1-866-450-8683 (toll-free domestic) or 1-281-542-4847 (international) and using the conference ID 1891169. A replay of the webcast will be available on Sage’s website approximately two hours after the completion of the event and will be archived for up to 30 days.
About Postpartum Depression
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a distinct and readily identified major depressive disorder that is the most common medical complication of childbirth, affecting a subset of women typically commencing in the third trimester of pregnancy or within four weeks after giving birth. PPD may have devastating consequences for a woman and for her family, which may include significant functional impairment, depressed mood and/or loss of interest in her newborn, and associated symptoms of depression such as loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, motor challenges, lack of concentration, loss of energy and poor self-esteem. Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death following childbirth. Postpartum depression is estimated to affect approximately one in nine women who have given birth in the U.S. and 400,000 women annually. More than half of these cases may go undiagnosed without proper screening. There are no FDA approved therapies specifically indicated for PPD and there is a high unmet medical need for improved pharmacological therapy in PPD.
About ZULRESSOTM (brexanolone) Injection
Brexanolone is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Allosteric modulation of neurotransmitter receptor activity results in varying degrees of desired activity rather than complete activation or inhibition of the receptor. ZULRESSOTM (brexanolone) injection has completed Phase 3 clinical development for postpartum depression and a New Drug Application is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ZULRESSO for the treatment of PPD has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The FDA has conditionally accepted the proprietary name ZULRESSO for Sage’s intravenous formulation of brexanolone.
About Sage Therapeutics
Sage Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel medicines to transform the lives of patients with life-altering CNS disorders. Sage’s lead product candidate, ZULRESSOTM (brexanolone) injection, has completed Phase 3 clinical development for postpartum depression and a New Drug Application is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Forward-Looking Statements
Various statements in this release concern Sage’s future expectations, plans and prospects, including without limitation statements regarding: our expectations regarding the possible approval of our NDA filing for ZULRESSO™ (brexanolone) injection; the potential for ZULRESSO to be the first medication specifically indicated for PPD; the potential impact of ZULRESSO as a treatment option for PPD, if approved; our estimates of the prevalence of PPD; and other statements regarding our business and portfolio. These forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees of future performance, and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements, including the risks that: the FDA may not agree with the recommendations of the joint Advisory Committee, and, despite the recommendation, may determine that the clinical and non-clinical data we have generated to date are insufficient to gain regulatory approval to launch and commercialize our product in PPD or may determine that additional trials or data are necessary in order to obtain approval; the FDA may not complete its review of our filing within the target timelines; the actual size of the PPD patient population may be significantly lower than our estimates and, even if ZULRESSO is successfully approved for PPD, it may only be used to treat a subset of the PPD population, particularly given the intravenous (IV) mode of administration, limitations on site of administration to a certified healthcare facility monitored by a qualified healthcare provider, and the necessity for a REMS; we may encounter unexpected safety, tolerability or other issues with ZULRESSO in ongoing clinical trials or in commercial use, if approved; we may not be able to successfully demonstrate the efficacy and safety of any of our other product candidates at each stage of development; success of any of our product candidates in early stage clinical trials may not be repeated or observed in ongoing or future studies of our product candidates; ongoing and future clinical results may not support further development or be sufficient to gain regulatory approval to market our product candidates; and we may encounter technical and other unexpected hurdles in the development and manufacture of our product candidates; as well as those risks more fully discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and discussions of potential risks, uncertainties, and other important factors in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We explicitly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Nov. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced the presentation of 10 scientific research abstracts, including the final report of the OSLER-1 study, evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Repatha® (evolocumab) in patients with hypercholesterolemia for up to five years. Additional abstracts to be presented include a sub-analysis of the Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER), investigating the effects of triglycerides on cardiovascular risk in patients with established cardiovascular disease, and an evaluation of the utilization of lipid-lowering therapies in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events in a real-world setting. These analyses will be presented at the upcoming American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2018 in Chicago, Nov. 10-12, and follow the Company's recent announcement that Repatha is now available in the U.S. at a 60 percent reduced list price.

""Despite recent advances in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke, many patients with cardiovascular disease do not meet, and may not even be aware of, their recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals, putting them at increased risk for cardiovascular events,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""The data that will be presented at AHA contributes to the growing body of compelling clinical evidence on the role for Repatha among high-risk patients for whom statins and other traditional therapies are not enough. Our recent announcement to make Repatha available at a reduced list price should address concerns over out-of-pocket costs, which have been a barrier to its use and help make sure that every patient who needs Repatha gets it.""

The OSLER-1 study data to be presented at AHA 18 forms part of the PROFICIO (Program to Reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular Outcomes Following Inhibition of PCSK9 In different pOpulations) scientific research program. PROFICIO is evaluating Repatha in 32 clinical trials to date, with a combined enrollment of approximately 37,800 patients.1 

In addition to Amgen's commitment to advancing the science of the management of LDL-C and cardiovascular risk, the Company is equally committed to ensuring patients who need Repatha can get it. Amgen recently made the innovative biologic available at a list price of $5,850 per year, a 60 percent reduction, to improve affordability for patients, especially for Medicare patients. To ensure patients benefit from this lower list price, all stakeholders must be engaged – from healthcare professionals to payers to plans and to government agencies. Any patients or physicians who need help understanding how recent changes impact them or their patients can contact our team at RepathaReady® (1-844-REPATHA).

OSLER-1 Study Design
Open Label Study of Long Term Evaluation Against LDL-C 1 (OSLER-1) is an open-label extension study with Repatha, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor. The study is being conducted across 192 sites in 18 countries.

Patients were eligible for participation in OSLER-1 provided that they did not discontinue treatment due to a treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) during their qualifying Phase 2 study or require unblinded lipid measurements and/or adjustment of background lipid therapy during the first 12 weeks of OSLER-1. During the first year, patients were randomized 2:1 to Repatha 420 mg monthly in addition to standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone. After year one, all patients continuing in the study received Repatha 420 mg monthly in addition to SOC for the remaining 4 years of the study. Lipid parameters, safety and tolerability were assessed every 12 weeks.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha. The secondary objective is to evaluate LDL-C reductions with Repatha over an extended period of time.

Repatha Cardiovascular Outcomes (FOURIER) Study Design
FOURIER (Further cardiovascular OUtcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk), a multinational Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, is designed to evaluate whether treatment with Repatha in combination with statin therapy compared to placebo plus statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events. The primary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke. 

Eligible patients with high cholesterol (LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] ≥100 mg/dL) and clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at more than 1,300 study locations around the world were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly plus effective statin dose; or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly plus effective statin dose. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. The study was event-driven and continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary endpoint.

About Repatha® (evolocumab)
Repatha is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.2

Repatha is approved in more than 60 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.

Important U.S. Product Information
Repatha is a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) inhibitor antibody indicated:

to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular disease.
as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe), for treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C.
The safety and effectiveness of Repatha have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old or in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.

Important U.S. Safety Information

Contraindication: Repatha is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema have occurred in patients treated with Repatha.

Allergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. angioedema, rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.

Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of patients treated with Repatha and occurring more frequently than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions. 

From a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials: Local injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising.

Allergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).

The most common adverse reactions in the Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (>5% of patients treated with Repatha and occurring more frequently than placebo) were: diabetes mellitus (8.8% Repatha, 8.2% placebo), nasopharyngitis (7.8% Repatha, 7.4% placebo), and upper respiratory tract infection (5.1% Repatha, 4.8% placebo). 

Among the 16,676 patients without diabetes mellitus at baseline, the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus during the trial was 8.1% in patients assigned to Repatha compared with 7.7% in those assigned to placebo. 

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): The adverse reactions that occurred in at least two patients treated with Repatha and more frequently than placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, gastroenteritis, and nasopharyngitis.

Immunogenicity: Repatha is a human monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Repatha.

Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. and OLDWICK, N.J., — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Provention Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:PRVB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on immune-mediated diseases, today announced a licensing and co-development agreement for AMG 714, identified by Provention as PRV-015. AMG 714 is a novel anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of gluten-free diet non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD). Development efforts at Provention will be led by researchers with previous experience developing AMG 714.
Under the terms of the agreement, Provention will conduct and fund a Phase 2b trial in NRCD and lead the next phase of development and regulatory activities for the program. Amgen will make a $20 million investment coincident with Provention’s next financing event, subject to certain terms and conditions. Amgen is also responsible for the manufacturing of AMG 714. Upon completion of the Phase 2b trial, Provention will be eligible to receive a $150 million milestone payment, as well as additional regulatory milestone payments and royalties if Amgen continues AMG 714 development.
“Celiac disease impacts millions of people around the world and remains the only common autoimmune disease with no approved therapeutic treatment,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “We are pleased to collaborate with Provention, given their expertise and familiarity with AMG 714, in advancing a potential new treatment option for patients living with this life-interrupting illness.”
“Our AMG 714 co-development collaboration with Amgen is a significant milestone in the growth and advancement of Provention. AMG 714 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved treatment for celiac disease and aligns with Provention’s mission to prevent and intercept immune-mediated disease,” said Ashleigh Palmer, co-founder and chief executive officer of Provention.
“Data presented at Digestive Disease Week 2018 from two Phase 2a clinical trials of AMG 714 demonstrated the drug’s potential in celiac disease and refractory celiac disease type II (RCD-II), an in situ gastrointestinal T cell lymphoma, and confirmed that IL-15 plays a central role in non-responsive celiac disease and RCD-II,” said Francisco Leon, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder and chief scientific officer of Provention. “We are delighted to be collaborating with Amgen to advance AMG 714 by way of the planned Phase 2b NRCD study.”
About AMG 714
AMG 714 (PRV-015) is a human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-15. AMG 714 was initially developed by Amgen in rheumatoid arthritis and later investigated for possible use in celiac disease. In 2015, Amgen outlicensed AMG 714 to Celimmune LLC, a clinical development-stage immunotherapy company founded by Ashleigh Palmer and Francisco Leon, M.D., Ph.D. Celimmune conducted two separate AMG 714 Phase 2a clinical trials in celiac disease and refractory celiac disease type II, after which Amgen acquired Celimmune in 2017. Data from both clinical trials were presented at Digestive Disease Week 2018.
About Celiac Disease
Celiac disease is a chronic hereditary systemic autoimmune and inflammatory disease triggered by gluten consumption that results in damage to the lining of the small intestine, causing gastrointestinal dysfunction and debilitating symptoms. Nutritional malabsorption can lead to a failure to thrive in children, and anemia and osteopenia in children and adults. Over the course of a lifetime, untreated or poorly managed celiac disease is often associated with deteriorating general health, multiple serious intestinal and extra-intestinal medical complications, and increased morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that currently one percent of Western and .5 percent of Asian populations suffer from celiac disease and diagnosed prevalence is expected to increase with improved diagnostic tools and clinical awareness. There are no approved medications for celiac disease.

New data support ongoing broad clinical program for LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA combination across multiple tumor types 

Tokyo and Kenilworth, N.J., – Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A. (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced results from presentations of new data and analyses of LENVIMA® (lenvatinib), an orally available kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, in combination with Merck’s & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A.’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in three different tumor types – metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Abstract #11147), metastatic melanoma (Abstract #11187) and metastatic urothelial carcinoma (Abstract #11201).
These data from the Study 111/KEYNOTE-146 Phase 1b/2 trial will be presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in Washington, D.C. from November 9-11. In the interim analyses of the studies across three tumor types, the LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA combination demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity and was generally well tolerated. These data support further evaluation of the combination. LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA are not approved for use in combination in any cancer types today.
“We are increasingly confident that these interim analyses of new clinical trial data on the combination of LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and urothelial cancer continue to verify the potential of this combination,” said Dr. Takashi Owa, Vice President and Chief Medicine Creation Officer, Oncology Business Group at Eisai. “Through our collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A., we are doing our utmost to be able to provide this combination to patients in need of new treatment options as soon as possible.”
“These early promising data being presented support the clinical strategy behind our study of KEYTRUDA in combination with LENVIMA across a range of different cancers,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, Vice President, Oncology Clinical Research, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A. Research Laboratories. “We look forward to continuing our broad clinical research effort in collaboration with Eisai to evaluate these two therapies in combination, with the goal of improving treatment outcomes for people living with cancer.”
 
Trial Design and New Data for Study 111/KEYNOTE-146
Study 111/KEYNOTE-146 is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm, Phase 1b/2 basket trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02501096) evaluating the combination of LENVIMA (20 mg/day) with KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously every three weeks) in patients with selected solid tumors (metastatic endometrial cancer, metastatic head and neck cancer, metastatic melanoma, metastatic NSCLC, metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic urothelial carcinoma). Patients were not preselected based on PD-L1 tumor expression status. The primary endpoint of the Phase 1b study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA in combination. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 portion is investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) at week 24 based on immune-related RECIST (irRECIST). The secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR, progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) for patients with complete or partial responses. Data from Study 111/KEYNOTE-146 are being presented at SITC’s 33rd Annual Meeting from the metastatic NSCLC, metastatic melanoma and metastatic urothelial carcinoma cohorts.
 
Phase 1b/2 trial of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC (Abstract #11147/Poster #P392)
As of data cutoff on March 1, 2018, 21 patients with metastatic NSCLC who either had no prior therapy or had received up to two prior lines of therapy were enrolled in this Phase 2 cohort. The primary endpoint of ORR at week 24 per irRECIST was 33.3% (95% CI: 14.6-57.0). For secondary endpoints, median PFS per irRECIST was 5.9 months (95% CI: 2.3-13.8), and the PFS rate at 12 months per irRECIST was 29.0% (95% CI: 10.2-51.0). Median DOR was 10.9 months (95% CI: 2.4-not estimable). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 10 patients (48%), and Grade 4 TRAEs occurred in one patient (5%). The most common TRAEs (any grade) ≥30% were decreased appetite (67%), fatigue (62%), hypothyroidism (43%), diarrhea (43%), proteinuria (43%), arthralgia (33%) and hypertension (33%). There was one treatment-related death. The combination of LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA was generally well tolerated and demonstrated promising clinical activity regardless of PD-L1 status, supporting further evaluation of the combination in patients with metastatic NSCLC.
Phase 1b/2 trial of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma (Abstract #11187/Poster #P391)
As of March 1, 2018, 21 patients with metastatic melanoma who either had no prior therapy or had received up to two prior lines of therapy were enrolled in this cohort. The primary endpoint of ORR at week 24 per irRECIST was 47.6% (95% CI: 25.7-70.2). For secondary endpoints, median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.6-15.8), and the PFS rate at 12 months was 34.7% (95% CI: 14.5-56.0). In addition, median DOR was 12.5 months (95% CI: 2.7-not estimable). All patients experienced at least one TRAE. Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs occurred in 14 patients (67%). The most common TRAEs (any grade) ≥30% were fatigue (52%), decreased appetite (48%), diarrhea (48%), hypertension (48%), dysphonia (43%), nausea (43%), arthralgia (33%) and proteinuria (33%). There were no treatment-related deaths. The LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA combination regimen was generally well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging clinical activity. These data support further evaluation of this regimen in patients with metastatic melanoma.

About LENVIMA® (lenvatinib mesylate)

Discovered and developed in house by Eisai, LENVIMA is an orally administered kinase inhibitor with a novel binding mode that selectively inhibits the multi activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4) in addition to other pathway-related RTKs (including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFRα; KIT; and RET) involved in tumor angiogenesis, tumor progression and modification of tumor immunity.

Currently, Eisai has obtained approval for LENVIMA as a treatment for refractory thyroid cancer in over 50 countries, including the United States, Japan, in Europe and Asia. Additionally, Eisai has obtained approval for the agent in combination with everolimus as a second-line treatment for renal cell carcinoma in over 45 countries, including the United States and in Europe. In Europe, the agent was launched under the brand name Kisplyx® for renal cell carcinoma.

In addition, LENVIMA has been approved as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan, the United States, Europe, China and other countries. Furthermore, Eisai has submitted applications for an indication covering hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan (December 2017) as well as in other countries.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

About the Eisai and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A. Strategic Collaboration

In March 2018, Eisai and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A., known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, through an affiliate, entered into a strategic collaboration for the worldwide co-development and co-commercialization of LENVIMA. Under the agreement, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize LENVIMA, both as monotherapy and in combination with Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A.’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA. In addition to ongoing clinical studies of the combination, the companies will jointly initiate new clinical studies evaluating the LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA combination to support 11 potential indications in six types of cancer (bladder cancer, endometrial cancer, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer), as well as a basket trial targeting six additional cancer types. The LENVIMA and KEYTRUDA combination is not approved in any cancer types today.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.,/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced the final report of the Open-Label Study of Long-TERm Evaluation Against LDL-C (OSLER-1), demonstrating long-term treatment with Repatha® (evolocumab) was associated with robust and consistent reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), with no increase in overall rates of adverse events over time and no neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, data from the Getting to an ImprOved Understanding of Low-Density Lipoprotein and Dyslipidemia Management (GOULD) Registry reflect a disconnect between physician perception of lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) and their actual use, and highlight both a need for improved patient awareness of the goals of LLT and a need to address barriers to use of medications like Repatha.
In an effort to help more patients bring down the risk of heart attack and stroke, Amgen recently made Repatha available in the United States (U.S.) at a 60 percent reduced list price to address concerns over high out-of-pocket costs for patients. The results of all analyses were presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2018 in Chicago.
OSLER-1 is a five-year, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Repatha in hypercholesterolemia patients, including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, on background statin therapy and patients with statin intolerance who were previously enrolled in one of five double-blind Repatha trials (N=1,324).1-6 Patients treated with Repatha achieved a 59 percent reduction in mean LDL-C from baseline during the first year of treatment (n=785). With Repatha, the mean LDL-C reductions at years two, three, four and five were: 56 percent (n=1,071), 57 percent (n=1,001), 56 percent (n=943) and 56 percent (n=803), respectively. Adverse events (AE) were reported in 80 percent, 74 percent, 71 percent, 67 percent, and 65 percent of patients, respectively; serious AEs were reported in seven percent, seven percent, eight percent, seven percent, and seven percent of patients each year (years one through five, respectively).
“Amgen is pleased to present the results of OSLER-1, the longest study of a PCSK9 inhibitor to date, which clearly demonstrate the durable, long-term efficacy and safety of Repatha in reducing LDL-C levels,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “These findings are consistent with those observed in the Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) and other Phase 3 trials, reinforcing Repatha’s role in the treatment of high-risk patients who are unable to achieve sufficient LDL-C reduction through other means.”
Analyses of data from GOULD, a multicenter, observational registry of people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) designed to describe LDL-C treatment patterns in the U.S. over time (N= 5,006), demonstrated the underutilization of effective LLTs among patients at high-risk for cardiovascular events, in those with LDL-C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL. A survey of 110 physicians identified a disconnect between physicians’ perceptions of LLTs and their actual use, with support for high-intensity statins and PCSK9 inhibition use at 75 percent among physicians and actual observed use of 50 percent and 10 percent, respectively. While many physicians had prescribed a PCSK9 inhibitor, those who had not, cited cost and hassle associated with prior authorization requirements from payers as important reasons for not prescribing.
Furthermore, among patients receiving any LLT, more than 70 percent did not know the main goal of this treatment was prevention of cardiovascular events and nearly half were unaware of their total lipid levels. GOULD data also demonstrated that, regardless of LLT type, a large proportion of patients remain unaware of their ASCVD risk, LDL-C levels, or therapy goals. This highlights an educational gap, which if addressed, may impact shared healthcare decision making and treatment adherence.
“Despite decades of research that has demonstrated the clear connection between lowering LDL-C levels and reducing the risk for cardiovascular events, several challenges, including cost and low awareness of this critical link have negatively impacted the use of PCSK9 inhibitors,” said Murdo Gordon, executive vice president Global Commercial Operations at Amgen. “As demonstrated by our recent decision to make Repatha available in the U.S. at a 60 percent reduced list price, Amgen remains steadfast in its commitment to improving affordability for patients and supporting educational initiatives with the goal of advancing the effective management of LDL-C in high-risk patients to reduce cardiovascular risk.”
OSLER-1 is part of Amgen’s Program to Reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular Outcomes Following Inhibition of PCSK9 In different pOpulations (PROFICIO). PROFICIO is a large and comprehensive scientific research program evaluating Repatha in 32 clinical trials to date, with a combined enrollment of approximately 38,700 patients.7
OSLER-1 Study Design
Open Label Study of Long-TERm Evaluation Against LDL-C 1 (OSLER-1) is an open-label extension study with Repatha, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor. The study was conducted across 192 sites in 18 countries.
Patients were eligible for participation in OSLER-1 provided that they did not discontinue treatment due to a treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) during their qualifying Phase 2 study or require unblinded lipid measurements and/or adjustment of background lipid therapy during the first 12 weeks of OSLER-1. During the first year, patients were randomized 2:1 to Repatha 420 mg monthly in addition to standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone. After year one, all patients continuing in the study received Repatha 420 mg monthly in addition to SOC for the remaining 4 years of the study. Lipid parameters, safety and tolerability were assessed every 12 weeks.
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha. The secondary objective is to evaluate LDL-C reductions with Repatha over an extended period of time.
GOULD Study Design
Getting to an ImprOved Understanding of Low-Density Lipoprotein and Dyslipidemia Management (GOULD) Registry is a multicenter, observational registry of ASCVD patients, to describe LDL-C treatment patterns in the United States and track them over time. This registry and subsequent analysis sought to better understand the adaptability of lipid management guidelines for patients with ASCVD.
From December 2016 to April 2018, interactive phone surveys with the lead physicians from each of the 120 U.S. centers participating in the registry (1 physician from each center) and patients (N=5,006) were conducted. Patients with ASCVD receiving any pharmacological LLT were eligible for enrollment in 1 of 3 cohorts: 1) currently receiving a PCSK9i antibody, 2) no PCSK9i and LDL-C 70-99 mg/dL, and 3) no PCSK9i and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL. Patients underwent a 1-year retrospective chart review, followed by chart reviews and interviews every 6 months for 2 years.
About Repatha® (evolocumab)
Repatha is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.8
Repatha is approved in more than 60 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.
Important U.S. Product Information
Repatha is a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) inhibitor antibody indicated:
to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular disease.
as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe), for treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDLC.
The safety and effectiveness of Repatha have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old or in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.

6099,Novartis' Gilenya (fingolimod) Receives EU's Approval for Relapsing-Remitting Forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS),"Novartis announces EU approval of Gilenya for children and adolescents with MS, making it the first and only oral disease-modifying treatment for these patients in Europe","The approval is based on the results of P-III PARADIGMS study assessing Gilenya (0.5mg/ 0.25mg, qd) vs Extavia (interferon beta-1a, qw) in 215 patients with MS aged 10 to <18 yrs, across 80 centers and 25 countries
 P-III PARADIGMS study Results: annualized relapse rates by 82%; relapse-free @ 24 months (85.7% vs 38.8%); reduction of disability progression 77%; reduction in no. of T2 lesions 53%; annualized rate of brain volume loss 40%
 Gilenya is a S1P modulator, approved to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and is available in the US, EU including Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein","Approval based on landmark PARADIGMS study showing Gilenya (fingolimod) significantly reduced relapse rates by 82% vs interferon beta-1a; additionally, 85.7% of Gilenya patients were relapse-free at two years[1]
Young people with MS often experience more frequent and severe relapses than adults, which affects their development and ability to participate in daily life[2]
Gilenya, a leading oral MS therapy for adults, now also addresses the critical need for an effective and safe therapy approved for young people living with MS
The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here:

Basel, Novartis today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Gilenya® (fingolimod) for the treatment of children and adolescents 10 to 17 years old with relapsing-remitting forms of multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The European market authorization makes Gilenya the first and only oral disease-modifying treatment for children and adolescents based on clinical Phase III data. This young population living with MS have a critical need for an effective treatment option, as they experience two-to-three times as many relapses as adults, often leading to a more severe prognosis and earlier irreversible disability compared to adult-onset MS[2].
“We are excited by the news that there is now a new approved treatment indicated for young people with RRMS in Europe – hopefully this will be the first step to having more therapy options for children and adolescents with MS,” said Pedro Carrascal, President, European Multiple Sclerosis Platform. “Young patients affected by MS often experience a more severe impact during their overall lifetime. Today’s approval provides an opportunity for a brighter future for them and their families.”
“Early onset MS can have a devastating impact on children and adolescents’ daily life, such as going to school and spending time with friends and family,” said Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Our mission is to change the course of MS as we’ve been doing since the treatment’s initial approval in 2011, and we won’t stop until we stop MS. We are delighted that today’s decision has brought us one step closer to reimagining the treatment of MS, across all ages.”
The EC’s approval is based on the PARADIGMS trial, a landmark Phase III clinical study in MS, specifically designed for children and adolescents 10 to 17 years old[1]. Results from the double-blind, randomized, multi-center study of Gilenya vs. interferon beta-1a show that Gilenya significantly reduced the annualized relapse rates by 82% (compared to interferon beta-1a, p<0.001) and 85.7% of patients treated with Gilenya were relapse-free at up to 24 months, versus 38.8% of patients treated with interferon beta-1a (p<0.001)[1]. Patients treated with Gilenya also showed a 77% risk reduction of disability progression relative to patients treated with interferon beta-1a[1]. Furthermore, it also significantly reduced the number of new or newly enlarged T2 lesions up to 24 months by 53% (compared to interferon beta-1a, p<0.001) and the annualized rate of brain volume loss (brain shrinkage) by 40% (compared to interferon beta-1a, p=0.014)[1]. The full PARADIGMS data were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in September 2018.
The EC decision is applicable to all 28 European Union member states plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Gilenya was initially approved for adults aged 18 years and older with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in the US and Europe. Gilenya received FDA approval for the treatment of children and adolescents 10 years of age and older with MS on May 11, 2018.
About the Phase III PARADIGMS Study
The Phase III PARADIGMS study (NCT01892722) is a flexible duration (up to two years), double-blind, randomized, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral Gilenya compared to injectable interferon beta-1a in children and adolescents with a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), followed by a five-year open label extension phase[1]. The study enrolled 215 children and adolescents with MS, from 10 to less than 18 years of age with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.5[1]. Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral Gilenya (0.5 mg or 0.25 mg, dependent on patients’ body weight) or intramuscular interferon beta-1a once weekly[1].
The primary endpoint of the study was the frequency of relapses in patients treated up to 24 months (annualized relapse rate)[1]. Secondary endpoints include the number of new or newly enlarged T2 lesions, Gadolinium enhancing T1 lesions, safety and the pharmacokinetic properties of Gilenya, all measured throughout the treatment period[1].
The PARADIGMS study enrolled 215 patients at 80 centers in 25 countries and was designed in agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency and the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group.
About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss[3]. In adults, there are three main types of MS: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS)[4]. Approximately 85% of people with MS have relapsing-remitting MS, where the immune system attacks healthy tissue[5]. In children, RRMS account for nearly all cases (approximately 98%)[6].
About Novartis in Multiple Sclerosis
The Novartis multiple sclerosis portfolio includes Gilenya® (fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is indicated for relapsing forms of MS. In the United States, Gilenya is the first disease-modifying therapy approved for the treatment of children and adolescents 10 to less than 18 years of age with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS).
Investigational compounds include siponimod (BAF312). Siponimod is an investigational, selective modulator of specific subtypes of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor, and has the potential to delay progression and expand possibilities for patients with typical SPMS. Novartis initiated the submission of siponimod for US approval in SPMS in the first half of 2018, which was followed by filing with the EMA in September 2018 for EU approval. The file has been accepted by both agencies.
Our other investigational compound is subcutaneously administered ofatumumab (OMB157), a fully human monoclonal antibody in development for relapsing MS. Ofatumumab targets CD20, and is currently being investigated in two Phase III pivotal studies.
Extavia® (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the US for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. In Europe, Extavia is approved to treat people with relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS.
In the US, the Sandoz Division of Novartis markets Glatopa® (glatiramer acetate injection) 20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL, generic versions of Teva’s Copaxone®.

6156,Janssen (J&amp;J) Reports Results of Erleada (apalutamide) in P-III TITAN Study for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mCSPC) #ASCO2019,Janssen Announces ERLEADA (apalutamide) Phase 3 TITAN Study Unblinded as Dual Primary Endpoints Achieved in Clinical Program Evaluating Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer,"The P-III TITAN study involves assessing of Erleada + Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) vs PBO + ADT in 1050 patients in ratio 1:1 with mCSPC across 23 countries
 The P-III study results: @22.7 mos. OS (82% vs 74%); PSA (68% vs 29%); 52% reduction in risk of radiographic progression; 61% reduction in time to cytotoxic CT; 34% reduction in PFS2
 Erleada (apalutamide) is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor and has received FDA approval for patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) on 14 Feb,2018. The results of P-III TITAN study will accelerate the approval of Erleada for mCSPC","Phase 3 Study Unblinded Following Recommendation of Independent Data Monitoring Committee SPRING HOUSE, PA, The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today the unblinding of the Phase 3 TITAN study evaluating ERLEADA (apalutamide) plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). The decision resulted from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommendation coinciding with a pre-planned analysis that showed the dual primary endpoints were both achieved, significantly improving radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Based on these results, the IDMC recommended that patients in the placebo plus ADT group be given the opportunity to cross over to treatment with ERLEADA plus ADT. Patients will continue to be followed for OS and long-term safety as part of the TITAN study.
“The TITAN study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ERLEADA in combination with androgen deprivation therapy in patients with newly-diagnosed metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer, regardless of the extent of their disease,” said Margaret Yu, M.D., Vice President, Oncology Clinical Development, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We look to continue to build upon our understanding of ERLEADA for patients with metastatic prostate cancer as there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.” Results from the TITAN study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical congress. Applications seeking regulatory approval of ERLEADA supported by data from the Phase 3 TITAN study are planned for 2019. About Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Metastatic prostate cancer is cancer that has spread to another part of the body.1 Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), refers to prostate cancer that still responds to ADT.1 Patients with newly-diagnosed metastatic disease tend to have a poorer prognosis, resulting in a need for new treatment options.2,3 About the TITAN Study TITAN is a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in men who were
newly diagnosed with metastatic disease, regardless of prognostic risk, volume of diseaes ERLEADA (apalutamide) is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). It became the first treatment to receive FDA approval for this disease state on February 14, 2018.5 The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Prostate Cancer include apalutamide as a treatment option for patients with non-metastatic (M0) CRPC with a category 1 recommendation (especially for those with a PSA doubling time ≤10 months)*.6 Additionally, the American Urological Association (AUA) Guidelines for
Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) were updated to include apalutamide (ERLEADA) with continued ADT as a treatment option that clinicians should offer to patients with asymptomatic nmCRPC. It is included as one of the options clinicians should offer to
patients with nmCRPC who are at high-risk for developing metastatic disease (Standard; Evidence Level Grade A)**.7 *Referenced with permission from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Prostate Cancer V.4.2018. © National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Inc. 2018.

ERLEADA IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION5 CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy — ERLEADA (apalutamide) can cause fetal harm and potential loss of
pregnancy.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Falls and Fractures — In a randomized study (SPARTAN), falls and fractures occurred in
16% and 12% of patients treated with ERLEADA compared to 9% and 7% treated with
placebo, respectively. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure.
Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for
fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone targeted
agents.
Seizure — In a randomized study (SPARTAN), 2 patients (0.2%) treated with ERLEADA
experienced a seizure. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA in patients who develop a
seizure during treatment. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent
seizures with ERLEADA. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while receiving
ERLEADA and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause
harm to themselves or others.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse Reactions — The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were fatigue,
hypertension, rash, diarrhea, nausea, weight decreased, arthralgia, fall, hot flush,
decreased appetite, fracture, and peripheral edema.
Laboratory Abnormalities — All Grades (Grade 3-4)
• Hematology — anemia ERLEADA® 70% (0.4%), placebo 64% (0.5%);
leukopenia ERLEADA 47% (0.3%), placebo 29% (0%); lymphopenia ERLEADA
41% (2%), placebo 21% (2%)
• Chemistry — hypercholesterolemia ERLEADA 76% (0.1%), placebo 46% (0%);
hyperglycemia ERLEADA® 70% (2%), placebo 59% (1%); hypertriglyceridemia
ERLEADA® 67% (2%), placebo 49% (0.8%); hyperkalemia ERLEADA 32% (2%),
placebo 22% (0.5%)
Rash — Rash was most commonly described as macular or maculo-papular. Adverse
reactions were 24% with ERLEADA® versus 6% with placebo. Grade 3 rashes (defined as
covering > 30% body surface area [BSA]) were reported with ERLEADA treatment (5%)
versus placebo (0.3%).
The onset of rash occurred at a median of 82 days. Rash resolved in 81% of patients within
a median of 60 days (range: 2 to 709 days) from onset of rash. Four percent of patients
treated with ERLEADA® received systemic corticosteroids. Rash recurred in approximately
half of patients who were re-challenged with ERLEADA.
Hypothyroidism was reported for 8% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 2% of
patients treated with placebo based on assessments of thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH) every 4 months. Elevated TSH occurred in 25% of patients treated with ERLEADA
and 7% of patients treated with placebo. The median onset was day 113. There were no
Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions. Thyroid replacement therapy, when clinically indicated,
should be initiated or dose-adjusted.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Effect of Other Drugs on ERLEADA — Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 or CYP3A4
inhibitor is predicted to increase the steady-state exposure of the active moieties. No initial
dose adjustment is necessary; however, reduce the ERLEADA dose based on tolerability
[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Effect of ERLEADA on Other Drugs — ERLEADA is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and
CYP2C19, and a weak inducer of CYP2C9 in humans. Concomitant use of ERLEADA® with
medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 can result in
lower exposure to these medications. Substitution for these medications is recommended
when possible or evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued. Concomitant
administration of ERLEADA with medications that are substrates of UDP-glucuronosyl
transferase (UGT) can result in decreased exposure. Use caution if substrates of UGT must
be co-administered with ERLEADA and evaluate for loss of activity.
P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 substrates — Apalutamide is a weak inducer of P-glycoprotein
(P- gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and organic anion transporting
polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) clinically. Concomitant use of ERLEADA with medications that
are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1 can result in lower exposure of these
medications. Use caution if substrates of P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 must be co-administered
with ERLEADA and evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued.

6157,Merck's V114 Receives FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Prevent Invasive Pneumococcal Disease,"Merck Receives Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA for V114, the Company’s Investigational 15-Valent Conjugate Vaccine for the Prevention of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease, in Infants, Children, and Adolescents","The BT designation is based on P-I/II and P-II results assessing four lots of V114 in healthy adults and infants, demonstrating non-inferiority data in patients
 FDA’s BT designation is granted to the drugs showing clinical improvement over a currently available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint with benefits of Priority Review and Accelerated Approval
 V114 is a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine targeted for two disease-causing serotypes (22F and 33F), evaluated in P-III for the prevention of IPD in adults","KENILWORTH, N.J.–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced that V114, the company’s investigational 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the vaccine serotypes in pediatric patients 6 weeks to 18 years of age. V114 is also under development for the prevention of IPD in adults. Both indications are currently being studied in Phase 3 clinical trials.
The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is an FDA program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs intended for serious or life-threatening conditions. To qualify for this designation, preliminary clinical evidence must demonstrate that the drug may provide substantial improvement over currently available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint. The benefits of this Breakthrough Therapy Designation include more intensive guidance from FDA on an efficient drug development program, access to a scientific liaison to help accelerate review time and eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review if relevant criteria are met.
The FDA’s decision was informed in part by immunogenicity data from two studies. Study 005 was a Phase 1/2, multicentre, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity profiles of 4 different lots of a new formulation of V114 in healthy adults and infants. Study 008 was a proof of concept, Phase 2, pediatric trial to confirm the results from Study 005 in a larger population of infants. In both studies, V114 induced an immune response in infants for two disease-causing serotypes (22F and 33F) not contained in the currently available 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, while demonstrating non-inferiority for the serotypes contained in both vaccines.
“We are pleased with the data on V114 compiled to date, and we look forward to working closely with the FDA on the subsequent development of this investigational vaccine,” said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, senior vice president and head of vaccine and infectious diseases clinical research at Merck Research Laboratories. “The goal of our program in pediatric patients remains focused on providing additional serotype coverage versus currently available vaccines, while at the same time maintaining a strong immune response across all serotypes in the vaccine.”

In a scientific first, Columbia neuroengineers have created a system that translates thought into intelligible, recognizable speech. By monitoring someone’s brain activity, the technology can reconstruct the words a person hears with unprecedented clarity. This breakthrough, which harnesses the power of speech synthesizers and artificial intelligence, could lead to new ways for computers to communicate directly with the brain. It also lays the groundwork for helping people who cannot speak, such as those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or recovering from stroke, regain their ability to communicate with the outside world.

These findings were published today in Scientific Reports.

“Our voices help connect us to our friends, family and the world around us, which is why losing the power of one’s voice due to injury or disease is so devastating,” said Nima Mesgarani, PhD, the paper’s senior author and a principal investigator at Columbia University’s Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. “With today’s study, we have a potential way to restore that power. We’ve shown that, with the right technology, these people’s thoughts could be decoded and understood by any listener.”

This would be a game changer. It would give anyone who has lost their ability to speak, whether through injury or disease, the renewed chance to connect to the world around them.

Decades of research has shown that when people speak — or even imagine speaking — telltale patterns of activity appear in their brain. Distinct (but recognizable) pattern of signals also emerge when we listen to someone speak, or imagine listening. Experts, trying to record and decode these patterns, see a future in which thoughts need not remain hidden inside the brain — but instead could be translated into verbal speech at will.

But accomplishing this feat has proven challenging. Early efforts to decode brain signals by Dr. Mesgarani and others focused on simple computer models that analyzed spectrograms, which are visual representations of sound frequencies.

But because this approach has failed to produce anything resembling intelligible speech, Dr. Mesgarani and his team, including the paper’s first author Hassan Akbari, turned instead to a vocoder, a computer algorithm that can synthesize speech after being trained on recordings of people talking.

“This is the same technology used by Amazon Echo and Apple Siri to give verbal responses to our questions,” said Dr. Mesgarani, who is also an associate professor of electrical engineering at Columbia Engineering.

To teach the vocoder to interpret to brain activity, Dr. Mesgarani teamed up with Ashesh Dinesh Mehta, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon at Northwell Health Physician Partners Neuroscience Institute and co-author of today’s paper. Dr. Mehta treats epilepsy patients, some of whom must undergo regular surgeries.

“Working with Dr. Mehta, we asked epilepsy patients already undergoing brain surgery to listen to sentences spoken by different people, while we measured patterns of brain activity,” said Dr. Mesgarani. “These neural patterns trained the vocoder.”

Next, the researchers asked those same patients to listen to speakers reciting digits between 0 to 9, while recording brain signals that could then be run through the vocoder. The sound produced by the vocoder in response to those signals was analyzed and cleaned up by neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence that mimics the structure of neurons in the biological brain.

Above: representation of researchers’ new approach to audio reconstruction that uses a vocoder and deep neural network model.

The end result was a robotic-sounding voice reciting a sequence of numbers. To test the accuracy of the recording, Dr. Mesgarani and his team tasked individuals to listen to the recording and report what they heard.

“We found that people could understand and repeat the sounds about 75% of the time, which is well above and beyond any previous attempts,” said Dr. Mesgarani. The improvement in intelligibility was especially evident when comparing the new recordings to the earlier, spectrogram-based attempts. “The sensitive vocoder and powerful neural networks represented the sounds the patients had originally listened to with surprising accuracy.”

Dr. Mesgarani and his team plan to test more complicated words and sentences next, and they want to run the same tests on brain signals emitted when a person speaks or imagines speaking. Ultimately, they hope their system could be part of an implant, similar to those worn by some epilepsy patients, that translates the wearer’s thoughts directly into words.

“In this scenario, if the wearer thinks ‘I need a glass of water,’ our system could take the brain signals generated by that thought, and turn them into synthesized, verbal speech,” said Dr. Mesgarani. “This would be a game changer. It would give anyone who has lost their ability to speak, whether through injury or disease, the renewed chance to connect to the world around them.”

 Alimta is a combination therapy and has received its FDA approval in Jun,2018 for 1L mnon-sq NSCLC in combination with pembrolizumab and carboplatin","New approval based on Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 results
INDIANAPOLIS,– Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for a new indication for ALIMTA® (pemetrexed for injection) in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), developed and marketed by Merck (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada), and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. This indication is approved based on data from Merck’s Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial, which enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 expression and had dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).
Eli Lilly and Company logo. (PRNewsfoto/Eli Lilly and Company)
ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and carboplatin was first approved in June 2018 under the FDA’s accelerated approval process for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, based on tumor response rates and PFS data from the Phase 2 study KEYNOTE-021 (Cohort G1). In accordance with the accelerated approval process, continued approval was contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit, which has now been demonstrated in the KEYNOTE-189 trial and has resulted in the FDA converting the accelerated approval to full (regular) approval.
“KEYNOTE-189 demonstrated an exceptional effect of the ALIMTA-pembrolizumab-platinum chemotherapy combination in the first-line setting, offering significantly improved survival in patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations,” said Anne White, president, Lilly Oncology. “This new indication reinforces Lilly’s continued commitment to providing practice-changing treatment options that can make a meaningful difference for people living with lung cancer.”
ALIMTA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed. See additional Important Safety Information below.
KEYNOTE-189 Trial Results
On August 20, 2018, Merck’s pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA for this indication, based on data from the KEYNOTE-189 study, which demonstrated that treatment with ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer OS and PFS than ALIMTA plus platinum chemotherapy with placebo.

In the KEYNOTE-189 study, safety was evaluated in 405 patients who received ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy and 202 patients who received placebo, ALIMTA and platinum chemotherapy. ALIMTA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 23 percent of patients in the ALIMTA-pembrolizumab-platinum chemotherapy arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of ALIMTA in this arm were acute kidney injury (3%) and pneumonitis (2%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of ALIMTA occurred in 49 percent of patients in the ALIMTA-pembrolizumab-platinum chemotherapy arm; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of ALIMTA in this arm (≥2%) were neutropenia (12%), anemia (7%), asthenia (4%), pneumonia (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), diarrhea (3%), and fatigue (3%). Adverse reactions of any grade occurring in ≥20 percent of patients receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy were nausea (56%), fatigue (56%), constipation (35%), diarrhea (31%), decreased appetite (28%), rash (25%), vomiting (24%), cough (21%), dyspnea (21%) and pyrexia (20%).
KEYNOTE-189 Trial Design
Conducted by Merck, the KEYNOTE-189 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02578680), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, evaluated ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and cisplatin or carboplatin compared with ALIMTA in combination with placebo and cisplatin or carboplatin, in 616 untreated patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. Patients had no sensitizing EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and had not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. This was a treat-to-progression protocol, with both ALIMTA and pembrolizumab being used until progression or unacceptable toxicity (or 35 cycles for pembrolizumab)1, and had dual primary endpoints of OS and PFS [assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)]; secondary endpoints include overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Patients were randomized 2:1 to one of two treatment groups, as follows:

ALIMTA (500 mg/m2) (with vitamin supplementation) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min on day one every three weeks (Q3W) for four cycles, followed by ALIMTA (500 mg/m2) plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W; or
ALIMTA (500 mg/m2) (with vitamin supplementation) plus saline placebo plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min on day one every three weeks (Q3W) for four cycles, followed by ALIMTA (500 mg/m2) plus placebo Q3W.
Patients on the control arm who experienced disease progression, verified by central independent review, were permitted to undergo treatment assignment unblinding and crossover to receive open-label pembrolizumab. The KEYNOTE-189 study was conducted in collaboration with Lilly.
About Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and most other countries, killing nearly 1.7 million people worldwide each year.2 In the U.S., lung cancer is responsible for approximately 25 percent of all cancer deaths, more than those from breast, colon and prostate cancers combined.3 Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a very difficult-to-treat cancer and the prognosis is poor for metastatic NSCLC.4 NSCLC is much more common than other types of lung cancer and accounts for about 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.5 For those people afflicted with NSCLC, about 70 percent have nonsquamous cell carcinoma, while about 30 percent have squamous cell carcinoma.5
About ALIMTA® (pemetrexed for injection)
ALIMTA is indicated in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. For all FDA-approved indications for ALIMTA, please see full Prescribing Information.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ALIMTA® (pemetrexed for injection)
CONTRAINDICATION

ALIMTA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression Without Vitamin Supplementation

ALIMTA can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation.
Prior to treatment with ALIMTA, patients must be instructed to initiate supplementation with oral folic acid. Intramuscular injections of vitamin B12 are also required prior to ALIMTA treatment. Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation should be continued during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of ALIMTA as they may reduce the severity of treatment-related hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities. Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer ALIMTA until the ANC is at least 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm3. Permanently reduce ALIMTA in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm3 or platelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm3 in previous cycles.
In Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%, respectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the ALIMTA arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm. In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%.
Renal Failure

ALIMTA can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal toxicity. Determine creatinine clearance before each dose and periodically monitor renal function during treatment with ALIMTA.
The incidences of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA with cisplatin were 2.1% in Study JMDB and 2.2% in Study JMCH. The incidence of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA as a single agent ranged from 0.4% to 0.6% (Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI).
Withhold ALIMTA in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 mL/min.
Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity

Serious and sometimes fatal, bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin toxicity, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, can occur with ALIMTA. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for severe and life-threatening bullous, blistering, or exfoliating skin toxicity.
Interstitial Pneumonitis

Serious interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal cases, can occur with ALIMTA treatment. Withhold ALIMTA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, or fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, permanently discontinue ALIMTA.
Radiation Recall

Radiation recall can occur with ALIMTA in patients who have received radiation weeks to years previously. Monitor patients for inflammation or blistering in areas of previous radiation treatment. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for signs of radiation recall.
Increased Risk of Toxicity With Ibuprofen in Patients With Renal Impairment

Exposure to ALIMTA is increased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment who take concomitant ibuprofen, increasing the risks of adverse reactions of ALIMTA. In patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA. If concomitant ibuprofen use cannot be avoided, monitor patients more frequently for ALIMTA adverse reactions, including myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in developmental delays and increased malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg/m2. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 3 months after the final dose.
DRUG INTERACTIONS

Ibuprofen increases exposure (AUC) of pemetrexed. In patients with creatinine clearance between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min:
Avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA.
Monitor patients more frequently for myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity, if concomitant administration of ibuprofen cannot be avoided.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

Severe adverse reactions (Grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) versus ALIMTA with platinum chemotherapy + placebo for initial treatment (KEYNOTE-189), respectively, were fatigue (12% vs 6%); diarrhea (5% vs 3%); dyspnea (3.7% vs 5%); vomiting (3.7% vs 3%); nausea (3.5% vs 3.5%); rash (2% vs 2.5%); decreased appetite (1.5% vs 0.5%); constipation (1% vs 0.5%); and pyrexia (0.2% vs 0%).
Common adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in ≥20% of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) versus ALIMTA with platinum chemotherapy + placebo for initial treatment (KEYNOTE-189), respectively, were nausea (56% vs 52%); fatigue (56% vs 58%); constipation (35% vs 32%); diarrhea (31% vs 21%); decreased appetite (28% vs 30%); rash (25% vs 17%); vomiting (24% vs 23%); cough (21% vs 28%); dyspnea (21% vs 26%); and pyrexia (20% vs 15%).
USE IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS

Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of pemetrexed or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from ALIMTA, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIMTA and for one week after the last dose.
Males of Reproductive Potential: ALIMTA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible.
Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ALIMTA in pediatric patients have not been established. Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients studied were similar to those observed in adults.
Patients with Renal Impairment: ALIMTA is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Decreased renal function results in reduced clearance and greater exposure (AUC) to ALIMTA compared with patients with normal renal function. No dose is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min.
Geriatric: The incidences of Grade 3-4 anemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and neutropenia were higher in patients 65 years of age and older as compared to younger patients: in at least one of five randomized clinical trials.

About Achromatopsia, AAV-CNGB3, and AAV-CNGA3
Achromatopsia is an inherited retinal disease that prevents cone photoreceptors from functioning. Patients are legally blind from birth and usually suffer from severely reduced visual acuity of 20/200 or worse; a disabling sensitivity to light, or photophobia; total color blindness; and involuntary back and forth eye movements, or nystagmus. There are currently no approved treatments for achromatopsia.

AAV-CNGB3 and AAV-CNGA3, gene therapy candidates designed to restore cone function, are delivered via subretinal injection to the area of the eye where most of the cones in the retina are located. AAV-CNGB3 was granted orphan drug designation (ODD), rare pediatric disease and Fast Track designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and orphan medicinal product and PRIME designations by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of achromatopsia caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AAV-CNGB3 in both adult and pediatric patients is underway.

About X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa and AAV-RGPR
X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) represent some of the most severe forms of RP, resulting in early onset in childhood and rapid progression to blindness by the time patients reach 20 to 30 years old. In XLRP, both rods and cones function poorly, leading to degeneration of the retina and total blindness. There are currently no approved treatments for XLRP.

AAV-RGPR is designed to treat the most common form of XLRP caused by mutations in the RPGR gene. Both rod and cone photoreceptors require RPGR to function. AAV-RPGR has received Fast Track designation and ODD from the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation from the EMA. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AAV-RPGR in adult and pediatric patients is underway.

6194,Bayer Signs an Exclusive License Agreement with Kyoto University for Pulmonary Disorders,Bayer and Kyoto University form research alliance to discover new treatment approaches against lung diseases,"Bayer and Kyoto University collaborate to jointly conduct clinical trials for identifying targets in lung diseases. Bayer will have an exclusive option to license the developed product in the trial
 The focus of the agreement is to discover targets and develop treatments, with combined techniques of the company in pulmonary disorders including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
 In 2014, Bayer and Kyoto University’s Office of Society-Academia Collaboration for Innovation (KU-SACI) collaborated to jointly explore candidates for certain research projects in areas cardiology & oncology including hematology, gynecology, and ophthalmology","Berlin, Bayer and Kyoto University have agreed on a strategic research alliance to jointly identify new drug targets for the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-threatening chronic disease in which, over time, tissue of the lungs becomes more and more thick and stiff, leading to a progressive loss of lung function. Although research has identified key factors in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, no direct cause leading to this disease is known. The goal of the research alliance is to identify specific targets and pathways that are causing the disease and to discover new treatments to modulate these pathways and prevent further lung function decline.
“In line with our strategy to complement in-house research through external innovation approaches, we are collaborating with Kyoto University in the area of pulmonology to identify new treatment options for patients suffering from lung diseases”, said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a disease with a high unmet medical need and we hope that the collaboration with Kyoto University will lead to the identification of new drug targets that make significant differences to patients.”
The collaboration will build on discoveries and expertise developed by Dr. Atsuyasu Sato at the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto University, especially with regard to the role of epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of IPF, combining it with Bayer’s expertise in drug discovery and development. Both partners will contribute personnel, infrastructure and unique technologies to further explore common hypotheses allowing identification of new treatment options.
Under the agreement, Bayer and Kyoto University will jointly conduct research activities to identify new drug targets. Bayer will have an option for the exclusive use of the collaboration results. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
“We are committed to discover novel therapeutics for lung diseases through our innovative approaches established in the respiratory medicine and thoracic surgery departments”, said Professor Dr. Toyohiro Hirai, Head of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto University. “We are very excited to work on multiple projects with Bayer jointly and closely. Combining our expertise, we will deepen our understanding of intractable lung diseases including IPF to search for new treatments.”
The new research alliance in pulmonology was established with the support of Kyoto University Medical Business Liaison Organization (KUMBL) and follows on a previous, broad range research agreement with Kyoto University’s Office of Society-Academia Collaboration for Innovation (KU-SACI) that was signed in 2014 to explore potential joint research projects.
About Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease affecting approximately 5 million people globally. Scarring of lung tissue occurs over time, leading to a progressive loss of lung function. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the lung tissue thickens, gas exchange from the lungs to the blood stream decreases over time. As a result, the brain and other organs are undersupplied with oxygen. Although research has identified key factors in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, no direct cause leading to this disease is known. This is why the disease is called “idiopathic” pulmonary fibrosis. Acute IPF exacerbations are defined as a rapid worsening of symptoms within days or weeks and reducing the risk of acute exacerbations is a key treatment goal in the management of all patients with IPF.

 Post-P-II study completion, Alexion will get an exclusive option to acquire Caelum, depending on the results of CAEL-101 in P-II. If the option is exercised, Caelum will receive $500M, including upfront, milestones, and royalties from Alexion
 CAEL-101 is a mAb, targeted for reducing and eliminating amyloid accumulation in patients with AL, has received FDA’s ODD for AL amyloidosis has shown improved results in P-Ia/Ib study for patients with r/r AL amyloidosis","Collaboration provides opportunity to diversify Alexion’s clinical-stage rare hematology portfolio –
– Caelum to receive up to $60 million for equity investment and option fee –
– Alexion has option to acquire Caelum based on Phase 2 data –
“We believe CAEL-101 holds significant promise in being able to help these patients and we’re excited to add it to our growing clinical-stage rare hematology portfolio.”
BOSTON & NEW YORK—Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) and Caelum Biosciences today announced a collaboration to develop CAEL-101 for light chain (AL) amyloidosis. CAEL-101 is a first-in-class amyloid fibril targeted therapy designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in patients with AL amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis is a rare systemic disorder that causes misfolded immunoglobulin light chain protein to build up in and around tissues, resulting in progressive and widespread organ damage, most commonly to the heart and kidneys.
“With a median survival time of less than 18 months following diagnosis and no approved therapies to address the organ damage caused by AL amyloidosis, there is a significant need for new treatments for this devastating disease,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research & Development at Alexion. “We believe CAEL-101 holds significant promise in being able to help these patients and we’re excited to add it to our growing clinical-stage rare hematology portfolio.”
Michael Spector, President and Chief Executive Officer of Caelum, said, “CAEL-101 appears to have a unique capability of binding to both kappa and lambda misfolded proteins. Data from the Phase 1a/1b study indicate that CAEL-101 is a well-tolerated therapy that leads to a rapid and clinically relevant organ response, particularly in the heart and kidneys. Further, CAEL-101 showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline in global longitudinal strain, an endpoint that has been correlated with survival in patients with AL amyloidosis. We are very pleased to collaborate with Alexion, a global leader in the rare disease field.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will acquire a minority equity interest in Caelum and an exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity in the company based on Phase 2 data for pre-negotiated economics. Alexion will make payments to Caelum totaling up to $60 million, including the purchase price for the equity and milestone-dependent development funding payments. The collaboration also provides for potential additional payments of up to $500 million, including the upfront and regulatory and commercial milestone payments, in the event Alexion exercises the acquisition option. The collaboration will leverage Alexion’s expertise in rare disease antibody development and commercial franchise in hematology. Alexion and Caelum will collaborate on the design of the ongoing development program for CAEL-101. Caelum will be responsible for conducting the development program through the end of Phase 2 and for manufacturing CAEL-101.
About CAEL-101
CAEL-101 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in the tissues and organs of patients with AL amyloidosis. The antibody is designed to bind to insoluble light chain amyloid protein, including both kappa and lambda subtypes. In a Phase 1a/1b study, CAEL-101 demonstrated improved organ function, including cardiac and renal function, in 27 patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis who had previously not had an organ response to standard of care therapy. CAEL-101 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a therapy for patients with AL amyloidosis and as a radio-imaging agent in AL amyloidosis.
About AL Amyloidosis
AL amyloidosis is a rare systemic disorder caused by an abnormality of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Misfolded immunoglobulin light chains produced by plasma cells aggregate and form fibrils that deposit in tissues and organs, gradually affecting their function. This can cause progressive and widespread organ damage and high mortality rates, with death most frequently occurring as a result of cardiac failure. Current standard of care includes plasma cell directed chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant, but these therapies do not address the organ dysfunction caused by amyloid deposition, and up to 80 percent of patients are ineligible for transplant.
AL amyloidosis is a rare disease but is the most common form of amyloidosis. There are approximately 22,000 patients across the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. AL amyloidosis has a one-year mortality rate of 47 percent, 76 percent of which is caused by cardiac amyloidosis.

Polθ inhibitor opportunity
DNA Polymerase θ (Polθ) is a unique, multifunctional DNA polymerase essential to repairing DNA breaks, especially in homologous recombination deficient (HRD) cells. HRD, including deficiency in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is a clinically important feature across a variety of important tumor types, including breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Polθ gene expression is low in normal cells but elevated across a broad range of tumor types, including those with HRD. Currently, HRD tumors may be treated with Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which represent a rapidly growing, multi-billion dollar global market. A significant fraction of patients does not initially respond to PARP inhibitor treatment, and the vast majority of treated patients eventually develop PARP inhibitor resistance. A Polθ inhibitor has potential as both a mono-therapy across multiple tumor types and in combination with PARP inhibitors, where its distinct mechanism of action may help address both forms of PARP resistance. Additional clinical populations may also be attractive for combination treatment with a Polθ inhibitor, including possible combinations with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and Immuno-Oncology agents.

6285,ï»¿Roche Recalls Lots of Coaguchek Xs Pt Test Strips with FDA's Class I Warning,"FDA warns patients and doctors about recall of home-use test strips used with device to monitor blood thinner warfarin, not authorized for sale in U.S.","The recall is in response to the inaccurate INR (International Normalized Ratio) results reported byCoaguChek XS PT Test Strips distributed by Terrific Care/Medex Supply including catalogue number that were not included in Roche’s 2018, recall of strips and were not labeled or authorized for sales in the US
 The FDA Class I recall is for the devices which have serious or harmful effect on the human body leading to death
 CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips are used in combination with CoaguChek XS plus, CoaguChek XS Pro, CoaguChek XS PST and CoaguChek Vantus test meter devices for monitoring levels of warfarin to examine time taken for blood to clot","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today is warning patients and doctors, who use at-home or in-the-office medical devices to monitor levels of the blood thinner warfarin, that certain test strips used with the devices may provide inaccurate results and should not be relied upon to adjust the drug dosage. Medical product distributor Terrific Care/Medex Supply LLC issued a voluntary recall of certain Roche Diagnostics test strip lots used with CoaguChek test meter devices last month. Today, the FDA classified this action as a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall, which means use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death. This recall is related to the November 2018 Roche Diagnostics Recall, the manufacturer of CoaguChek meters and test strips.
The previous recall conducted by Roche, which is still in effect, involved more than 1.1 million packages of CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips that were distributed nationwide from Jan. 12, 2018 to Oct. 29, 2018. The CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips announced in today’s recall were manufactured by Roche, but distributed by Terrific Care/Medex Supply and include catalog numbers that were not included in the recent Roche recall because these strips were not labeled or authorized for sale in the U.S. and were only distributed by Roche Diagnostics outside the country. Terrific Care/Medex Supply purchased the Roche test strips from an unknown source and imported and sold them in the U.S.
“Monitoring warfarin dosing is a critical part of using the drug properly to prevent and treat blood clots. Using faulty strips can lead to errors in medication dosage that could cause serious harm or death in some patients. That’s why it’s so concerning that this distributor continued to sell these test strips in the U.S. even though domestic sales had been stopped due to safety concerns. To reduce risks to patients, we’re warning health care providers and the public about the dangers associated with this product,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “Distributing products that are not labeled or authorized for sale in the United States raises significant concerns for us in view of the serious safety issues with these test strip devices, and our work on this matter is not finished. Our top priority is the immediate safety of patients, and we’re taking steps to ensure the products that this company distributed are removed from the market.”
As with the previous recall, the FDA is warning patients and health care professionals that they should not rely on these test meter devices to monitor warfarin levels if they’re using test strips affected by the recall. Instead, they should have blood drawn from a vein and have their levels measured by a laboratory test or use an alternative meter device.
Millions of Americans take the blood thinner warfarin (also known by the brand names Coumadin and Jantoven) to prevent and treat blood clots. The drug may be prescribed for patients with certain types of irregular heartbeats, blood clots in the legs or lungs, or certain medical device implants such as artificial heart valves. Achieving the correct warfarin dosage is crucial, and patients need regular monitoring to test how long it takes their blood to clot. The response is measured by a blood test to check the International Normalized Ratio, or INR. This test can be performed by an accredited laboratory on blood drawn from a vein or with a fingerstick blood draw using an INR test meter at home or in a doctor’s office.
The FDA’s previous warning concerning the CoaguChek XS PT Test Strips was based on medical device reports submitted by Roche Diagnostics to the agency indicating that the test strips may provide results that are higher than the actual INR. As a result of incorrect INR results, some patients may be prescribed an insufficient warfarin dose or instructed to interrupt warfarin use, which may increase the risk for dangerous blood clots.
Incorrect INR results are of particular concern for individuals at an increased risk of blood clots including those with mechanical heart valves, with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) who are at a high risk of stroke, or those who had a recent blood clot. It is important to note that problems with the CoaguChek XS PT test strips are not likely to be evident to the patient.
The test strips are used with the CoaguChek XS plus, CoaguChek XS Pro, CoaguChek XS professional, CoaguChek XS PST and CoaguChek Vantus test meter devices.
Patients and health care providers who are using CoaguChek meters should immediately stop using test strips purchased from Terrific Care/Medex Supply and use an alternative test method.
All health care providers, patients and caregivers, are strongly encouraged to voluntarily report INR test meter problems directly to the FDA through MedWatch, the FDA’s voluntary reporting program. Problems should be reported whenever one suspects that there may be an issue with an INR test meter such as a malfunction or incorrect result, or that the meter caused or contributed to a serious injury or death.
The FDA is committed to continuing to communicate publicly on this issue and will provide updates related to this recall when available.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

6409,ï»¿Novartis' Kymriah Receives NICE Approval for R/R Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in Adults,NICE recommends another revolutionary CAR T-cell therapy for adults with lymphoma,"The approval is based on the P-II JULIET (NCT02445248) trial results assessing Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) in patients with 1L+ DLBCL and followed by NICE approval in for pediatric and aged <25 yrs. with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Sep,2018
 The P-II JULIET results; 18mos.@ median relapse-free survival rate 64%; OR 43%; safe and effective
 Kymriah is a CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) therapy and has also received the US FDA approval for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphomas","Adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) will be able to access another revolutionary chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell (CAR T-cell) therapy through the Cancer Drugs Fund.
Tisagenlecleucel, also known as Kymriah and made by Novartis, is recommended for adults with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. It will be offered to people whose disease has not responded or those whose disease has relapsed after treatment with two or more courses of chemotherapy.
Lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system which is part of the immune system. There were 11,690 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in England in 2015 with 4,688 of these being diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
 
Meindert Boysen, director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at NICE said: “Recommending another revolutionary CAR T-cell therapy for adults with lymphoma represents a step forward for personalised medicine. We are pleased that patients are set to benefit from such an innovative therapy so rapidly because of joint working between NICE, NHS England and the company.“CAR T-cell therapy is expensive, however the treatment is specific to each individual and could be a potential cure for some, although it is early days. Our recommendation for tisagenlecleucel on the Cancer Drugs Fund means people can benefit while more data is collected.”
CAR T-cell therapies are specifically manufactured for each individual patient. This involves taking some of the patient’s own white blood cells which are then reengineered in a laboratory so they can recognise and attack cancer cells before being infused back into the patient
The list price for tisagenlecleucel is £282,000 and it is given as a single intravenous infusion. The company have agreed to offer the therapy at a confidential discounted price. It is estimated 200 people will be eligible for treatment each year in the UK and NHS England are working closely with several hospitals across the country to deliver this complex treatment.
Lymphoma Action Chief Executive, Ropinder Gill, said: “We’re very pleased that this ground-breaking CAR T-cell therapy will now be available on the NHS for some people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This is really good news for people affected by this type of lymphoma who, until now, have faced limited treatment options. The news offers patients and their families faced with a poor prognosis a more hopeful outlook.”
John Stewart, Director of Specialised Commissioning at NHS England said: “The NHS has agreed another deal with the manufacturer Novartis which means that from next week more patients will benefit from this game changing treatment at even more hospitals throughout the country.
“Providing the latest cutting edge treatments for patients through competitive drug deals and offering more personalised medicines like CAR T-cell therapy are just two of the ways that the NHS Long Term Plan will transform cancer care across the country.”
Dr Alasdair Rankin, Director of Research and Patient Experience at the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, said: “CAR T-cell therapy is the most promising breakthrough in blood cancer treatment of the past decade, with the potential to be used much more widely in the future.
“Ensuring access to CAR T-cell therapies gives these patients the real chance of long-term survival when all other treatments have failed.”

KENILWORTH, N.J.–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. This recommendation is based on results from the pivotal, Phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial, which enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. The trial showed a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients taking KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) compared with chemotherapy alone. If approved, this would mark the first approval in Europe for an anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy for adults with metastatic squamous NSCLC.
“We are pleased by today’s positive opinion from the CHMP, which brings us one step closer to potentially expanding our lung cancer indications in Europe to include first-line combination therapy for patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “This is important as squamous cell carcinoma continues to be an area of unmet need, and there was a significant overall survival benefit observed in the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial.”
Data from KEYNOTE-407 were presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU). The decision by the European Commission is expected in the first quarter of 2019.
KEYNOTE-407 is part of Merck’s leading clinical development program in lung cancer, which includes 10 Merck-sponsored Phase 3 trials. These trials are evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with other treatments and as monotherapy, in both advanced and earlier stages of disease, as well as across different histologies and lines of treatment.
About Lung Cancer in Europe
Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death in Europe and worldwide. In 2018, there were nearly 388,000 deaths from lung cancer in Europe. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85 percent of all cases. There are several subtypes of NSCLC, including adenocarcinoma (accounting for 40 percent of lung cancers), squamous cell carcinoma (25 to 30 percent) and large cell carcinoma (10 to 15 percent).
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 900 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Halozyme will also receive mid-single digit royalties on sales of commercialized products
“Through our collaboration with Halozyme, a company that has transformed subcutaneous delivery of biologics, we now have the potential to add optimal delivery capabilities to our profile of building best-in-class antibodies against novel targets. By gaining exclusive access to ENHANZE® technology for our anti-FcRn asset, we also solidify our leadership position in this exciting new space that has the potential to disrupt the way severe autoimmune diseases are treated,” commented Keith Woods, Chief Operating Officer of argenx. “As we look towards commercialization, if approved, efgartigimod is now equipped with a well-established subcutaneous delivery technology in addition to the clinical activity and favorable tolerability profile we have observed in studies to date. We believe that by offering both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations, we have the opportunity to capture patient preferences across all indications within our efgartigimod portfolio.”
“We are excited to work with argenx to create new delivery options for therapies being developed to improve the lives of patients suffering from severe autoimmune diseases,” said Dr. Helen Torley, President and CEO of Halozyme. “This collaboration is an example of the value ENHANZE® can potentially bring while a product is still in development where the benefits of subcutaneous administration can be realized earlier by both patients and healthcare providers.”
argenx represents Halozyme’s ninth global collaboration and license partner for the ENHANZE® technology. These collaborations cover more than 50 therapeutic targets and include three commercialized products.
About ENHANZE® Technology
Halozyme’s proprietary ENHANZE® drug-delivery technology is based on its patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (rHuPH20). rHuPH20 has been shown to remove traditional limitations on the volume of biologics that can be delivered subcutaneously (just under the skin). By using rHuPH20, some biologics and compounds that are administered intravenously may instead be delivered subcutaneously. ENHANZE® may also benefit subcutaneous biologics by reducing the need for multiple injections. This delivery has been shown in studies to reduce health care practitioner time required for administration and shorten time for drug administration

6631,Eli Lilly Reports Results of Olumiant (baricitinib) in P-III BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 study for Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD),Lilly Announces Top-Line Phase 3 Results for Baricitinib in Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,"The two P-III study BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 involves assessing of baricitinib vs PBO in patients with moderate-to-severe AD
 The two P-III study resulted in meeting 1EPs @16 wks. with no venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) & deaths rates
 Olumiant (baricitinib, 2mg) indicated for moderate-to-severe RA who have had an inadequate response to TNF antagonist therapies and is approved in 50 countries including the US, EU, and Japan. In Dec,2009 Lilly and Incyte collaborated to develop and commercialize baricitinib for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases","INDIANAPOLIS, Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, two Phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In both investigational trials, compared to patients treated with placebo, a statistically significant proportion of patients treated with baricitinib achieved the primary endpoint at Week 16 defined by the Investigator’s Global Assessment for AD (IGA) score of clear or almost clear (IGA 0,1). These are two of five studies that will be part of the placebo-controlled data program intended to support global registrations.
In the 16-week placebo-controlled phase of BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events with baricitinib treatment was similar to placebo, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed were nasopharyngitis and headache. No venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or deaths were reported.
“Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can negatively impact the quality of life for patients, and unfortunately there are limited treatment options, particularly oral medications,” said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. “We are encouraged that baricitinib met the primary endpoints in these two studies, and look forward to seeing the collective results of all five studies.”
Lilly plans to share the full data results from both the BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 studies at future scientific venues and in peer-reviewed journals, as well as the topline data from other ongoing Phase 3 trials later this year.
Baricitinib is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in more than 50 countries, including the U.S., member states of the EU and Japan, and is marketed as OLUMIANT®.
Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2 mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets 
WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.
Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.
MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.
THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.
Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.
Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.
The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.
MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.
GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.
LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to ≥5x and ≥10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.
Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.
Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.
VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse reactions (≥1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%), and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.
HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

About BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE AD-2
The BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 clinical trials are multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Significant improvement in disease activity was determined by the proportion of patients on baricitinib achieving clear (0) or almost clear skin (1) with a greater than or equal to 2-point improvement as measured by the 5-point Investigator’s Global Assessment for AD (IGA) scale at 16 weeks of treatment.
About OLUMIANT
OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies. There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known. OLUMIANT is approved in more than 50 countries.
About Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis (AD), a serious form of eczema, is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by intense itching, dry skin and inflammation that can be present on any part of the body. AD is a heterogeneous disease both clinically and biologically, but may be characterized by chronic baseline symptoms of itch, redness and skin damage that are often punctuated with episodic, sometimes unpredictable, flares or exacerbations. AD affects approximately 1-3 percent of adults worldwide.
Moderate-to-severe AD is characterized by intense itching, resulting in visibly damaged skin and sleep loss. Like other chronic inflammatory diseases, AD is immune-mediated and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines.

6838,ï»¿BioLineRX's BL-8040 Receives FDA's Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for Pancreatic Cancer,BioLineRx Receives Orphan Drug Designation From the FDA for its Lead Therapeutic Candidate BL-8040 for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer,"The FDA’s ODD to BL-8040 is granted for pancreatic cancer, with an addition to previously granted for AML and stem-cell mobilization in 2015
 The US FDA’s ODD is granted to the drugs offering treatment for rare diseases and disorders affecting fewer than 200,000 people or >200,000 persons with seven yrs. of market exclusivity, significant development incentives, including tax credits related to clinical trial expenses, an exemption from the FDA-user fee, and FDA assistance in clinical trial design
 BL-8040 is an antagonist for CXCR4 targeted for hematological malignancies, solid tumors and stem cell mobilization and is a licensed product of BioLineRx from Biokine Therapeutics","BioLineRx Ltd. (NASDAQ: BLRX) (TASE:BLRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to its lead oncology candidate, BL-8040, for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
“Orphan Drug Designation in pancreatic cancer is a very important milestone in the development plan of BL-8040, and joins previously approved orphan designations by the FDA for BL-8040 in AML and stem-cell mobilization,” stated Philip Serlin, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx. “Despite advances in the treatment of various cancers with immune checkpoint inhibitors, pancreatic cancer is refractory to these treatment options, and remains an area of significant unmet medical need. We have previously reported encouraging clinical data supporting the potential of BL-8040 as part of an immunotherapy combination treatment in pancreatic cancer, and we look forward to top-line results from our ongoing pancreatic clinical studies later this year.”
BL-8040 is currently being investigated in clinical studies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer under two separate immuno-oncology collaborations – one with Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), and a second collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group.
Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA entitles BioLineRx to seven years of market exclusivity for the use of BL-8040 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, if approved, plus significant development incentives, including tax credits related to clinical trial expenses, an exemption from the FDA-user fee, and FDA assistance in clinical trial design.
About BL-8040
BL-8040 is a short synthetic peptide for the treatment of hematological malignancies, solid tumors, and stem cell mobilization. It functions as a high-affinity best-in-class antagonist for CXCR4, a chemokine receptor that is directly involved in tumor progression, angiogenesis, metastasis and cell survival. CXCR4 is over-expressed in many human cancers and its expression often correlates with disease severity. In a number of clinical and pre-clinical studies, BL-8040 has shown robust mobilization of cancer cells and immune-cells, sensitization of cancer cells to chemo- and bio-based anti-cancer therapies, and direct anti-cancer effect by inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis). BL-8040 was licensed by BioLineRx from Biokine Therapeutics and was previously developed under the name BKT-140.
About Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer has a low rate of early diagnosis and a poor prognosis. Its incidence rate in the U.S. is estimated at 3.2% of new cancer cases. Each year, about 185,000 individuals globally are diagnosed with this condition, and an estimated 55,000 individuals were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the U.S. during 2018. Symptoms are usually non-specific and as a result, pancreatic cancer is often not diagnosed until it reaches an advanced stage. Surgical resection does not offer adequate treatment since only 20% of patients have resectable tumors at the time of diagnosis. Even among patients who undergo resection for pancreatic cancer and have tumor-free margins, the five-year survival rate is only 10%-25%. The overall five-year survival rate among pancreatic cancer patients is 7-8%, which constitutes the highest mortality rate among solid tumor malignancies. The overall median survival is less than one year from diagnosis, highlighting the need for the development of new therapeutic options.
Despite advances in chemotherapeutics and immunotherapy, increases in median and overall survival rates in pancreatic cancer have been modest. Pancreatic cancer remains an area of unmet medical need, with no new approved therapies since the approval of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine (Abraxane®) for first-line treatment in 2013 and Onivyde® in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for second-line treatment in 2015. The limited clinical benefits demonstrated by these existing standard treatment options reinforce the need for additional approaches.

6861,ï»¿Eisai and Purdue Report Result of Lemborexant in P-III SUNRISE 2 Study for Insomnia in Adults,Lilly Announces Top-Line Phase 3 Results for Baricitinib in Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis,"The P-III SUNRISE 2 study involves assessing of Lemborexant (5mg,10mg) vs PBO in 949 patients with insomnia disorder, characterized by difficulty in falling asleep/staying asleep aged 18 to 88yrs.
 P-III SUNRISE 2 study results: reductions in sleep onset latency (sSOL) (-21.81, -28.21 vs -11.43 min); improvement in sSE (14.19%, 14.31% vs 9.64%); reduction in subjective wake after sleep onset (sWASO) (-46.75, -41.95 vs -29.28 min); presented at Sleep Research Society’s on 14 Feb, 2019
 Lemborexant is an orexin neurotransmitter targeted for faster falling asleep with longer period of time with its NDA filled with the US FDA for insomnia on 27 Dec,2018 and is evaluated in P-II for sleep-wake rhythm disorder and mild to moderate Alzheimer’s dementia","INDIANAPOLIS, Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, two Phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In both investigational trials, compared to patients treated with placebo, a statistically significant proportion of patients treated with baricitinib achieved the primary endpoint at Week 16 defined by the Investigator’s Global Assessment for AD (IGA) score of clear or almost clear (IGA 0,1). These are two of five studies that will be part of the placebo-controlled data program intended to support global registrations.
In the 16-week placebo-controlled phase of BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events with baricitinib treatment was similar to placebo, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed were nasopharyngitis and headache. No venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or deaths were reported.
“Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can negatively impact the quality of life for patients, and unfortunately there are limited treatment options, particularly oral medications,” said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. “We are encouraged that baricitinib met the primary endpoints in these two studies, and look forward to seeing the collective results of all five studies.”
Lilly plans to share the full data results from both the BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 studies at future scientific venues and in peer-reviewed journals, as well as the topline data from other ongoing Phase 3 trials later this year.
Baricitinib is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in more than 50 countries, including the U.S., member states of the EU and Japan, and is marketed as OLUMIANT®.
Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2 mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets 
WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.
Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.
MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.
THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.
Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.
Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.
The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.
MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.
GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.
LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to ≥5x and ≥10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.
Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.
Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.
VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse reactions (≥1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%), and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.
HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

About BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE AD-2
The BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 clinical trials are multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Significant improvement in disease activity was determined by the proportion of patients on baricitinib achieving clear (0) or almost clear skin (1) with a greater than or equal to 2-point improvement as measured by the 5-point Investigator’s Global Assessment for AD (IGA) scale at 16 weeks of treatment.
About OLUMIANT
OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies. There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known. OLUMIANT is approved in more than 50 countries.
About Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis (AD), a serious form of eczema, is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by intense itching, dry skin and inflammation that can be present on any part of the body. AD is a heterogeneous disease both clinically and biologically, but may be characterized by chronic baseline symptoms of itch, redness and skin damage that are often punctuated with episodic, sometimes unpredictable, flares or exacerbations. AD affects approximately 1-3 percent of adults worldwide.
Moderate-to-severe AD is characterized by intense itching, resulting in visibly damaged skin and sleep loss. Like other chronic inflammatory diseases, AD is immune-mediated and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines.

6879,AstraZeneca's MEDI8897 Receives FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) &amp; EMA's PRIME Designation for Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) in Infants,US FDA grants Breakthrough Therapy Designation for potential next-generation RSV medicine MEDI8897,"The FDA’s BT & EMA’s PRIME designation is based on P-IIb trial results assessing MEDI8897 in patients with LTRI caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in premature infants @150 days
 The P-IIb study resulted in meeting its 1EPs with reduction in the incidence of medically-attended LRTI
 MEDI8897 is an extended half-life RSV F mAb, used for prevention of LRTI administered as a single dose within 5months and has received FDA’s FT designation in Mar,2015. In Mar, 2017 AstraZeneca and Sanofi Pasteur collaborated to jointly commercialize MEDI8897","AstraZeneca and its global biologics research and development arm, MedImmune, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for MEDI8897, an extended half-life respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F monoclonal antibody (mAb) being developed for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by RSV.
A BTD is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and that have shown encouraging early clinical results, which may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically-significant endpoint over available medicines. MEDI8897 is being developed in partnership with Sanofi Pasteur and received Fast Track designation from the US FDA in March 2015.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice-President, R&D BioPharmaceuticals, said: “MEDI8897 is our next-generation preventive medicine for respiratory syncytial virus, which has the potential to address an important unmet need for infants, families and caregivers. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation, together with its recent PRIME eligibility from the European Medicines Agency, will help us to bring MEDI8897 to all infants at risk for RSV as quickly as possible.”
The BTD is based on the primary analysis of the Phase IIb trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MEDI8897, which met its primary endpoint defined as a statistically-significant reduction in the incidence of medically-attended LRTI caused by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed RSV, for 150 days after dosing in healthy preterm infants. Full results from the Phase IIb trial will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
About MEDI8897
MEDI8897 is an extended half-life RSV F mAb being developed for the prevention of LRTI caused by RSV. MEDI8897 is being developed for use in a broader infant population than the current standard of care for RSV prevention, Synagis (palivizumab), which in the US is only approved for use in high-risk infants. Additionally, MEDI8897 is being developed so that it may only require one dose during a typical five-month RSV season, vs. monthly injections with current standard of care.1
The development programme for MEDI8897 also includes a Phase III trial in late preterm and healthy full-term infants. AstraZeneca will also conduct a Phase II/III study in Synagis-eligible paediatric patients to generate additional data for use in this population.
In February 2019, the EMA granted PRIME eligibility to MEDI8897.
In March 2017, AstraZeneca and Sanofi Pasteur announced an agreement to develop and commercialise MEDI8897 jointly. In November 2018, AstraZeneca announced Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi) has the right to participate in payments that may be received from the US profits or losses for MEDI8897.
About RSV
RSV is the most common cause of LRTI in infants and young children worldwide, and 90% of children are infected with RSV in the first two years of life. Of those, up to 40% will experience a LRTI with the initial episode, making the development and availability of effective prevention methods a critical public health priority.2 In the US, there is currently one approved medicine for RSV prophylaxis, Synagis (palivizumab), indicated for high-risk children (premature infants ≤ 35 weeks gestational age, children with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and children with haemodynamically significant chronic heart disease).3

6936,Novartis to Acquire AveXis with its Gene Therapy Clinical Candidates,Novartis enters agreement to acquire AveXis Inc. for USD 8.7 bn to transform care in SMA and expand position as a gene therapy and Neuroscience leader,"Novartis acquires AveXis, in all stock transaction with its AVXS-101 candidate for replacing the defective SMN1 gene. AveXis to receive $218/share making total deal value $8.7B
 The focus of the agreement is to utilize AveXis’ AAV9 gene therapy platform to develop therapies for multiple therapeutic areas
 AVXS-101 is a gene replacement therapy candidate targeted for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1 and has received FDA’s ODD and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for SMA & SMA Type 1","AveXis lead product candidate, AVXS-101, has potential to be first-ever one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a disease which results in early death or lifelong disability with considerable healthcare costs
AVXS-101 has Breakthrough therapy designation in the US, PRIME designation in the EU and Sakigake in Japan; expected US patient availability in 2019
Financially attractive acquisition with multi-billion dollar peak sales potential; strong Core Operating Income and EPS contribution as of 2020
AveXis offers a valuable gene therapy platform, with potential beyond SMA, and scalable manufacturing to accelerate potential future gene therapy programs and launches
Deal completion expected in mid 2018
Basel, – Novartis announced today that it has entered into an agreement and plan of merger with AveXis, Inc. to acquire the US-based Nasdaq-listed clinical stage gene therapy company for USD 218 per share or a total of USD 8.7 billion in cash. The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of both companies.
AveXis has several ongoing clinical studies for the treatment of SMA, an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a defect in a single gene, the survival motor neuron (SMN1). The lead AveXis gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101, has highly compelling clinical data in treating SMA Type 1, which is the number one genetic cause of death in infants, where 9 out of 10 infants do not live to their second birthday or are permanently ventilator dependent. It is estimated that one out of every 6,000-10,000 children born is affected by some form of SMA.
Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, said: “The proposed acquisition of AveXis offers an extraordinary opportunity to transform the care of SMA. We believe AVXS-101 could create a lifetime of possibilities for the children and families impacted by this devastating condition. The acquisition would also accelerate our strategy to pursue high-efficacy, first-in-class therapies and broaden our leadership in neuroscience. We would gain with the team at AveXis another gene therapy platform, in addition to our CAR-T platform for cancer, to advance a growing pipeline of gene therapies across therapeutic areas. We look forward on the closing of the deal to a smooth transition for AveXis employees and welcoming them to Novartis.”
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted AVXS-101 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of SMA as well as Breakthrough Therapy designation for SMA Type 1. A BLA filing with the FDA for AVXS-101 is expected in the second half of 2018 and approval and launch in the US is expected in 2019. PRIME and Sakigake designations have been secured in Europe and Japan, respectively.
If approved, AVXS-101 would be a first-in-class one-time therapy that addresses the root genetic cause of SMA by effectively replacing the defective SMN1 gene. In a clinical study, AVXS-101 showed life-saving efficacy, with all 15 infants treated event free at 20 months compared with an event-free survival rate of 8 percent in an historical cohort (NEJM, November 2017). AveXis will also present two-year data to the American Academy of Neurology on April 25, 2018.
Paul Hudson, CEO Novartis Pharmaceuticals, said: “Bringing AveXis on board would support both our ambition to be a leader in neurodegenerative diseases and our Neuroscience franchise priorities to strengthen our position in devastating pediatric neurological diseases such as SMA. We relish the opportunity to leverage our expertise, our 70-plus year heritage in neuroscience and our global footprint to help AVXS-101 benefit high-need SMA patients around the world.”
AveXis also offers state of the art AAV9 gene therapy manufacturing capabilities and valuable R&D capabilities, which in addition to AVXS-101, includes other pipeline products for Rett Syndrome (RTT) and a genetic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. AAV9 is considered to be a clinically proven gene delivery platform for diseases of the central nervous system (CNS).
Assuming mid 2018 completion, the acquisition impact would be slightly negative to Core Operating Income in 2018 and 2019, mainly due to R&D investments. As of 2020, Novartis would expect the acquisition impact to strongly contribute to Core Operating Income and Core EPS accretion driven by a significant increase in sales.
The transaction is expected to close in mid 2018, pending the successful fulfilment of the tender offer and all other closing conditions. On completion, Novartis plans a smooth transition of operations and the integration of AveXis’ talented and dedicated employees to continue the mission of bringing AVXS-101 to patients worldwide.
Conference calls for Investors will take place on Monday April 9, 2018 at 08:00 CET and 18:00 CET. Details can be found at https://www.novartis.com/investors/event-calendar
Transaction Details
Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, Novartis has formed an acquisition subsidiary, Novartis AM Merger Corporation (“Purchaser“), that will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of AveXis for USD 218 per share.

SUMMIT, N.J. & SEATTLE–– Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) and Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:JUNO) today announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Juno. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will pay $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired and Juno shares already owned by Celgene (approximately 9.7% of outstanding shares). The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of both companies.
Juno is a pioneer in the development of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T and TCR (T cell receptor) therapeutics with a broad, novel portfolio evaluating multiple targets and cancer indications. Adding to Celgene’s lymphoma program, JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) represents a potentially best-in-class CD19-directed CAR T currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Regulatory approval for JCAR017 in the U.S. is expected in 2019 with potential global peak sales of approximately $3 billion.
“The acquisition of Juno builds on our shared vision to discover and develop transformative medicines for patients with incurable blood cancers,” said Mark J. Alles, Celgene’s Chief Executive Officer. “Juno’s advanced cellular immunotherapy portfolio and research capabilities strengthen Celgene’s global leadership in hematology and adds new drivers for growth beyond 2020.”
“The people at Juno channel their passion for science and patients towards a common goal of finding cures by creating cell therapies that help people live longer, better lives,” said Hans Bishop, Juno’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Continuing this work will take scientific prowess, manufacturing excellence and global reach. This union will provide all three.”
The acquisition will also add a novel scientific platform and scalable manufacturing capabilities which will complement Celgene’s leadership in hematology and oncology. In collaboration with Juno’s team in Seattle, Celgene plans to expand its existing center of excellence for immuno-oncology translational medicine by leveraging Juno’s research and development facility in Seattle, WA as well as Juno’s manufacturing facility in Bothell, WA.
Strategic Rationale for Acquiring Juno
Upon completion of the acquisition of Juno, Celgene will be positioned to become a preeminent cellular immunotherapy company. The strategic advantages of this acquisition will include the opportunity to:

Leverage a novel scientific platform and scalable manufacturing capabilities to position Celgene at the forefront of future advances in the science of cellular immunotherapy
Accelerate Juno’s pipeline development to capture the full potential of cellular immunotherapy
JCAR017, a pivotal stage asset, with an emerging favorable profile in DLBCL, is expected to add approximately $3 billion in peak sales and significantly strengthen Celgene’s lymphoma portfolio
JCARH125 will enhance Celgene’s campaign against BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), a key target in multiple myeloma
Additional cellular therapy assets in proof-of-concept trials for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors will add to Celgene’s existing pipeline
Accelerate revenue diversification with meaningful growth drivers beyond 2020
Capture 100% of the global economics on all Juno’s cellular immunotherapy assets
Terms of the Agreement
Celgene will acquire all the outstanding shares of common stock of Juno through a tender offer for $87 per share in cash, or an aggregate of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired and Juno shares already owned by Celgene. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of a number of shares of Juno common stock, that when taken together with the shares of Juno common stock already directly and indirectly owned by Celgene, represent at least a majority of outstanding shares of Juno common stock, and expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The transaction is anticipated to close in Q1:18.
Celgene expects to fund the transaction through a combination of existing cash and new debt. The resulting capital structure will be consistent with Celgene’s historical financial strategy and strong investment grade profile providing the financial flexibility to pursue Celgene’s strategic priorities and take actions to drive post 2020 growth.
The acquisition is expected to be dilutive to adjusted EPS (earnings per share) in 2018 by approximately $0.50 and is expected to be incrementally additive to net product sales in 2020. There is no change to the previously disclosed 2020 financial targets of total net product sales of $19 billion to $20 billion and adjusted EPS greater than $12.50.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor to Celgene on the transaction. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor to Juno. Legal counsel for Celgene is Proskauer Rose LLP and Hogan Lovells, and Juno’s legal counsel is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, LLP.

 The focus of the agreement is to combine Bioverativ’s expertise with its platform for the advancement of fitusiran to treat Hemophilia A and B and further strengthening Sanofi’s footprints in rare diseases
 Fitusiran is a once-monthly RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic, targeted for hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors","Expands Sanofi’s presence in specialty care and strengthens leadership in rare diseases
Adds leader in the growing hemophilia market and provides platform for expansion in other rare blood disorders
Drives meaningful shareholder value with ROIC expected to exceed cost of capital within three years
Enhances Sanofi’s sustainable revenue and earnings growth
Provides immediate Business EPS accretion[1]
Paris (France) and Waltham, Mass. Sanofi and Bioverativ Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders, have entered into a definitive agreement under which Sanofi will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Bioverativ for $105 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $11.6 billion (on a fully diluted basis). The transaction was unanimously approved by both the Sanofi and Bioverativ Boards of Directors.
“With Bioverativ, a leader in the growing hemophilia market, Sanofi enhances its presence in specialty care and leadership in rare diseases, in line with its 2020 Roadmap, and creates a platform for growth in other rare blood disorders. Together, we have a great opportunity to bring innovative medicines to patients worldwide, building on Bioverativ’s success in driving new standards of care with its extended half-life factor replacement therapies,” commented Olivier Brandicourt, Sanofi’s Chief Executive Officer. “Combined, we will continue to leverage our scientific know-how, disciplined focus and development expertise that best position us to drive value for our shareholders and create breakthrough treatments for patients.”
Bioverativ Chief Executive Officer, John Cox, noted, “Bioverativ was created to bring meaningful progress to people living with hemophilia and other rare blood disorders, and I am extremely proud of the accomplishments we’ve made toward that mission over the past year. We have expanded upon the success of Eloctate and Alprolix, which are making a difference in the lives of people with hemophilia every day, and built a pipeline of novel programs for people with rare blood disorders. Sanofi brings proven capabilities and a global infrastructure, which we believe will help to more rapidly expand access to our medicines globally and further our mission of transforming the lives of people with rare blood disorders. Our Chairman, Brian Posner, our entire Board and I strongly believed our spin-off would create meaningful value for shareholders, and this transaction delivers tremendous value for the shareholders who have invested in and supported our mission.”
Creating a Leading Hemophilia Portfolio
With approximately $10 billion in annual sales and 181,000[2] people affected worldwide, hemophilia represents the largest market for rare diseases and is expected to grow above 7%[3] per year through 2022. Treatment options for patients are shaped by shifting standards of care worldwide and include prophylaxis and extended half-life products, and the development and adoption of innovative therapies.
Bioverativ’s extended half-life therapies, Eloctate® [Antihemophilic Factor VIII (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] and Alprolix® [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] for the treatment of hemophilia A and B, respectively, represented the first major advancements in the hemophilia market in nearly two decades when launched. In 2016, Bioverativ generated $847 million in sales and $41 million in royalties.
Bioverativ currently markets the two products in the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia, and plans to expand into additional geographies. The therapies are also commercialized in the European Union and other countries under a collaboration agreement.
Sanofi believes factor replacement therapy will remain the standard of care in hemophilia for many years due to excellent safety and its increasingly superior long-acting profile. Sanofi will be able to leverage Bioverativ’s clinical expertise and existing commercial platform to advance fitusiran, an investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic for hemophilia A and B, with or without inhibitors. Sanofi recently announced a restructuring of its rare disease alliance with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, with Sanofi obtaining global development and commercialization rights to fitusiran.
Strengthening Sanofi’s Specialty Care Portfolio
One of the priorities of Sanofi’s 2020 roadmap is to “Reshape the Portfolio” and focus on areas where the company currently has, or can effectively build, a leadership position. The addition of Bioverativ supports this priority by adding to our portfolio a differentiated offering of innovative therapies and providing a platform for growth in rare blood disorders, which will expand our presence in specialty care, further strengthen our leadership position in rare diseases and meet the needs of the patient community.
Beyond its two marketed products, Bioverativ’s pipeline includes a program in Phase 3 testing for cold agglutinin disease, and early stage research programs and collaborations in hemophilia, and other rare blood disorders, including sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Sanofi’s R&D organization will support Bioverativ in bringing these important therapies to patients faster. Furthermore, Sanofi’s global presence, proven expertise and success in launching specialty medicines, and established footprint in key emerging markets will help Bioverativ fully capitalize on growth opportunities for Bioverativ’s current and future products.
Delivering Shareholder Value
The addition of Bioverativ is expected to drive meaningful value for Sanofi’s shareholders, with strong cash flows from Bioverativ’s growing products expected to increase Sanofi’s financial and operational scale. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Sanofi’s Business EPS in FY2018 and up to 5% accretive in FY2019. Sanofi is also projected to achieve ROIC in excess of cost of capital within three years. Sanofi expects to preserve its strong credit rating.
Transaction Terms
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sanofi will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Bioverativ common stock at a price of $105 per share in cash. The $105 per share acquisition price represents a 64 percent premium to Bioverativ’s closing price on January 19, 2018.
The consummation of the tender offer is subject to various conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding Bioverativ shares, redelivery of a tax opinion delivered at signing, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and receipt of certain other regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. Following the successful completion of the tender offer, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi will merge with Bioverativ and the outstanding Bioverativ shares not tendered in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same $105 per share in cash paid in the tender offer. The tender offer is expected to commence in February 2018.
Sanofi plans to finance the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and through new debt to be raised. The tender offer is not subject to any financing condition. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close within three months.
Lazard is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Sanofi. Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are acting as financial advisors to Bioverativ.

About Ozanimod
Ozanimod is a novel, oral, selective, sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1PR1) and 5 (S1PR5) receptor modulator in development for immune-inflammatory indications, including relapsing multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Selective binding with S1PR1 is believed to inhibit a specific sub set of activated lymphocytes from migrating to sites of inflammation. The result is a reduction of circulating T and B lymphocytes that leads to anti-inflammatory activity. Importantly, immune surveillance is maintained.
Selective binding with S1PR5 is thought to activate specific cells within the central nervous system (CNS). This has the potential to enhance remyelination and prevent synaptic defects. Ultimately, neurological damage may be prevented.
Ozanimod is an investigational compound that is not approved for any use in any country.

6957,"GSK to Acquire 36.5% Stake in Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture, Established with Novartis","GSK announces major 3-part transaction with Novartis to drive sustainable sales growth, improve long-term earnings and deliver increasing returns to shareholders","Novartis to receive $13B (£9.2B) as total deal value from GSK. GSK to acquire 36.5% stake (63.5% already acquired in 2014) in Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture, formed in 2014 with Novartis
 The focus of the agreement is to utilize the venture for manufacturing of OTC, oral health brands, pharmaceutical and vaccines such as Sensodyne and Eno in Vemgal, Karnataka and Nashik
 Additionally, GSK plans to review Horlicks and healthcare nutrition products to support the transaction. In April 2014, GSK and Novartis signed a joint agreement to create Consumer Healthcare business focusing on Consumer Healthcare, Vaccines and Oncology products","GlaxoSmithKline plc today announces a major 3-part inter-conditional transaction with Novartis AG involving its Consumer Healthcare, Vaccines and Oncology businesses (the “Transaction”). In summary:

GSK and Novartis will create a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare business with 2013 pro forma revenues of £6.5 billion. GSK will have majority control with an equity interest of 63.5%
GSK will acquire Novartis’ global Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) for an initial cash consideration of $5.25 billion with subsequent potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion and ongoing royalties
GSK will divest its marketed Oncology portfolio, related R&D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and also grant of commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis for an aggregate cash consideration of $16 billion (of which up to $1.5 billion depends on the results of the COMBI-d trial)
GSK shareholders to receive £4 billion capital return funded by net cash transaction proceeds and expected to be delivered via a B share scheme
Transaction expected to be accretive to core EPS from first year, reflecting execution of intended B share scheme, and thereafter with growing contribution from 2017 as projected cost savings and new growth opportunities are delivered
Transaction is expected to complete during the first half of 2015 subject to approvals
Sir Andrew Witty, Chief Executive Officer, GSK said: 
“This proposed 3-part transaction accelerates our strategy to generate sustainable, broadly sourced sales growth and improve long-term earnings.
“Opportunities to build greater scale and combine high quality assets in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare are scarce. With this transaction we will substantially strengthen two of our core businesses and create significant new options to increase value for shareholders.
“The Novartis OTC portfolio is highly complementary to GSK’s and has many well-known, widely recommended brands such as Voltaren, Excedrin, Otrivin, andTheraflu. Together, we will create the world’s premier OTC business with clear opportunities to accelerate revenue growth.
“The acquisition of Novartis’ Vaccines business will significantly enhance the breadth of our vaccines portfolio and pipeline, notably in meningitis, with the addition of Bexsero, an exciting new vaccine for prevention of meningitis B. The acquisition will also strengthen our manufacturing network and reduce supply costs.
“The third part of this transaction would see divestment of our Oncology portfolio to Novartis. Over the last six years we have made excellent progress to develop a series of innovative medicines. This transaction provides us with a unique opportunity to crystallise an attractive value for this portfolio and allow these medicines to benefit from Novartis’ global scale in this area.
In financial terms, this transaction significantly exceeds our return criteria and delivers accretion to core earnings per share in year one and then with a growing contribution over time, particularly in 2017, as growth opportunities and projected cost savings are delivered.
“We also expect to return £4 billion to shareholders following completion of this transaction, whilst maintaining a strong capital base and our commitment to increasing dividends.
“Finally, and very importantly, this transaction strengthens GSK’s offering to patients and consumers. We will expand our portfolio to both help treat illness and prevent disease, and we will broaden our scope to improve human health with the acquired R&D and innovation expertise.”
Strategic highlights
Balanced set of core businesses and strengthened R&D
The proposed Transaction would increase GSK’s annual revenues by £1.3 billion to £26.9 billion (on a 2013 pro forma basis) and fundamentally re-shape GSK’s revenue base. These revenues would be split across Pharmaceuticals 62%, Consumer Healthcare 24% and Vaccines 14%.
Following completion, around 70% of GSK’s revenues would be focussed around four key franchises: Respiratory, HIV (ViiV Healthcare), Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. All of these franchises operate in growing markets with new and market-leading brands and products manufactured in protected technologies.
Of the remaining revenue base, approximately 14% of sales would reside in GSK’s Established Products Portfolio (EPP). GSK is currently reviewing this portfolio to ensure the Group evaluates all options to maximise its value.
As a result of this transaction, GSK’s late-stage development pipeline would be further strengthened with the addition of 4 new candidate vaccines from Novartis. In total, GSK would have around 45 NMEs in Phase II/III clinical development. In Consumer Healthcare, both GSK and Novartis have strong track-records of brand innovation and creating scientifically differentiated products with ~15% of combined sales generated from innovation launched in recent years.
Creating a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare business
Following completion of the transaction, GSK will be a global leader in Consumer Healthcare with revenues of £6.5 billion, on a 2013 pro forma basis. The new business will hold category leading positions and brands in Wellness, Oral health, Nutrition and Skin health, combining OTC and FMCG capabilities and expertise.
In Wellness, the new combination’s £3.4 billion complementary portfolio will create the world’s largest OTC business with the leading position in more than 35 countries around the world.
The combination is geographically well-matched. Novartis’ portfolio has had relatively limited exposure to high growth emerging markets and this presents multiple new growth opportunities for several major brands and innovations, notably Voltaren, Excedrin and Otrivin. Similarly, GSK’s brands would benefit from exposure to Novartis’ highly successful CIS, Central and Eastern European business.
The combination also creates a more competitive business. With leading positions in most of the categories in which it operates, the combination will have excellent customer insight and ability to offer retailers better shopper experiences. The combination will also have significant mass market, pharmacy and expert selling capabilities with sales personnel throughout the world. The business will also have access to world-leading science capabilities and to new Rx/Cx switch opportunities from both parent companies.
Emma Walmsley has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer Designate of the new business and will be a member of its Board. Sir Andrew Witty will be Chairman of the Board. The Board will comprise directors from both GSK and Novartis.
Strengthening global leadership in Vaccines
The acquisition of Novartis’ global Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) further improves GSK’s position as the world’s leading global vaccines supplier. Demand for vaccination remains significant with the global vaccine market projected to grow approximately 10% per annum over the next 10 years.
The transaction will strengthen the breadth of GSK’s portfolio, notably in meningitis, including the addition of Bexsero, a new vaccine for prevention of meningitis B and a further candidate vaccine in late-stage development, MenABCWY.
This portfolio expansion will be of benefit to GSK in all markets and notably in the USA, where Novartis has a strong track record of delivery. GSK’s significant presence in emerging and developing markets will also provide new opportunities for introduction and growth of Novartis’ vaccines.
GSK and Novartis’ Vaccines R&D organisations are highly complementary, bringing together respective expertise in virology, bacterial infection and different adjuvant platforms. The new business would have more than 20 different vaccines in development, including assets to prevent hospital and maternal infections and diseases prevalent in developing countries such as malaria and tuberculosis.
The acquisition is expected to strengthen GSK’s manufacturing network and increase overall capacity, notably with the addition of Novartis’ secondary packaging and supply facilities in Rosia, Italy and Marburg, Germany. GSK would also acquire new manufacturing sites in India and China. In addition, the integration of the supply of a number of key antigens, currently provided to GSK by Novartis, will provide immediate improvements and enhance the future flexibility of the business, particularly in paediatric vaccines.
Realising value for Oncology
GSK has agreed to divest its marketed Oncology portfolio, related R&D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and also grant commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis for an aggregate cash consideration of $16 billion. Up to $1.5 billion of this amount depends on the results of the COMBI-d trial, a Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of Tafinlar (BRAF) and Mekinist (MEK) versus BRAF monotherapy.
For GSK, this part of the Transaction represents a unique opportunity to crystallise an attractive value for its marketed portfolio and provide Novartis with the opportunity to leverage its global scale in this therapy area and deliver new growth and development opportunities for these products.
GSK’s R&D in oncology will continue with programmes to investigate potential new treatments in areas of cancer immunotherapy, epigenetics, and tumour environment.
Financial implications
Sales and earnings benefits
The proposed Transaction significantly exceeds GSK’s returns criteria and the company expects to realise benefits to sales and earnings as a result of it. The Transaction would increase overall GSK revenues by £1.3 billion to £26.9 billion, on a 2013 pro forma basis.
The Transaction is expected to be accretive to core earnings per share from the first year, reflecting the execution of the intended B share scheme, and is expected to make a growing contribution to earnings thereafter, especially from 2017, as the delivery of cost savings, new product launches and re-introduction of Novartis’ OTC products accelerates. GSK’s operating margins would reflect changes to GSK’s revenue mix which result from the Transaction.
New revenue growth opportunities are expected in both Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare as a result of the Transaction and future revenues would also reflect the benefits from recent restructuring and investment by Novartis. In Consumer Healthcare, sales would reflect the re-supply of certain products manufactured at Novartis’ facility in Lincoln, Nebraska following remediation activities at the site. Production and re-supply of these products is expected to increase and be phased in over the next 2 years.
Cost savings
GSK estimates that total annual cost savings of £1 billion could be achievable by the fifth full year following closing. The delivery of these potential savings is expected to be phased with approximately 50% delivered by year three and the full amount by year five. GSK intends to reinvest approximately 20% of cost savings to support innovation and expected new product launches across the Group, wherever returns are most attractive.
Total costs to deliver these savings are estimated to be £2 billion, split approximately evenly between cash and non-cash charges.
Contributions to the total cost savings are estimated to be approximately 40% from Consumer Healthcare, 40% from Vaccines and 20% from savings associated with the divestment of GSK’s Oncology portfolio. These estimates are subject to further detailed implementation planning post closing.
Potential cost savings would be generated from reductions in selling and administrative costs, removal of infrastructure overlaps and reduced third party contracting as well as through improvements in manufacturing costs. The new GSK businesses would also expect to benefit from new economies of scale and earn greater returns from leveraging sales, distribution and purchasing opportunities across its broader global platform.
The companies will conduct consultations on cost savings proposals with staff, works councils, trade unions and other employee representatives in line with local practice and in accordance with applicable employment legislation.
Shareholder information
Approvals
The Transaction constitutes a Class 1 transaction for the purposes of the FCA’s Listing Rules and therefore is conditional upon the approval of GSK’s shareholders at a General Meeting which is expected to be held in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Transaction is also conditional upon other matters, including receiving certain anti-trust approvals. Completion of the Transaction is anticipated to occur during the first half of 2015.
Capital return
GSK plans to use net after tax cash proceeds of $7.8 billion to fund a capital return of £4 billion to shareholders following completion of the transaction. This return is expected to be implemented through a B share scheme in 2015, subject to approvals. Specific details related to the execution of the B share scheme will be sent to shareholders in due course.
Following implementation of the B share scheme, GSK would not make any further share repurchases in 2015 but will review the potential for future share buy backs from 2016 in line with its usual annual cycle and subject to its current return and rating criteria.

GlaxoSmithKline plc – Proposed 3-part transaction with Novartis
Introduction
GSK today announces that it has reached agreement with Novartis on a major 3-part transaction involving its Consumer Healthcare and Oncology businesses and Novartis’ Vaccines and OTC (over-the-counter) Consumer Healthcare businesses.
The Transaction with Novartis comprises three inter-conditional components, consisting of:
(i) the creation of a Consumer Healthcare joint venture (JV), combining GSK’s Consumer Healthcare business and Novartis’ OTC Consumer Healthcare business (the “Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture”);
(ii) the acquisition by GSK of Novartis’ global Vaccines Business, including its meningitis portfolio and antigen manufacturing facilities, but excluding influenza vaccines (the “Vaccines Acquisition”); and
(i) the divestment of GSK’s marketed Oncology portfolio, related R&D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and the grant of commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis (the “Oncology Disposal”).
Summary of principal terms and conditions of the Transaction
This section provides information about the material terms and conditions of the Transaction, its constituent parts and the agreements entered into today by GSK and Novartis in that regard. Payment terms have been agreed in US dollars ($).
Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture
GSK and Novartis have today entered into contribution agreements under which, upon completion of the Transaction, GSK and Novartis will create the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture to hold GSK’s Consumer Healthcare business and Novartis’ OTC Consumer Healthcare business. In consideration of these contributions, GSK will have a controlling 63.5% equity interest in the joint venture company, with Novartis’ interest being 36.5%.
The JV will operate under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name and would operate in all territories where GSK and Novartis have a presence in those businesses, with the exception of India and Nigeria where GSK will continue to hold directly its interests in its listed subsidiaries.
The JV will be consolidated in GSK’s financial statements and will have no external debt.
GSK will assume control of Novartis’ OTC manufacturing network. This includes Novartis’ facility in Lincoln, Nebraska. Remedial actions to address the manufacturing issues identified at the Nebraska site have been underway since 2012 and re-supply of certain products started in November 2013. At present it is not possible to determine when the site will resume full operations. Production and re-supply of products is expected to increase and be phased over the next 2 years.
The joint venture is the subject of a shareholders’ agreement between GSK and Novartis, under which GSK will have 7 directors and Novartis 4 directors on the board of the joint venture company. GSK will have control of the joint venture company through the board, while Novartis will enjoy customary minority shareholder protections.
Novartis has the right to exit its investment in the joint venture company via a put option to GSK at an expert-determined market valuation. The put option is exercisable in certain windows in the period from the third to the twentieth anniversary of closing of the Transaction. The put option may be exercised either in respect of Novartis’ entire holding in the joint venture company at any given point or in instalments of 7.5% (with a final instalment of 14%). If the put option is exercised in instalments, a waiting period of 18 months applies between option exercises.
GSK and Novartis are subject to restrictions regarding the transfer of their respective interests in the joint venture company to third parties. As an exception to these restrictions, Novartis will be free to sell its shares to a third party (subject to GSK’s right of first refusal) following expiry of the put option arrangements described above. In addition, GSK is free to sell its shares to a third party following the third anniversary of closing of the Transaction, subject to Novartis having a right of first refusal and a tag right entitling it to require its shares to be sold as part of any sale by GSK.
Vaccines Acquisition
GSK and Novartis have today entered into a share and business sale agreement under which, upon completion of the Transaction, Novartis’ global Vaccines Business (including relevant corporate entities but excluding influenza vaccines) will be sold to GSK.
The consideration payable by GSK under this agreement comprises:
(i) $5.25 billion payable at closing (which is subject to customary adjustment for levels of cash, debt and working capital);
(ii) the following pipeline-related milestone payments:
(a) $450 million upon FDA regulatory approval for Novartis’ MenABCWY vaccine product;
(b) $450 million in the event that Bexsero achieves an agreed annual net sales threshold;
(c) $450 million upon achievement of an agreed milestone relating to ACIP regulatory recommendations in respect of either Novartis’ MenABCWY vaccine product or Bexsero; and
(d) $450 million upon achievement of an agreed milestone relating to ACIP regulatory recommendations in respect of Novartis’ Group B streptococcus vaccine (“GBS”); and
(iii) annual royalty payments at the rate of 10% on certain net sales of the above products.
Oncology Disposal
GSK and Novartis have today entered into a sale agreement under which GSK has agreed to sell, upon completion of the Transaction, the rights to GSK’s currently marketed oncology portfolio, related R&D activities and its AKT inhibitor currently in development as well as to grant Novartis preferred partner rights for future commercialisation of GSK oncology products for an aggregate cash consideration of $16 billion. Up to $1.5 billion of this cash consideration depends on the results of the COMBI-d trial, a Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of Tafinlar (BRAF) and Mekinist (MEK) versus BRAF monotherapy.
COMBI-d is a Phase III trial studying the combination of BRAF/MEK in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as compared to BRAF monotherapy. The trial reported positive progression free survival (primary endpoint) data in January 2014, and is being continued to evaluate its secondary endpoint of overall survival. The data on overall survival is estimated to read out in late 2014 or early 2015.
GSK will enter into a manufacturing supply agreement for the transferred products with Novartis for an initial period of 5 years.
The cash consideration is subject to customary adjustment for levels of working capital.
GSK will retain its early-stage R&D pipeline and discovery capability, as well as certain product rights outside of oncology for Arzerra.
The preferred partner rights granted by GSK to Novartis are for a period of 12.5 years from closing of the Transaction and relate to co-development and commercialisation opportunities relating to GSK oncology development products.
Inter-conditionality and Long-stop date
The Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture, the Vaccines Acquisition and the Oncology Disposal are inter-conditional. As such, none of the Transaction’s constituent parts will close unless the conditions to the other parts are satisfied or, where applicable, waived. The various conditions to the Transaction and its constituent parts must be satisfied (or, where applicable, waived) within 18 months (or such other date as GSK and Novartis may agree). If that does not occur, the Transaction will terminate.
Conditions to completion
The Transaction constitutes a Class 1 transaction for the purposes of the FCA’s Listing Rules and is therefore conditional upon the approval of GSK’s shareholders at a General Meeting. Until such time as the Transaction is approved by GSK’s shareholders, the Transaction is also conditional upon the Novartis Board not withdrawing approval of the Transaction that it has announced today.
GSK has agreed that its Board will recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolution approving the Transaction at the General Meeting (the “GSK Recommendation”). The Novartis Board has today approved the Transaction as being in the best interests of Novartis and its shareholders as a whole (the “Novartis Approval”). The GSK Recommendation and the Novartis Approval are both subject to provisions that allow them to be withdrawn on account of fiduciary duties.
In addition, the Transaction and its constituent parts are subject to certain other conditions, including the following material conditions:
· the receipt of anti-trust clearances by GSK and Novartis in respect of the constituent parts of the Transaction, including EU merger clearance and expiry of the HSR waiting periods;
· no material adverse event in relation to the businesses of either GSK or Novartis which are part of the Transaction; and
· certain other regulatory matters and approvals and certain third party consents.
GSK and Novartis will also conduct consultations with staff, works councils and trade unions and other employee representatives as appropriate and in accordance with applicable requirements and legislation.
Exclusivity and termination fees
GSK and Novartis have agreed exclusivity and non-solicit arrangements which apply until the earlier of completion or termination of the Transaction. Under these arrangements, GSK and Novartis have agreed, inter alia, that they, members of their respective groups and their respective representatives shall not enter into any agreement, discussion or process with any third party in relation to the assets which form part of the Transaction. In addition to these provisions, in the event that GSK or Novartis receives any proposal or offer relating to such assets, it is, during the exclusivity period, obliged to notify the other party with details of the proposal or offer.
GSK has agreed to pay Novartis a termination fee of $900 million by way of compensation:
(i) (subject to limited exceptions) in the event that: the General Meeting is not held within 18 months; the Shareholder Resolution is voted down at the General Meeting; or the GSK Directors adversely change, withdraw or qualify the GSK Recommendation and the Shareholder Resolution is not then passed within eight weeks; or
(ii) in certain specified circumstances where anti-trust clearance is not obtained for the Vaccines Acquisition; or
(iii) in certain specified circumstances where anti-trust clearance is not obtained for the creation of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture as a result of GSK’s non-compliance with agreed co-operation undertakings between it and Novartis.
Novartis has agreed to pay GSK a termination fee of $900 million by way of compensation:
(i) in circumstances where the Novartis Board adversely changes, withdraws or qualifies the Novartis Approval prior to the General Meeting (which, action as described in “Conditions to Completion” above, would cause a condition to the Transaction not to be satisfied); or
(ii) in certain specified circumstances where anti-trust clearance is not obtained for the Oncology Disposal; or
(iii) in certain specified circumstances where anti-trust clearance is not obtained for the creation of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture as a result of Novartis’ non-compliance with agreed co-operation undertakings between it and GSK.
Other terms
GSK and Novartis have, under the agreements relating to the Transaction and its constituent parts, given customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities to each other, including undertakings regarding achieving satisfaction of the conditions to which the Transaction and its constituent parts are subject as well as regarding the conduct of their respective businesses pending completion.

6969,Genentech Signs a Development and Commercialization Agreement with Xencor for its IL-15 &amp; XmAb24306 Programs,Xencor to Develop and Commercialize Novel IL-15 Immune Activating Cytokines with Genentech,"Xencor to receive $120M upfront, $160M milestones for XmAb24306 program and $180M for IL-15 candidate. Genentech to get worldwide commercialization rights for XmAb24306 & IL-15 program, with Xencor has an option for its co-promotion in the US, sharing equal cost/profit
 The companies will collaborate for a two-year research program for discovering IL-15 drug candidates, with its expected closure in H1’19
 XmAb24306 is an IL-15/IL-15Rα cytokine, developed using Xencor’s Fc domain and Xtend Fc technology evaluated in preclinical trials for multiple cancer","Xencor Receives $120 Million Upfront Payment, up to $180 Million in Development Milestones Per Program and Profit Share from Commercialized Medicines
MONROVIA, Calif., Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune disease, asthma and allergic disease, and cancer, today announced it has entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, including XmAb®24306. XmAb24306 is an IL-15/IL-15Rα cytokine complex engineered with Xencor’sbispecific Fc domain and Xtend™ Fc technology and is Xencor’s most advanced preclinical cytokine program.
“This partnership with Genentech accelerates our immuno-oncology work by enabling the exploration of novel XmAb24306 combinations with Genentech’s leading oncology portfolio and our growing internal pipeline of bispecific antibodies,” said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer at Xencor. “A wide-ranging combination strategy will be critical to realize the potential of IL-15 bispecific cytokines such as XmAb24306, so we plan to explore our cytokines with a broad spectrum of leading commercial-stage and investigational cancer therapies.”
“We believe cytokine therapy will play an important role in the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including cancer,” said James Sabry, M.D., Ph.D., global head of Pharma Partnering, Roche. “This collaboration with Xencor will further enhance our understanding of a critical immune activation pathway and may present a potential new way to use the immune system to target cancer.”
IL-15 is a highly active cytokine, or immune signaling protein, that when pre-complexed with IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Rα) will bind to IL-15Rβγ and stimulate the expansion and activation of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells, but with reduced regulatory T cell activation compared to IL-2. Xencor’s IL-15 bispecific cytokine platform provides a more druggable version of IL-15 with potentially superior tolerability, slower receptor-mediated clearance and a prolonged half-life, and is intended for development with a wide range of combination agents due to its proposed mechanism of activating tumor-killing immune cells.
Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will co-develop XmAb24306 and other potential IL-15 programs, in which the companies will share development costs and profits. Genentech will commercialize medicines worldwide, and Xencor has the option to co-promote in the United States. Additionally, the companies will engage in a two-year research program to discover new IL-15 drug candidates, including ones targeted to specific immune cell populations. Genentech will pay Xencor$120 million upfront, and Xencor will be eligible to receive up to $160 million in development milestones for the XmAb24306 program and up to $180 million in development milestones for each new IL-15 drug candidate.
The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and closing is expected to occur in the first half of 2019.

6980,ï»¿Lilly Reports Negative Results of Solanezumab in P-III EXPEDITION Studies in Patients with Alzheimer Disease,Lilly Announces Detailed Results of the Phase 3 Solanezumab EXPEDITION Studies Following a Presentation of the Independent Analyses by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS),"The P-III EXPEDITION Study involves assessing of Solanezumab (400 mg, IV, q4w) vs PBO in 1,012 (EXPEDITION1) & 1,040 (EXPEDITION2) patients with mild or mild to moderate Alzheimer disease
 The study resulted in unmet endpoint and demonstrated 42% reduction in decline, 20% reduction in cognitive decline, 19 percent reduction in functional decline in patients
 Solanezumab is a monoclonal IgG1 Ab, evaluated as a neuroprotector in patients with Alzheimer disease","Lilly’s analysis, as previously reported, showed primary endpoints, both cognitive and functional, were not met in the two Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled solanezumab EXPEDITION trials in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease
In Lilly’s pre-specified secondary analysis of pooled data in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease, a statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline was shown; this finding represented a 34 percent reduction in decline
Independent analyses of EXPEDITION studies conducted by the ADCS were generally similar to Lilly’s top-line results reported on August 24, 2012
Next steps for solanezumab will be determined after discussions with regulators
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced its detailed results for the Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled EXPEDITION studies in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. This announcement follows the presentation of results from independent analyses of the EXPEDITION study data conducted by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), an academic research consortium, at the annual meeting of the American Neurological Association (ANA) by Rachelle Doody, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Neurology and the Effie Marie Cain Chair in Alzheimer’s Disease Research, Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Doody is a member of the steering committee for the ADCS.
Lilly provided the raw data (the full data set collected from the EXPEDITION studies) to the ADCS. The ADCS statisticians then performed independent analyses of these data. These results were presented at today’s meeting.
“Alzheimer’s disease research has been extremely challenging,” said Dr. Doody. “The data results from the solanezumab Phase 3 trials were encouraging to the ADCS team. These results represent an important step for the medical, academic, and scientific communities in understanding brain amyloid as a target of AD therapies.”
Lilly’s relationship with the ADCS is longstanding and the decision to have them conduct independent analyses of the Phase 3 solanezumab data was made prior to seeing the top-line results from either of the EXPEDITION studies.
Lilly Results from EXPEDITION1
The EXPEDITION1 study was designed with co-primary cognitive and functional endpoints (the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive subscale [ADAS-Cog11] and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living [ADCS-ADL], respectively) in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzeimer’s disease.
Lilly’s pre-specified secondary analyses showed that results in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease taking solanezumab demonstrated a slowing of cognitive decline compared with placebo (p=.008), as measured by the ADAS- Cog11. This finding represented a 42 percent reduction in decline at the endpoint of the 18-month study. The difference in functional decline (ADCS-ADL) was not statistically significant.
Lilly Results from EXPEDITION2
Based on the results of EXPEDITION1, Lilly modified the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for EXPEDITION2, prior to database lock, to specify a single primary endpoint of cognition in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease as measured by the ADAS-Cog14, a 14-item scale, which includes three additional items considered relevant for patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease.1 At the conclusion of EXPEDITION2, there was a 20 percent reduction in cognitive decline in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease taking solanezumab; however, the treatment difference was not statistically significant (p=.120). In the pre-specified secondary endpoint of ADCS-ADL, there was a 19 percent reduction in functional decline in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease treated with solanezumab, as compared with placebo; this difference was not statistically significant (p=.076).
Lilly Results from Pooled Analyses of EXPEDITION1 and EXPEDITION2
A pre-specified secondary analysis of pooled data in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease showed a slowing of cognitive decline (p=.001) compared with placebo, as measured by the ADAS-Cog14; this finding represented a 34 percent reduction in decline. In addition, the secondary analysis of the pooled data in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease showed a 17 percent reduction of functional decline as measured by the ADCS-ADL; however, the treatment difference was not statistically significant compared with placebo (p=.057).
A number of different biomarkers were assessed in the EXPEDITION studies. Some, but not all, of these biomarkers showed an effect of solanezumab. These additional data will be presented by the ADCS at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) meeting in Monte Carlo, Monaco, on October 29, 2012, or at subsequent medical meetings and in appropriate scientific venues.
In the EXPEDITION studies, the only adverse event with an incidence of at least 1 percent that occurred statistically significantly more in the solanezumab group than in the placebo group was angina (1.1 percent versus 0.2 percent). The incidence of vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) was approximately 1 percent, occurring in 11 patients treated with solanezumab and 5 patients on placebo, which was not statistically significant.
“This is a complex disease that touches millions of people worldwide,” said David Ricks, senior vice president and president, Lilly Bio-Medicines. “Alzheimer’s disease causes significant burden on patients, caregivers and our society. While the path forward has not been determined, we believe these data in patients with mild disease may provide a step toward a potential treatment option.”
About the Primary Endpoint Scales2
The ADAS-Cog is a standard tool used in pivotal clinical trials to detect therapeutic efficacy in cognition. It consists of subtests related to memory, praxis, and language. Higher scores on the ADAS-Cog indicate more cognitive impairment. The ADCS-ADL measures activities of daily living, such as reading books or magazines, pastime activities, or household chores. Higher scores on the ADCS-ADL indicate less functional impairment.
About the EXPEDITION Trials
The EXPEDITION trials consisted of two Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled solanezumab trials in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease in 16 countries around the world. In both of the EXPEDITION study protocols, mild Alzheimer’s disease was defined as a baseline Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score of 20 to 26 and moderate Alzheimer’s disease was defined as a baseline MMSE score of 16 to 19.
The designs of EXPEDITION1 and EXPEDITION2 were the same. Patients aged 55-94 years were eligible to enroll in these studies; EXPEDITION1 enrolled 1,012 patients and EXPEDITION2 enrolled 1,040 patients. Patients received either 400mg of solanezumab infused intravenously (IV) or placebo every four weeks for approximately 18 months. Both EXPEDITION trials allowed patients to remain on stable standard of care (defined as their existing treatment regimen) during these studies. More than 85 percent of the patients in these trials were taking an acetycholinesterase inhibitor and / or memantine.
About Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, causes progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition.3,4 Researchers do not know exactly what causes Alzheimer’s disease and there are currently no approved treatments shown to slow the progression of this devastating disease, only treatment options that reduce certain symptoms of the disease.2,3,5 Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) estimates that there are currently 35.6 million people with dementia worldwide, with 7.7 million new cases each year (which implies one new case every four seconds).6 The number of people affected is estimated to be over 115 million by 2050.4 Estimates vary, but experts suggest that as many as 5.4 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s disease.3

7018,ï»¿Merck Reports Acceptance of NDA from FDA for Its (Imipenem/Cilastatin) + (Relebactam) for Complicated Urinary Tract and Intra-Abdominal Infections in Adults,"FDA Accepts for Review New Drug Application (NDA) for Merck’s Investigational Combination of Imipenem/Cilastatin and Relebactam, and Supplemental NDA (sNDA) for ZERBAXA (Ceftolozane and Tazobactam)","The NDA filing is based on the P-III RESTORE-IMI 1 study results, assessing Imipenem/Cilastatin + Relebactam (IMI/REL) vs imipenem/cilastatin + colistin (IMI+CST) in patients with gram-negative bacterial infections
 The P-III RESTORE-IMI 1 study were presented at the 28th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) meeting in Madrid, Spain, in Aprl 2018 with its PDUFA date on 16 Jul,2019
 Relebactam IV is a class A and C beta-lactamase inhibitor and has received FDA’s FT designation in combination with imipenem/cilastatin for cUTI, complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) & hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP)","KENILWORTH, N.J.– Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review regulatory filings for two antibacterial agents. These filings are: (1) a NDA accepted for Priority Review for the combination of relebactam, the company’s investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor, with imipenem/cilastatin (MK-7655A, IMI/REL), for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by certain susceptible Gram-negative bacteria, in adults with limited or no alternative therapies available; and (2) a sNDA accepted for Priority Review for ZERBAXA® (ceftolozane and tazobactam) to treat adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by certain susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for IMI/REL is July 16, 2019, while the PDUFA target action date for ZERBAXA is June 3, 2019.
In the U.S., ZERBAXA is currently indicated for the treatment of adult patients with cUTI, including pyelonephritis, caused by certain susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms, and is also indicated, in combination with metronidazole, for the treatment of adult patients with cIAI caused by certain susceptible Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms.
Corresponding applications for both medicines have been filed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and are currently under review.
“There is a major unmet need for new treatment options to address the growing danger of serious and potentially life-threatening infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria,” said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, senior vice president, head of clinical research for infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. “In a space where there are currently very few treatment options, these filings underscore Merck’s ongoing commitment to delivering new antibacterial agents to healthcare practitioners and patients.”
The IMI/REL (MK-7655A) NDA is based on the results of the pivotal Phase 3 RESTORE-IMI 1 trial, which were presented at the 28th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) meeting in Madrid, Spain, in April 2018. The ZERBAXA sNDA is based on the pivotal Phase 3 ASPECT-NP trial in adults with ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Merck plans to present results from the ASPECT-NP study at a future scientific conference.
About imipenem, cilastatin and relebactam
Relebactam is an investigational, intravenous, class A and C beta-lactamase inhibitor currently being evaluated in combination with imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of certain Gram-negative bacterial infections. The FDA has designated the combination of relebactam with imipenem/cilastatin for intravenous use as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) with Fast Track status for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP).
About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam)
ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium.
ZERBAXA 1.5g (ceftolozane 1g and tazobactam 0.5g) is approved in the United States and is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ZERBAXA used in combination with metronidazole is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus salivarius.
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.
Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam)
Patients with renal impairment: Decreased efficacy of ZERBAXA has been observed in patients with baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to ≤50 mL/min. In a clinical trial, patients with cIAIs with CrCl >50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 85.2% when treated with ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) plus metronidazole vs. 87.9% when treated with meropenem. In the same trial, patients with CrCl 30 to ≤50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 47.8% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 69.2% when treated with meropenem. A similar trend was also seen in the cUTI trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly.
Hypersensitivity: ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ceftolozane/tazobactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.
Clostridium difficile –associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible.
Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Prescribing ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients were headache (5.8%) in the cUTI trial, and nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (6.2%) and pyrexia (5.6%) in the cIAI trial.

7041,ï»¿GSK to Collaborate with Pfizer to Build a Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture,GlaxoSmithKline plc and Pfizer Inc to form new world-leading Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture Transaction provides a unique opportunity to accelerate GSK’s strategy and create substantial value for shareholders Lays foundation for separation of GSK to create two new UK-based global companies focused on Pharmaceuticals/Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare,"GSK to receive 68% equity stake and Pfizer to receive 32% equity stake in consumer health business joint venture
 The focus of the agreement is to establish a joint venture using emphasizing on pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer healthcare products with use of genetics and technologies
 The consumer healthcare business unit will focus on OTC products including Pain Relief, Respiratory, Vitamin and Mineral Supplements, Digestive Health, Skin Health and Therapeutic Oral Health","GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) has reached agreement with Pfizer Inc to combine their consumer health businesses into a new world-leading Joint Venture, with combined sales of approximately £9.8 billion ($12.7 billion)[1]. GSK will have a majority controlling equity interest of 68% and Pfizer will have an equity interest of 32% in the Joint Venture.
The proposed all-equity transaction represents a compelling opportunity to build on the recent buyout of Novartis’ stake in GSK Consumer Healthcare, to create a new world-leading consumer healthcare business and to deliver further significant shareholder value. The proposed transaction also supports GSK’s key priority of strengthening its pharmaceuticals business over the next few years by increasing cashflows and providing an effective pathway through the separation of GSK Consumer Healthcare to build further support for investment in its R&D pipeline.
New Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture
The new Joint Venture will be well-positioned to deliver stronger sales, cash flow and earnings growth driven by category leading Power Brands, science-based innovation and substantial cost synergies. The combination will bring together two highly complementary portfolios of trusted consumer health brands, including GSK’s Sensodyne, Voltaren and Panadol and Pfizer’s Advil, Centrum and Caltrate. The Joint Venture will be a category leader in Pain Relief, Respiratory, Vitamin and Mineral Supplements, Digestive Health, Skin Health and Therapeutic Oral Health. The Joint Venture will be the global leader in OTC products with a market share of 7.3% ahead of its nearest competitor at 4.1% and have number 1 or 2 market share positions in all key geographies, including the US and China.
The proposed transaction is expected to realise substantial cost synergies, with the Joint Venture expected to generate total annual cost savings of £0.5 billion by 2022 for expected total cash costs of £0.9 billion and non-cash charges of £0.3 billion. Planned divestments targeting around £1 billion of net proceeds are expected to cover the cash costs of the integration. Up to 25% of the cost savings are intended to be reinvested in the business to support innovation and other growth opportunities. Overall the Joint Venture will target an Adjusted operating margin percentage in the ‘mid-to-high 20’s’ by 2022.
GSK expects the proposed transaction to be accretive to Total earnings in the second full year following closing, reflecting the impact and timing for the costs of integration; and to be accretive to Adjusted earnings and free cashflow in the first full year after closing
Future separation
The proposed transaction is transformational to the scale of GSK’s Consumer Healthcare business. Within 3 years of the closing of the transaction, GSK intends to separate the Joint Venture via a demerger of its equity interest and a listing of GSK Consumer Healthcare on the UK equity market. Over this period, GSK will substantially complete the integration and expects to make continued progress in strengthening its Pharmaceuticals business and R&D pipeline.
The intended separation of the Group will allow the two resulting companies to be established with appropriate capital structures for their future investment needs and capital allocation priorities. The new consumer healthcare company with its more durable cash flows will be able to support higher leverage levels than the GSK Group today, creating the opportunity on separation to reduce the leverage in the new Pharmaceuticals/Vaccines company.
Dividend expectations
GSK remains committed to its current dividend policy and confirms it continues to expect to pay 80 pence per share in dividends for 2018. Recognising the significance of this proposed transaction and the importance of dividends to shareholders, the company is today confirming that it expects to pay dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019.
Going forward, the proposed transaction enhances prospects for the Consumer Healthcare business and supports the development of GSK’s Pharmaceuticals business. With expected improvements in both businesses, GSK expects to be well positioned to deliver returns to shareholders alongside continued investment in its strategic priorities.
Emma Walmsley, Chief Executive Officer, GSK, said:
“Eighteen months ago, I set out clear priorities and a capital allocation framework for GSK to improve our long-term competitive performance and to strengthen our ability to bring new breakthrough medicines and better healthcare products to people around the world. We have improved our operating performance and have set out a new approach to R&D. We have also started to reshape the Group’s portfolio through prioritisation of R&D programmes, acquisitions such as that proposed with the oncology biopharmaceutical company, TESARO, the minority buy-out of the consumer healthcare business and a series of non-core product divestments.
“The transaction we have announced today is a unique opportunity to accelerate this work. Through the combination of GSK and Pfizer’s consumer healthcare businesses we will create substantial further value for shareholders. At the same time, incremental cashflows and visibility of the intended separation will help support GSK’s future capital planning and further investment in our pharmaceuticals pipeline.
“With our future intention to separate, the transaction also presents a clear pathway forward for GSK to create a new global Pharmaceuticals/Vaccines company, with an R&D approach focused on science related to the immune system, use of genetics and advanced technologies, and a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare company.
“Ultimately, our goal is to create two exceptional, UK-based global companies, with appropriate capital structures, that are each well positioned to deliver improving returns to shareholders and significant benefits to patients and consumers.”
Approvals and closing
The proposed transaction is subject to approval by GSK shareholders and conditional upon the receipt of certain anti-trust authority approvals. Subject to these approvals, the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2019. The Board intends to recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the proposed transaction.

Principal terms and conditions of the Transaction
New Joint Venture
GSK and Pfizer have today entered into an agreement under which, upon closing of the proposed transaction, Pfizer will contribute its consumer healthcare business to GSK’s existing consumer healthcare business in return for equity shares in this business. As a result, a new Joint Venture will be created in which GSK will have a controlling 68% equity interest and Pfizer a 32% equity interest.
GSK and Pfizer have provided customary and broadly reciprocal representations, warranties and indemnities to each other in respect of their respective businesses that will be included in the Joint Venture, which are subject to customary limitations of liability.
Combined 2017 global sales for the Joint Venture were approximately £9.8 billion ($12.7 billion)[2]. The Joint Venture will be a category leader in Pain Relief, Respiratory, Vitamin and Mineral Supplements, Digestive Health, OTC Skin Health and Therapeutic Oral Health and will have the largest global market share in OTC at 7.3% ahead of its nearest competitor at 4.1%. The Joint Venture is expected to have number 1 or 2 market share positions in all key geographies, including the US, Western, Central and Eastern Europe, China, India and Australasia.
The Joint Venture will operate under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name in all territories where GSK and Pfizer have a presence, with the exception of GSK’s interest in its listed subsidiary in Nigeria which will be excluded from the Joint Venture. The assets within the scope of, and the proceeds of, GSK’s proposed divestment of Horlicks and other Consumer Healthcare nutrition products to Unilever will not be included in the Joint Venture.
Until separation, the Joint Venture will be consolidated in GSK’s financial statements and is not expected to carry any external debt.
Governance and leadership
The Joint Venture will be subject to a shareholders’ agreement between GSK and Pfizer, under which GSK will have 6 directors and Pfizer 3 directors on the board of the joint venture company. GSK will have control of the joint venture company through the board, while Pfizer will enjoy customary minority shareholder protections.
Emma Walmsley will be Chair of the new Joint Venture until separation. Brian McNamara, currently CEO GSK Consumer Healthcare, will be CEO of the new Joint Venture and Tobias Hestler, currently CFO GSK Consumer Healthcare will be CFO.
Separation rights
As stated above the proposed transaction is transformational to the scale of GSK’s consumer healthcare business and following substantial completion of the integration and further progress in strengthening the pharmaceuticals pipeline, GSK intends to separate the Joint Venture from GSK via a demerger of its equity interest to GSK shareholders and a listing of the GSK Consumer Healthcare business on the UK equity market. This is expected to be within 3 years of the closing of the transaction.
GSK will have the sole right to decide whether and when to initiate a separation and listing for a period of five years from closing of the proposed transaction. GSK has also retained the right to sell all or part of its stake in the Joint Venture in a contemporaneous IPO. In the event of the separation and listing occurring in this period, Pfizer has the option to participate through the demerger of its equity interest in the Joint Venture to its shareholders or the sale of its equity interest in a contemporaneous IPO. After the fifth anniversary of closing of the proposed transaction, both GSK and Pfizer will have the right to decide whether and when to initiate a separation and listing of the Joint Venture.
In circumstances where Pfizer initiates a separation and listing of the Joint Venture after the fifth anniversary of closing of the proposed transaction, GSK will have the right to acquire all (but not part) of Pfizer’s equity interest in the Joint Venture at fair market value. In addition, from the fifteenth anniversary of closing of the proposed transaction, GSK will have the right to acquire all (but not part) of Pfizer’s equity interest in the Joint Venture at fair market value.
As a part of any separation and listing, the Joint Venture will incur borrowings so as to result in an initial ratio of net debt to the aggregate of the Joint Venture’s last four quarters’ Adjusted EBITDA of between 3.5x and 4.0x. The cash proceeds of this recapitalisation will be distributed by the Joint Venture to GSK and Pfizer in proportion to their respective interests in the Joint Venture prior to any separation and listing.
In the event of any separation and listing, GSK also has the right to determine the Joint Venture’s prospective dividend policy provided the pay-out ratio is between 30% and 50% of the aggregate of the Joint Venture’s last four quarters’ Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders.
Conditions to closing
Pfizer is treated as a related party of GSK for the purposes of the UK Listing Rules by virtue of its interest in ViiV Healthcare and, as such, the proposed transaction is conditional upon the approval of GSK’s shareholders at a general meeting. GSK has agreed that its Board will recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolution approving the Proposed Transaction, subject to provisions that allow the recommendation to be withdrawn on account of fiduciary duties. The proposed transaction is also conditional on there being no governmental orders restraining or prohibiting the transaction and certain anti-trust authority approvals.
Expected timetable to closing
A circular setting out further details on the proposed transaction, including the resolution seeking shareholder approval, will be sent to GSK shareholders in the first quarter of 2019. Closing of the proposed transaction is currently expected to occur during the second half of 2019, subject to shareholder approval and relevant anti-trust approvals.
Break fee
GSK has agreed to pay a break fee of US$900 million if (i) the Board changes, withdraws or qualifies its recommendation; (ii) shareholders vote on the proposed transaction and do not approve it; or (iii) shareholders do not approve the proposed transaction by 30 September 2019 (or, at either GSK’s or Pfizer’s option, 31 December 2019 or 31 March 2020 in the case of delayed anti-trust approvals).
By virtue of Pfizer being a related party of GSK under the UK Listing Rules, the break fee constitutes a smaller related party transaction within LR11.1.10R of the UK Listing Rules. GSK has obtained written confirmation from Citi and J. P. Morgan Cazenove that the terms of the break fee are fair and reasonable so far as GSK’s shareholders are concerned.
Advisors
GSK has been advised by Citi, who has been acting as lead advisor, J. P. Morgan Cazenove and Greenhill & Co. Slaughter and May and Kirkland & Ellis LLP have provided legal advice.
Advice to the Board
The Board, which has been so advised by Citi and J. P. Morgan Cazenove, considers the terms of the proposed transaction to be fair and reasonable so far as shareholders are concerned. In providing their advice to the Board, Citi and J. P. Morgan Cazenove have taken into account the Board’s commercial assessment of the proposed transaction.

Sources of information and bases of calculation
Unless otherwise stated, the financial information in this announcement relating to GSK’s contributed consumer healthcare business is based on the audited consolidated financial statements of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings Limited for the year ended 31 December 2017 (from which Novartis was bought out in June 2018), which were prepared under IFRS, adjusted for the perimeter changes that GSK will make to the business contributed to the new Joint Venture, and that relating to Pfizer’s contributed consumer healthcare business is extracted from carve out accounts prepared by Pfizer under US GAAP, adjusted to exclude certain items that were allocated to the business by Pfizer in preparing those accounts but which are not within the perimeter of the business being contributed to the new Joint Venture. Figures in respect of the combined sales of the new Joint Venture have been calculated by aggregating the 2017 sales of GSK’s consumer healthcare business, prepared under IFRS, and the 2017 sales of Pfizer’s consumer healthcare business, prepared under US GAAP; no reconciliation from US GAAP to IFRS has been performed. Conversions use an exchange rate of £1=US$1.30, being the average exchange rate for 2017.

 The study resulted in meeting al 1EPs with safe and effective results
 Isatuximab is used for targeting CD38, involved in apoptosis and immunomodulatory activity, has received ODD from the US FDA & EU for r/r multiple myeloma and is evaluated in other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors","Study evaluated the benefit of isatuximab in combination with standard of care
in prolonging progression free survival as compared to standard of care in
patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
* First randomized Phase 3 trial to evaluate the benefit of adding a monoclonal
antibody to pomalidomide and dexamethasone for treatment of
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
* Multiple ongoing Phase 3 studies with isatuximab, an investigational agent, in
combination with standard of care therapies in newly diagnosed and
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
PARIS – February 5, 2019 – The pivotal Phase 3 trial of isatuximab in patients with
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma met the primary endpoint of prolonging progression
free survival in patients treated with isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and lowdose dexamethasone versus pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone (standard
of care).
Results will be submitted to an upcoming medical meeting and are anticipated to form the
basis of regulatory submissions planned for later this year.
“We are excited by these results, which represent significant progress in our
ambition to extend the lives of multiple myeloma patients,” said John Reed, Head
of Research and Development at Sanofi. “We look forward to engaging with
regulatory authorities with the goal of bringing this potential new treatment to
patients as quickly as possible.”
Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy1, with more than
138,0002 new cases worldwide each year. Multiple myeloma remains incurable in the vast
majority of patients, resulting in significant disease burden.
The randomized, multi-center, open label Phase 3 study, known as ICARIA-MM, enrolled
307 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma across 96 centers spanning 24
countries. All study participants received two or more prior anti-myeloma therapies,
including at least two consecutive cycles of lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor given
alone or in combination. During the trial, isatuximab was administered through an
intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks, then every other
week for 28-day cycles in combination with standard doses of pomalidomide and
dexamethasone for the duration of treatment. The safety profile was evaluated as a
secondary endpoint.
About isatuximab clinical development program
Isatuximab targets a specific epitope of CD38 capable of triggering multiple, distinct
mechanisms of action that are believed to promote programmed tumor cell death
(apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on
multiple myeloma cells and is a cell surface receptor target for antibody-based therapeutics
in multiple myeloma and other malignancies. The clinical significance of these findings is
under investigation.
ICARIA-MM is one of four ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating isatuximab in
combination with currently available standard treatments for people with
relapsed/refractory or newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Isatuximab received orphan designation for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Isatuximab is an
investigational agent and the safety and efficacy has not been evaluated by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, or any other regulatory
authority. Isatuximab is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic
malignancies and solid tumors

RETACRIT ®IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
What is the most important information I should know about RETACRIT?
RETACRIT may cause serious side effects that can lead to death, including:
For people with cancer:

Your tumor may grow faster and you may die sooner if you choose to take RETACRIT. Your healthcare provider will talk with you about these risks.
For all people who take RETACRIT, including people with cancer or chronic kidney disease:

Serious heart problems, such as heart attack or heart failure and stroke. You may die sooner if you are treated with RETACRIT to increase red blood cells (RBCs) to near the same level found in healthy people.
Blood clots. Blood clots may happen at any time while taking RETACRIT. If you are receiving RETACRIT for any reason and you are going to have surgery, talk to your healthcare provider about whether or not you need to take a blood thinner to lessen the chance of blood clots during or following surgery. Blood clots can form in blood vessels (veins), especially in your leg (deep venous thrombosis or DVT). Pieces of a blood clot may travel to the lungs and block the blood circulation in the lungs (pulmonary embolus).
Call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms:
Chest pain
Trouble breathing or shortness of breath
Pain in your legs, with or without swelling
A cool or pale arm or leg
Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or trouble understanding others’ speech
Sudden numbness or weakness in your face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of your body
Sudden trouble seeing
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
Loss of consciousness (fainting)
Hemodialysis vascular access stops working
See “What are the possible side effects of RETACRIT?” below for more information.
If you decide to take RETACRIT, your healthcare provider should prescribe the smallest dose of RETACRIT that is necessary to reduce your chance of needing RBC transfusions.
What is RETACRIT?
RETACRIT is a prescription medicine used to treat anemia. People with anemia have a lower-than normal number of RBCs. RETACRIT works like the human protein called erythropoietin to help your body make more RBCs. RETACRIT is used to reduce or avoid the need for RBC transfusions.
RETACRIT may be used to treat anemia if it is caused by:

Chronic kidney disease (you may or may not be on dialysis).
Chemotherapy that will be used for at least two months after starting RETACRIT.
A medicine called zidovudine (AZT) used to treat HIV infection.
RETACRIT may also be used to reduce the chance you will need RBC transfusions if you are scheduled for certain surgeries where a lot of blood loss is expected.
If your hemoglobin level stays too high or if your hemoglobin goes up too quickly, this may lead to serious health problems which may result in death. These serious health problems may happen if you take RETACRIT, even if you do not have an increase in your hemoglobin level.
RETACRIT has not been proven to improve quality of life, fatigue, or well-being.
RETACRIT should not be used for treatment of anemia:

If you have cancer and you will not be receiving chemotherapy that may cause anemia.
If you have a cancer that has a high chance of being cured. Talk with your healthcare provider about the kind of cancer you have.
If your anemia caused by chemotherapy treatment can be managed by RBC transfusion.
In place of emergency treatment for anemia (RBC transfusions).
RETACRIT should not be used to reduce the chance of RBC transfusions if:

You are scheduled for surgery on your heart or blood vessels.
You are able and willing to donate blood prior to surgery.
It is not known if RETACRIT is safe and effective in treating anemia in children less than 1 month old who have chronic kidney disease and in children less than 5 years old who have anemia caused by chemotherapy.
Who should not take RETACRIT?
Do not take RETACRIT if you:

Have cancer and have not been counseled by your healthcare provider about treatment with RETACRIT.
Have high blood pressure that is not controlled (uncontrolled hypertension).
Have been told by your healthcare provider that you have or have ever had a type of anemia called Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) that starts after treatment with RETACRIT or other erythropoietin protein medicines.
Have had a serious allergic reaction to RETACRIT or other epoetin alfa products.
Before taking RETACRIT, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

Have heart disease.
Have high blood pressure.
Have had a seizure (convulsion) or stroke.
Have phenylketonuria. RETACRIT contains phenylalanine (a component of aspartame).
Receive dialysis treatment
Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if RETACRIT may harm your unborn baby. Talk to your healthcare provider about possible pregnancy and birth control choices that are right for you.
Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if RETACRIT passes into breast milk.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
How should I take RETACRIT?

If you or your caregiver has been trained to give RETACRIT shots (injections) at home:
Be sure that you read, understand, and follow the “Instructions for Use” that come with RETACRIT.
Take RETACRIT exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to. Do not change the dose of RETACRIT unless told to do so by your healthcare provider.
Your healthcare provider will show you how much RETACRIT to use, how to inject it, how often it should be injected, and how to safely throw away the used vials, syringes, and needles.
If you miss a dose of RETACRIT, call your healthcare provider right away and ask what to do.
If you take more than the prescribed dose of RETACRIT, call your healthcare provider right away.
During treatment with RETACRIT, continue to follow your healthcare provider’s instructions for die and medicines.
Have your blood pressure checked as instructed by your healthcare provider.
What are the possible side effects of RETACRIT?
RETACRIT may cause serious side effects, including:

See “What is the most important information I should know about RETACRIT?”
High blood pressure. High blood pressure is a common side effect of RETACRIT in people with chronic kidney disease. Your blood pressure may go up or be difficult to control with blood pressure medicine while taking RETACRIT. This can happen even if you have never had high blood pressure before. Your healthcare provider should check your blood pressure often. If your blood pressure does go up, your healthcare provider may prescribe new or more blood pressure medicine.
Seizures. If you have any seizures while taking RETACRIT, get medical help right away and tell your healthcare provider.
Antibodies to RETACRIT. Your body may make antibodies to RETACRIT. These antibodies can block or lessen your body’s ability to make RBCs and cause you to have severe anemia. Call your healthcare provider if you have unusual tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness, or fainting. You may need to stop taking RETACRIT.
Serious allergic reactions. Serious allergic reactions can cause a skin rash, itching, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness and fainting because of a drop in blood pressure, swelling around your mouth or eyes, fast pulse, or sweating. If you have a serious allergic reaction, stop using RETACRIT and call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away.
Severe skin reactions. Signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions with RETACRIT may include: skin rash with itching, blisters, skin sores, peeling, or areas of skin coming off. If you have any signs or symptoms of a severe skin reaction, stop using RETACRIT and call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away.

How will I receive NIVESTYM?

NIVESTYM injections can be given by a healthcare provider by intravenous (IV) infusion or under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Your healthcare provider may decide that subcutaneous injections can be given at home by you or your caregiver. If NIVESTYM is given at home, see the detailed “Instructions for Use” that comes with your NIVESTYM prescription for information on how to prepare and inject a dose of NIVESTYM.
You and your caregiver should be shown how to prepare and inject NIVESTYM, before you use it, by your healthcare provider.
Your healthcare provider will tell you how much NIVESTYM to inject and when to inject it. Do not change your dose or stop NIVESTYM unless your healthcare provider tells you to.
If you are receiving NIVESTYM because you are also receiving chemotherapy, your dose of NIVESTYM should be injected at least 24 hours before or 24 hours after your dose of chemotherapy.
If you miss a dose of NIVESTYM, talk to your healthcare provider about when you should give your next dose.
What are the most common side effects of NIVESTYM?

The most common side effects of NIVESTYM include aching in the bones and muscles.
What are possible side effects of NIVESTYM?
NIVESTYM may cause serious side effects including:

Spleen rupture. Your spleen may become enlarged and can rupture. A ruptured spleen can cause death.
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a serious lung problem.
Serious allergic reactions. These can occur anywhere in your body. If you have an allergic reaction, stop using NIVESTYM.
Sickle cell crises. Serious sickle cell crises have happened in people with sickle cell disorders receiving NIVESTYM that have sometimes led to death.
Kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). NIVESTYM can cause kidney injury.
Capillary Leak Syndrome. NIVESTYM can cause fluid to leak from blood vessels into your body’s tissues. This condition is called “Capillary Leak Syndrome” (CLS). CLS can quickly cause you to have symptoms that may become life-threatening.
Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with NIVESTYM. Tell your healthcare provider if you have unusual bleeding or bruising during treatment with NIVESTYM. This could be a sign of decreased platelet counts, which may reduce the ability of your blood to clot.
Increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with NIVESTYM.
Inflammation of your blood vessels (cutaneous vasculitis). Tell your healthcare provider if you develop purple spots or redness of your skin.
Call your healthcare provider or seek emergency medical help right away if you have:

pain in the left upper stomach area or left shoulder
symptoms of sickle cell crisis such as pain or trouble breathing
shortness of breath, with or without a fever, any trouble breathing, wheezing or a fast rate of breathing
a rash over your whole body, swelling around your mouth or eyes, fast heart rate and sweating
swelling or puffiness, especially swelling of your stomach-area and feeling of fullness
swelling of your face and ankles
blood in your urine or dark colored urine
less than usual urination
dizziness or are feeling faint
a general feeling of tiredness
These are not all the possible side effects of NIVESTYM. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.

Important Safety Information and Boxed Warnings
 

WARNING: CARDIOMYOPATHY, INFUSION REACTIONS, EMBRYO‑FETAL TOXICITY, AND PULMONARY TOXICITY 
Cardiomyopathy – Administration of trastuzumab products can result in sub-clinical and clinical cardiac failure. The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving trastuzumab with anthracycline‑containing chemotherapy regimens.
 
Evaluate left ventricular function in all patients prior to and during treatment with HERZUMA. Discontinue HERZUMA treatment in patients receiving adjuvant therapy and withhold HERZUMA in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function.
 
Infusion Reactions; Pulmonary Toxicity – Administration of trastuzumab products can result in serious and fatal infusion reactions and pulmonary toxicity. Symptoms usually occur during or within 24 hours of HERZUMA administration. Interrupt HERZUMA infusion for dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension. Monitor patients until symptoms completely resolve. Discontinue HERZUMA for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
 
Embryo Fetal Toxicity – Exposure to trastuzumab products during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.
 
Cardiomyopathy

Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death. Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
There is a 4–6-fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline.
Withhold HERZUMA for ≥ 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and ≥ 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. The safety of continuation or resumption of HERZUMA in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied.
Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping HERZUMA may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction.
Cardiac Monitoring

Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended:
Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of HERZUMA.
LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of HERZUMA.
Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if HERZUMA is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction.
LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of HERZUMA as a component of adjuvant therapy.
Infusion Reactions

Infusion reactions consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and chills, and on occasion included nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, rash, and asthenia.
In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction.
Interrupt HERZUMA infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions.
There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre‑medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death.
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of HERZUMA. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to HERZUMA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of HERZUMA.
Pulmonary Toxicity

Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non‑cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions.
Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity.
Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia

In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not.
Adverse Reactions

Adjuvant Breast Cancer – Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, and chills.
Metastatic Breast Cancer- Most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) are fever, chills, headache, infection, congestive heart failure, insomnia, cough, and rash.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., — Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Allergan plc. (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for MVASI® (biosimilar bevacizumab). MVASI is the first biosimilar bevacizumab approved by the EC and is approved for the treatment of certain types of cancers, including in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum; in combination with paclitaxel for metastatic breast cancer; in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); in combination with erlotinib for unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC; in combination with interferon alfa-2a for advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer; in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, carboplatin and gemcitabine, and paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin for advanced, platinum-sensitive, or platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; and in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin, or alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix.
“The European Commission’s approval of MVASI marks a significant milestone for both Amgen and the oncology community, providing a biosimilar for a medicine which is used across multiple types of cancer,” said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “MVASI is the first targeted cancer biosimilar from Amgen’s portfolio approved in Europe, underscoring our commitment to delivering high-quality medicines that address some of the most serious illnesses.”
Amgen and Allergan are committed to developing high-quality biosimilars with a robust analytic and clinical package. The EC approved MVASI based on a comprehensive data package that demonstrated MVASI and bevacizumab are highly similar, with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between the products. Clinical studies included results from a Phase 3 trial in patients with non-squamous NSCLC.
“MVASI is the first product from our collaboration with Amgen to receive marketing authorization from the European Commission, highlighting the success of our joint commitment to developing cancer biosimilars,” said David Nicholson, chief research and development officer at Allergan. “We look forward to our continued work with Amgen and to providing important medicines to patients in the future.”
Approval from the EC grants a centralized marketing authorization with unified labeling in the 28 countries that are members of the European Union (EU). Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as members of the European Economic Area, will take corresponding decisions on the basis of the decision of the EC.
In September 2017, MVASI became the first anti-cancer biosimilar, as well as the first biosimilar bevacizumab, to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Amgen and Allergan are collaborating on the development and commercialization of four oncology biosimilars. Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its portfolio, two of which have been approved by the EC.
About MVASI® (biosimilar bevacizumab) in the EU
MVASI is a biosimilar to bevacizumab, a recombinant immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibits the interaction of VEGF with its receptors, VEGF receptor-1 and VEGF receptor-2, thus inhibiting establishment of new blood vessels necessary for the maintenance and growth of solid tumors.
MVASI, in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, is indicated for treatment of adult patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum.

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.
Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’s research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between it and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key manufacturing facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’s efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies Amgen has acquired may not be successful. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all. Amgen is increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Amgen’s stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock.
Allergan plc Forward-Looking Statements
Statements contained in this press release that refer to future events or other non-historical facts are forward-looking statements that reflect Allergan’s current perspective on existing trends and information as of the date of this release. Actual results may differ materially from Allergan’s current expectations depending upon a number of factors affecting Allergan’s business. These factors include, among others, the difficulty of predicting the timing or outcome of FDA approvals or actions, if any; the impact of competitive products and pricing; market acceptance of and continued demand for Allergan’s products; the impact of uncertainty around timing of generic entry related to key products, including RESTASIS®, on our financial results; uncertainty associated with financial projections, projected cost reductions, projected synergies, restructurings, increased costs, and adverse tax consequences; difficulties or delays in manufacturing; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in Allergan’s periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to Allergan’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Allergan’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2017.

 The study resulted in a non-inferiority data demonstrating efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, PD and PK in patients
 Herzuma (trastuzumab biosimilar, CT-P6) is a mAb, that binds to extracellular domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) and is currently reviewed by FDA review in the USS","Herzuma (CT-P6) granted EU marketing authorisation to treat early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer
WEDNESDAY Celltrion Healthcare today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Herzuma (trastuzumab biosimilar, CT-P6) for all indications of reference trastuzumab in the European Union (EU). The approval of Herzuma marks the third Celltrion Healthcare product approved in the EU and builds on the company’s expanding biosimilar portfolio.
Man Hoon Kim, President and CEO of Celltrion Healthcare, said, “We are delighted to receive marketing authorisation of Herzuma as we are now able to offer two biosimilar monoclonal antibodies in oncology following the launch of Truxima (biosimilar rituximab) in 2017. This means with the help of our partners across Europe, we can persevere with our aim of ensuring these important biologic treatments are made available to the millions of patients who can benefit from them.”
 
The EC decision allows the marketing of Herzuma in all 28 EU member states and the European Economic Area for the treatment of people with early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer, or metastatic gastric cancer whose tumours have either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification.
 
The approval follows a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in December and is based on the totality of evidence submitted. The supporting data showed that Herzuma® and reference trastuzumab were highly similar in terms of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK). [1], [2]
 
Celltrion Healthcare also held their annual Partner Summit in Venice earlier this month where 26 of their European partners gathered to discuss local market launches for Herzuma following its successful approval. Richard Trollope, Head of Biosimilars, Mundipharma speaking at the event, said, “There is an increasing number of European national healthcare systems that are challenged by the high cost burden of oncology treatments. Subsequently, the approval of Herzuma will be greatly welcomed, as it provides a high-quality treatment alternative for patients, while offering significant potential savings and headroom for other oncology treatments.”

Notes to editors:
 
About CT-P6 (biosimilar trastuzumab)
CT-P6 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) – a protein designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure or antigen in the body. CT-P6 has been designed to bind with high affinity and specificity to the extracellular domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2).
 
HER2 is found to be overexpressed and/or amplified in about 15-20% of patients with the diseases for which reference trastuzumab is indicated. By binding to HER2 receptor binding domains on the tumor cells, trastuzumab inhibits proliferation of HER2 overexpressing tumour cells.
 
Celltrion has carried out extensive studies between CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab to establish that they are highly similar in physicochemical and biological attributes. Studies have also demonstrated comparability in terms of efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety.
 
Herzuma is a biosimilar to Herceptin[3], a biologic drug developed by Genentech and marketed by Roche. Herceptin is a blockbuster drug which had worldwide sales of CHF 6.8 billion (US$6.8billion) in 2016, of which CHF 2.1 billion (US$2.1 billion) was in European sales. [4]
 
CT-P6 is also currently under review by the FDA but not yet an approved product in the U.S.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Allergan plc. (NYSE:AGN) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of ABP 980, a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab). ABP 980 has been recommended for approval for the treatment of the same three types of cancer as Herceptin is approved for in the European Union (EU), including HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-positive early breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.
“The positive opinion issued by the CHMP for ABP 980 marks an important step for our biosimilar portfolio, as it’s our second oncology biosimilar to reach this important milestone, and further underscores our commitment to providing the oncology community access to high-quality cancer therapies,” said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “We look forward to continuing our work with Allergan and European regulatory authorities to bring additional options to patients with cancer.”
The Marketing Authorization Application for ABP 980 was supported by analytical, pharmacokinetic and clinical data, as well as pharmacology and toxicology data. The Phase 3 comparative efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study was conducted in adult female patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.
“We are committed to providing patients with important medicines to help them fight cancer,” said David Nicholson, chief research and development officer at Allergan. “The CHMP’s positive opinion for the marketing authorization of ABP 980 reinforces its potential to increase physician choice and patient access to an important biologic.”
The CHMP positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines for the EU. If approved, a centralized marketing authorization will be granted that will be valid in the 28 countries that are members of the EU. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as members of the European Economic Area (EEA), will take corresponding decisions on the basis of the EC’s decision.
Amgen and Allergan are collaborating on the development and commercialization of four oncology biosimilars. Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its portfolio, two of which have been approved by the EC.
About ABP 980
ABP 980 is being developed as a biosimilar to trastuzumab, a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 kappa antibody approved in many regions for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing early breast cancer, adjuvant breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. The active ingredient of ABP 980 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that has the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab. ABP 980 has the same pharmaceutical dosage form and same strength after reconstitution as trastuzumab. Amgen and Allergan also submitted a Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ABP 980 in 2017.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.
Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’s research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between it and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key manufacturing facilities and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’s efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies Amgen has acquired may not be successful. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all. Amgen is increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Amgen’s stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock.

Statements contained in this press release that refer to future events or other non-historical facts are forward-looking statements that reflect Allergan’s current perspective on existing trends and information as of the date of this release. Actual results may differ materially from Allergan’s current expectations depending upon a number of factors affecting Allergan’s business. These factors include, among others, the difficulty of predicting the timing or outcome of FDA approvals or actions, if any; the impact of competitive products and pricing; market acceptance of and continued demand for Allergan’s products; the impact of uncertainty around timing of generic entry related to key products, including RESTASIS®, on our financial results; uncertainty associated with financial projections, projected cost reductions, projected synergies, restructurings, increased costs, and adverse tax consequences; difficulties or delays in manufacturing; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in Allergan’s periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to Allergan’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Allergan’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2017.
