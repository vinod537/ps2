Optional digital companion with sensor and app that provide inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data to better support therapeutic decisions also covered by EC approval
Approval based on robust efficacy and safety data from the Phase III IRIDIUM study, in which once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler was superior to once-daily Atectura® Breezhaler® (IND/MF) in improving the lung function of patients whose asthma is uncontrolled with LABA/ICS standard-of-care treatment2
Asthma affects an estimated 358 million people worldwide and can cause a significant personal, health and financial burden when not adequately controlled3,4
Basel, July 7, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Enerzair® Breezhaler® (QVM149; indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate [IND/GLY/MF]) as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long‑acting beta2‑agonist (LABA) and a high-dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. Once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler is the first LABA/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/ICS fixed-dose combination available in the EU for these patients. The approval also includes an optional digital companion with sensor and app that provides inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data to better support therapeutic decisions. The EC decision is applicable to all 27 European Union member states as well as the UK, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

“Novartis is working to reimagine medicine for people with uncontrolled asthma, who find it a challenge to achieve effective symptom and exacerbation control,” said Rod Wooten, Head of Global Marketing, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “The approval of Enerzair Breezhaler with sensor and app in the EU is an example of our commitment to utilize data and digital offerings to make asthma control an achievable goal for patients and physicians.”

Enerzair Breezhaler is provided in a transparent capsule that allows patients to see that they have taken their medication and will be administered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device, which enables once-daily inhalation using a single inhaler. The digital companion includes a sensor that attaches to the Breezhaler device and can be linked to the Propeller Health smartphone app, providing patients with inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data that can be shared with their physician in order to help them make better therapeutic decisions.

“Today, over 45% of asthma patients at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled, demonstrating the need for new treatments, delivery approaches and patient support to ensure that medication is taken correctly and treatment goals are reached,” said Professor David Price, Chair of Primary Care Respiratory Medicine, University of Aberdeen. “Once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler plus a digital companion could help to facilitate greater collaborative disease management between physicians and patients in the EU whose asthma remains uncontrolled, despite LABA/ICS treatment.”

The EC approval is based on robust efficacy and safety data from over 3,000 asthma patients in the Phase III IRIDIUM study, in which once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler was superior to once-daily Atectura® Breezhaler® (QMF149; IND/MF) in improving the lung function of patients whose asthma is uncontrolled with LABA/ICS standard-of-care treatment2. In the IRIDIUM study, the key secondary endpoint was improvement in the Asthma Control Questionnaire score (ACQ-7) for Enerzair Breezhaler versus Atectura Breezhaler2. Both treatments delivered clinically meaningful improvements in this measure of symptoms from baseline at Week 26, but the key secondary endpoint was not met2. Among other secondary analyses, IRIDIUM explored asthma exacerbation rates, where statistically significant reductions were observed in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates with Enerzair Breezhaler compared with an established LABA/ICS standard-of-care (twice-daily salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate [Sal/Flu])2. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of the monocomponents2.

Once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler has been approved in Japan and Canada. Once-daily Atectura Breezhaler has been approved in the EU as a maintenance treatment of asthma for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older not adequately controlled with ICS and inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA)5, and in Canada and Japan. Further regulatory reviews for Enerzair Breezhaler and Atectura Breezhaler are currently underway in multiple countries including Switzerland.

In keeping with the Novartis commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our asthma combinations, Enerzair Breezhaler and Atectura Breezhaler will both be available in the hydrofluoroalkane/chlorofluorocarbon (HFA/CFC)-free Breezhaler device. Novartis aims to drive sustainability and has set ambitious targets to minimize its impact on climate, waste and water, including targets to become carbon neutral in company operations by 2025.

About Uncontrolled Asthma
Asthma affects an estimated 358 million people worldwide and can cause a significant personal, health and financial burden when not adequately controlled3,4. Despite current therapy, over 40% of patients with asthma at Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 3, and over 45% at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled6,7. Patients with uncontrolled asthma may downplay or underestimate the severity of their disease and are at a higher risk of exacerbation, hospitalization or death8-10. Barriers, such as less than optimal adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, treatment mismatch, safety issues with oral corticosteroids and ineligibility for biologics, have created an unmet medical need in asthma11-14.

*About Enerzair Breezhaler (IND/GLY/MF) in the EU
The EC approved high-dose Enerzair Breezhaler (IND/GLY/MF) 150/50/160 μg once-daily as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long‑acting beta2‑agonist (LABA) and a high-dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year1. This formulation combines the bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA) and glycopyrronium bromide (a LAMA) with mometasone furoate (ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler device. Glycopyrronium bromide certain use and formulation intellectual property were exclusively licensed to Novartis in April 2005 by Sosei Heptares and Vectura. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in IND/GLY/MF (worldwide excluding the US).

Novartis developed the optional digital companion in collaboration with Propeller Health, which includes the Propeller Health app and sensor custom-built for the Breezhaler device. The sensor is a CE marked Medical Device, designed and licensed to Novartis for use with the Breezhaler inhaler worldwide. The sensor includes a microchip, a microphone, Bluetooth capabilities, an antenna and a battery. The sensor does not alter the drug delivery characteristics of the Breezhaler inhaler itself but produces a recording of each administered dose. Based on the patient’s recorded medication usage, personalized content is presented within the app to help the patient better self-manage their asthma.

About the PLATINUM Clinical Development Program
The PLATINUM program, having enrolled over 7,500 patients worldwide, is the Novartis Phase III/IIIb clinical development program supporting the development of Enerzair Breezhaler (IND/GLY/MF) and Atectura Breezhaler (IND/MF). It includes four studies: the QUARTZ study, which compared a low-dose of Atectura Breezhaler with MF alone; the PALLADIUM study, which compared Atectura Breezhaler with MF and salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu); the IRIDIUM study, which compared Enerzair Breezhaler with Atectura Breezhaler and Sal/Flu; and the ARGON study, which compared Enerzair Breezhaler with a free combination of Sal/Flu plus tiotropium (Tio).

About the IRIDIUM study2
IRIDIUM was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Enerzair Breezhaler (IND/GLY/MF) with Atectura Breezhaler (IND/MF) in patients with asthma.

The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of Enerzair Breezhaler (high: 150/50/160 μg and medium:150/50/80 μg), versus two corresponding Atectura Breezhaler doses (high: 150/320 μg and medium: 150/160 μg) in patients with uncontrolled asthma, as determined by pulmonary function testing and effects on asthma control.

All patients were required to be symptomatic at screening and to have one or more exacerbations in the previous year, despite being on treatment with medium or high stable doses of LABA/ICS. Approximately 3,092 male and female adult patients with asthma were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 (approximately 618 patients in each of the treatment groups) to receive either:

Enerzair Breezhaler 150/50/80 μg (once-daily)
Enerzair Breezhaler 150/50/160 μg (once-daily)
Atectura Breezhaler 150/160 μg (once-daily)
Atectura Breezhaler 150/320 μg (once-daily)
Sal/Flu 50/500 μg (twice-daily)
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate superiority of both high-dose Enerzair Breezhaler versus high-dose Atectura Breezhaler and medium-dose Enerzair Breezhaler versus medium-dose Atectura Breezhaler, all delivered once-daily, in improving trough FEV1 (volume of air that can be forced out in the first second of expiration approximately 24 hours post-administration of study drug) after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.

The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of both doses of Enerzair Breezhaler versus respective doses of Atectura Breezhaler, in improving Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma. Other secondary analyses also included reduction of exacerbation rate, comparing high-dose Enerzair Breezhaler with high-dose Atectura Breezhaler and medium-dose Enerzair Breezhaler with medium-dose Atectura Breezhaler. Secondary analyses included efficacy comparisons for both doses of Enerzair Breezhaler compared with Sal/Flu (50/500 μg).

36257,Daiichi Reports EMA's Validation of MAA and Accelerated Assessment for Trastuzumab Deruxtecan to Treat HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer,EMA Validates and Grants Accelerated Assessment for Trastuzumab Deruxtecan for the Treatment of HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer,"The MAA validation is based on P-II DESTINY-Breast01 trial assessing Trastuzumab Deruxtecan as a monothx in patients with 2L+ HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer and the results were published in the NEJM
 The EMA’s CHMP validation provides the application is complete and commences the scientific review process while CHMP’s accelerated assessment is granted to products with public health interests and therapeutic innovation further leading reduction in approval timelines
 Trastuzumab deruxtecan (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a HER2 directed ADC developed using Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC technology approved in the US and Japan also received the US FDA’s BT designation for 2L+ HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma","Tokyo and Munich – (July 6, 2020) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for trastuzumab deruxtecan, a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens. Trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted accelerated assessment by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

 

Validation confirms that the application is complete and commences the scientific review process by the EMA’s CHMP. Accelerated assessment is granted by the CHMP to products expected to be of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation and can significantly reduce the review timelines.

 

“The accelerated assessment highlights the significant unmet need for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer that trastuzumab deruxtecan aims at addressing,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Trastuzumab deruxtecan is already available for patients in the U.S. and Japan, and we look forward to working with the EMA to bring this important new medicine to patients in the EU as quickly as possible.”

 

The MAA is based on the positive results from the pivotal phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who had received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens. The results of the DESTINY-Breast01 trial are published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

 

About HER2

HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[1]

 

About HER2 Positive Breast Cancer

Approximately one in five breast cancers are HER2 positive.[2],[3] Despite recent improvements and approvals of new medicines, there remain significant clinical needs for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.[4],[5] This disease remains incurable with patients eventually progressing after available treatment.5

 

About Trastuzumab Deruxtecan

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.

 

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.

 

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial.

 

Trastuzumab deruxtecan has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the U.S., for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications.

 

About the Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program

A comprehensive development program for trastuzumab deruxtecan is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy across multiple HER2 cancers including breast, gastric, and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.

 

In May 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab, and Orphan Drug Designation for gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer. In March 2018, trastuzumab deruxtecan received a SAKIGAKE designation for potential use in the same HER2positive patient population and a supplemental New Drug Application was submitted to the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for approval in April 2020.

 

In May 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan also received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.

 

About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca

In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize trastuzumab deruxtecan worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.

36292,Regeneron Signs an Agreement with BARDA and the US Department of Defense for REGN-COV2 Worth $450M,REGENERON ANNOUNCES MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT FOR BARDA AND U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR REGN-COV2 ANTI-VIRAL ANTIBODY COCKTAIL,"Regeneron and the US Government signed $450M contract for the supply of REGN-COV2 which is currently in two P-II/III clinical trials for the treatment and in a P-III trial for the prevention of COVID-19
 The collaboration supports continued manufacturing so that the product could be made available immediately in the US if the FDA grants EUA or approval to the therapy. Regeneron will ramp up manufacturing to produce up to 1.6M doses of the cocktail with initial doses to be ready as early as the end of summer
 Regeneron is evaluating multiple dosages for REGN-COV2 and covers between 70,000 -300,000 treatment doses and 420,000 to 1.3M preventive doses. Regeneron will provide bulk, as well as finished doses of cocktail by the end of 2020","TARRYTOWN, N.Y., July 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that, as part of Operation Warp Speed, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense have awarded Regeneron a $450 million contract to manufacture and supply REGN-COV2. REGN-COV2 is Regeneron’s investigational double antibody cocktail that is currently in two Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and in a Phase 3 trial for the prevention of COVID-19 infection.

Regeneron began scaling up manufacturing of REGN-COV2 at business risk in spring of 2020. This agreement supports continued manufacturing so that the product could be made available immediately in the United States if clinical trials are successful and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or product approval. The agreement covers a fixed number of bulk lots that are intended to be completed in the fall of 2020, as well as fill/finish and storage activities. The ongoing REGN-COV2 clinical program is evaluating multiple dosages and will help establish the exact number of potential treatment doses (estimated range of 70,000 to 300,000) or prevention doses (estimated range of 420,000 to 1,300,000) available from these lots in total. Initial doses may be ready as early as end of summer. If EUA or product approval is granted, the government has committed to making doses from these lots available to the American people at no cost and would be responsible for their distribution.

“Regeneron’s thirty years of investment in our innovative VelociSuite® antibody discovery and development technologies and our large-scale manufacturing facilities, coupled with the expertise and passion of our people, has enabled us to move the REGN-COV2 program forward at remarkable speed,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. “We made the decision early on to begin large-scale manufacturing at our own risk in order to ensure that product would be available immediately if our clinical trials prove successful and an Emergency Use Authorization is granted. This manufacturing and supply agreement with BARDA and the Department of Defense could help REGN-COV2 reach many people quickly, hopefully helping to change the course of this deadly and still-raging pandemic.”

Regeneron continues to work to maximize manufacturing capacity of REGN-COV2 within Regeneron and with potential partners.

About REGN-COV2
Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s proprietary VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. They selected the two most potent, non-competing and virus-neutralizing antibodies to create REGN-COV2 and have scaled up this dual-antibody cocktail with the company’s in-house VelociMab® and manufacturing capabilities. REGN-COV2’s two antibodies bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in recent Science publications. More recent research also demonstrates coverage against the now prevalent D614G variant.

Regeneron used the same ‘rapid response’ capabilities and cocktail approach to develop REGN-EB3, a novel triple antibody treatment for Ebola that is now under regulatory review by the FDA. REGN-COV2’s development and manufacturing has been funded in part with federal funds from the BARDA under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

The companies aim to complete the development and make it available in H1’21 and expect to manufacture ~100M doses by the end of 2021","For media and investors only

Issued:London, UK and Quebec city

• Collaboration combines innovative plant-based and adjuvant technologies to develop and produce a COVID-19 candidate vaccine.

• Phase 1 clinical testing scheduled to begin mid-July

• Collaboration to explore vaccine development opportunities for other infectious diseases

GSK and Medicago today announced a collaboration to develop and evaluate a COVID-19 candidate vaccine combining Medicago’s recombinant Coronavirus Virus-Like Particles (CoVLP) with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system. CoVLPs mimic the structure of the virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, allowing them to be recognised by the immune system. Use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic situation as it may boost the immune response and reduce the amount of antigen required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protect more people.

Pre-clinical results with Medicago’s CoVLP vaccine candidate demonstrated a high level of neutralizing antibodies following a single dose when administered with adjuvant.

Phase 1 clinical testing is planned to start in mid-July and will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three different dose levels of antigen combined with GSKs pandemic adjuvant and in parallel with an adjuvant from another company, administered on a one- and two-dose vaccination schedule, given 21 days apart.

Subject to successful clinical development and regulatory considerations, the companies aim to complete development and make the vaccine available, in the first half of 2021. Both companies will also evaluate expanding their collaboration to develop a post-pandemic vaccine COVID-19 candidate, should the need arise based on the further development of COVID-19 after the pandemic, and other infectious diseases.

The companies will use Medicago’s plant-based production platform to manufacture the COVID-19 vaccine antigen. This innovative technology uses the leaves of a plant as bioreactors to produce the S-spike protein which self-assemble into VLPs for use in the CoVLP vaccine candidate. It is highly scalable and can support the production of large amounts of vaccine in a significantly shortened timeline. Using this technology combined with GSKs proprietary adjuvant system, the companies expect to be able to manufacture approximately 100m doses by the end of 2021. By the end of 2023, a large-scale facility under construction in Quebec City, Canada, is expected to deliver up to 1 billion doses annually. The manufacturing platform has been used to produce a seasonal VLP flu vaccine and the license application is under review with the Canadian regulatory authority.

Dr Thomas Breuer, Chief Medical Officer, GSK Vaccines, said: “This agreement paves the way for an innovative vaccine option combining a scalable plant-based antigen technology with an adjuvant which has pandemic dose sparing capability. If successful, it will be a meaningful contributor in the fight against COVID-19. We strongly believe that multiple vaccines are needed, including post-pandemic vaccines. This plant-based technology also shows promise beyond COVID-19 and has the potential to help prevent other infectious diseases.”

Dr Bruce Clark, President and CEO of Medicago, said: “We are about to begin clinical trials with our CoVLP vaccine candidate harnessing GSKs pandemic adjuvant technology against the virus that causes COVID-19. This collaboration with GSK gives us access to a proven adjuvant which could enhance the effectiveness of our candidate vaccine, and also to a depth of scientific experience to support our development efforts.”

GSK and Medicago have entered into a binding agreement to develop and manufacture an adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine. Medicago is a privately held company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (MTPC) and Philip Morris International (PMI), with a shareholding ratio of 67:33, respectively. PMI has signalled that it is willing to evaluate offers for its shareholding from parties that may be better suited to help Medicago on the next phase of its journey and has initiated preliminary review to determine the optimal shareholding and governance structure for Medicago’s future success.

36319,Angion Commences P-II Study of ANG-3777 in Patients with Acute Lung Injury Associated with COVID-19 Pneumonia in Brazil,Angion Initiates Phase 2 Clinical Trial of ANG-3777 in Patients with Acute Lung Injury Associated with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"The P-II POC study assess safety and efficacy of ANG-3777 (2.0 mg/kg, IV) + SOC vs PBO + SOC in ~100 patients in a ratio (1:1) hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia with 1EPs as the proportion of patients alive, without the need for mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy (on an ongoing basis) @28day
 Following the success of the P-II study, the company plans to submit an IND for the therapy in the US. Additionally, Angion is conducting a P-III study of ANG-3777 to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of transplant-associated AKI in patients showing evidence of early kidney dysfunction and in a P-II clinical trial for the treatment of AKI associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass
 ANG-3777 is designed to mimic the biological activity of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which activates the c-Met cascade of pathways involved in tissue repair and organ repair","SAN FRANCISCO, July 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Angion Biomedica Corp. (Angion), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases, announced it has initiated in Brazil a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of ANG-3777 plus standard of care in patients with acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 pneumonia.

“Given the potential of ANG-3777 to broadly address acute organ injury, we believe it is important to investigate its ability to mitigate or prevent acute lung injury in patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia,” commented John Neylan, M.D., Angion’s Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. “We are commencing this study in Brazil, which continues to be tremendously impacted by COVID-19 and where we are conducting another clinical trial of ANG-3777 in patients with acute kidney injury involving cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.”

The Phase 2 trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess safety and efficacy of ANG-3777 in patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The primary endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients alive, without the need for mechanical ventilation and free of the need for renal replacement therapy (on an ongoing basis) at day 28. Angion expects to enroll approximately 100 patients in the trial. Patients will be randomized at a ratio of one-to-one to receive four intravenous doses of 2.0 mg/kg of ANG-3777 plus standard of care versus placebo plus standard of care. This ANG-3777 dosing regimen was previously approved for investigational use in Brazil, allowing for a quicker initiation of this trial for a population in need. If the Phase 2 trial is successful in patients with acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, we intend to submit an investigational new drug application (IND) in the United States

“While anti-viral therapies are most welcome in our effort to help patients with COVID-19, front-line physicians need additional tools to address the acute lung injury often seen in these patients,” commented Gregory P. Downey, MD, a pulmonologist at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado and a member of Angion’s Scientific Advisory Board. “I’m hopeful data from this trial will show ANG-3777 can be another tool to help address the needs of patients impacted by this pandemic.”

The clinical rationale for this Phase 2 clinical trial of ANG-3777 in patients with acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 pneumonia is rooted in the compelling activity ANG-3777 has shown in several preclinical in vivo models of acute lung injury such as radiation-induced lung injury, chlorine (Cl2)-induced acute lung injury, bleomycin-induced pulmonary edema, TGFβ1-induced mortality and lung fibrosis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock, and lung ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Following the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of ANG-3777, Angion is currently conducting a Phase 3 registration trial of ANG-3777 to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of transplant-associated acute kidney injury, also known as delayed graft function, in patients showing evidence of early kidney dysfunction and in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass.

Additional details on the Phase 2 clinical trial can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT #04459676)

About ANG-3777
ANG-3777 is a small molecule designed to mimic the biological activity of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which activates the c-Met cascade of pathways involved in tissue repair and organ repair. ANG-3777 has a substantially longer half-life than HGF and we believe ANG-3777 has the potential to be a first-in-class therapeutic addressing acute organ injury. The ongoing clinical trials of ANG-3777 include a placebo-controlled Phase 3 registration trial in transplant-associated acute kidney injury, also known as delayed graft function, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, and a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 pneumonia.

About Angion Biomedica Corp.
Angion Biomedica Corp. is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases. Angion’s lead product candidate, ANG-3777, is a small molecule designed to mimic the biological activity of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which activates the HGF/c-Met pathway, which has a central role in tissue repair and organ recovery. ANG-3777 is currently in clinical trials investigating its impact on acute organ injury, including two forms of acute kidney injury and in acute lung injury. Angion is also developing ANG-3070, an orally-bioavailable small molecule, as a potential treatment for fibrotic diseases using a precision-medicine approach.

TRIDENT-1 Phase 2 Registrational Study of Repotrectinib to Open Additional Sites in Greater China

SAN DIEGO and SHANGHAI, July 07, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TPTX), a precision oncology company developing next-generation therapies that target genetic drivers of cancer, and Zai Lab (NASDAQ: ZLAB), an innovative commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of Turning Point’s lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, in Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

Under the terms of the agreement, Zai Lab will obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize repotrectinib in Greater China and Turning Point Therapeutics will receive a $25 million upfront payment, with potential to receive up to an additional $151 million in development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments. Turning Point will also be eligible to receive mid-to-high teen royalties based on annual net sales of repotrectinib in Greater China.

“With more than 700,000 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients every year in Greater China, and the development and commercialization capabilities Zai Lab have shown over time in the region, we view Zai Lab as the ideal partner to help expand the potential reach of repotrectinib,” said Athena Countouriotis, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Turning Point Therapeutics. “Our collaboration with Zai Lab is a strategic step to potentially accelerate the development of repotrectinib in Greater China.”

Zai Lab anticipates opening additional sites for the TRIDENT-1 Phase 2 registrational clinical study of repotrectinib. The ongoing study is currently active in 11 countries globally and enrolling patients with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and NTRK-positive solid tumors.

“We are very pleased to enter into this agreement with Turning Point Therapeutics. Repotrectinib is highly synergistic with Zai’s existing pipeline and further strengthens our disease area strongholds across most common tumor types in China, particularly in lung cancer. We are looking forward to bringing this potential best-in-class agent in the front-line setting and for patients previously treated with an approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) where there are no approved targeted therapies,” said Samantha Du, Ph.D., Founder, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of Zai Lab.

“In China, there is only one approved targeted therapy for patients with advanced ROS1-positive lung cancer and despite its efficacy, most patients eventually acquire resistance,” said Dr. Lu Shun, Director of Chinese Lung Cancer Association. “The unmet need in the ROS1-positive lung cancer patient population is significant. The preliminary clinical activity and safety data generated to date for repotrectinib represent a promising clinical profile. If approved, repotrectinib has the potential to be the standard of care for ROS1-positive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in China.”

About Repotrectinib
Repotrectinib is an investigational next-generation TKI designed to effectively target ROS1 and TRK A/B/C with potential to treat TKI-naïve or -pretreated patients. ROS1 rearrangement is estimated to be an oncogenic driver in approximately 2 to 3 percent of patients with advanced NSCLC in China, and NTRK is estimated to be an oncogenic driver in approximately 0.5 percent of patients with other advanced solid tumors in China.

Utilizing a 22 July 2019 data cut-off, data from the Phase 1 portion of TRIDENT-1 demonstrated the potential for repotrectinib to be best-in-class for the treatment of ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC in patients who were not previously treated with a TKI, with a 91 percent overall response rate by blinded independent central review, a median duration of response of 23.1 months, a median progression-free survival of 24.6 months, and a generally well-tolerated adverse-event profile.

36334,AstraZeneca and MSD's Lynparza (olaparib) Receives EC's Approval for BRCA-Mutated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,Lynparza approved in the EU for BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer,"The EC’s approval is based on P-III POLO study assessing Lynparza (300mg, bid) as maintenance monothx. vs PBO in 154 patients in a ratio (3:2) with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed on 1L platinum-based CT
 The study demonstrated that Lynparza nearly doubled the lifespan of patients without disease progression or death (7.4 vs 3.8 mos.). The safety and tolerability profile of Lynparza in the study was consistent with previous trials
 The approval follows CHMP’s recommendation granted on Jun 01, 2020. Lynparza is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor acts by targeting DDR in cells/tumors harboring a deficiency in HRR (BRCA1& 2 mutation)and is approved in the US & other countries as a 1L maintenance treatment for patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer","Only PARP inhibitor approved in this disease
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that Lynparza (olaparib) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for patients with germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is a rare, life-threatening disease with the lowest survival rate among the most common cancers.1 Approximately 5-7% of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer have a germline BRCA mutation.2

The approval by the European Commission was based on results from the Phase III POLO trial, which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. It follows the recommendation for approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency.

Hedy L. Kindler, Co-Principal Investigator of the POLO trial and Professor of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, said: “Today’s approval opens the door to a new era of biomarker-led care for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in the EU, which has the highest incidence of any region globally. Lynparza now provides clinicians with a targeted, well-tolerated treatment option for patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer historically have faced poor outcomes due to the aggressive nature of the disease and few treatment advances have been made over the last few decades. In the POLO trial, Lynparza nearly doubled median progression-free survival versus placebo after 1st-line chemotherapy for patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. This approval underscores the importance of testing all patients for germline BRCA mutations at the time of diagnosis, as it will help inform personalised treatment options for patients in the EU.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “MSD and AstraZeneca are committed to advancing research into the treatment of patients with challenging types of cancer, including those with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is now the only approved PARP inhibitor in biomarker-selected patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. We look forward to making this targeted treatment option available for patients across the EU as quickly as possible.”

The POLO trial demonstrated that Lynparza nearly doubled the time patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death to a median of 7.4 months versus 3.8 months on placebo. The safety and tolerability profile of Lynparza in the trial was consistent with previous trials.

Lynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations who have metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and have not progressed after a minimum of 16 weeks of platinum treatment within a 1st-line chemotherapy regimen.

Lynparza is approved in the US and several other countries as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the Phase III POLO trial, with ongoing regulatory reviews in other regions.

Pancreatic cancer

Pancreatic cancer is a deadly cancer with a high unmet medical need. Globally, pancreatic cancer is the 11th-most commonly occurring cancer and the seventh leading cause of cancer death.3,4 There were approximately 460,000 new cases worldwide in 2018.1 As there are often no symptoms, or symptoms may be non-specific in the early stages, it is most commonly diagnosed at an incurable stage.5,6

Around 80% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed when the disease has metastasised, at which point average survival is less than a year.7 Despite advances, few improvements have been made in diagnosis and treatment in the past few decades.8 Current treatment is surgery (for which approximately only 10-20% of patients are eligible), chemotherapy and radiotherapy, highlighting a critical unmet medical need for more effective treatment options.9

POLO

POLO is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase III trial of Lynparza tablets (300mg twice daily) as maintenance monotherapy versus placebo. The trial randomised 154 patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed on 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomised (3:2) to receive Lynparza or placebo until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and key secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to second disease progression, overall response rate and health-related quality of life.

BRCA mutations

BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role in maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.

Lynparza

Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for patients with homologous recombination deficiency positive advanced ovarian cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for gBRCAm, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is also approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US for homologous recombination repair gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in several regions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.

The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo (selumetinib), a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investment that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.

The target is one of Foghorn’s growing number of programs emerging from the company’s product platform focused on chromatin dysregulation. The chromatin system regulates which genes a cell expresses and when it expresses them. Dysregulation of the chromatin system is implicated in up to half of all cancers.

Under the collaboration agreement, Foghorn will grant Merck exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize drugs that target dysregulation of a single transcription factor. Under the terms of the agreement, Foghorn will receive an upfront payment and research milestones and will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestones potentially totaling up to $425 million as well as royalties on sales of any approved product from the collaboration.

“We’re excited to partner with Merck given their world-renowned capabilities in cancer research and development,” said Adrian Gottschalk, president and chief executive officer of Foghorn. “Our ability to systematically drug transcription factors using our proprietary product platform opens vast potential to discover and develop novel cancer treatments.”

“There is broad evidence for the role of dysregulated transcription factors in multiple cancer types, but these have been difficult targets to drug,” said Dr. Nick Haining, vice president, Discovery Oncology & Immunology, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to working with Foghorn and applying their platform to identify novel candidates to drug transcription factors in cancer.”

About the Chromatin Regulatory System

The chromatin regulatory system regulates gene expression by directing the movement of molecules that turn genes on and off. Disease dependencies associated with the chromatin regulatory system are estimated to impact over 2.5 million cancer patients across the United States, Europe and Japan. This system is further implicated in neurological, autoimmune, and other serious diseases.

About Foghorn Therapeutics

Foghorn® Therapeutics is discovering and developing a novel class of precision medicine therapeutics targeting the chromatin regulatory system in oncology. Through its scalable Gene Traffic Control™ product platform, Foghorn is systematically interrogating and drugging the chromatin regulatory system. The Company, currently in pre-clinical stage, is advancing over 10 small molecule and protein degrader programs across a wide range of cancers. The company expects to file an IND for its first program later this year.

Foghorn, a Flagship Pioneering® company, was founded in 2016 by Cigall Kadoch, Ph.D., Gerald Crabtree, M.D., and Doug Cole, M.D., of Flagship Pioneering. Learn more about Foghorn at www.foghorntx.com.

Additionally, Biogen is working with multiple regulatory authorities to submit BLA including the EU and Japan","If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment with the potential to meaningfully change the course of Alzheimer’s disease
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and TOKYO, July 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) today announced that Biogen has completed the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the approval of aducanumab, an investigational treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The completed submission followed ongoing collaboration with the FDA and includes clinical data from the Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE studies, as well as the Phase 1b PRIME study. As part of the completed submission, Biogen has requested Priority Review. If approved, aducanumab would become the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer’s disease and would also be the first therapy to demonstrate that removing amyloid beta resulted in better clinical outcomes.

“Alzheimer’s disease remains one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. It robs memories, independence and eventually the ability to perform basic tasks from the people we love,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “The aducanumab BLA is the first filing for FDA approval of a treatment that addresses the clinical decline associated with this devastating condition, as well as the pathology of the disease. We are committed to driving progress for the Alzheimer’s disease community and look forward to the FDA’s review of our filing.”

“People living with Alzheimer’s, their families, caregivers and so many others in the community are fighting this disease every day, and the global social burden of the disease is expected to grow as the population ages,” said Dr. Haruo Naito, Chief Executive Officer at Eisai Co., Ltd. “The BLA submission is an important step in the fight against this disease, for which pathophysiological progression currently cannot be stopped, delayed or prevented.”

The aducanumab clinical development program included two Phase 3 trials, EMERGE and ENGAGE, in patients with early stage Alzheimer’s disease (enrolled patients had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 24-30). In EMERGE, patients who received aducanumab experienced significant slowing of decline on measures of cognition and function such as memory, orientation and language. Patients also experienced slowing of decline on activities of daily living including conducting personal finances, performing household chores, such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry, and independently traveling out of the home.

EMERGE (n=1,638) met its pre-specified primary endpoint, with patients treated with high dose aducanumab showing a statistically significant reduction of clinical decline from baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores at 78 weeks (22% versus placebo, P=0.01). In EMERGE, patients treated with high dose aducanumab also showed a consistent reduction of clinical decline as measured by the pre-specified secondary endpoints: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 18% versus placebo, P=0.05), the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 Items (ADAS-Cog 13; 27% versus placebo, P=0.01) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory Mild Cognitive Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-MCI; 40% versus placebo, P=0.001). Imaging of amyloid plaque deposition in EMERGE demonstrated that amyloid plaque burden was reduced with low and high dose aducanumab compared to placebo at 26 and 78 weeks (P<0.001). While ENGAGE (n=1,647) did not meet its primary endpoint, Biogen believes a subset of data from ENGAGE are supportive of the outcome in EMERGE.

The aducanumab clinical program also included the Phase 1b PRIME study and its long-term extension (LTE) in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (enrolled patients had prodromal Alzheimer’s disease or mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia with MMSE scores of 20-30). The results of this study indicated that aducanumab reduced amyloid beta plaque in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, and analyses of exploratory clinical endpoints showed a reduction of clinical decline (CDR-SB and MMSE, nominally statistically significant for the 10 mg/kg dose at 12 months), which continued out to 48 months in the LTE.

“For many people living with the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, maintaining independence for as long as possible is the ultimate goal,” said Stephen Salloway, M.D., M.S., Director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program at Brown University. “If we can help slow the progression from one stage to the next, this could preserve independence, which, in turn, could have truly meaningful benefits for people living with the disease and their loved ones. Aducanumab represents a potential breakthrough that we hope will provide a treatment foothold in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease.”

The completion of the BLA submission followed a planned pre-BLA meeting with the FDA. The FDA now has up to 60 days to decide whether to accept the application for review, at which point, if accepted, Biogen expects the FDA will also inform the Company whether the BLA has been granted Priority Review designation. The BLA will then be subject to review by the FDA to make a determination on the potential approval of aducanumab.

In addition to submitting the BLA to the FDA, Biogen has continued to engage in dialogue with regulatory authorities in other markets, including Europe and Japan, working diligently toward the goal of submitting applications in these markets.

About Aducanumab

Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational human monoclonal antibody studied for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Based on clinical data, aducanumab has the potential to impact underlying disease pathophysiology, slow cognitive and functional decline and provide benefits on patients’ ability to perform activities of daily living, including conducting personal finances, performing household chores, such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry, and independently traveling out of the home. If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment to meaningfully change the course of the disease for individuals living with Alzheimer’s.

Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative development and license agreement. Since October 2017 Biogen and Eisai have collaborated on the development and commercialization of aducanumab globally.

EMERGE and ENGAGE were Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab. The primary objective of the studies was to evaluate the efficacy of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared with placebo in reducing cognitive and functional impairment as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared to placebo on clinical decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 Items (ADAS-Cog 13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory Mild Cognitive Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-MCI).

About Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that impairs thinking, memory and independence, leading to premature death. The disease currently cannot be stopped, delayed or prevented and is a growing global health crisis, affecting those living with the disease and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tens of millions of people worldwide live with Alzheimer’s disease, and the number will grow in the years ahead, outpacing the healthcare resources needed to manage it and costing billions of dollars.

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by changes in the brain, including the abnormal accumulation of toxic amyloid beta plaque, which begins approximately 20 years before patients exhibit symptoms of the disease. Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease is one of the earliest stages of the disease when symptoms start to be more visible and can be detected and diagnosed. Current research efforts are focused on catching and treating patients as early as possible for the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

36380,AstraZeneca's Brilinta (ticagrelor) Receives the US FDA's Priority Review for Reducing Stroke in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack,Brilinta granted FDA Priority Review for the reduction of subsequent stroke in patients who had an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack,"The US FDA has accepted sNDA and granted PR for Brilinta to reduce subsequent stroke in patients experiencing an acute ischemic stroke or TIA. The sNDA is based on P-III THALES study assessing Brilinta (90mg, bid, for 30 days) + aspirin vs aspirin as monothx. in 11,000 patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA
 The study resulted in a reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death while the safety is consistent with the known profile of the therapy. The anticipated PDUFA date is in Q4’20
 Brilinta (ticagrelor) is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist acts by inhibiting platelet activation. The therapy when co-administered with aspirin prevents atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS, or for patients with a history of MI and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event","Brilinta in combination with aspirin could be the first FDA-approved dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the rate of stroke in these high-risk patients
AstraZeneca today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and granted Priority Review for Brilinta (ticagrelor) for the reduction of subsequent stroke in patients who experienced an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for this supplemental application, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2020.

The sNDA was based on results from the Phase III THALES trial, which showed aspirin plus Brilinta 90mg used twice daily for 30 days resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death, compared to aspirin alone.1 The results were in line with the known safety profile of Brilinta.1

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Patients who have had an acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at high risk of experiencing a subsequent stroke, which may be disabling or fatal. Today’s Priority Review reflects Brilinta’s potential as a much-needed treatment option to reduce the rate of subsequent stroke for these patients and we look forward to working with the FDA to make Brilinta available as soon as possible.”

The data from the THALES trial will be published in a peer reviewed journal and presented at an forthcoming medical congress.

Brilinta is approved in more than 110 countries for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in more than 70 countries for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among high-risk patients who have experienced a heart attack. In May 2020, the FDA approved a label update for Brilinta in the US to include the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

Stroke

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with 6.2 million stroke-related deaths in 2017, of which 2.7 million were due to ischaemic stroke.2 Patients who experience an acute ischaemic stroke or TIA are at high risk of developing subsequent ischaemic events, with particularly high risk within 30 days after the initial event and the highest risk period being the first 24 hours after the initial event.3

THALES

THALES is an AstraZeneca sponsored, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, international, multicentre, event-driven trial involving more than 11,000 patients from 28 countries. It tested the hypothesis whether aspirin plus Brilinta is superior to aspirin alone in preventing the composite of stroke and death in patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA. Patients were randomised within 24 hours of onset of acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA symptoms and followed-up for 30 days of treatment. Trial treatments were Brilinta 180mg loading dose on day 1 as soon as possible after randomisation, followed by 90mg twice daily on days 2-30, or matching placebo. All patients received open-label aspirin 300-325mg on day 1, followed by 75-100mg once daily on days 2-30. The primary efficacy outcome was the time to the composite endpoint of stroke and death at 30 days. The primary safety outcome is time to first severe bleeding event according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definition, which includes fatal bleedings, intracranial haemorrhage; and bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention. Patients were followed for an additional 30 days on standard of care.

Brilinta

Brilinta (ticagrelor) is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. Brilinta, together with aspirin, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death), in patients with ACS or a history of myocardial infarction (MI, heart attack).

Brilinta, co-administered with aspirin, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS, or for patients with a history of MI and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.

36386,The European Commission Signs an Agreement with Roche and Merck to Supply their COVID-19 Therapies in EU,"EU secures potential COVID-19 drugs from Roche, Germany’s Merck – source","The EC has signed an agreement to supply Roche’s RoActemra and Merck’s Rebif in 27 EU member states willing to buy the therapies to combat the pandemic. The agreement follows requests from EU states in May to acquire the two drugs having the potential to target COVID-19
 In a discussion with EC, Roche has committed to meet the need for eligible patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia in the EU & across the globe in an equitable and sustainable manner. On Jul 08, 2020, EC asked Merck to be prepared to supply Rebif in EU states
 Roche is evaluating RoActemra in 330 COVID -19 patients and also assessing it in combination with Gilead’s Remdesivir while Rebif was developed by Serono before Merck acquired the company","BRUSSELS (Reuters) – The European Commission has struck deals with drugmakers Roche and Merck KGaA to secure supplies of experimental treatments for COVID-19, a Commission source told Reuters on Wednesday.

The deals cover Roche’s arthritis drug RoActemra and Merck’s multiple sclerosis drug Rebif – both seen as potential COVID-19 therapies – and will secure supplies for any of the 27 European Union member states wanting to buy them, the source said.

The deals follow requests from EU states in May to acquire the two drugs and come as governments around the world jostle for access to potential COVID-19 therapies and vaccines, even before their efficacy is proven.

The source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic, did not disclose the terms of the deals.

Later on Wednesday, Merck said it had been asked by the Commission to be prepared to supply Rebif to EU states “upon request if and when the indication for COVID-19 treatment is adjudicated.”

Roche also confirmed talks with the EU.

“In ongoing discussions with the European Commission, Roche has committed to meeting the supply needs for eligible patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia in the EU, and around the globe, in an equitable and sustainable manner,” the Swiss company said in a statement.

A Commission spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.

Roche is doing a late-stage, 330-patient trial of RoActemra, known as Actemra in some markets, in COVID-19 patents after the anti-inflammatory drug used against rheumatoid arthritis was deployed in China in patients suffering from a severe immune system reaction. Roche said it would share data as soon as possible.

The medicine is also being tested on COVID-19 patients in combination with Gilead’s antiviral remdesivir, the only drug so far authorised by the EU for use against COVID-19. Patients are still being recruited, Roche said.

in early June, an Italian trial of Actemra in patients with early-stage COVID-19 showed it failed to help them.

Rebif was developed by Swiss biotech firm Serono before Merck bought the company.

Both drugs target proteins in the body associated with inflammation, and there is some hope they may help severely ill COVID-19 patients suffering from a so-called cytokine storm, an immune system reaction that in can lead to organ failure.

The companies said in letters to the Commission that they could meet demand from EU countries, the source said, declining to name the EU states that had expressed interest in the drugs.

EU countries will now have to agree with the companies on the supplies needed, the source added.

Brussels is also in talks with Gilead to obtain doses of remdesivir for member states and boost its production capacity. It also wants to reserve supplies of vaccines being developed by Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi.

In June, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands said they had secured 400 million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed by Britain’s AstraZeneca.

Concerns over remdesivir’s availability were ignited after Gilead pledged almost all its output to the United States.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/roche-7.jpg,Biotech|COVID-19,Merck | Roche,RoActemra | Remdesivir | Rebif,COVID-19 | Biotech | Agreement| Therapies | EU | European Commission | Signs | Supply,publish,7/9/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/eu-secures-potential-covid-19-drugs-from-roche-germanys-merck-source/,https://pharmashots.com/36386/the-european-commission-signs-an-agreement-with-roche-and-merck-to-supply-their-covid-19-therapies-in-eu/

Additionally, the company has an option to develop and commercialize the two programs in the US while retaining global rights to its IRAK4 program in oncology indications.
 Sanofi will get a global right to develop and commercialize protein degrader therapies targeting IRAK4 in patients with immune-inflammatory diseases and a second undisclosed preclinical program
 Kymera will advance the IRAK4 program through the P-I study, afterward, Sanofi will be further responsible for its development and will lead all clinical development activities for the second program. IRAK4 is a key protein involved in inflammation mediated by the activation of TLRs and IL-1Rs","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Kymera Therapeutics Inc. today announced the company has entered into a multi-program strategic collaboration with Sanofi (NASDAQ: SNY) to develop and commercialize first-in-class protein degrader therapies targeting IRAK4 in patients with immune-inflammatory diseases. The companies will also partner on a second earlier stage program. Kymera will receive $150 million in cash upfront and may receive more than $2 billion in potential development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as significant royalty payments. Kymera retains the option to participate in US development and commercialization for both programs. This includes the ability to participate equally in the costs, profits and losses after opt-in, and to co-promote partnered products in the US.

“This is an important collaboration for both companies and for the field of targeted protein degradation,” said Nello Mainolfi, Ph.D., co-founder, President and CEO of Kymera Therapeutics. “Kymera is becoming a fully integrated biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of novel therapies with the potential to transform treatment paradigms. We are excited to partner with Sanofi, an organization with world-class drug development and commercialization capabilities, to ensure maximal patient impact from two of our programs across multiple disease indications, while enabling Kymera to invest in key strategic areas to realize the broad potential of protein degrader therapies.”

Under terms of the collaboration, Sanofi will make an upfront payment of $150 million in cash to Kymera for global rights to develop its small molecule IRAK4 protein degraders in inflammation and immunology indications, and a second earlier stage undisclosed program. IRAK4 is believed to play a key role in multiple immune-inflammatory diseases, including hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Kymera will advance the IRAK4 program through Phase 1 clinical trials; Sanofi will assume clinical development and commercialization responsibilities thereafter. Sanofi will lead all clinical development activities for the second program. Kymera will have the option to participate in the development of both programs in the US during clinical development. Kymera will retain global rights to its IRAK4 program in oncology indications.

IRAK4 is a key protein involved in inflammation mediated by the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). While TLR and IL-1R signaling via IRAK4 is involved in the normal immune response, aberrant activation of these pathways is the underlying cause of multiple immune-inflammatory conditions. In pre-clinical studies, Kymera has shown oral daily administration of an IRAK4 degrader can lead to complete knockdown of IRAK4 in skin and immune cells in higher species and is well tolerated. Data presented at the most recent annual meetings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation showed potent anti-inflammatory activity in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models.

“Targeted protein degradation is an exciting modality. Kymera has developed an incredible drug discovery engine producing protein degraders with compelling and differentiated pharmacology against targets that, to date, have not been optimally addressed with other therapeutic modalities,” said John Reed, Global Head of Research & Development at Sanofi. “We are excited to partner with the Kymera team to advance a new generation of first-in-class therapies with the potential to eliminate underlying drivers of disease.”

Aquilo Partners, L.P. acted as financial advisor to Kymera on this transaction.

The FIDELIO-DKD study is part of the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date in CKD, which enrolled 13,000 patients across a broad range of disease severity, including those with early kidney damage and more advanced stages of kidney disease. FIDELIO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, event-driven Phase III study investigating finerenone versus placebo in patients with CKD and T2D. The study included approximately 5,700 patients from more than 1,000 sites across 48 countries worldwide. Patients were randomized to receive either finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily or placebo when added to standard of care, including blood glucose lowering therapies and maximum tolerated dose of renin–angiotensin system (RAS)-blocking therapy, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).

There has been a recent uptick of both federal initiatives and public-private partnerships encouraging innovation to improve kidney health in America. In 2019, the United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services announced Advancing American Kidney Health, an executive order focused on improving the prevention, detection and treatment of kidney disease.3

About Finerenone

Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is an investigational, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that has been shown to reduce the harmful effects of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation.4 Mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation is a major driver of kidney and heart damage.

The finerenone Phase III clinical program is comprised of two studies which randomized more than 13,000 patients with CKD and T2D from around the world to evaluate the effect of finerenone versus placebo on top of standard of care on both renal and CV outcomes. FIDELIO-DKD (FInerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease) investigated the efficacy and safety of finerenone in comparison to placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of kidney failure and kidney disease progression in approximately 5,700 patients with CKD and T2D. The study has met its primary efficacy endpoint. FIGARO-DKD (FInerenone in reducinG cArdiovascular moRtality and mOrbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease) is still ongoing and is investigating the efficacy and safety of finerenone versus placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of CV morbidity and mortality in approximately 7,400 patients with CKD and T2D across 48 countries including sites in Europe, Japan, China and the U.S. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Fast Track designation for finerenone.

Bayer also recently announced the initiation of the FINEARTS-HF study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study which will investigate finerenone compared to placebo in more than 5,500 symptomatic heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 40 percent. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of finerenone over placebo in reducing the rate of the composite endpoint of CV death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) events (defined as hospitalizations for HF or urgent HF visits).

About Chronic Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes

Chronic kidney disease is one of the most frequent complications arising from diabetes and is also an independent risk factor of CV.5 Approximately 40 percent of all patients with T2D develop CKD.2 Chronic kidney disease in T2D is the main cause of end stage kidney disease and kidney failure and at advanced stages, patients may need dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive.6,7 Over a 10-year period, patients with CKD in T2D were three times more likely to die of CV-related causes than patients with T2D alone.8 Mineralocorticoid receptor over-activation is known to trigger detrimental processes (e.g., inflammation and fibrosis) in the kidneys and heart in patients with CKD and T2D.9 Chronic kidney disease in T2D is the most common cause of kidney failure worldwide.10

 The BioSticker is a single-use, FDA-cleared 510k class II wearable medical device that enables at-home passive monitoring with minute level data across a broad set of vital signs, physiological biometrics and symptomatic events (skin temperature, resting heart rate, resting respiratory rate, body position, activity levels, cough frequency) on a single device 30days","Philips integrates the BioIntelliSense FDA-cleared BioSticker™ sensor as part of its remote patient monitoring solutions for patients outside the hospital
Multi-parameter sensors aid monitoring across multiple chronic conditions with medical-grade vital signs for physicians to remotely track core symptoms, including COVID-19 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands – Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, today announced it has formed a strategic collaboration with BioIntelliSense, a continuous health monitoring and clinical intelligence company, to integrate its BioSticker™ medical device into Philips’ remote patient monitoring (RPM) offering to help monitor at-risk patients from the hospital into the home. With the addition of multi-parameter sensors, Philips’ solutions can enhance how clinicians monitor patient populations living with chronic conditions – including diabetes, cancer, congestive heart failure and more – in their homes with passive monitoring of key vital signs, physiological biometrics and symptomatic events via a discreet wearable patch for monitoring up to 30 days. 

 

Remote patient monitoring and telehealth-enabled clinical programs offer care teams a sustainable and scalable way to manage patient populations with chronic or complex conditions at home, and plays a key role in supporting care for COVID-19 patients who do not require hospitalization. By regularly transmitting patient data that can provide critical insights into a patient’s condition, the collaboration will empower care teams in the U.S. with a more holistic patient view and the ability to intervene earlier before adverse events occur. With single-use sensors and patient-owned technology supporting remote monitoring, care teams can also help reduce the need for clinicians and patients to interact in person. 

With more patients interacting with their doctors from home and more hospitals developing strategies to virtually engage with their patients, remote patient monitoring is now, more than ever, an essential tool.

Chief Business Leader Connected Care, member of the Executive Committee at Royal Philips

“With more patients interacting with their doctors from home and more hospitals developing strategies to virtually engage with their patients, remote patient monitoring is now, more than ever, an essential tool,” said Roy Jakobs, Chief Business Leader Connected Care, member of the Executive Committee at Royal Philips. “Building on Philips’ global leadership in patient monitoring, which includes an extensive suite of advanced monitoring solutions, platforms and sensors, this is the latest example of our capability to allow more seamless, cloud-based data collection across multiple settings from the home to the hospital and back into the home. Patient data, coupled with our clinically differentiated and leading AI-powered technology, quantifies the data into relevant actionable insights to help detect deterioration trends and support care interventions – all while outside the walls of the hospital.”
Wireless, secure data transfer of key vital signs
The BioSticker is a single-use, FDA-cleared 510k class II wearable medical device to enable at-home continuous passive monitoring with minute level data across a broad set of vital signs, physiological biometrics and symptomatic events (skin temperature, resting heart rate, resting respiratory rate, body position, activity levels, cough frequency) on a single device for thirty-days. Symptoms, including those directly associated with COVID-19 such as temperature and respiratory rate, can be remotely monitored in confirmed cases of Coronavirus and also for those patients not sick enough to be hospitalized, or those suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to COVID-19, the BioSticker device will help transform the way clinicians monitor and manage patients living with chronic conditions from the home. 

 

“Multi-parameter sensors are the natural next phase for remote monitoring, especially at a time when more patients are engaging with their physicians from home,” said James Mault, MD, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of BioIntelliSense. “Clinicians need medical grade monitoring and algorithmic clinical insights for COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and management. Accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis, the practice of medicine has been irreversibly enlightened as to the safety and efficacy of virtual care. Philips is a demonstrated leader in remote patient monitoring, and we look forward to BioIntelliSense’s technology playing an integral role in simplifying and enhancing outcomes for patients and their doctors.”

Healthcare Highways first to leverage BioSticker as a part of Philips’ RPM solutions 
Healthcare Highways, a leading provider of health plans, high performance provider networks, pharmacy benefit management, population health management, and benefit plan administration, is the first to leverage the BioSticker sensor as a part of Philips’ RPM program in the U.S. Out of the seven programs that will be deployed with Healthcare Highways, one will focus specifically on monitoring patients with COVID-19. The remaining six will focus on conditions across the acuity spectrum, including patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, total joint replacement, cancer and asthma. The program will help Healthcare Highways improve insights to patient health status across its provider network. 

 

“Healthcare Highways was built on the idea of delivering measurable value and access to quality care to our members. We work in partnership with our providers to innovate on the care model, and look at Remote Patient Monitoring as the next frontier of how providers will connect with patients,” said Creagh Milford, DO, MPH, Chief Medical Officer of Healthcare Highways and Chief Executive Officer of HighCare Health. “COVID-19 has underscored the need for proactive care management. Resources are strained and by integrating an RPM program with biosensor technology, we’ll be able to drive further value for our unique member base, providers and employers to establish a new way of care delivery.”

 

Philips’ remote patient monitoring offerings are part of the company’s broader Population Health Management portfolio, which provides a comprehensive and proactive healthcare delivery strategy to connect clinicians, providers and patients for ongoing care. By combining technology and data-driven population management with clinical expertise and a proven programmatic approach, Philips supports the delivery of telehealth services for programs in and out of the hospital to provide connected, patient-centered care across the health continuum.

July 09, 2020 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
BALLERUP, Denmark, & MADISON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–LEO Pharma A/S, a global leader in medical dermatology, today announced that the Biologics License Application (BLA) for tralokinumab for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) has been accepted for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The acceptance of the BLA is the beginning of the formal review procedure for this potential new treatment by the FDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has set a target action date in the second quarter of 2021.

Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes the interleukin-13 (IL-13) cytokine which is a key driver of the underlying inflammation in atopic dermatitis.1,2 The BLA submission is based on data from the pivotal ECZTRA 1, 2 and ECZTRA 3 Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of tralokinumab.3,4,5 The safety and efficacy of tralokinumab have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

“There is a significant unmet medical need for people whose moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis remains uncontrolled,” said Kim Kjøller, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, LEO Pharma. “If approved, tralokinumab could become the first biologic available to specifically neutralize the IL-13 cytokine and, most importantly, offer a more targeted approach for adults living with this debilitating disease. We will continue to work closely with the FDA as they review this application.”

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently accepted the marketing authorization application (MAA) for tralokinumab and regulatory review is underway by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

About tralokinumab

Tralokinumab is an investigational, fully human, immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that works by neutralizing the IL-13 cytokine.1 IL-13 plays a key role in driving the underlying chronic inflammation in AD.2,6 By specifically binding to the IL-13 cytokine with high affinity, tralokinumab prevents its interaction with the receptor and the subsequent downstream IL-13 signalling.1

About the pivotal ECZTRA 1, 2 and ECZTRA 3 Phase 3 studies

ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 (ECZema TRAlokinumab trials Nos. 1 and 2) were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, 52-week trials, which included 802 and 794 patients, respectively, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tralokinumab (300 mg subcutaneous) as monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy.3,4

ECZTRA 3 (ECZema TRAlokinumab trial No. 3) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational 32-week study, which included 380 patients, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tralokinumab (300 mg subcutaneous) in combination with topical corticosteroid (TCS) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy.5

About atopic dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory, heterogeneous skin disease characterized by intense itch and eczematous lesions.7 AD is the result of skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation, leading to chronic inflammation.8 Type-2 cytokines, including IL-13, play a central role in the key aspects of AD pathophysiology.2,6

36510,Biocon's ALZUMAb (itolizumab) Receives the DCGI's Approval for Emergency Use to Treat Patients with Moderate to Severe COVID-19,Biocon’s Breakthrough Drug Itolizumab Receives DCGI Nod for its Use in Moderate to Severe COVID-19 Patients,"The approval is based on the positive outcomes of a clinical trial assessing Itolizumab for its safety and efficacy in preventing CRS in moderate to severe ARDS patients due to COVID-19 at multiple hospitals in Mumbai and New Delhi 
 The study met its 1EP with a reduction in mortality rates and other 2EPs for efficacy and biomarkers were also achieved
 ALZUMAb (itolizumab, 25mg/5mL) is an anti-CD6 IgG1 mAb launched for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in India in 2013, manufactured and formulated IV injection at Biocon’s bio-manufacturing facility at Biocon Park, Bengaluru","Bengaluru, Karnataka, India – July 11, 2020

Biocon Ltd. (BSE code: 532523, NSE: BIOCON), an innovation-led global biopharmaceuticals company, announced today that it has received the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI) approval to market Itolizumab (ALZUMAb®) Injection 25mg/5mL solution for emergency use in India for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) patients due to COVID-19.

Itolizumab is the first novel biologic therapy to be approved anywhere in the world for treating patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 complications. Biocon has repurposed Itolizumab, an anti-CD6 IgG1 monoclonal antibody launched in India in 2013 as ALZUMAb® for treating chronic plaque psoriasis, for the treatment of CRS in moderate to severe ARDS patients due to COVID-19.

Itolizumab will be manufactured and formulated as an intravenous injection at Biocon’s bio-manufacturing facility at Biocon Park, Bengaluru.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been observed to induce an overreaction of the immune system, generating a large number of cytokines that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, multi-organ failure and even death.

The approval of Itolizumab, from the DCGI is based on the results from the successful conclusion of a randomized, controlled clinical trial at multiple hospitals in Mumbai and New Delhi. The study focussed on the safety and efficacy of Itolizumab in preventing CRS in moderate to severe ARDS patients due to COVID-19. The primary endpoints for reduction in mortality rate were met and other key secondary endpoints for efficacy and biomarkers were also achieved.

Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Executive Chairperson, Biocon, said: “As an innovation-led biopharmaceuticals company, I am proud of the successful outcome of the pivotal study we conducted with our novel immuno-modulating anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody, Itolizumab, which has proven to be an efficacious intervention in treating the serious hyper immune response seen with COVID-19. The data is compelling and I am confident that this ‘first-in-class’ biologic will save lives and help reduce the mortality rate in our country. 

“This positions India amongst the leading global innovators in their effort to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. The randomized control trial indicated that all the patients treated with Itolizumab (ALZUMAb®) responded positively and recovered. The control arm that did not receive Itolizumab unfortunately had deaths. Itolizumab is now approved for the treatment of CRS in patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19. We plan to take this therapy to other parts of the world impacted by the pandemic. 

“Itolizumab’s unique mechanism of action made it an ideal candidate for treating the ‘cytokine storm’, which is a leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients. I am pleased that our R&D and clinical teams delivered on this promising hypothesis in such a short period of time. It is a proud moment for all of us at Biocon and we would like more and more patients to benefit from this therapy. I also thank the investigators and the regulators for the sense of urgency that they displayed in this study. 

“ALZUMAb® has a seven-year proven track record of safety as doctors in India have been prescribing this biologic to treat acute psoriasis and ensure a better quality of life for patients and now we will be able to save many critically ill COVID-19 patients with our drug.”

Dr Suresh Kumar, Medical Director, Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi said: “At the time of this COVID-19 pandemic, we do not have any specific treatment for patients who are losing the fight against the disease in spite of best supportive care. Lok Nayak Hospital was one of the sites of the Itolizumab study wherein we used Itolizumab to treat eight patients. These patients did extremely well even with a single dose of Itolizumab. Patients who were with initial oxygen saturation of less than 80% and would have been put on ventilator support with little chance of survival, recovered completely when treated with Itolizumab and got discharged. I sincerely believe Itolizumab will not only help in reducing morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients but will also help us in judiciously managing healthcare resources like ICUs and ventilators for critically ill patients.”

Dr Mohan Joshi, Dean, BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai, said: “In our hospital, we have tried Itolizumab in many COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS and found significant improvement in clinical, radiological and inflammatory markers after administering Itolizumab. These outcomes were quite evident with one dose of Itolizumab when administered before the ‘cytokine storm’ set in. Most of the patients have well tolerated the drug. Given the growing surge of COVID-19 cases, I would recommend use of Itolizumab in moderate to severe complications in COVID-19.”

Dr Sandeep Athalye, Chief Medical Officer, Biocon Biologics, said: “We are delighted with the results of the clinical trial for Itolizumab in India. Itolizumab demonstrated statistically significant advantage over the control arm, in one month mortality rate. Key efficacy parameters such as PaO2 and SpO2 (oxygen saturation) improvement without increasing FiO2 (oxygen flow) also showed statistically significant advantage for Itolizumab arm over the control arm. All the patients on Itolizumab arm were weaned off oxygen by Day 30, and none needed ventilator support unlike the control arm. Key secondary endpoints of clinical markers of inflammation such as IL-6, TNF-α, serum ferritin, d-dimer, LDH and CRP showed clinically significant suppression post dose and correlated well with clinical improvement in symptoms and chest x-ray images. Itolizumab was overall well tolerated and was found to be safe. Itolizumab when administered to patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19, prevents morbidity and mortality due to cytokine storm.

India currently has more than 283,400* documented active coronavirus infections and over 22,100* deaths.

Itolizumab’s unique mechanism of action of immunomodulation involves binding to the CD6 receptor and blocking the activation of T lymphocytes, which in turn suppresses the pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus reducing the cytokine storm and deadly inflammatory response.

Biocon launched ALZUMAb® (Itolizumab) in India in 2013 for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Many patients have benefitted from this novel therapy.

36522,Roche Reports Results of Tecentriq in P-III IMagyn050 Study for Women with 1L Newly Diagnosed Advanced Stage Ovarian Cancer,Roche provides update on Phase III study of Tecentriq in women with advanced stage ovarian cancer,"The P-III IMagyn050 study involves assessing of Tecentriq + Avastin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin vs PBO + Avastin, paclitaxel and carboplatin in the ratio (1:1) in women with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer who are undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy
 The study did not meet its 1EP i.e. PFS while the safety data were consistent with the safety profile of the combination 
 Tecentriq is a mAb targeting PD-L1 protein while blocking its interaction with PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. Additionally, Roche collaborated with The GOG Foundation and European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT) [ENGOT OV-39] to conduct P-III IMagyn050 Trial","Basel, 13 July 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Phase III IMagyn050 study showed that the addition of Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) to Avastin® (bevacizumab), paclitaxel and carboplatin did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) for the front-line treatment of women with newly diagnosed advanced stage ovarian cancer. Topline safety data indicate that safety for Tecentriq in combination with Avastin, paclitaxel and carboplatin was consistent with the known safety profile of the combination.

“Ovarian cancer remains one of the most aggressive cancers and is difficult to treat in its advanced stages,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “While we are disappointed by these results, we remain committed to improving outcomes for women living with this disease and are pleased that Avastin remains a key component in the treatment of front-line ovarian cancer.”

Data for the overall survival (OS) co-primary endpoint are currently immature and follow-up will continue until the next planned analysis. Results from IMagyn050 will be further evaluated in order to inform the Tecentriq gynaecologic development programme. The Tecentriq programme in ovarian cancer and cervical cancers builds on the combination with Avastin, which has helped women with newly diagnosed, advanced or relapsed ovarian and cervical cancers live without their disease getting worse, as demonstrated in results across seven pivotal Phase III trials that involved more than 5,000 women.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMagyn050 study
IMagyn050 is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with Avastin, paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with placebo plus Avastin, paclitaxel and carboplatin in women with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer who are undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Patients were randomised 1:1 either before or after tumour reductive surgery. The co-primary endpoints are investigator-determined PFS and OS, both in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and PD-L1-positive subpopulation. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate, safety and tolerability, as well as patient-reported improvement in abdominal pain and bloating.

The IMagyn050 study is being conducted in collaboration with The GOG Foundation, Inc. (GOG Foundation) [GOG-3015] and the European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT) [ENGOT OV-39].

About ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancer is the 8th most commonly occurring cancer in women worldwide, with nearly 300,000 new cases diagnosed each year.1,2 Ovarian cancer remains the leading cause of death from any gynaecologic malignancy, due to the fact that the majority of patients are not diagnosed until they present with already advanced stage disease, resulting in a 5-year survival rate of less than30%.3,4

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

About Avastin
Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumour to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumour blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumour blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumour’s ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasise).

36553,Gilead's Veklury (remdesivir) Receives the TGA's Approval to Treat Adults and Adolescents with Severe COVID-19 Symptoms,Australia’s first COVID treatment approved,"The TGA authorization follows the recent data shared by EMA and Singapore Health Sciences Authority for remdesivir’s approval in EU, Singapore and, Japan for COVID-19 patients
 TGA’s approval was made within 2 weeks of the receipt of the submission while the provisional approval is based on preliminary data valid for 6 years. Additionally, the company plans filling full registration confirming the safety and efficacy of the drug to the TGA committee
 Remdesivir is an investigational drug targeted reduce hospitalization time for COVID-19 while the drug will be available for severely unwell, requiring oxygen or high-level support to breathe, and in-hospital care","The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has granted provisional approval to remdesivir (“Veklury”, Gilead Sciences Pty Ltd) as the first treatment option for COVID-19. It has received provisional approval for use in adults and adolescent patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms who have been hospitalised.

Remdesivir is the most promising treatment option so far to reduce hospitalisation time for those suffering from severe coronavirus infections. Remdesivir offers the potential to reduce the strain on Australia’s health care system. By reducing recovery times patients will be able to leave hospital earlier, freeing beds for those in need. Remdesivir will not be available to Australians unless they are severely unwell, requiring oxygen or high level support to breathe, and in hospital care.

While this is a major milestone in Australia’s struggle against the pandemic, it is important to emphasise that the product has not been shown to prevent coronavirus infection or relieve milder cases of infection.

Australia is the one of the first regulators to authorise the use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, following on from recent approvals in European Union, Japan, and Singapore. International regulatory cooperation played a significant role, as the European Medicines Agency and the Singapore Health Sciences Authority generously shared their review reports with TGA at an early stage.

TGA’s approval was able to be made within 2 weeks of the receipt of the submission with a large multidisciplinary review team at TGA working around the clock.

Provisional approval, which is limited to a maximum of six years, was made on the basis of preliminary clinical data, as there is the potential for substantial benefit to Australian patients. The sponsor, Gilead Sciences Pty Ltd may apply for full registration when additional clinical data required by the TGA to confirm the safety and efficacy of the medicine are available.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gilead-20.jpg,COVID-19|Regulatory,Gilead,Veklury | remdesivir,COVID-19|Regulatory| Adolescent|Adults|approval|receives|Severe|the TGA|Treat,publish,13/7/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/australias-first-covid-treatment-approved/,https://pharmashots.com/36553/gileads-veklury-remdesivir-receives-the-tgas-approval-to-treat-adults-and-adolescents-with-severe-covid-19-symptoms/

 Pralsetinib (qd, PO) is precision therapy for the treatment of patients with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other types of thyroid cancer, and solid tumors and has demonstrated tumor-agnostic potential with its PDUFA date as Nov 23, 2020","Roche will obtain co-development and co-commercialisation rights for pralsetinib, an investigational, precision therapy in late-stage development for people with RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer, various types of thyroid cancer and other solid tumours.
Blueprint Medicines and Roche will collaborate on the development of pralsetinib.
Roche and Blueprint Medicines will co-commercialise pralsetinib in the US while Roche will be responsible for commercial activities outside the US, excluding Greater China*.
Roche will pay an upfront of $675 million in cash in addition to a $100 million equity investment in Blueprint Medicines who is eligible to receive up to $927 million in potential milestones, plus royalties on net product sales outside the US.
 
Basel, 14 July 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and Blueprint Medicines Corporation (NASDAQ:BPMC), today announced the signing of a licensing and collaboration agreement providing exclusive rights to Roche for global co-development and commercialisation outside the United States (US), excluding Greater China*. In the US, Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, will obtain co-commercialisation rights to pralsetinib, Blueprint Medicine’s investigational, once-daily oral precision therapy for the treatment of people with RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and other types of thyroid cancer, as well as other solid tumours. In addition, pralsetinib has demonstrated tumour-agnostic potential. The companies also plan to expand development of pralsetinib in multiple treatment settings and explore development of a next-generation RET inhibitor under the collaboration.

RET-activating fusions and mutations are key disease drivers in many cancer types, including NSCLC and MTC, and treatment options that selectively target these genetic alterations are limited. With the ongoing need for more targeted therapies that may offer clinical benefit to people with these types of cancers, this collaboration reflects Roche’s strategy of providing treatments tailored specifically to a patient’s individual tumour profile and delivering truly personalised healthcare.

In lung cancer, pralsetinib will complement Roche’s broad portfolio of already approved medicines, alongside Alecensa, Rozlytrek, Tecentriq, Avastin and Tarceva and will further support our focus on understanding driver mutations in lung cancer through personalised treatment approaches. Beyond lung cancer, pralsetinib’s tumour-agnostic potential further expands Roche’s ongoing commitment to finding new approaches to treat cancer in a more personalised way based on the genetic mutation of the disease, irrespective of the tumour site of origin.

“We are very excited to enter into this collaboration with Blueprint Medicines, a partner we have already been working with for four years, with the goal of bringing a potentially transformative treatment option to patients with rare RET-altered cancers as quickly as possible,” said James Sabry, Head of Roche Pharma Partnering. “In bringing pralsetinib to patients, we will leverage our global reach and expertise in oncology, as well as our capabilities in diagnostics and the use of real-world data toward our aim of providing personalised treatments for patients.”

“With Roche’s global reach and unparalleled expertise in personalised healthcare, this collaboration will accelerate our ability to bring pralsetinib to patients with significant medical needs around the world and expand development of pralsetinib across multiple treatment settings where there is potential to benefit even broader patient populations,” said Jeff Albers, Chief Executive Officer of Blueprint Medicines.

Blueprint Medicines has submitted a new drug application (NDA) for pralsetinib to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a marketing authorisation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of RET fusion-positive NSCLC. The FDA granted priority review with an expected decision date of 23 November 2020. Blueprint Medicines has also submitted an NDA to the US FDA for RET mutation-positive MTC and RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer. The FDA has accepted the MTC application for its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot programme, which aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible.

Under the terms of the agreement, Blueprint Medicines will receive an upfront cash payment of $675 million and a $100 million equity investment in Blueprint Medicines’ common stock. In addition, Blueprint Medicines is eligible to receive up to $927 million in contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, and royalties on net product sales outside the US. Roche and Blueprint Medicines will share global development expenses based on pre-specified cost-sharing percentages and equally share profits and losses in the US.

The closing of a minority portion of the equity investment is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions.

About RET-Altered Solid Tumours
RET activating fusions and mutations are key disease drivers in many cancer types, including NSCLC and multiple types of thyroid cancer. RET fusions are implicated in approximately 1 to 2 percent of patients with NSCLC and approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients with papillary thyroid cancer, while RET mutations are implicated in approximately 90 percent of patients with advanced MTC. In addition, oncogenic RET alterations are observed at low frequencies in colorectal, breast, pancreatic and other cancers, and RET fusions have been observed in patients with treatment-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

About Pralsetinib
Pralsetinib is an investigational, once-daily oral precision therapy designed to selectively target RET alterations, including fusions and mutations, regardless of the tissue of origin. Preclinical data have shown that pralsetinib potently inhibits primary RET fusions and mutations that cause cancer in subsets of patients, as well as secondary RET mutations predicted to drive resistance to treatment. Blueprint Medicines is developing pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with RET-altered NSCLC, various types of thyroid cancer and other solid tumours.

36589,Roche's Mosunetuzumab Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Treat Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma,FDA grants Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Roche’s CD20xCD3 bispecific cancer immunotherapy mosunetuzumab recognising its potential in follicular lymphoma,"The US FDA has granted BTD to the Roche’s mosunetuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with r/r FL, prior treated with at least two systemic therapies
 The BT designation is based on P-I/Ib GO29781 study assessing mosunetuzumab in R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The safety profile of the therapy was consistent with its mechanism of action
 Mosunetuzumab is an investigational CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific that targets CD20 on the surface of B-cells and CD3 on the surface of T-cells, being evaluated in clinical development program across several lymphoma indications both as monothx. and combination therapy","This designation is based on results from the phase I/Ib GO29781 study that showed mosunetuzumab demonstrated high response rates and durable complete remissions in people with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Tenth Breakthrough Therapy Designation awarded for Roche’s haematology medicines
Basel, 14 July 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that its investigational CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific mosunetuzumab has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.

“We are pleased that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to mosunetuzumab, recognising the promising early efficacy data for this molecule and the remaining unmet need in follicular lymphoma,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Indeed, we are excited by the potential of both our CD20xCD3 bispecific antibodies – mosunetuzumab and glofitamab – in development for difficult-to-treat lymphomas, and remain committed to developing innovative therapies to improve outcomes for patients.”

This designation was granted based on encouraging efficacy results observed in the phase I/Ib GO29781 study [NCT02500407] investigating mosunetuzumab in R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The safety profile of this T-cell engaging bispecific was consistent with its mechanism of action. Results from this study were previously presented at the American Society of Hematology 2019 Annual Meeting.

BTD is designed to accelerate the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. This is the 34th BTD for Roche’s portfolio of medicines, and the 10th designation for its haematology portfolio.

A robust clinical development programme for mosunetuzumab is ongoing across a number of lymphoma indications and earlier lines of treatment, investigating the molecule alone and in combination to identify where mosunetuzumab may be able to provide benefit over current treatment options. This includes further investigation of mosunetuzumab in combination with Roche’s Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) and Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) as well as with chemotherapy regimens and non-Roche molecules.

About mosunetuzumab
Mosunetuzumab is an investigational CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific designed to target CD20 on the surface of B-cells and CD3 on the surface of T-cells. This dual targeting activates and redirects a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target B-cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the B-cells. Mosunetuzumab has a structure similar to that of a natural human antibody in that it has two ‘Fab’ regions, but is different from naturally-occurring antibodies in that one ‘Fab’ region targets CD20 and the other ‘Fab’ region targets CD3. A robust clinical development programme for mosunetuzumab is ongoing, investigating the molecule as a monotherapy and in combination with other medicines, for the treatment of people with CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and other blood cancers.

About the GO29781 study
The GO29781 study [NCT02500407] is a phase I/Ib, multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in people with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Outcome measures include best objective response rate by revised International Working Group criteria, maximum tolerated dose, and tolerability.

About Roche in haematology
Roche has been developing medicines for people with malignant and non-malignant blood diseases for over 20 years; our experience and knowledge in this therapeutic area runs deep. Today, we are investing more than ever in our effort to bring innovative treatment options to patients across a wide range of haematologic diseases. Our approved medicines include MabThera®/Rituxan® (rituximab), Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab), Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin), Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax) in collaboration with AbbVie, and Hemlibra® (emicizumab). Our pipeline of investigational haematology medicines includes idasanutlin, a small molecule which inhibits the interaction of MDM2 with p53; T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, glofitamab and mosunetuzumab, targeting both CD20 and CD3; Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with PD-L1; and crovalimab, an anti-C5 antibody engineered to optimise complement inhibition. Our scientific expertise, combined with the breadth of our portfolio and pipeline, also provides a unique opportunity to develop combination regimens that aim to improve the lives of patients even further.

Immunomedics also announces Phase 2 NeoSTAR study in neoadjuvant triple-negative breast cancer has begun patient enrollment

MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., July 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Immunomedics, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMU) (“Immunomedics” or the “Company”), a leading biopharmaceutical company in the area of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), today announced an extension of its current clinical collaboration with Roche to evaluate Trodelvy, Immunomedics’ anti-Trop-2 ADC, in combination with Tecentriq, Roche’s programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-blocking checkpoint inhibitor (CPI), in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC).

“Given that Trodelvy can cause tumor-cell death with possible neoantigen release, combining it with an immune-stimulating agent, such as atezolizumab, could potentially create a synergistic effect, which can lead to a promising therapeutic option,” said Dr. Loretta M. Itri, Chief Medical Officer of Immunomedics.

Under the terms of the extension, Roche will be conducting two open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 1b/2 studies using its MORPHEUS platform. The MORPHEUS-mUC study will randomize CPI-naïve mUC patients who have failed platinum-containing chemotherapy to receive the Tecentriq plus Trodelvy combination or Tecentriq alone. The second study, Morpheus-Lung, will enroll CPI-experienced mNSCLC patients after failure with platinum-based regimen to receive either Tecentriq and Trodelvy or docetaxel alone.

“We are pleased to be expanding our partnership with Roche, a global leader in cancer therapy,” commented Dr. Behzad Aghazadeh, Executive Chairman of Immunomedics. “We believe these combination studies will build a strong foundation for early-line cancer treatment developments.”

Separately, Immunomedics also announces that the new Phase 2 NeoSTAR study initiated by Dr. Aditya Bardia at Mass General Cancer Center has enrolled the first patient with localized triple-negative breast cancer to receive Trodelvy before surgery to remove the tumor. Pathological complete response rate is the primary endpoint of this study, with disease-free survival and overall survival serving as secondary endpoints.

 The collaboration leverages Dewpoint’s biomolecular condensate platform to develop an HIV drug candidate with a unique mechanism, providing the potential to cure rather than suppressing the infection
 Biomolecular condensates are droplet-like structures that form dynamically within cells when diverse communities of proteins, RNAs, and other biomolecules come together through a process called phase separation","BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Dewpoint Therapeutics, the biomolecular condensates company, announced today that it has forged an exclusive collaboration agreement with Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, to apply Dewpoint’s proprietary platform for condensate-based drug discovery to the development of a novel mechanism for the treatment of HIV.

.@dewpoint_tx and @Merck team up to develop a new treatment for HIV, harnessing Dewpoint’s biomolecular condensate platform

Biomolecular condensates are droplet-like structures that form dynamically within cells when diverse “communities” of proteins, RNAs, and other biomolecules come together through a process called phase separation. Though condensates have been visible through the microscope for more than a century, new research has only recently revealed them to be key players in a wide range of normal biological functions and disease processes, including viral infection.

While drug discovery has traditionally treated the cell’s molecular activity largely as a black box, or focused on individual molecular targets, Dewpoint’s high-throughput condensate platform provides the ability to see and understand the complex interactions of biomolecular communities—and to find drugs that intervene in entirely new ways. By targeting both individual molecules and interacting groups of molecules within condensate communities, Dewpoint aims to create new treatments for diseases that were previously untreatable or incurable.

Such is the case with HIV. “Dewpoint and Merck will leverage Dewpoint’s expertise in condensates to develop an HIV drug candidate with a unique mechanism that may provide the potential to cure rather than suppress the infection,” said Ann Kwong, Dewpoint Executive Vice President, R&D.

“For me, it’s really exciting and inspiring to be partnering with Merck, a leader in the HIV treatment field,” said Kwong. “I’m thrilled that we have the chance to work together to try to develop the first HIV curative treatment.”

“At Merck we remain committed to advancing new treatment options for patients with HIV, including exploring novel ways toward a potential cure,” said Daria Hazuda, vice president Infectious Diseases Discovery, Merck Research Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer, Merck Exploratory Science Center. “We look forward to working with the Dewpoint team.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Dewpoint will receive up to $305 million in upfront and milestone payments, as well as royalties on sales of any approved product resulting from the collaboration.

About Dewpoint Therapeutics

Dewpoint Therapeutics is the first company founded to apply the emerging discipline of biomolecular condensates to drug discovery. Dewpoint believes that a vast range of conditions have pathways that are regulated by condensates or arise from the dysfunction of condensates — including cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disease. Dewpoint scientists are working in Boston, MA, and Dresden and Berlin, Germany, to translate condensate biology into treatments for the toughest diseases. Dewpoint’s investors include Polaris Partners, 6 Dimensions Capital, Samsara BioCapital, Leaps by Bayer, ARCH Venture Partners, EcoR1 Capital, Innovation Endeavors, and Alexandria Venture Investments.

36634,"Moderna to Commence Late-stage COVID-19 Vaccine Trial on 27 July, 2020",An mRNA Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 — Preliminary Report,"Moderna has reported the robust results of its ongoing P-I study that demonstrated mRNA-1273 at (25-, 100- & 250-mcg dose levels) induced anti–SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants with no trial-limiting safety concerns. These results were published in NEJM
 All participants seroconverted by the 15-day mark. Post two vaccinations, @57day, geometric mean titers exceeded those seen in convalescent sera obtained from 38 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The mRNA-1273 elicited neutralizing Abs titers, post two vaccination with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in all evaluated participants @43day
 Based on P-I interim analysis data, Moderna’s CMO has supported the choice of mRNA-1273 (100mcg) in a prime and boost regimen as the optimal dose for the P-III study scheduled to begin July 27, 2020","BACKGROUND
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and spread globally, prompting an international effort to accelerate development of a vaccine. The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

METHODS
We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg. There were 15 participants in each dose group.

RESULTS
After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti–S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-μg group, 109,209 in the 100-μg group, and 213,526 in the 250-μg group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). After the second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants evaluated, with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose, and three participants (21%) in the 250-μg dose group reported one or more severe adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS
The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti–SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others; mRNA-1273 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04283461. opens in new tab).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and spread globally, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).1 The urgent need for vaccines prompted an international response, with more than 120 candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development within the first 5 months of 2020.2 The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated, nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)–based vaccine that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein stabilized in its prefusion conformation. The S glycoprotein mediates host cell attachment and is required for viral entry3; it is the primary vaccine target for many candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.4-7

We conducted a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adults to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273. Here we report interim results of the trial.

Methods
TRIAL DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS
We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label clinical trial designed to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273. Eligible participants were healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age who received two injections of trial vaccine 28 days apart at a dose of 25 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg. On the basis of the results obtained in patients at these dose levels, additional groups were added to the protocol; those results will be reported in a subsequent publication. Participants were not screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by serology or polymerase chain reaction before enrollment. The trial was conducted at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle and at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. The protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, permitted interim analyses to inform decisions regarding vaccine strategy and public health; this interim analysis reports findings through day 57. Full details of the trial design, conduct, oversight, and analyses can be found in the protocol and statistical analysis plan (available at NEJM.org).

The trial was reviewed and approved by the Advarra institutional review board, which functioned as a single board and was overseen by an independent safety monitoring committee. All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. The trial was conducted under an Investigational New Drug application submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine was codeveloped by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID, the trial sponsor) and at Moderna (Cambridge, MA). Moderna was involved in discussions of the trial design, provided the vaccine candidate, and, as part of the writing group, contributed to drafting the manuscript. The Emmes Company, as a subcontractor to the NIAID, served as the statistical and data coordinating center, developed the statistical analysis plan, and performed the analyses. The manuscript was written entirely by the authors, with the first author as the overall lead author, the fourth author as the lead NIAID author, and the last two authors as senior authors (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). The authors had full access to the data reports, which were prepared from the raw data by the statistical and data coordinating center, and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.

VACCINE
The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate, manufactured by Moderna, encodes the S-2P antigen, consisting of the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein with a transmembrane anchor and an intact S1–S2 cleavage site. S-2P is stabilized in its prefusion conformation by two consecutive proline substitutions at amino acid positions 986 and 987, at the top of the central helix in the S2 subunit.8 The lipid nanoparticle capsule composed of four lipids was formulated in a fixed ratio of mRNA and lipid. The mRNA-1273 vaccine was provided as a sterile liquid for injection at a concentration of 0.5 mg per milliliter. Normal saline was used as a diluent to prepare the doses administered.

TRIAL PROCEDURES
The vaccine was administered as a 0.5-ml injection in the deltoid muscle on days 1 and 29; follow-up visits were scheduled for 7 and 14 days after each vaccination and on days 57, 119, 209, and 394. The dose-escalation plan specified enrollment of four sentinel participants in the 25-μg group, followed by four sentinel participants in the 100-μg group, followed by full enrollment of those two dose groups. If no halting rules were met after all participants in those two dose groups completed day 8, four sentinel participants in the 250-μg group were enrolled, followed by the remainder of that dose group.

Participants recorded local and systemic reactions, using a memory aid, for 7 days after each vaccination. Participants were not instructed to routinely use acetaminophen or other analgesics or antipyretics before or after the vaccinations but were asked to record any new medications taken. Adverse events were graded according to a standard toxicity grading scale (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).9

ASSESSMENT OF SARS-COV-2 BINDING ANTIBODY AND NEUTRALIZING RESPONSES
Binding antibody responses against S-2P and the isolated receptor-binding domain, located in the S1 subunit, were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vaccine-induced neutralizing activity was assessed by a pseudotyped lentivirus reporter single-round-of-infection neutralization assay (PsVNA) and by live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 plaque-reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) assay. ELISA and PsVNA were performed on specimens collected from all participants on days 1, 15, 29, 36, 43, and 57. Because of the time-intensive nature of the PRNT assay, for this report of the interim analysis, results were available only for the day 1 and day 43 time points in the 25-μg and 100-μg dose groups.

For comparison of the participants’ immune responses with those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41 convalescent serum specimens were also tested. The assays were performed at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center (ELISA and PsVNA) and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (PRNT).

ASSESSMENT OF SARS-COV-2 T-CELL RESPONSES
T-cell responses against the spike protein were assessed by an intracellular cytokine–staining assay, performed on specimens collected at days 1, 29, and 43. For this report of the interim analysis, results were available only for the 25-μg and 100-μg dose groups. These assays were performed at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. (See the Supplementary Appendix for details of all assay methods and for characteristics of the convalescent serum specimens.)

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Results of immunogenicity testing of the 45 enrolled participants excluded findings for day 36, day 43, and day 57 for 3 participants who did not receive the second vaccination and for time points at which specimens were not collected (in the 100-μg group: 1 participant at day 43 and day 57; in the 250-μg group: 1 participant at day 29 and 1 at day 57). Confidence intervals of the geometric means were calculated with the Student’s t distribution on log-transformed data. Seroconversion as measured by ELISA was defined as an increase by a factor of 4 or more in antibody titer over baseline.

Results
TRIAL POPULATION
Table 1.Characteristics of the Participants in the mRNA-1273 Trial at Enrollment.

The 45 enrolled participants received their first vaccination between March 16 and April 14, 2020 (Fig. S1). Three participants did not receive the second vaccination, including one in the 25-μg group who had urticaria on both legs, with onset 5 days after the first vaccination, and two (one in the 25-μg group and one in the 250-μg group) who missed the second vaccination window owing to isolation for suspected Covid-19 while the test results, ultimately negative, were pending. All continued to attend scheduled trial visits. The demographic characteristics of participants at enrollment are provided in Table 1.

VACCINE SAFETY
No serious adverse events were noted, and no prespecified trial halting rules were met. As noted above, one participant in the 25-μg group was withdrawn because of an unsolicited adverse event, transient urticaria, judged to be related to the first vaccination.

Figure 1.Systemic and Local Adverse Events.

After the first vaccination, solicited systemic adverse events were reported by 5 participants (33%) in the 25-μg group, 10 (67%) in the 100-μg group, and 8 (53%) in the 250-μg group; all were mild or moderate in severity (Figure 1 and Table S2). Solicited systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination and occurred in 7 of 13 participants (54%) in the 25-μg group, all 15 in the 100-μg group, and all 14 in the 250-μg group, with 3 of those participants (21%) reporting one or more severe events.

None of the participants had fever after the first vaccination. After the second vaccination, no participants in the 25-μg group, 6 (40%) in the 100-μg group, and 8 (57%) in the 250-μg group reported fever; one of the events (maximum temperature, 39.6°C) in the 250-μg group was graded severe. (Additional details regarding adverse events for that participant are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.)

Local adverse events, when present, were nearly all mild or moderate, and pain at the injection site was common. Across both vaccinations, solicited systemic and local adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Evaluation of safety clinical laboratory values of grade 2 or higher and unsolicited adverse events revealed no patterns of concern (Supplementary Appendix and Table S3).

SARS-COV-2 BINDING ANTIBODY RESPONSES
Table 2.Geometric Mean Humoral Immunogenicity Assay Responses to mRNA-1273 in Participants and in Convalescent Serum Specimens.Figure 2.SARS-CoV-2 Antibody and Neutralization Responses.

Binding antibody IgG geometric mean titers (GMTs) to S-2P increased rapidly after the first vaccination, with seroconversion in all participants by day 15 (Table 2 and Figure 2A). Dose-dependent responses to the first and second vaccinations were evident. Receptor-binding domain–specific antibody responses were similar in pattern and magnitude (Figure 2B). For both assays, the median magnitude of antibody responses after the first vaccination in the 100-μg and 250-μg dose groups was similar to the median magnitude in convalescent serum specimens, and in all dose groups the median magnitude after the second vaccination was in the upper quartile of values in the convalescent serum specimens. The S-2P ELISA GMTs at day 57 (299,751 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 206,071 to 436,020] in the 25-μg group, 782,719 [95% CI, 619,310 to 989,244] in the 100-μg group, and 1,192,154 [95% CI, 924,878 to 1,536,669] in the 250-μg group) exceeded that in the convalescent serum specimens (142,140 [95% CI, 81,543 to 247,768]).

SARS-COV-2 NEUTRALIZATION RESPONSES
No participant had detectable PsVNA responses before vaccination. After the first vaccination, PsVNA responses were detected in less than half the participants, and a dose effect was seen (50% inhibitory dilution [ID50]: Figure 2C, Fig. S8, and Table 2; 80% inhibitory dilution [ID80]: Fig. S2 and Table S6). However, after the second vaccination, PsVNA responses were identified in serum samples from all participants. The lowest responses were in the 25-μg dose group, with a geometric mean ID50 of 112.3 (95% CI, 71.2 to 177.1) at day 43; the higher responses in the 100-μg and 250-μg groups were similar in magnitude (geometric mean ID50, 343.8 [95% CI, 261.2 to 452.7] and 332.2 [95% CI, 266.3 to 414.5], respectively, at day 43). These responses were similar to values in the upper half of the distribution of values for convalescent serum specimens.

Before vaccination, no participant had detectable 80% live-virus neutralization at the highest serum concentration tested (1:8 dilution) in the PRNT assay. At day 43, wild-type virus–neutralizing activity capable of reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by 80% or more (PRNT80) was detected in all participants, with geometric mean PRNT80 responses of 339.7 (95% CI, 184.0 to 627.1) in the 25-μg group and 654.3 (95% CI, 460.1 to 930.5) in the 100-μg group (Figure 2D). Neutralizing PRNT80 average responses were generally at or above the values of the three convalescent serum specimens tested in this assay. Good agreement was noted within and between the values from binding assays for S-2P and receptor-binding domain and neutralizing activity measured by PsVNA and PRNT (Figs. S3 through S7), which provides orthogonal support for each assay in characterizing the humoral response induced by mRNA-1273.

SARS-COV-2 T-CELL RESPONSES
The 25-μg and 100-μg doses elicited CD4 T-cell responses (Figs. S9 and S10) that on stimulation by S-specific peptide pools were strongly biased toward expression of Th1 cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α > interleukin 2 > interferon γ), with minimal type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) cytokine expression (interleukin 4 and interleukin 13). CD8 T-cell responses to S-2P were detected at low levels after the second vaccination in the 100-μg dose group (Fig. S11).

Discussion
We report interim findings from this phase 1 clinical trial of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine encoding a stabilized prefusion spike trimer, S-2P. Experience with the mRNA platform for other candidate vaccines and rapid manufacturing allowed the deployment of a first-in-human clinical vaccine candidate in record time. Product development processes that normally require years10 were finished in about 2 months. Vaccine development was initiated after the SARS-CoV-2 genome was posted on January 10, 2020; manufacture and delivery of clinical trials material was completed within 45 days, and the first trial participants were vaccinated on March 16, 2020, just 66 days after the genomic sequence of the virus was posted. The accelerated timeline generated key interim data necessary to launch advanced large-scale clinical trials within 6 months after initial awareness of a new pandemic threat.

The two-dose vaccine series was generally without serious toxicity; systemic adverse events after the first vaccination, when reported, were all graded mild or moderate. Greater reactogenicity followed the second vaccination, particularly in the 250-μg group. Across the three dose groups, local injection-site reactions were primarily mild. This descriptive safety profile is similar to that described in a report of two trials of avian influenza mRNA vaccines (influenza A/H10N8 and influenza A/H7N9) that were manufactured by Moderna with the use of an earlier lipid nanoparticle capsule formulation11 and is consistent with an interim report of a phase 1–2 evaluation of a Covid-19 mRNA vaccine encoding the S receptor-binding domain.6 Those studies showed that solicited systemic adverse events tended to be more frequent and more severe with higher doses and after the second vaccination.

The mRNA-1273 vaccine was immunogenic, inducing robust binding antibody responses to both full-length S-2P and receptor-binding domain in all participants after the first vaccination in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Commensurately high neutralizing antibody responses were also elicited in a dose-dependent fashion. Seroconversion was rapid for binding antibodies, occurring within 2 weeks after the first vaccination, but pseudovirus neutralizing activity was low before the second vaccination, which supports the need for a two-dose vaccination schedule. It is important to note that both binding and neutralizing antibody titers induced by the two-dose schedule were similar to those found in convalescent serum specimens. However, interpretation of the significance of those comparisons must account for the variability in Covid-19 convalescent antibody titers according to factors such as patient age, disease severity, and time since disease onset and for the number of samples in the panel.12,13

Though correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection have not yet been determined, measurement of serum neutralizing activity has been shown to be a mechanistic correlate of protection for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza14 and respiratory syncytial virus,15and is generally accepted as a functional biomarker of the in vivo humoral response.16 In rhesus macaques given DNA vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers were correlated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.17 Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses have been associated with vaccine-induced protection against challenge18 or subsequent rechallenge after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rhesus macaque model.19 We found strong correlations between the binding and neutralization assays and between the live virus and pseudovirus neutralization assays. The latter finding suggests that the pseudovirus neutralization assay, performed under biosafety level 2 containment, may, when validated, serve as a relevant surrogate for live virus neutralization, which requires biosafety level 3 containment. In humans, phase 3 efficacy trials will allow assessment of the correlation of vaccine-induced immune responses with clinical protection.

In this interim report of follow-up of participants through day 57, we were not able to assess the durability of the immune responses; however, participants will be followed for 1 year after the second vaccination with scheduled blood collections throughout that period to characterize the humoral and cellular immunologic responses. This longitudinal assessment is relevant given that natural history studies suggest that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infections, particularly mild illnesses, may not generate long-lived antibody responses.20-22

The rapid and robust immunogenicity profile of the mRNA-1273 vaccine most likely results from an innovative structure-based vaccine antigen design,23 coupled with a potent lipid-nanoparticle delivery system, and the use of modified nucleotides that avoid early intracellular activation of interferon-associated genes. These features of the mRNA composition and formulation have been associated with prolonged protein expression, induction of antigen-specific T-follicular helper cells, and activation of germinal center B cells.24 Stabilizing coronavirus spike proteins by substituting two prolines at the top of heptad repeat 1 prevents structural rearrangements of the fusion (S2) subunit. This has enabled the determination of atomic-level structure for the prefusion conformation of spike from both endemic and pandemic strains, including HKU1,25 SARS-CoV,26 and MERS-CoV.27Moreover, S-2P conformational stability translates into greater immunogenicity,27-29 based on preservation of neutralization-sensitive epitopes at the apex of the prefusion molecule, as shown for respiratory syncytial virus F glycoprotein,30 and improved protein expression,27which is particularly advantageous for gene-based antigen delivery. Thus, presentation of the naturally folded prefusion conformation of the S glycoprotein to the immune system from an mRNA template enables efficient within-host antigen production and promotes both high-quality and high-magnitude antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.

Previous experience with veterinary coronavirus vaccines and animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have raised safety concerns about the potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. These events were associated either with macrophage-tropic coronaviruses susceptible to antibody-dependent enhancement of replication or with vaccine antigens that induced antibodies with poor neutralizing activity and Th2-biased responses.31 Reducing the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease or antibody-dependent enhancement of replication involves induction of high-quality functional antibody responses and Th1-biased T-cell responses. Studies of mRNA-1273 in mice show that the structurally defined spike antigen induces robust neutralizing activity and that the gene-based delivery promotes Th1-biased responses, including CD8 T cells that protect against virus replication in lung and nose without evidence of immunopathology.32 It is important to note that mRNA-1273 also induces Th1-biased CD4 T-cell responses in humans. Additional testing in animals and ongoing T-cell analysis of clinical specimens will continue to define the safety profile of mRNA-1273.

These safety and immunogenicity findings support advancement of the mRNA-1273 vaccine to later-stage clinical trials. Of the three doses evaluated, the 100-μg dose elicits high neutralization responses and Th1-skewed CD4 T cell responses, coupled with a reactogenicity profile that is more favorable than that of the higher dose. A phase 2 trial of mRNA-1273 in 600 healthy adults, evaluating doses of 50 μg and 100 μg, is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04405076. opens in new tab). A large phase 3 efficacy trial, expected to evaluate a 100-μg dose, is anticipated to begin during the summer of 2020.

36660,3M Collaborates with MIT to Develop Paper-Based Diagnostic Test for COVID-19,3M and MIT Researchers Developing a Rapid Diagnostic Test for COVID-19,"3M is working with MIT’s researcher to develop a rapid COVID-19 diagnostic using a simple, paper-based test that detects viral antigens and produces accurate results within minutes and is feasible to mass manufacture
 The collaboration leverages 3M’s expertise in biomaterials and bioprocessing along with the global medical device manufacturing capabilities. 3M and MIT believe a diagnostic test can be deployed once validated and expect to produce millions of units/ day
 NIH has supported the project under competitive Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Tech (RADx Tech) program launched in early May to combat COVID-19. The project received $500,000 for validation funding from RADx Tech and is eligible for further investment in later stages of the development","ST. PAUL, Minn.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–To help the world respond to COVID-19, 3M and researchers at MIT are testing a new rapid test that detects the virus. Accelerated research is underway to learn if a simple-to-use, diagnostic device can produce highly accurate results within minutes and is feasible to mass manufacture.

The U.S. National Institute of Health selected the rapid COVID-19 test for accelerated development and commercialization support, after rigorous review by an expert panel. The test is in the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Tech (RADx Tech) program, an aggressively-paced COVID-19 diagnostics initiative from the NIH’s National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

“We are excited to collaborate with Professor Hadley Sikes and the team at MIT. Our approach is ambitious, but our collective expertise can make a difference for people around the world, so we owe it to ourselves and society to give it our best effort,” said John Banovetz, 3M Senior Vice President for Innovation and Stewardship and Chief Technology Officer. “This is another step demonstrating 3M’s leadership in the fight against COVID-19. We are seeking to improve the speed, accessibility and affordability of testing for the virus, a major step in helping to prevent its spread.”

The test would detect viral antigens and deliver highly accurate results within minutes via a paper-based device. The test could be administered at the point-of-care and would not need to be sent to labs for testing.

This effort draws on 3M’s deep technological expertise in biomaterials and bioprocessing along with the company’s expertise in global medical device manufacturing. The 3M team is led by scientists, manufacturing and regulatory experts from its corporate research laboratories and health care business group.

The research team at MIT is led by Professor Hadley Sikes at the Institute’s Department of Chemical Engineering. The Sikes lab specializes in the creation and development of molecular technologies to improve the performance of rapid, cellulose-based protein tests.

“There is a pressing need for a highly scalable rapid test,” Sikes said. “We are working with our colleagues at 3M to overcome the challenges to move this research from lab to impact, and find an innovative path forward to manufacture it at scale. Joining forces with 3M and the NIH has greatly enhanced our collective efforts toward swift detection of the virus, and a potential tool to help mitigate and contain this public health crisis.”

The teams at 3M and MIT believe a diagnostic test can be deployed once validated. Manufacturing equipment can be scaled to produce millions of units per day.

The team is prepared to collaborate with the government’s RADx Tech program to demonstrate the test’s capability and to deploy it as quickly as possible. RADx Tech’s phased innovation funnel is initially supporting a four-week period of intense research to demonstrate the test concept works and can be commercialized on a large scale. The project received $500,000 in validation funding from RADx Tech and is eligible for further investment in later stages of the development funnel.

Two committee members could not participate in the final vote
 The recommendation is based on DREAMM program including the pivotal DREAMM-2 study which enrolled heavily pre-treated patients who had actively progressing MM that had worsened despite treated with SOC
 Belantamab mafodotin is an investigational ADC comprising a humanized anti- BCMA mAb conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via a non-cleavable linker and has received the US FDA’s BT designation in 2017 and PR in early 2020. The therapy’s MAA is under EMA’s accelerated assessment","LONDON, July 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 12-0 in favour of the demonstrated benefit of monotherapy treatment with belantamab mafodotin outweighing the risks for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. Two committee members could not participate in the final vote.

Dr Axel Hoos, Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology R&D, GSK said: “We are pleased the committee recognised the potential for belantamab mafodotin to help patients who have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, an incurable disease with limited treatment options. We look forward to working with the FDA as they complete their review of our Biologics License Application.”

The recommendation was based on data from the DREAMM (DRiving Excellence in Approaches to Multiple Myeloma) clinical trial programme, including the pivotal DREAMM-2 study which enrolled heavily pre-treated patients who had actively progressing multiple myeloma that had worsened despite current standard of care.i The six-month primary results from the study were published in The Lancet Oncology in December 2019 and serve as the basis for the Biologics License Application (BLA).

The FDA will consider the recommendation of the committee but is not obligated to follow it. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to belantamab mafodotin in 2017 and priority review designation for the BLA earlier this year. A Marketing Authorisation Application for belantamab mafodotin also is under accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency.

Belantamab mafodotin is not currently approved for use anywhere in the world.

About belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916)
Belantamab mafodotin is an investigational antibody drug conjugate comprising a humanised anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via non-cleavable linker. The drug linker technology is licensed from Seattle Genetics; monoclonal antibody is produced using POTELLIGENT Technology licensed from BioWa.

About DREAMM-2
DREAMM-2 is an open label study of belantamab mafodotin. Patients in the trial had actively progressing multiple myeloma that had worsened despite current standard of care and were randomised to two arms to receive either 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg belantamab mafodotin every three weeks. Overall, patients in DREAMM-2 had more advanced disease, poorer prognosis and performance status and also had a greater number of prior lines of therapy in comparison with patients in DREAMM-1, the first time in human study of belantamab mafodotin.

About multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer in the US and is generally considered treatable, but not curable.ii Research into new therapies is needed as multiple myeloma commonly becomes refractory to available treatments.iii

About B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)
The normal function of BCMA is to promote plasma cell survival by transduction of signals from two known ligands, BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand). This pathway has been shown to be important for myeloma cell growth and survival. BCMA expression is limited to B cells at later stages of development. BCMA is expressed at varying levels in myeloma patients and BCMA membrane expression is universally detected in myeloma cell lines.iii

GSK in Oncology
GSK is focused on maximising patient survival through transformational medicines. GSK’s pipeline is focused on immuno-oncology, cell therapy, cancer epigenetics, and synthetic lethality. Our goal is to achieve a sustainable flow of new treatments based on a diversified portfolio of investigational medicines utilising modalities such as small molecules, antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and cells, either alone or in combination.

36682,AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford to Share Positive News on its COVID-19 Vaccine Imminently,"Positive news is coming on Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, writes Robert Peston","As per ITV, AstraZeneca to share positive news on its AZD1222. The update could come tomorrow while the first data is due to be published in The Lancet
 According to Robert Peston, a UK journalist, the vaccine generating the kind of antibody and T-cell (killer cell) response that the researchers want. He revealed that not all vaccines under development across the globe increase both Abs and T-cells but the AZD1222 demonstrate twin effect
 The efficacy of the vaccine will be properly established in P-III program, which is underway in Brazil to deliver a large database assessing the safety as well as the efficacy of AZD1222. If approved, the company could go for mass production as early as Sept’20","I am hearing there will be positive news soon (perhaps tomorrow) on initial trials of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine that is backed by AstraZeneca and supported by tens of millions of pounds of government money.

The first data is due be published in the Lancet.

Apparently the vaccine is generating the kind of antibody and T-cell (killer cell) response that the researchers would hope to see.

That said, the efficacy will only be properly established in the large phase III programme that is under way in the viral epicentre of Brazil, to deliver a large database that assesses safety as well as efficacy.

One source told me: “An important point to keep in mind is that there are two dimensions to the immune response: antibodies and T-cells..

“Everybody is focussed on antibodies but there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the T-cells response is important in the defence against coronavirus.

As I understand, not all of the many vaccines under development across the world increase both antibodies and T-cells. But the Oxford vaccine looks as though it has this twin effect.

It remains relatively early days: No effective vaccine has ever been developed as rapidly as is being attempted for Covid-19. And there could still be disappointment and failure.

July 15, 2020 02:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
DUBLIN & LYON, France–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), a global leader in medical technology, and Medicrea (Euronext Growth Paris: FR0004178572 – ALMED Medicrea; OTCQX Best Market – MRNTF), a pioneer in the transformation of spinal surgery through artificial intelligence, predictive modeling and patient specific implants, today announced that they have entered into a tender offer agreement for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Medicrea. The friendly voluntary all-cash tender offer will be at a price of €7.00 per Medicrea share (the “Tender Offer”). The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction.

“Spine surgery is one of the more complex procedures in healthcare because of the high number of different parameters to take into consideration. It is impossible for the human brain to compute all of them for one single patient”

This acquisition would strengthen Medtronic’s position as a global innovator in enabling technologies and solutions for spine surgery.

“Combining Medtronic’s innovative portfolio of spine implants, robotics, navigation, and 3D imaging technology with Medicrea’s capabilities and solutions in data analytics, artificial intelligence and personalized implants, would enhance Medtronic’s fully-integrated procedural solution for surgical planning and delivery. This marks another important step in furthering our commitment to improving outcomes in spine care,” said Jacob Paul, senior vice president and president of the Cranial & Spinal Technologies division, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group at Medtronic. “Medtronic will become the first company to be able to offer an integrated solution including artificial intelligence driven surgical planning, personalized spinal implants and robotic assisted surgical delivery, which will significantly benefit our customers and their patients.”

Medicrea’s product portfolio includes MEDICREA® UNiD® ASI (Adaptive Spine Intelligence) designed to support surgeon workflow in pre-operative planning and create personalized implant solutions for surgery. The Medicrea solution is powered by predictive modeling and sophisticated algorithms that measure and digitally reconstruct the spine to its optimal profile.

“Spine surgery is one of the more complex procedures in healthcare because of the high number of different parameters to take into consideration. It is impossible for the human brain to compute all of them for one single patient,” said Denys Sournac, founder, chairman and CEO of Medicrea. “The medical world has been waiting for the arrival of customization in spinal surgery. With scientific progress in understanding sagittal balance and spinal injury, combined with the advent of new digital technologies, it is now possible to offer spinal patients entirely customized implants. We are thrilled to be joining forces with Medtronic because we share a similar mission to restore the long-term quality of life for patients. Now, together, we can help more patients in more places benefit from consistently high-quality surgical care.”

Key Terms of the Transaction

The Tender Offer price of €7.00 per share represents a premium of:

– 22% over the closing price of Medicrea shares on 14 July 2020

– 33% over the 1-month volume weighted average price of Medicrea shares as of 14 July 2020

– 56% over the 3-month volume weighted average price of Medicrea shares as of 14 July 2020

The Tender Offer will target all the outstanding shares of Medicrea as well as the shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants subject to their exercise prior to the closing of the Tender Offer.

Medicrea’s largest shareholders, including founder, president and CEO Denys Sournac as well as certain other key managers, employees and directors of Medicrea, have entered into commitments to tender their shares (including shares to be issued upon exercise of warrants, but excluding, in the case of Denys Sournac and managers, free shares under lock-up period) in the Tender Offer.

These commitments remain revocable in case of a higher competing public tender offer in accordance with applicable French financial markets regulations.

With the above-mentioned commitments to tender, Medtronic has entered into agreements with Medicrea shareholders totalling approximatively 44.4% of Medicrea’s current outstanding share capital (adjusted for new shares to be issued upon exercise of warrants).

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including obtaining regulatory clearance from the French Markets Authority (the “AMF”), applicable foreign investment clearance in France, and applicable merger control clearance in the United States.

The completion of the Tender Offer will be subject, in addition to the mandatory minimum acceptance condition set out in Article 231-9, I 1° of the AMF Regulation, to a minimum acceptance condition that Medtronic obtains a number of Medicrea shares representing at least 66.67% of the share capital and voting rights.

The Board of Medicrea will issue in due course a reasoned opinion on the merits of the Tender Offer for Medicrea, its shareholders and its employees following receipt of the fairness opinion issued by the independent expert appointed in accordance with Article 261-1, I & III of the AMF Regulation by the ad hoc​ committee to be created by the Board of Medicrea.

It is expected that the Tender Offer will be filed with the AMF in September 2020. The Tender Offer will be opened once the foreign investment approval in France is obtained, and the Tender Offer would still remain subject to the merger control clearance in the United States.

Assuming receipt of regulatory and other clearances and satisfaction of other closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to close by the end of calendar year 2020. The transaction is expected to be immaterial to Medtronic’s adjusted earnings per share in the first two fiscal years before turning accretive in fiscal year 2023. In addition, it is expected to meet Medtronic’s long-term financial metrics for acquisitions.

 The COVID-19 portfolio includes Amoxicillin, Ceftriaxone, Clarithromycin, Colchicine, Dexamethasone, Dobutamine, Fluconazole, Heparin, Levofloxacin, Loperamide, Pantoprazole, Prednisone, Prednisolone, Salbutamol, Vancomycin","Portfolio of 15 generic and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines from Sandoz division addresses urgent unmet needs of low- and lower-middle-income countries to treat patients with COVID-19 symptoms
Portfolio will be sold at zero-profit to governments in up to 791 eligible countries during the pandemic and until a vaccine or curative treatment is available
Early access to treatment for managing COVID-19 symptoms is critical to preventing healthcare system overload
Basel, July 16, 2020 — Today, Novartis announced a new initiative to help patients in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LIC; LMIC) access affordable medicines to treat the major symptoms of COVID-19 – a critical need in the absence of a vaccine or curative treatment. Inflammation and respiratory problems linked to COVID-19 can cause severe medical complications and can lead to death in some people, putting immense strain on fragile healthcare systems.

The Novartis COVID-19 portfolio includes 15 medicines from its Sandoz division for gastro-intestinal illness, acute respiratory symptoms, pneumonia as well as septic shock. The medicines were chosen based on clinical relevance and availability to ensure demand can be met globally.

The medicines will be made available to governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and other institutional customers in up to 79 eligible countries at zero-profit to support financially-strained healthcare systems. Countries will have the flexibility to select the medicines in the portfolio that meet their healthcare needs. Eligible countries must be included on the World Bank’s list of LICs & LMICs1.

“Access to medicine can be a challenge for patients in low- and lower-middle-income countries and the situation has worsened during COVID-19. With our COVID-19 portfolio, we wish to help address the additional healthcare demands of the pandemic in the countries we are targeting,” said Dr Lutz Hegemann, Chief Operating Officer for Global Health at Novartis.

“This initiative builds on our earlier global commitment to keep prices stable for a basket of essential drugs used to treating COVID-19 patients,” said Sandoz CEO Richard Saynor. “The COVID-19 Response Portfolio for low-income and lower-middle-income countries is designed to support governments in treating COVID-19 symptoms before they lead to complications in patients.”

The following medicines are included in the Novartis COVID-19 Response Portfolio:
Amoxicillin, Ceftriaxone, Clarithromycin, Colchicine, Dexamethasone, Dobutamine, Fluconazole, Heparin, Levofloxacin, Loperamide, Pantoprazole, Prednisone, Prednisolone, Salbutamol, Vancomycin.

The portfolio will be offered in addition to the Novartis Access portfolio (on- and off-patent medicines against key non-communicable diseases) via the local Novartis or Sandoz affiliate.

This global pandemic has placed extreme pressure on healthcare systems in low- and lower-income countries. The pandemic response portfolio complements the previously launched Novartis COVID-19 Response Fund to support healthcare workers and communities in over 50 projects around the world.

The COVID-19 medicines portfolio is Novartis latest contribution to the global effort to combat the pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis has been active in two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership organized by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis continues to provide hydroxychloroquine for ongoing investigator-initiated trials (IITs) and upon government requests, as appropriate. The company is also separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. To support access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. Furthermore, AveXis, Novartis gene therapy unit, entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID.

36759,AstraZeneca Report Results of Brilinta (ticagrelor) in P-III THALES Study for Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack,Brilinta significantly reduced the rate of the composite of stroke and death in patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack in the Phase III THALES trial,"The P-III THALES study involves assessing of Brilinta (180mg as a loading dose followed by 90mg, bid) + aspirin vs aspirin as monothx. in 11,000 patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA for 30days
 Results: 17% reduction in 1EPs of stroke and death, 21% reduction in 2EPs of ischaemic stroke, the risk for severe bleeding events (0.1% vs 0.5%); results were consistent with the known safety profile of Brilinta
 Brilinta is approved in 110+ countries to prevent atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS and in 70+ countries for the secondary prevention of CV events among high-risk patients experienced a heart attack. In May’2020, the FDA approved a label update for Brilinta in the US to include the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with CAD","TOR, JUL 16, 2020 08:03 CETDetailed results from the positive Phase III THALES trial showed AstraZeneca’s Brilinta (ticagrelor) 90mg used twice daily and taken with daily aspirin for 30 days, reduced the rate of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death by 17% (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.71, 0.96], p=0.02), compared to aspirin alone in patients who had an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).1

This was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction. Furthermore, aspirin plus Brilinta significantly reduced the rate of the first secondary endpoint of ischaemic stroke by 21%, compared to aspirin alone up to day 30.1 The risk for severe bleeding events was 0.5% in the aspirin plus Brilinta group and 0.1% in the aspirin group. The results were in line with the known safety profile of Brilinta.1

Dr. Clay Johnston, lead investigator for the THALES trial and Dean of the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas in Austin, US, said: “About one in four stroke survivors go on to experience a second stroke, and the risk is particularly high within the first month after the initial event. Early treatment is important to prevent a subsequent stroke that may be disabling or fatal. It is also expected to improve long-term outcomes.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischemic attack may experience a subsequent, potentially avoidable stroke. Results from the Phase III THALES trial confirm that aspirin plus Brilinta has the potential to be a new effective treatment option for these high-risk patients and we look forward to continuing discussions with regulatory authorities.”

Results from the THALES trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

This month, AstraZeneca announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and granted Priority Review for Brilinta for the reduction of subsequent stroke in patients who experienced an acute ischemic stroke or TIA based on the Phase III THALES trial. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for this supplemental application, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2020.

Brilinta is approved in more than 110 countries for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in more than 70 countries for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among high-risk patients who have experienced a heart attack. In May 2020, the FDA approved a label update for Brilinta in the US to include the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

Stroke

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with 6.2 million stroke-related deaths in 2017, from which 2.7 million were due to ischaemic stroke.2 Patients who experience an acute ischaemic stroke or TIA are at high risk of developing subsequent ischaemic events, with particularly high risk within 30 days after the initial event and the highest risk period being the first 24 hours after the initial event.3

THALES

THALES is an AstraZeneca-sponsored, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, international, multicentre, event-driven trial involving more than 11,000 patients from 28 countries. It tested the hypothesis whether aspirin plus Brilinta is superior to aspirin alone in preventing the composite of stroke and death in patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA. Patients were randomised within 24 hours of onset of acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA symptoms and followed-up for 30 days of treatment. Study treatments were Brilinta 180mg loading dose on day 1 as soon as possible after randomisation, followed by 90mg twice daily on days 2–30, or matching placebo. All patients received open-label aspirin 300–325mg on day 1, followed by 75–100mg once daily on days 2–30. The primary efficacy outcome was the time to the composite endpoint of stroke and death at 30 days. The primary safety outcome is time to first severe bleeding event according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definition, which includes fatal bleedings, intracranial haemorrhage; and bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention. Patients were followed for an additional 30 days on standard of care.

Brilinta

Brilinta is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. Brilinta, together with aspirin, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (heart attack, stroke or CV death), in patients with ACS or a history of heart attack.

Brilinta, co-administered with aspirin, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS, or for patients with a history of MI and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.

AstraZeneca in CVRM

Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism (CVRM) together forms one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company. By following the science to understand more clearly the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas, AstraZeneca is investing in a portfolio of medicines to protect organs and improve outcomes by slowing disease progression, reducing risks and tackling comorbidities.

We look forward to generating clinical data demonstrating the effect of Tumor Treating Fields concurrent with KEYTRUDA in first-line NSCLC.”

About Lung Cancer

Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Each year, more people die from lung cancer than from colon and breast cancers combined. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85 percent of all cases. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the U.S. with NSCLC is approximately 24 percent.

About Tumor Treating Fields

Tumor Treating Fields is a cancer therapy that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth and causing cancer cells to die. Tumor Treating Fields does not stimulate or heat tissue and targets dividing cancer cells of a specific size. Tumor Treating Fields causes minimal damage to healthy cells. Mild to moderate skin irritation is the most common side effect reported. Tumor Treating Fields is approved in certain countries for the treatment of adults with glioblastoma and in the U.S. for mesothelioma, two of the most difficult cancer types to treat. The therapy shows promise in multiple solid tumor types – including some of the most aggressive forms of cancer.

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review the New Drug Application (NDA) for vericiguat, an orally administered soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization following a worsening heart failure event in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), in combination with other heart failure therapies. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, of Jan. 20, 2021. Vericiguat is being jointly developed with Bayer AG.

“This submission builds on Merck’s commitment to patients with cardiovascular disease and long legacy of advancing cardiovascular research to meet unmet medical needs,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to working with the FDA as they review this New Drug Application for vericiguat.”

The application is based on results from the Phase 3 VICTORIA trial, which is the first contemporary outcomes study focused exclusively on a population with worsening chronic heart failure who are at high risk for cardiovascular mortality and repeated heart failure hospitalizations. Data from VICTORIA were presented at the virtual American College of Cardiology’s 69th Annual Scientific Session together with World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.20/WCC) and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

About the VICTORIA Trial

VICTORIA (NCT02861534) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, double-blind, Phase 3 study of vericiguat versus placebo when given in combination with available heart failure therapies in patients with worsening chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV), a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of <45% within 12 months prior to randomization following a decompensation event. The primary endpoint of the study was the composite of time to first occurrence of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death. Secondary endpoints included time to occurrence of cardiovascular death, time to first occurrence of heart failure hospitalization, time to total heart failure hospitalizations (including first and recurrent events), time to the composite of all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization, and time to all-cause mortality.

The study enrolled a total of 5,050 patients who were randomly selected to receive either vericiguat once daily (titrated up to 10 mg) or placebo when given in combination with available heart failure therapies. The study was co-sponsored by Merck and Bayer, conducted under the scientific oversight of the Canadian VIGOUR Centre and the Duke Clinical Research Institute, and executed by Merck in more than 600 centers in 42 countries including in Europe, Japan, China and the U.S.

About Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction

HFrEF, formerly known as systolic heart failure, is characterized by the compromised ability of the heart to eject blood sufficiently during its contraction phase. In the U.S., 6.5 million people have heart failure, and approximately 40-50% of these patients have HFrEF. Annually, approximately 30% of patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure will experience worsening of the disease, which is marked by progressive symptoms and/or a recent heart failure event. Approximately half of patients with worsening chronic HFrEF are rehospitalized within 30 days of a worsening event, and an estimated one in five patients with worsening chronic HFrEF will die within two years.

 Kronos to acquire the two clinical-phase assets along with the rest of Gilead’s portfolio of SYK inhibitors. The portfolio includes entospletinib, being evaluated in P-I & II study in oncology patients, and lanraplenib that has been evaluated in P-II trials for autoimmune diseases
 Kronos plans to initially focus on a biomarker-defined subset of AML patients. The focus indicates that SYK inhibition showed promising clinical activity in AML patients with cancers that overexpress the HOXA9 and MEIS1 transcription factors. Additionally, Entospletinib demonstrated positive clinical data in its early studies","Strengthens Kronos’ clinical development pipeline and long-term commitment to leverage transcriptional regulatory networks to unlock historically undruggable targets in oncology

Includes two clinical stage SYK inhibitors (entospletinib and lanraplenib) with initial development planned in biomarker defined subset of acute myelogenous leukemia

SAN MATEO, Calif. & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Kronos Bio, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of novel cancer therapeutics designed to transform patient outcomes by targeting dysregulated transcription, today announced that it has entered into an asset purchase agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. to acquire Gilead’s spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor portfolio. The portfolio includes the clinical stage compounds entospletinib, which has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in oncology patients, and lanraplenib, which has been evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with autoimmune diseases.
“Kronos is uniquely positioned to advance these differentiated and selective SYK inhibitors by leveraging our expertise in oncology and transcriptional regulatory networks,” said Norbert Bischofberger, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Kronos. “We believe the acquisition of these compounds not only propels us more quickly into clinical development but also brings us closer to our goal of transforming patient outcomes.”

Kronos intends to initially focus on developing the SYK inhibitor program in a biomarker-defined subset of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). SYK is a critical node in AML overexpressing the HOXA9 and MEIS1 transcription factors. HOXA9 and MEIS1 become dysregulated as a result of recurring mutations found in up to one half of AML patients.

“Despite recent advancements in AML, there remains a substantial need for targeted therapies that can extend life,” said John Byrd, M.D., D. Warren Brown Chair of Leukemia Research, and Distinguished University Professor of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and Chief Medical Officer of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Beat AML Trial. “SYK inhibition has demonstrated promising activity in clinical trials of AML patients who have high HOXA9/MEIS1 expression and is an optimal target for further clinical research to understand how HOXA9/MEIS1 dysregulation drives AML in these patients. The Beat AML Trial directed by The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society has partnered closely with Gilead and looks forward to continued close collaboration with Kronos Bio.”

Entospletinib has produced promising early clinical data in a biomarker-defined subset of AML patients (Liu, et al. EHA poster abstract PF246, 2018). Entospletinib has been investigated in over 500 patients across six Gilead sponsored studies in a variety of hematologic malignancies, including AML, demonstrating activity as a single-agent and in combination with standard-of-care.

Lanraplenib has been investigated in over 250 patients across seven Gilead sponsored studies in various autoimmune diseases. Its pharmaceutical properties may make it a commercially attractive next generation product candidate.

Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead will receive an upfront cash payment and a note convertible into Kronos equity, and will be eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties on future sales of products arising from the acquired programs.

36893,Kiniksa's Rilonacept Receives the US FDA's Orphan Drug Designation to Treat Pericarditis,Kiniksa Announces U.S. Orphan Drug Designation for Rilonacept for the Treatment of Pericarditis,"The US FDA has granted ODD for Kiniksa’s Rilonacept to treat pericarditis, which includes recurrent pericarditis. The company plans to submit sBLA in recurrent pericarditis to the US FDA in late 2020
 Earlier, the company has reported the results of P-III RHAPSODY study that met its all 1EPs & 2EPs showing that the therapy improved clinical outcomes associated with the unmet medical need in recurrent pericarditis
 Rilonacept (SC, qw) is a recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL-1α and IL-1β signaling and has received the US FDA’s BT designation in 2019. In 2017, Regeneron out-licensed rilonacept to Kiniksa for recurrent pericarditis under which Regeneron will receive equal profit on sales of the therapy, if approved in the US","HAMILTON, Bermuda, July 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Nasdaq: KNSA) (“Kiniksa”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing therapeutic medicines for patients with significant unmet medical need, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation for rilonacept for the treatment of pericarditis, which includes recurrent pericarditis. Rilonacept is a weekly, subcutaneously-injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) signaling.

“Orphan Drug designation for rilonacept for the treatment of pericarditis, along with the Breakthrough Therapy designation for recurrent pericarditis and the recent highly statistically significant pivotal Phase 3 data, represent important advances toward bringing a potential treatment solution to patients suffering from this debilitating autoinflammatory disease,” said Sanj K. Patel, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Kiniksa. “We look forward to submitting an sBLA in recurrent pericarditis to the FDA later this year and are actively preparing for commercialization.”

Kiniksa recently reported positive data from RHAPSODY, a pivotal Phase 3 trial of rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis. RHAPSODY met its prespecified primary and all major secondary efficacy endpoints, showing that rilonacept improved clinically-meaningful outcomes associated with the unmet medical need in recurrent pericarditis.

Rilonacept was discovered and developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) and is approved by the FDA under the brand name ARCALYST® for the treatment of for Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). Kiniksa licensed rilonacept from Regeneron in 2017 for evaluation in diseases believed to be mediated by both IL-1α and IL-1β, including recurrent pericarditis. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to rilonacept for recurrent pericarditis in 2019. Based on the Phase 3 RHAPSODY data, the Biologic License Application (BLA) for CAPS will transfer to Kiniksa, and the company plans to submit a supplemental Biologic License Application (sBLA) in recurrent pericarditis to the FDA later this year. Upon receipt of FDA approval for rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis, Kiniksa would assume the sales and distribution of rilonacept for the approved indications in the United States and would evenly split profits on sales with Regeneron.

About Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA grants Orphan Drug designation status to products that treat rare diseases, providing incentives to sponsors developing drugs or biologics. The FDA defines rare diseases as those affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. at the time of designation. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user‑fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances. Additionally, orphan drug designation waives the requirement to conduct pediatric studies for the product in the disease it is designated.

About Recurrent Pericarditis
Recurrent pericarditis is a painful and debilitating autoinflammatory cardiovascular disease that typically presents with chest pain and is often associated with changes in electrical conduction and sometimes buildup of fluid around the heart, called pericardial effusion. Patients with pericarditis are deemed recurrent if they have an additional episode after a symptom-free period of 4-6 weeks and chronic if symptoms from any one episode last longer than three months. Recurrent pericarditis symptoms impair qualify of life, limit physical activities, and lead to frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for recurrent pericarditis.

About RHAPSODY
RHAPSODY is the global, randomized withdrawal design, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis. Eligible patients presented at screening with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain of ≥ 4 on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) value ≥ 1 mg/dL within the 7-day period prior to first study drug administration. Patients could have been receiving concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or colchicine and/or oral corticosteroid treatment in any combination. The study was comprised of 4 periods: a screening period; a single-blind run-in period during which patients received a loading dose of rilonacept 320 mg injected subcutaneously (SC) followed by 160 mg SC weekly while background pericarditis medications were tapered and discontinued; a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal period during which clinical responders to rilonacept were randomized 1:1 and received 160 mg SC weekly rilonacept or placebo; and a long-term extension treatment period with up to 24 months of open-label rilonacept 160 mg SC weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint was time-to-first pericarditis-recurrence in the randomized withdrawal period. The Clinical Endpoint Committee adjudicated all suspected pericarditis recurrences for inclusion in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. The co-principal investigators are Dr. Allan Klein of Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Massimo Imazio of the University of Torino, Italy. For more information, refer to ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03737110.

About Rilonacept
Rilonacept is a weekly, subcutaneously-injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL-1α and IL-1β signaling. Rilonacept was discovered and developed by Regeneron and is approved by the FDA under the brand name ARCALYST® for the treatment of CAPS, specifically Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome. Rilonacept for the treatment of deficiency of the interleukin‑1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) is currently pending FDA approval following the submission of an sBLA in June 2020. Rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis is an investigational drug. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to rilonacept for recurrent pericarditis in 2019 and Orphan Drug designation to rilonacept for pericarditis in 2020.

Important information about ARCALYST® (rilonacept) Injection
IL-1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections. Serious, life-threatening infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST. ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Taking ARCALYST with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections.

Patients should not receive a live vaccine while taking ARCALYST. It is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. In the initial development program for ARCALYST, six serious adverse reactions were reported by four patients: Mycobacterium intracellular infection, gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis, sinusitis and bronchitis and Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with ARCALYST were injection site reaction and upper respiratory tract infection. Patients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if warranted. Treatment with immunosuppressants, including ARCALYST, may result in an increase in risk of malignancies. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration in clinical studies have been rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of ARCALYST should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated.

The safety profile was consistent with previously disclosed results for mirikizumab and known safety findings of other drugs in the IL23p19 class.

“The results from this study are promising to people around the world who are burdened by psoriasis and Lilly is grateful to the patients, providers and investigators for advancing science to benefit patients with immunologic conditions,” said Patrik Jonsson, senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. “We look forward to bringing mirikizumab to market to provide patients with an additional treatment option that has the potential to provide near complete or complete skin clearance as measured by PASI 90 and PASI 100, with sustained results at 52 weeks.”

The OASIS program demonstrates Lilly’s continued commitment to developing new treatment options in dermatology. In addition to mirikizumab in psoriasis, Lilly is studying other treatments for atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata, a disease without an FDA-approved medicine.

“We are pleased with the positive results observed in the mirikizumab psoriasis development program (OASIS). Mirikizumab has the potential to be a meaningful treatment option for people living with psoriasis,” said Andrew Blauvelt, M.D., M.B.A., president of Oregon Medical Research Center and a lead investigator in the OASIS program. “The data builds on our understanding of IL-23 inhibition in psoriasis and possible future applications.”

In OASIS-2, the primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a Static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) of (0,1) with at least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) at Week 16 compared to placebo. Similar endpoints were evaluated at Week 16 as key secondary endpoints compared to Cosentyx. Other key secondary endpoints compared to placebo at Week 16 include the proportion of patients with at least a 75 and 100 percent improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75/PASI 100).

Key secondary endpoints at Week 52 compared to Cosentyx included the proportion of patients with a Static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) of (0,1) with at least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with at least a 90 and 100 percent improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90/PASI 100).

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (≥5%) during the induction period (up to Week 16) were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory infections and during the combined induction and maintenance treatment periods (up to Week 52) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, headache, back pain, and arthralgia. The frequency of serious adverse events was comparable across treatment arms during the induction period (<2.5%) and combined induction and maintenance periods up to 52 weeks (<6%).

The full OASIS-2 study results will be disclosed at future congresses. Phase 3 clinical trials are ongoing for mirikizumab in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, an area where there are limited treatment options and patients are currently underserved. After pausing enrollment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these studies have resumed enrolling patients. Lilly expects topline results for the Phase 3 induction data in ulcerative colitis in the spring of 2021 and for the Phase 3 Crohn’s data in 2022.

About Mirikizumab
Mirikizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23. Mirikizumab is being studied for the treatment of immune diseases, including psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

About the OASIS-2 Trial
OASIS-2 is a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of mirikizumab to placebo and Cosentyx (secukinumab) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 1,465 patients were randomized in the study in a 4:4:4:1 ratio to one of the following induction and maintenance period treatments: a) 250 mg mirikizumab at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 followed by 250 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) starting at Week 16; b) 250 mg mirikizumab at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 followed by 125 mg Q8W starting at Week 16; c) 300 mg secukinumab at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, followed by 300 mg Q4W starting at Week 4; d) placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, followed by 250 mg mirikizumab every 4 weeks (Q4W) starting at Week 16 through Week 32 followed by Q8W thereafter. Dosing was via subcutaneous injection for all treatments.

About Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic disease that occurs when the immune system sends out faulty signals that speed up the growth cycle of skin cells, causing raised, red, scaly patches to appear on the skin.1 Psoriasis affects approximately 125 million people worldwide, approximately 20 percent of whom have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.1,2 There are five types of psoriasis. The most common form of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis, appears as raised, red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells.1

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 16, 2020 – Oncorus, Inc., a viral immunotherapies company focused on driving innovation to transform outcomes for cancer patients, today announced that it has initiated a Phase 1 study of its lead product candidate, ONCR-177, an intratumorally administered oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) viral immunotherapy being developed for multiple solid tumor indications. The Phase 1 open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose as well as preliminary anti-tumor activity of ONCR-177 alone and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD1-1, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced and/or refractory cutaneous, subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors.

“Initiating our first-in-human study of ONCR-177 is a significant milestone, bringing us a major step closer to delivering on our mission to realize the full promise of viral immunotherapy for cancer patients across multiple indications, including some of the most notoriously difficult-to-treat types of cancer,” said Theodore (Ted) A. Ashburn, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Oncorus. “Our oHSV Platform represents a potential breakthrough for the viral immunotherapy class due to the multiple proprietary innovations our team has developed to activate multiple arms of the immune system to enhance potency while balancing safety.”

Dr. Ashburn continued, “A huge thank you to our team and collaborators for their tremendous effort preparing for this study amidst the unprecedented challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m proud and honored to work with such a bright, dedicated and patient-driven group of people.”

“While we have seen great success with immuno-oncology as an approach in some patients, these therapies have not benefited all patients with cancer and new strategies are needed,” said Shiraj Sen, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Director, Drug Development Unit, Sarah Cannon Research Institute at HealthONE in Denver, Colorado. “Given its differentiated profile, ONCR-177 has the potential to enable more patients to respond to, and realize the benefits of, immuno-oncology treatment. We are pleased to be part of this important first-in-human study of this next-generation viral immunotherapy.” Dr. Sen is a site investigator for the ONCR-177 Phase 1 study, and his site enrolled and dosed the first patient in this trial.

John Goldberg, M.D., Senior Vice President of Clinical Development at Oncorus, commented, “We are privileged to be working with preeminent cancer research institutions and leading researchers on the execution of this study. We are also thrilled to enter a clinical collaboration with Merck to study ONCR-177 in combination with KEYTRUDA, which is a key component of the trial. Above all, we are humbled to now be in a study in patients with ONCR-177 and believe in its potential to become a foundational component of oncologists’ anti-tumor arsenal. Our team is motivated by the courage of cancer patients and driven to enable every patient to win their war against this disease.”

Oncorus has designed its proprietary oHSV Platform to develop improved intratumorally administered viral immunotherapies that have the potential to enhance potency without sacrificing safety, a challenge that has been encountered by earlier generation programs in this class. ONCR-177 is designed to mount a powerful, multidimensional attack on cancer; it induces immunogenic cancer cell death and ignites innate and adaptive immunity to drive a lasting and systemic anti-tumor response. In addition to its oncolytic activity, ONCR-177 is armed with five immunomodulatory transgenes: IL-12, CCL4, FLT3LG, and antagonists of clinically proven immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4. This represents a greater payload capacity than viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development.

In preclinical studies, ONCR-177 was shown to stimulate multiples arms of the immune system, drive abscopal activity and prolong survival while limiting systemic exposure to transgene products, such as IL-12, that generally cannot be safely dosed systemically due to toxicities.

ONCR-177 retains full replication competency to enable potent tumor cell killing. It also incorporates two highly innovative approaches — the use of microRNA target sequences and a proprietary mutation engineered in an HSV-1 protein, known as UL37 — to allow for tumor-specific replication, which restricts viral activity to tumor cells while sparing normal tissues.

About the Phase 1 ONCR-177 Study

The first part of the study involves a monotherapy dose escalation of ONCR-177 and will enroll approximately 21 cancer patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom surgical resection or locoregional therapy is not indicated, and who are refractory to, ineligible for, relapsed from and/or intolerant of standard of care treatment or have a disease for which no standard of care exists. The Phase 1 trial will escalate the dose of ONCR-177 until the recommended phase 2 dose is determined.

Upon determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, the study will then enroll patients to histology- specific expansion cohorts to demonstrate safety and initial efficacy of ONCR-177 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA, in addition to enabling biomarker exploration. The expansion cohorts will enroll patients with solid tumors who are refractory to, ineligible for, relapsed from and/or intolerant of standard of care treatment or have a disease for which no standard of care exists, including patients with breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and melanoma.

Companies to collaborate on mRNA vaccine and monoclonal antibody research programmes in infectious diseases
GSK to make equity investment of £130m (€150m) in CureVac, and an upfront payment of £104m (€120m)
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and CureVac today announced the signing of a strategic collaboration agreement for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialisation of up to five mRNA-based vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting infectious disease pathogens. The collaboration complements GSK’s existing mRNA capabilities with CureVac’s integrated mRNA platform.

mRNA (messenger RNA) technology is a rapidly progressing, cutting-edge platform for the development of new vaccines and medicines, potentially expanding the range of diseases which can be prevented or treated, while also promising to significantly speed up development and manufacturing. mRNA enables protein synthesis in the human body, carrying the genetic code required for cells to manufacture and express proteins. By using mRNA technology in vaccines and medicines, specific proteins, or antigens, can be produced by the body’s own cells, enabling the human immune system to prevent or fight disease.

CureVac’s leadership in mRNA technology, along with its mRNA manufacturing capability, complements GSK’s existing scientific leadership in vaccines, including GSK’s own self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccine technology platform, and further builds on GSK’s growing capability in mAbs innovation, aligned to its R&D focus on the science of immunology. Advancing mRNA-based vaccine and treatment technologies is also expected to play a role in further improving response against future pandemics.

Roger Connor, President GSK Vaccines, said: “GSK’s self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccine technology has shown us the potential of mRNA technology to advance the science of vaccine development, and CureVac’s experience complements our own expertise. Through the application of mRNA technology, including SAM, we hope to be able to develop and scale up advanced vaccines and therapies to treat and prevent infectious diseases quicker than ever before.”

Dr. Franz-Werner Haas, acting Chief Executive Officer of CureVac, added: “We are delighted to partner with GSK. With this collaboration, we are gaining a world-class partner whose expertise and global footprint will allow us to further develop and translate the value of our platform into potential products for the world.”

The companies will combine their mRNA expertise on development opportunities across a range of infectious disease pathogens, selected with the potential to best leverage the advantages of this platform technology, while addressing significant unmet medical need and economic burden. CureVac’s existing COVID-19 mRNA and rabies vaccines research programmes are not included in the collaboration announced today.

Under the terms of the deal, GSK will make an equity investment in CureVac of £130m (€150m), representing close to a 10% stake, an upfront cash payment of £104m (€120m) and a one-time reimbursable payment of £26m (€30m) for manufacturing capacity reservation, upon certification of CureVac’s commercial scale manufacturing facility currently under construction in Germany.

CureVac will be eligible to receive development and regulatory milestone payments of up to £277m (€320m), commercial milestone payments of up to £329m (€380m) and tiered royalties on product sales.

GSK will fund R&D activities at CureVac related to the development projects covered by the collaboration. CureVac will be responsible for the preclinical- and clinical-development through Phase 1 trials of these projects, after which GSK will be responsible for further development and commercialisation. CureVac will be responsible for the GMP manufacturing of the product candidates, including for commercialisation, and will retain commercialisation rights for selected countries for all product candidates.

PicnicHealth is gathering medical records data from proactively consenting patients, de-identifying it to ensure patient data privacy (HIPAA and CCPA compliant) and then aggregating it with the goal of deepening the scientific understanding of serious diseases. In the partnership with Roche and Genentech, the companies are working together to generate insights that can be used to advance the development of treatments for better patient outcomes. Following initial efforts focused on multiple sclerosis (MS), PicnicHealth, Roche and Genentech recently expanded their collaboration to support Huntington’s disease (HD), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and hemophilia.

In MS, for example, the companies are working together in a multi-year collaboration that combines over seven years of retrospective medical record data with five years of prospective data for 5,000 patients. The multi-modal data set combines real-world clinical outcomes with MRI images in MS, and allows a deeper understanding of the natural history and progression of such a complex, heterogeneous disease. The data brings together patients’ experiences across all sites of care and will help facilitate a better understanding of MS treatment patterns and therapeutic outcomes in the real world.

“At PicnicHealth we are proud to work together with patients to unlock the important information from medical records that is usually stored in disparate and disorganized systems, and leveraging it to advance research,” said Noga Leviner, CEO PicnicHealth. “We’re excited to connect our deep understanding of patient data with the scientific expertise of Roche and Genentech in a joint quest to create personalized treatments for patients.”

James Sabry, Head of Roche Pharma Partnering stated, “Our strategic partnership with PicnicHealth will allow us to better understand serious diseases and accelerate development of effective treatments tailored to the individual needs of patients. By combining PicnicHealth’s uniquely built and curated real-world data sets with groundbreaking science we are aiming to make personalized healthcare a reality across multiple therapeutic areas. ”

Advancing Medical Research with Machine Learning

PicnicHealth uses advanced human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITL ML) to structure medical record data including typical EMR fields, like labs and diagnoses, and also disease-specific elements abstracted from doctors’ notes and reports. As part of the collaboration, data is enriched with unique additions including MRI images, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and linkage to data outside of the medical records. The approach of working directly with patients, who go through an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent process and get access to PicincHealth’s medical record management platform as a benefit of participation, allows PicnicHealth to get records from every site of care for each individual patient. The HITL technology platform, which combines PicnicHealth’s proprietary algorithms with human curation, enables PicnicHealth to ingest and make meaningful use of records from any medical facility in the US, in any format, regardless of hospital system or what electronic medical record system they use.

About PicnicHealth

PicnicHealth is a healthcare technology company that partners with patients, porting their complete medical records into an easy-to-use online application. The platform gives patients unprecedented access to and control over their medical records and, with their consent, the opportunity to contribute this valuable data to further scientific research. PicnicHealth was founded in 2014 by Noga Leviner and Troy Astorino. Learn more at Picnichealth.com.

37027,Quest Diagnostic Receives the US FDA's First EUA for Sample Pooling in COVID-19,FDA Authorizes Quest Diagnostics COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing for Specimen Pooling for Emergency Use,"The US FDA has authorized Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test for use with pooled samples containing up to 4 individual swab specimens collected under observation. The Quest test is the first COVID-19 diagnostic test to be authorized for use with pooled samples
 Quest Diagnostic expects to deploy the technique at its laboratories in Chantilly, VA and Marlborough, Mass., by the end of next week with additional laboratories to follow
 The company has received the FDA’s EUA for use of self-collection molecular diagnostic kit on the Hologic and Roche’s platforms, expanding use with healthcare provider supervision via telemedicine","SECAUCUS, N.J., July 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX), the world’s leading provider of diagnostic information services, today announced that it has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use specimen pooling with its proprietary molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19. Quest is the first lab provider to receive FDA authorization for the technique for COVID-19 testing in the United States.

In pooling, specimens must still be collected into individual vials, but then are combined into small batches or pools by the laboratory. A negative result for a batch means that all patients in that pool are considered negative (If a positive result occurs for the batch, each specimen is retested individually). The technique is an efficient way to evaluate patients in regions or populations with low rates of disease. Pooling is used routinely in blood banking to screen donated blood for a variety of viruses, among other applications.

With the new pooling EUA, the Quest Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RNA (“Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR”) test* may be used with pooled upper respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal, mid-turbinate, anterior nares or oropharyngeal swabs). **In clinical data presented by Quest to the FDA, none of 3,091 total specimens from a population with a prevalence rate of 1-10 percent, if pooled, would have been incorrectly determined to be negative (95%CI 0.0-0.1%).

The company expects to deploy the technique at its laboratories in Chantilly, VA and Marlborough, Mass., by the end of next week with additional laboratories to follow.

“As COVID-19 continues to spread around the country, access to timely, quality laboratory testing is critical to patients and an effective public health response,” said Steve Rusckowski, Chairman, CEO and President, Quest Diagnostics. “Pooled specimen testing is a proven technique that will help us to optimize testing capacity at this critical time for our country.”

“We applaud FDA for taking this important step to empower Quest to increase capacity across our national laboratory network,” said Jay G. Wohlgemuth, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Quest Diagnostics. “Pooling will help expand testing capacity but it is not a magic bullet, and testing times will continue to be strained as long as soaring COVID-19 test demand outpaces capacity. Each of us can practice behaviors that will reduce COVID-19 infections in our communities, so our national healthcare system can better respond to this crisis.”

On July 13, 2020, Quest issued a statement that soaring demand for COVID-19 molecular diagnostics is slowing turnaround times to report results.

FDA EUAs for Telemedicine Self-Collection
Yesterday, the FDA also granted three emergency use authorizations to Quest Diagnostics for the use of its Quest Diagnostics Self-Collection Kit with the Hologic Panther Fusion, Hologic Aptima and Roche cobas molecular platforms. The new EUAs expand the use of the self-collection kit beyond the EUA, granted on May 27th, for the use of the kit on the Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test. The company expects the new EUAs will allow it to use self-collection more broadly on behalf of clients and patients in the United States. Self-collected specimens that were not observed by a healthcare professional are not eligible for pooling.

New FDA EUAs Follows EUAs for Other Quest Innovations
Quest Diagnostics is a leader in infectious disease testing services, with a broad menu of molecular, antibody, and other test services to aid diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. The new FDA EUAs follow several others received by the company for its COVID-19 test innovations.

In March 2020, Quest received FDA EUA for The Quest Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Qualitative Real-Time RT-PCR (“Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR”), a real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens collected from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. In May 2020, the company received an FDA EUA to use the test nasal swab specimens that are self-collected at home or in a healthcare setting by individuals using an authorized home-collection kit when determined to be appropriate by a healthcare provider.

*The Quest Diagnostics molecular test and self-collection kit have not been FDA cleared or approved, have been authorized by FDA under an EUA, and have been authorized only for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens. The test and self-collection kit are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

**The Quest Diagnostics molecular test is also for use with pooled samples containing up to four individual upper respiratory swab specimens (nasopharyngeal, mid-turbinate, anterior nares or oropharyngeal swabs) collected under observation in individual vials containing transport media from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Negative results from pooled testing should not be treated as definitive. If patient’s clinical signs and symptoms are inconsistent with a negative result or results are necessary for patient management, then the patient should be considered for individual testing. Specimens included in pools with a positive, inconclusive, or invalid result must be tested individually prior to reporting a result. Specimens with low viral loads may not be detected in sample pools due to the decreased sensitivity of pooled testing.

37045,AstraZeneca and Oxford University's AZD1222 Delivers Dual Immune Response in its P-II/III COV001 Study Against COVID-19,COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 showed robust immune responses in all participants in Phase I/II trial,"The P-II/III COV001 designed to determine the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the AZD1222 (single dose or two doses of AZD1222 at 5×1010 viral particles) vs single dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control vaccine in up to 1,077 healthy adults aged 18-55yrs. in 5 trial centers in the UK
 The study demonstrated that a single dose of the AZD1222 resulted in 4 times increase in Abs to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein in 95% of participants one month after injection. A T-cell response was induced in all the participants, which was maintained two months after vaccination, as per the interim results. The peak response was noted by day 14
 91% of participants showed neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2 following a single dose of AZD1222 and 100% following a second dose. The levels of neutralizing Abs seen in participants receiving either one/ two doses were in a similar range to those seen in convalescent COVID-19 patients","Interim data showed strong antibody and T-cell responses
 
Interim results from the ongoing Phase I/II COV001 trial, led by Oxford University, showed AZD1222 was tolerated and generated robust immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in all evaluated participants.

COV001 is a blinded, multi-centre, randomised controlled Phase I/II trial with 1,077 healthy adult participants, aged 18-55 years. It assessed a single dose of AZD1222 against a comparator meningococcal conjugate vaccine, MenACWY. Ten participants also received two doses of AZD1222 one month apart.

The results published in The Lancet confirmed a single dose of AZD1222 resulted in a four-fold increase in antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein in 95% of participants one month after injection. In all participants, a T-cell response was induced, peaking by day 14, and maintained two months after injection.

Neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 (as assessed by the MNA80 assay) was seen in 91% of participants one month after vaccination and in 100% of participants who received a second dose. The levels of neutralising antibodies seen in participants receiving either one or two doses were in a similar range to those seen in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Strong correlations were observed across neutralisation assays.

The early safety responses confirmed that transient local and systemic reactions were common in the AZD1222 group and were comparable to previous trials and other adenoviral vector vaccines.1-4 They included temporary injection site pain and tenderness, mild-to-moderate headache, fatigue, chills, feverishness, malaise and muscle ache. No serious adverse events were reported with AZD1222, and reactions were lessened with the use of prophylactic paracetamol, a pain killer, and occurred less frequently after a second dose.

Professor Andrew Pollard, Chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford University and co-author of the trial, said: “The interim Phase I/II data for our coronavirus vaccine shows that the vaccine did not lead to any unexpected reactions and had a similar safety profile to previous vaccines of this type. The immune responses observed following vaccination are in line with what we expect will be associated with protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, although we must continue with our rigorous clinical trial programme to confirm this. We saw the strongest immune response in participants who received two doses of the vaccine, indicating that this might be a good strategy for vaccination.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “We are encouraged by the Phase I/II interim data showing AZD1222 was capable of generating a rapid antibody and T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2. While there is more work to be done, today’s data increases our confidence that the vaccine will work and allows us to continue our plans to manufacture the vaccine at scale for broad and equitable access around the world.”

Late-stage Phase II/III trials are currently underway in the UK, Brazil and South Africa and are due to start in the US. Trials will determine how well the vaccine will protect from the COVID-19 disease and measure safety and immune responses in different age ranges and at various doses.

In parallel, AstraZeneca continues to fulfil its commitment for broad and equitable access to the vaccine, should late-stage clinical trials prove successful. So far, commitments to supply more than two billion doses of the vaccine have been agreed with the UK, US, Europe’s Inclusive Vaccines Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and Serum Institute of India.

Financial considerations

Today’s announcement is not anticipated to impact the Company’s financial guidance for 2020 as expenses to progress the vaccine are anticipated to be offset by funding by governments and international organisations.

Immune correlates of protection to COVID-19 disease5

Correlates of protection for a vaccine against COVID-19 have not yet been defined. High levels of neutralising antibodies have been demonstrated in individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, emerging data suggest that a T-cell response could play an important role in mitigation of the disease. Some individuals who have been infected with the virus but remained asymptomatic, have developed a robust T-cell response with an absence of detectable antibodies. Rapid induction of antibodies and T-cells against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be important in protection against COVID-19.

COV001

COV001 is a Phase I/II single-blinded randomised controlled trial to determine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate AZD1222 in up to 1,077 healthy adults in five trial centres in the UK. Participants aged 18-55 years received either a single dose or two doses of AZD1222 at 5×1010 viral particles, or a single dose of a meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY as control vaccine.

Participants had blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunogenicity at day 0, 28 and will also be followed at day 184 and 364. In addition, participants enrolled in the Phase I component of the study and in the two dose groups, had visits at 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after each vaccination.

AZD1222

AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

MAINZ, Germany and NEW YORK, July 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced initial data from their ongoing German Phase 1/2, open-label, non-randomized, non-placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, that is part of the global mRNA-based vaccine program against SARS-CoV-2. The data are available on an online preprint server at medRxiv and are concurrently undergoing scientific peer-review for potential publication.

The preliminary clinical results are for the most advanced investigational vaccine candidate in Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine program against SARS-CoV-2, BNT162b1. This vaccine candidate is a lipid nanoparticle formulated, nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antigen. Overall, the new preliminary data from this German study support and expand upon the recently disclosed early results from the corresponding U.S. trial with BNT162b1.

Preliminary data for BNT162b1 in the German Phase 1/2 trial were evaluated with a total of 60 healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age enrolled in the study. Of these 60 participants, 12 subjects per dose level (1 µg, 10 µg, 30 µg, and 50 µg; 48 participants in total) were vaccinated with BNT162b1 on day 1 and day 22 (n=12 per prime-boost cohort, except n=11 for the 10 µg and 50 µg cohorts from day 22 on). Furthermore, 12 participants received a single injection of 60 µg.

The vaccine elicited high, dose level-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing titers and RBD-binding IgG concentrations after the second dose. Day 43 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing geometric mean titers were in the range of 0.7-fold (1 µg) to 3.2-fold (50 µg) compared to that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 infection convalescent human sera. Furthermore, sera of vaccinated subjects displayed broadly neutralizing activity in pseudovirus neutralization assays across a panel of sixteen SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants represented in publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences and against the newly dominant D614G strain.

In addition, the initial German trial results demonstrate, for the first time for the BNT62b1 candidate, a concurrent induction of high level CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

The strength of T cell responses varied between subjects. There was no clear dose level dependency of the T cell response between 1 µg to 50 µg, indicating that stimulation and robust expansion of T cells might be accomplished at low mRNA dose levels.

All subjects in the prime-boost cohorts, except for two at the lowest dose level, had CD4+ T cell responses. Cytokine profiling of the RBD-specific CD4+ T cells demonstrated a TH1-dominant profile for these cells. 29 of the 36 tested subjects also mounted an RBD-specific functional, CD8+ T cell response that was comparable to memory responses observed against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and influenza virus.

Overall, the data suggested that BNT162b1 could potentially be administered safely, with a manageable tolerability profile. Local reactions and systemic events after injection with BNT162b1 at all dose levels were transient, generally mild to moderate, with occasional severe events (Grade 3) of flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions. All adverse events resolved spontaneously and were managed with simple measures. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported, and there were no withdrawals due to adverse events related to the vaccine.

“It is encouraging that the data on BNT162b1 from the German study cohort are very much in line with what we have seen in the U.S. study cohort. The preliminary data indicate that our mRNA-based vaccine was able to stimulate antibody as well as T-cell responses at remarkably low dose levels. We believe both may play an important role in achieving effective clearance of a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2,” said Özlem Türeci, M.D., CMO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

“These interim results from the German study, combined with initial data from the U.S. study, highlight the potential of this mRNA-based vaccine approach and represent an important step forward in our development efforts for the BNT162 program,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development, Pfizer. “We remain dedicated to developing an effective vaccine to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, with safety at the forefront and look forward to sharing additional data as the program progresses.”

Preliminary data from both the German and U.S. Phase 1/2 studies, together with additional preclinical and clinical data being generated, will be used by the two companies to determine a dose level and select among multiple vaccine candidates to seek to progress to an anticipated large, global Phase 2b/3 safety and efficacy trial. That trial may involve up to 30,000 healthy participants and is anticipated to begin in late July 2020, if regulatory approval is received.

The BNT162b1 candidate remains under clinical study and is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. If the ongoing studies are successful and the vaccine candidate receives regulatory approval, the companies expect to manufacture up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. In that event, BioNTech and Pfizer would work jointly to distribute the potential COVID-19 vaccine worldwide (excluding China, where BioNTech has a collaboration with Fosun Pharma for BNT162 for both clinical development and commercialization).

Under the terms of the agreement, Jnana will partner with Roche on discovery and preclinical development for a broad set of targets across immunology and neuroscience, which Roche will further develop and commercialize exclusively. Jnana will receive an upfront payment of $40 million in cash, and may receive research funding, preclinical, development and commercialization milestone payments, as well as royalties. The aggregate value of potential future payments to Jnana can exceed $1 billion.

“We are delighted to partner with Roche to pursue the untapped potential of SLC transporters as a new approach to develop medicines in major disease areas with high unmet medical need. This collaboration with Roche will expand the impact of Jnana’s platform so that, together, we can broadly address compelling SLC targets and bring new treatments to patients with immune-mediated and neurological diseases,” said Joanne Kotz, Ph.D., Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President of Jnana. “In addition, Jnana is continuing to develop our internal pipeline programs that target SLC transporters for diseases where patients have limited or no treatment options.”

“Partnering with biotech companies that have innovative approaches to drug discovery is an essential part of Roche’s research strategy. We are excited about Jnana’s small molecule approach to targeting SLC transporters, which represent a promising class of targets for discovering new medicines for patients across a range of diseases,” said James Sabry, Head of Roche Pharma Partnering.

SLC transporters are an important class of more than 450 human membrane proteins that are gatekeepers for controlling the movement of metabolites in and out of cells and organs. SLCs ensure metabolites – the chemical building blocks and nutrients essential for life – are present in the right place at the right time, which is crucial for health and often dysregulated in disease.

The drug discovery and research activities under the Roche-Jnana collaboration will leverage Jnana’s RAPID platform which is designed to overcome the challenges of directly targeting SLC transporters, a protein family diverse in structure and mechanism, and with a wide range of substrates and cellular locales. The RAPID platform is a cell-based, proprietary platform that can be used to screen small molecule libraries to identify novel modulators of any SLC transporter.

“We look forward to a highly collaborative relationship with Roche, in which Roche’s disease area expertise and leading R&D capabilities complement Jnana’s pioneering work in SLC biology and drug discovery. This agreement with Roche highlights the value of our RAPID platform which is breaking new ground for targeting SLC transporters with a systematic, highly efficient approach – with the goal of realizing the potential of this rich target class to discover new medicines for patients,” said Joel Barrish, Ph.D., Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Jnana.

37084,The UK Government to Launch AbC-19 Lateral Flow Free Finger-Prick Test for COVID-19,Exclusive: ‘Game-changing’ coronavirus antibody test passes first major trials,"UK Rapid Test Consortium’s (UK-RTC) finger prick test passes its first major trial that delivers results in 20mints. and demonstrate 98.6% accuracy in its clinical study. The AbC-19 lateral flow test is the first approved Ab test for Covid-19 in the UK that generates an instant result
 The clinical trial involves ~300 people and was conducted by scientists at Ulster University last month. The test utilizes full-length spike protein part of the virus to capture IgG Abs as blood passes through the home test
 The consortium is working with NHSX to develop a test-specific app and digital service that facilitate the use and reading of the test device. The test is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the next few weeks and will be launched for use in a mass screening program before the end of 2020","Ministers draw up plans to distribute millions of free fingerprick tests after they were found to be 98.6 per cent accurate

 

The hunt for a “game-changing” antibody test may be over after a version backed by the UK Government passed its first major trials with flying colours.

Ministers are drawing up plans to distribute millions of free pregnancy-style tests after they were shown to be 98.6 per cent accurate in secret human trials held last month, The Telegraph can disclose.

Developed by Oxford University in partnership with leading UK diagnostics firms, the fingerprick test, designed for use at home, can tell within 20 minutes whether a person has ever been exposed to coronavirus.

Until now, the only antibody tests approved in the UK have involved blood samples sent to laboratories for analysis, which can take days.

“This rapid test appears to be truly amazing, and it shows we can do this ourselves,” said Sir John Bell, Oxford’s Regius Professor of Medicine, who leads the Government’s antibody testing programme.

Tens of thousands of prototypes have already been manufactured at factories across the UK in anticipation of expected regulatory approval in the coming weeks.

Ministers hope the AbC-19 lateral flow test will be available for use in a mass screening programme before the end of the year. The new tests have been developed by the UK Rapid Test Consortium (UK-RTC), a partnership between Oxford University and leading UK diagnostics firms including Abingdon Health, based in York.

The partnership was set up by the Government shortly after a consignment of Chinese-made fingerprick tests hailed by Boris Johnson as “game-changers” turned out to be largely useless.

Dr Chris Hand, the leader of the UK-RTC and chairman of Abingdon Health, revealed that the new UK-made test passed its first major clinical trial last month, involving nearly 300 people and conducted by scientists at Ulster University.

“It was found to be 98.6 per cent accurate, and that’s very good news,” Dr Hand told The Telegraph.

Results showed that the test produced a positive result in 98.8 per cent of cases in which the patient was thought to have been infected with the virus.

In patients who were not thought to have been infected, the test gave a negative result in 98.1 per cent of cases.

Overall, that means a 98.6 per cent accuracy in a population where 10 per cent of the population are positive, or less than two per cent of either false positives or false negatives. The results were based on a sample of 292 patients.

Dr Hand added: “We’ve had two shifts of R&D personnel working day and night, seven days a week. This sort of development programme would normally take a year. We’ve done it in 10 weeks.

“We’re now scaling up with our partners to produce hundreds of thousands of doses every month.”

Whitehall sources warned, however, that scientists are still unsure whether the presence of antibodies means a person is immune to coronavirus and can return to normal life without fear of re-infection.

A Public Health England study, called Siren, is currently under way, in which thousands of health workers have had their blood analysed to try and discover whether antibodies confer immunity.

Dido Harding said there were no plans to roll out antibody testing until ‘the science gives us that answer we’re searching for’ CREDIT: Shutterstock

At Thursday’s Downing Street briefing, Dido Harding, the head of the NHS Test and Trace programme, said there were no plans “immediately” to roll out antibody testing until “the science gives us that answer we’re searching for”.

But Dr Hand revealed that the Department of Health is already in behind the scenes negotiations with the UK-RTC over the purchase of millions of tests before the end of the year.

“We’re working with the Department of Health on the commercial side of things, the procurement agreements and so on. One of the key things is to make sure that we provide value for money,” he said.

Under Government plans, the tests will be distributed to healthcare professionals first before being made available for millions of people to use at home, who would then send in their results to a central database.

“At the moment, this test is a tool to gather knowledge,” Dr Hand said. “The objective is to allow mass testing, which you can’t really do by sending samples to a lab. By being able to test millions of people, it will gather information so that we know how many people have antibodies, whether they protect against reinfection and how long they last.”

Under plans drawn up by officials, the tests would be free and ordered online rather than sold in supermarkets. Each kit will come in a box with a QR barcode linking to a video showing the user how to safely prick their own finger and administer the test.

Ministers also hope the tests will be useful in determining whether future vaccinations against coronavirus have triggered the desired response.

“If coronavirus is like flu and people need an annual vaccine, we will need mass antibody testing to measure people’s antibody response to that vaccine. That’s part of the plan,” Dr Hand said.

In April, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) banned fingerprick tests sold in Superdrug and Boots – with which users were asked to post blood samples for analysis – over concerns about accuracy.

Unlike many rivals, the UK-RTC version uses the “full-length spike protein” part of the virus to capture so-called IgG antibodies as blood passes through the home test. If the result is positive, two pink lines appear within 20 minutes.

“We’re using a particular capture mechanism for the antibodies which allows our test to be very sensitive,” Dr Hand said. “As far as we know, others were using other smaller fractions of the virus. Our scientific opinion and that of Oxford University is that the full-length spike protein is the way to go.”

Three batches of tens of thousands of prototypes have been manufactured for validation testing. In the next few weeks, data will be submitted to the MHRA watchdog for regulatory approval.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “We have received an extraordinary response to our call to action to supply antibody tests, and we continue to work with industry to identify further tests that are safe and accurate to be used at home.

“While these tests will help us better understand how coronavirus is spreading across the country, we do not yet know whether antibodies indicate immunity from reinfection or transmission.”",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edc3FoBVcAAgDSM.jpg,COVID-19|MedTech,0,AbC-19,COVID-19|MedTech|Free Finger-Prick Test|Government|Lateral Flow|Launch|The UK,publish,21/7/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/exclusive-game-changing-coronavirus-antibody-test-passes-first-major-trials/,https://pharmashots.com/37084/the-uk-government-to-launch-abc-19-lateral-flow-free-finger-prick-test-for-covid-19/

 FullFocus operates within the Paige Platform and allows users, meaning researchers and pathologists to view any digital image, regardless of the scanning platform used to generate the image","NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Paige, a global leader in computational pathology, today announced it received Federal Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the FullFocus™, a digital pathology image viewer for the purpose of primary diagnosis. This 510(k) clearance from the FDA allows in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use of FullFocus with FDA-authorized Philips Ultra Fast Scanner and paves the way for IVD use of FullFocus with additional IVD Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners in the future.

Lack of interoperability, intensive capital requirements and burdensome, on-premise storage have long been a challenge in the adoption of digital pathology. The foundation for the FullFocus viewer was initially created and validated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to allow researchers and pathologists to intuitively view and navigate digital images of surgical pathology slides acquired on all major commercial brands of WSI scanners. After refinement based on 18 months of daily use for retrospective slide review by dozens of practicing pathologists at MSK, the viewer was further enhanced by Paige to meet the performance requirements for IVD use, with accurate color reproducibility, optimized viewing speeds and adherence to a certified quality management system. Committed to providing a flexible solution for hospitals, Paige is working to expand upon the clearance to incorporate use with additional WSI scanners and monitor displays in the near future.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has made it painfully clear that pathologists need better solutions to work safely and remotely,” said Leo Grady, PhD CEO at Paige. “Pathology labs, hospitals and biopharma companies need to serve patients and conduct research with little disruption, without having to be physically present at their labs. Receiving FDA clearance for the FullFocus viewer allows Paige to further its commitment to modernizing workflows for pathologists so that they can manage their ever-increasing workloads in an efficient, organized, collaborative and secure way and ultimately help patients get the right care at the right time.”

The FullFocus viewer operates within the Paige Platform, which also offers fully-managed, cost-effective storage capabilities. The combined offering can be quickly deployed in any clinical setting, requires minimal upfront costs and allows for collaboration between geographically distributed pathologists, streamlining the path to digital pathology. The Paige Platform is also designed to deliver best-in-class computational pathology products.

“A viewing and storage platform that is interoperable with various existing digital pathology tools could enable pathologists to collaborate with their team, remotely, without sacrificing security and privacy – all essential pieces of ‘going digital’ in pathology,” said Matthew G. Hanna, MD, the Director of Digital Pathology Informatics at MSK.

In November 2019, FullFocus received the CE Mark, opening its use to European pathology practices. Paige has early access trials across the United States, Europe and Brazil, with healthcare organizations interested in better serving patients and maintaining business continuity.

Dr. Hanna has a compensated consulting relationship with Paige. MSK has intellectual property rights and associated financial interests related to Paige by virtue of licensing agreements between MSK and Paige.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200721005336/en/

Gilead can exercise its option to acquire the remainder of Tizona following the readout of a Phase 1b study of Tizona’s investigational antibody, TTX-080, or earlier if Gilead decides to do so. TTX-080, discovered by Tizona, is a potential first-in-class medicine that targets HLA-G, a novel and emerging immune checkpoint expressed across multiple tumor types. The expression pattern of HLA-G often appears distinct from that of PD-(L)1, suggesting potential utility to address tumors that do not respond to current anti-PD-(L)1 treatments and to deepen responses in tumors that are sensitive to anti-PD-(L)1 therapies.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared Tizona’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for TTX-080, and in the third quarter of this year, Tizona plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating TTX-080 both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents in patients with advanced cancers.

“Tizona is pursuing first-in-class cancer immunotherapies that could make an important difference in oncology by helping patients who don’t respond to current checkpoint inhibitors,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “This agreement with Tizona adds to the significant progress we’ve made in the first half of this year in building out a strong and diverse immuno-oncology pipeline. We now have multiple opportunities to develop novel therapies that will improve the treatment of cancer.”

“Gilead’s support will enable Tizona to accelerate and broaden our TTX-080 clinical program while also enabling us to rapidly advance our rich, first-in-class preclinical portfolio and target validation efforts,” said Scott Clarke, Chief Executive Officer, Tizona. “Our mission is dedicated to translating novel scientific insights into first-in-class immunotherapies and Gilead is a partner that shares our passion for science and delivering breakthrough innovation to people with cancer.”

Terms of the Agreement

Under the terms of the agreement, Tizona equity holders will receive $300 million upon closing. Gilead will obtain a 49.9 percent equity stake and an exclusive option to purchase the remaining equity exercisable following the completion of Phase 1b studies for TTX-080, or earlier if Gilead chooses. Tizona equity holders will be eligible to receive up to $1.25 billion in an option exercise fee and potential future milestone payments. Gilead will also provide funding to support Tizona’s ongoing research and development to advance its novel pipeline.

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year and is subject to antitrust clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions.

Gilead will have the right to appoint two individuals to Tizona’s Board of Directors upon closing of the transaction.

Tizona will spin off TTX-030, the company’s investigational, first-in-class anti-CD39 antibody partnered with AbbVie, into a separate entity prior to closing of this transaction. TTX-030 is not subject to this agreement.

TTX-080 is investigational and not approved anywhere globally. Its efficacy and safety have not been established.

Cowen is acting as financial advisor and Ropes & Gray is acting as legal counsel to Gilead. Latham & Watkins is acting as legal counsel and Squire Patton Boggs is acting as IP counsel to Tizona.

The device receives CE mark in Mar’2019 and will immediately commence a launch of the device in the US","MARLBOROUGH, Mass., July 21, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the WATCHMAN FLX™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device.

Experience the interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8707351-boston-scientific-watchman-flx-device-fda-approved/

The next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who need an alternative to oral anticoagulation therapy by permanently closing off the left atrial appendage – the area of the heart where stroke-causing blood clots commonly form in NVAF. This technology, which is built upon the most studied and implanted LAAC device in the world, features a new, fully rounded design that offers physicians the ability to safely enter, and maneuver within, the left atrial appendage. It is the first LAAC device that can be fully recaptured, repositioned and redeployed for precise placement, and the new frame design allows for optimal device engagement with the tissue for long-term stability and a faster, more complete seal. The WATCHMAN FLX device is available in broader size options than the previous generation device and can treat a wider range of patient anatomies.

“We’ve been very pleased with the real-world clinical outcomes and positive physician feedback for the WATCHMAN FLX device in Europe and are excited to extend availability of this next-generation technology to patients and clinicians throughout the U.S.,” said Joe Fitzgerald, president, Interventional Cardiology, Boston Scientific. “Our WATCHMAN technology was the first FDA-approved LAAC device on the market and has been implanted in more than 100,000 patients worldwide, and now with the WATCHMAN FLX device, we are taking the clinical benefits of the technology to the next level for more patients while further differentiating our structural heart portfolio in the U.S.”

Positive 12-month results from the pivotal PINNACLE FLX study, which evaluated the performance of the WATCHMAN FLX device as an alternative to long-term non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and other OAC medications, were recently presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at Heart Rhythm Society 2020 Science. The study met its primary safety and efficacy endpoints with data demonstrating a low rate of major procedure-related safety events (0.5% at 7 days post procedure) and high rate of effective LAAC (100% with peri-device flow < 5mm at 12 months post procedure). Data also demonstrated a high implant success rate of 98.8%.

“Built upon the success of the WATCHMAN platform and thousands of patient-years of clinical research, the next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device is designed to offer increased ease of use for physicians and improved procedural outcomes for patients, including reduced complication risk and healing time,” said Dr. Ian Meredith, AM, global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific. “We’ve set the bar high and look forward to bringing these benefits to a wider range of U.S. patients with NVAF who need an alternative to the bleeding risk and lifestyle challenges associated with long-term use of blood thinners.”

Additional clinical research using the WATCHMAN FLX device for patients with NVAF will continue via enrollment in the OPTION trial – comparing the device to oral anticoagulants in patients who also undergo a cardiac ablation procedure – as well as in the CHAMPION-AF trial, which will study a broader OAC-eligible patient population in a head-to-head fashion to compare the device against NOACs.

The company announced CE Mark for the next-generation WATCHMAN FLX device in March 2019 and will immediately commence a limited launch of the device in the U.S.

37175,AbbVie Reports Results of Rinvoq (upadacitinib) as Monotherapy in a P-III Measure Up 2 Study for Atopic Dermatitis,RINVOQ (upadacitinib) Monotherapy Meets All Primary and Secondary Endpoints in Second Phase 3 Study for Atopic Dermatitis,"The P-III Measure Up 2 study involves assessing of Rinvoq (15/30mg) vs PBO in adults and adolescents aged 12-18yrs. or older with mod. to sev. AD who are candidates for systemic treatment. Placebo patients were switched to either upadacitinib (15/30mg) @16wks.
 The study met its co-1EPs @16wks. i.e. improvement in EASI 75 (60%/73% vs 13%), patient achieving vIGA-AD 0/1 (39%/52% vs 5%); reduction in itch (42%/60% vs 9%); Improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS≥4 (42%/60% vs 9%) respectively
 Rinvoq (qd) is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and has received the US FDA’s approval for patients with mod. to sev. active RA having inadequate response or intolerance to MTX. The therapy is under P-III study for AD, RA, PsA, axSpA, CD, UC and giant cell arteritis","Upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg) monotherapy showed significant improvement in skin clearance and reduction in itch at week 16 in adult and adolescent patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis versus placebo[1]
– Safety results were consistent with those of its replicate study, Measure Up 1[2]
– RINVOQ, a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor discovered and developed by AbbVie, is being studied as a once-daily oral therapy for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and in several other immune-mediated diseases[1,3-10]
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., July 21, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg, once daily) monotherapy met both primary and all secondary endpoints in Measure Up 2, the second Phase 3 study in individuals with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.1 The co-primary endpoints were at least a 75 percent improvement in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI 75) from baseline and a validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear) at week 16.1 The Measure Up 2 study evaluates the efficacy and safety of both doses of upadacitinib monotherapy versus placebo in adolescents and adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.1

Significantly more patients receiving either dose of upadacitinib monotherapy showed improvement in skin clearance and reduction in itch compared to placebo at week 16.1 In the study, 60/73 percent of patients receiving upadacitinib 15/30 mg achieved EASI 75, respectively, versus 13 percent in the placebo group (p<0.001).1 Of patients treated with upadacitinib 15/30 mg, 39/52 percent achieved vIGA-AD 0/1, respectively, versus 5 percent of patients receiving placebo (p<0.001).1

“We are encouraged by these results that reaffirm the data from Measure Up 1 and underscore the potential impact RINVOQ could have for individuals struggling to control their atopic dermatitis,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “We are committed to delivering on the needs of people living with atopic dermatitis, many of whom continue to endure relentless itch and skin symptoms that can interfere with daily activities.”

At week 16, 42/60 percent of patients on upadacitinib 15/30 mg experienced clinically meaningful reductions in itch, respectively, defined as improvement in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ≥4, versus 9 percent of patients receiving placebo (p<0.001).1 For both doses, patients experienced an early reduction in itch, which was maintained through week 16.1 After just one day following the first dose (day 2), reductions in itch compared to placebo were observed for patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg (8 percent versus 1 percent, p<0.001).1 For patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg, 12 percent experienced a reduction in itch after just two days following the first dose (day 3) compared to 3 percent of patients receiving placebo (p<0.001).1

“Atopic dermatitis is more than a rash or itchy skin. Many people living with moderate to severe forms continue to suffer from significant physical and emotional burden of the disease,” said Alan Irvine, M.D., D.S.c., professor of dermatology, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland and lead study investigator of Measure Up 2. “These data support our continued efforts to provide additional options for those living with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.”

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition characterized by a cycle of intense itching and scratching leading to cracked, scaly, oozing skin.11,12 It affects up to an estimated 25 percent of adolescents and 10 percent of adults at some point in their lifetime.12 Between 20 and 46 percent of adults with atopic dermatitis have moderate to severe disease.13 The range of symptoms pose significant physical, psychological and economic burden on individuals impacted by the disease.12,14

No new safety risks were observed compared to the safety profile observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis receiving RINVOQ.1,15-18 During the 16-week placebo-controlled period of Measure Up 2, serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 1.8 percent of patients in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 2.5 percent of patients in the upadacitinib 30 mg compared to 2.9 percent of patients in the placebo group.1 The most common AEs for the upadacitinib groups were acne, headache and upper respiratory tract infection.1 Acne was observed with both doses of upadacitinib (12.7 percent of patients on 15 mg and 14.5 percent of patients on 30 mg) versus placebo (2.2 percent of patients); all events were mild or moderate in severity and none led to treatment discontinuation.1 Eczema herpeticum was only observed in patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg (1.1 percent of patients).1 Serious infections were reported infrequently (0.7 percent of patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, 0.4 percent of patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 0.7 percent of patients receiving placebo).1 No venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were observed in the upadacitinib groups; a pulmonary embolism was reported in a patient receiving placebo.1 No deaths or major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were reported in any of the treatment groups.1

Full results from the Measure Up 2 study will be presented at a future medical meeting and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Use of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by regulatory authorities.

About Measure Up 2 Study1,10

Measure Up 2 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in adults and adolescents (ages 12 to 18 or older) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic treatment. Patients were randomized to upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg or placebo. Placebo patients were switched to either upadacitinib 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg at week 16.

The co-primary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving EASI 75 and a vIGA-AD of 0/1 after 16 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS≥4, EASI 90, percent change in Worst Pruritus NRS, percent change in EASI at week 16, as well as improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS≥4 at day 2 (one day after the first dose) for patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg and improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS≥4 at day 3 (two days after the first dose) for patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg. The trial is ongoing, and the long-term extension period remains blinded to investigators and patients, to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of the two once-daily doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib in patients who have completed the placebo-controlled period. Top-line results from the replicate Phase 3 study, Measure Up 1, were announced in June 2020.

About RINVOQ (upadacitinib)

Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is an oral, once-daily, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.1,3-10 It was engineered to have greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 versus JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2.15 In August 2019, RINVOQ received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. In December 2019, RINVOQ also received approval by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The approved dose for RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis are ongoing.5-10 Use of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by regulatory authorities.

Important Safety Information about RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib)

RINVOQ U.S. Use and Important Safety Information
RINVOQ is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate did not work well or could not be tolerated. It is not known if RINVOQ is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.

What is the most important information I should know about RINVOQ?
RINVOQ is a medicine that can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. You should not start taking RINVOQ if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider (HCP) tells you it is okay.

Serious infections have happened in some people taking RINVOQ, including tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your HCP should test you for TB before starting RINVOQ and check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with RINVOQ. You may be at higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster).
Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in people taking RINVOQ.
Blood clots in the veins of the legs or lungs and arteries are possible in some people taking RINVOQ. This may be life-threatening and cause death.
Tears in the stomach or intestines and changes in certain laboratory tests can happen. Your HCP should do blood tests before you start taking RINVOQ and while you take it. Your HCP may stop your RINVOQ treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
What should I tell my HCP BEFORE starting RINVOQ?
Tell your HCP if you:

Are being treated for an infection, have an infection that won’t go away or keeps coming back, or have symptoms of an infection such as:
Fever, sweating, or chills
Shortness of breath
Warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
Muscle aches
Feeling tired
Blood in phlegm
Diarrhea or stomach pain
Cough
Weight loss
Burning when urinating or urinating more often than normal
Have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB.
Have had any type of cancer, hepatitis B or C, shingles (herpes zoster), or blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs, diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine), or ulcers in your stomach or intestines.
Have other medical conditions including liver problems, low blood cell counts, diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune system.
Live, have lived, or have traveled to parts of the country that increase your risk of getting certain kinds of fungal infections, such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest. If you are unsure if you’ve been to these areas, ask your HCP.
Have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People who take RINVOQ should not receive live vaccines.
Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Based on animal studies, RINVOQ may harm your unborn baby. Your HCP will check whether or not you are pregnant before you start RINVOQ. You should use effective birth control (contraception) to avoid becoming pregnant while taking RINVOQ and for at least 4 weeks after your last dose.
Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. RINVOQ may pass into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed while taking RINVOQ and for at least 6 days after your last dose.
Tell your HCP about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. RINVOQ and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects.

Especially tell your HCP if you take:

Medicines for fungal or bacterial infections
Rifampicin or phenytoin
Medicines that affect your immune system
Ask your HCP or pharmacist if you are not sure if you are taking any of these medicines.

What should I tell my HCP AFTER starting RINVOQ?
Tell your HCP right away if you:

Have any symptoms of an infection. RINVOQ can make you more likely to get infections or make any infections you have worse.
Have any signs or symptoms of blood clots during treatment with RINVOQ, including:
Swelling
Sudden unexplained chest pain
Pain or tenderness in the leg
Shortness of breath
Have a fever or stomach-area pain that does not go away, and a change in your bowel habits.
What are the common side effects of RINVOQ?
These include: upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), nausea, cough, and fever. These are not all the possible side effects of RINVOQ.

RINVOQ is taken once a day with or without food. Do not split, break, crush, or chew the tablet. Take RINVOQ exactly as your HCP tells you to use it.

This is the most important information to know about RINVOQ. For more information, talk to your HCP. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit http://www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

 The study resulted in anti-AQP4 antibody-positive group remained relapse-free (89% vs 58%) including reductions in NMOSD-related hospitalizations with safety and tolerability profile
 Uplizna (inebilizumab-cdon) is a humanized CD19-directed mAb and is a novel B cell depleter approved for the treatment of NMOSD in adults who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive","UPLIZNA™ is the first and only B cell depleter approved for the treatment of NMOSD in adults who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive
GAITHERSBURG, Md., June 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Viela Bio (Nasdaq:VIE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved UPLIZNATM (inebilizumab-cdon) for the treatment of adult patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are anti-AQP4 antibody positive as a twice-a-year maintenance regimen following initial doses. Approximately 80%1 of all patients with NMOSD test positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies.

“NMOSD is an extremely challenging disease to treat. Patients experience unpredictable attacks that can lead to permanent disability from blindness and paralysis. In addition, each subsequent attack may result in a cumulative worsening of disability. In the pivotal N-MOmentum trial, UPLIZNATM—a humanized CD19-directed monoclonal antibody—significantly reduced the risk of attacks and also reduced hospitalizations when given as a monotherapy,” said Bruce Cree, M.D., Ph.D., MAS, the lead investigator for the N-MOmentum trial and Professor of Clinical Neurology at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences. “UPLIZNATM is an important new treatment option that provides prescribing physicians and patients living with NMOSD a therapy with proven efficacy, a favorable safety profile and a twice-a-year maintenance dosing schedule.”

NMOSD is a rare, severe, neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease that attacks the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain stem. In addition to potentially irreversible blindness and paralysis, patients may also experience loss of sensation, bladder and bowel dysfunction, nerve pain and respiratory failure. It is estimated that there are approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. suffering from NMOSD2. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that NMOSD is a B-cell-mediated disorder.

“As an organization that understands and represents the struggle of patients and their loved ones affected by NMOSD, we are pleased that now there is another treatment option that could reduce their attacks, which can lead to devastating and irreversible disability,” said Victoria Jackson, co-founder of the Guthy-Jackson Charitable Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to funding research and raising awareness about NMOSD. “We have been proud to partner with Viela Bio and congratulate them and the NMOSD community on this important milestone.”

The approval of UPLIZNATM—which previously received Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA—is based in part on results from the pivotal N-MOmentum trial, the largest study ever conducted in a real-world spectrum of adults with NMOSD. The global, placebo-controlled study—which enrolled 213 anti-AQP4 antibody positive patients and 17 anti-AQP4 antibody negative patients—met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in risk of NMOSD attacks. Specifically, 89% of patients in the anti-AQP4 antibody positive group remained relapse-free during the six-month period post-treatment, compared to 58% of the patients taking placebo. UPLIZNATM also demonstrated statistically significant benefits in key secondary endpoints, including reductions in NMOSD-related hospitalizations. Additionally, UPLIZNATM demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Across both the randomized and open-label treatment in Study 1, the most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were urinary tract infection (20%), nasopharyngitis (13%), infusion reaction (12%), arthralgia (11%), and headache (10%). The results from the N-MOmentum trial were published in the peer-reviewed journal, The Lancet, in September 2019 (“Inebilizumab for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (N-MOmentum): a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial”).

Commented Bing Yao, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Viela Bio: “We are proud that Viela Bio’s first approved medicine has the potential to help thousands of patients with NMOSD, a progressive and debilitating neuroinflammatory disease. We are incredibly grateful to the patients, families and care partners who participated in and supported our research.”

Viela anticipates product launch in June.

Study Design Overview and Efficacy Results Summary

Patients in the N-MOmentum trial were randomized 3:1 (UPLIZNATM to placebo) to receive two introductory doses of 300 mg of UPLIZNATM monotherapy or placebo at Day 1 and Day 15. The patients were followed for a total of 197 days. Following that randomized-controlled period (RCP), patients were given the option to enter an open-label extension period, in which every participant received 300 mg of UPLIZNATM monotherapy every 6 months. The study was concluded early on the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee, based on evidence of efficacy. Results from the anti-AQP4 antibody positive patient subgroup are shown in the chart below.

About Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD)
NMOSD is a unifying term for neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and related syndromes. NMOSD is a rare, severe, relapsing, neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease that can be fatal. Approximately 80% of all patients with NMOSD test positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies.

These AQP4 autoantibodies are produced by CD19+ B cells and bind primarily to astrocytes in the central nervous system. Binding of AQP4 antibodies to central and peripheral nervous system cells is believed to trigger attacks, which can damage the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain. Loss of vision, paralysis, loss of sensation, bladder and bowel dysfunction, nerve pain and respiratory failure can all be manifestations of the disease. Each NMOSD attack can lead to further damage and disability. NMOSD occurs more commonly in women and may be more common in individuals of African and Asian descent.

About N-MOmentum
N-MOmentum, the largest clinical study ever conducted in NMOSD, was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 213 patients who are anti-AQP4 antibody positive and 17 who are anti-AQP4 antibody negative (n=230). In the trial, patients were randomized to receive two intravenous doses of UPLIZNATM (inebilizumab-cdon) monotherapy or placebo and followed for 6.5 months. Patients were subsequently given the option to enter into an open-label extension in which all patients receive inebilizumab every 6 months. The primary endpoint was time from treatment initiation to occurrence of an NMOSD attack, which was reviewed by an independent, blinded external Adjudication Committee. NMOSD attack diagnosis was standardized using 18 clinically meaningful criteria that were developed for the study. The open-label extension portion of the study is ongoing. More information can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (Study NCT02200770).

Additional Clinical Investigation

A Phase 2 trial with inebilizumab is ongoing in kidney transplant desensitization, with an additional Phase 3 trial planned in myasthenia gravis and a Phase 2b trial planned in IgG4-related disease.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

UPLIZNATM is contraindicated in patients with:

A history of life-threatening infusion reaction to UPLIZNATM
Active hepatitis B infection
Active or untreated latent tuberculosis
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Infusion Reactions: UPLIZNATM can cause infusion reactions, which can include headache, nausea, somnolence, dyspnea, fever, myalgia, rash, or other symptoms. Infusion reactions were most common with the first infusion but were also observed during subsequent infusions. Administer pre-medication with a corticosteroid, an antihistamine, and an anti-pyretic.

Infections: The most common infections reported by UPLIZNATM-treated patients in the randomized and open-label periods included urinary tract infection (20%), nasopharyngitis (13%), upper respiratory tract infection (8%), and influenza (7%). Delay UPLIZNATM administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved.

Increased immunosuppressive effects are possible if combining UPLIZNATM with another immunosuppressive therapy.

The risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been observed with other B-cell-depleting antibodies. Perform HBV screening in all patients before initiation of treatment with UPLIZNATM. Do not administer to patients with active hepatitis.

Although no confirmed cases of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) were identified in UPLIZNATM clinical trials, JC virus infection resulting in PML has been observed in patients treated with other B-cell-depleting antibodies and other therapies that affect immune competence. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold UPLIZNATM and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation.

Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating UPLIZNATM.

Vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and after discontinuation, until B-cell repletion.

Reduction in Immunoglobulins: There may be a progressive and prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia or decline in the levels of total and individual immunoglobulins such as immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) with continued UPLIZNATM treatment. Monitor the level of immunoglobulins at the beginning, during, and after discontinuation of treatment with UPLIZNATM until B-cell repletion especially in patients with opportunistic or recurrent infections.

Fetal Risk: May cause fetal harm based on animal data. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for 6 months after stopping UPLIZNATM.

Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (at least 10% of patients treated with UPLIZNATM and greater than placebo) were urinary tract infection and arthralgia.

Ultragenyx to Host Conference Call Today at 4:00 pm Eastern Time

NOVATO, Calif., June 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dojolvi™ (triheptanoin) as a source of calories and fatty acids for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with molecularly confirmed long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD). LC-FAOD are a group of rare, lifelong and life-threatening genetic disorders in which the body is unable to convert long-chain fatty acids into energy. Dojolvi is a highly purified, synthetic, 7-carbon fatty acid triglyceride specifically designed to provide medium-chain, odd-carbon fatty acids as an energy source and metabolite replacement for people with LC-FAOD.

“With today’s FDA approval, patients living with this serious, unpredictable, and often catastrophic disease now have an approved therapy. Many patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders have difficult lives with frequent hospitalizations and major medical events despite the best current care. Now these patients have an approved treatment as an option to help manage their disease,” said Camille L. Bedrosian, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Ultragenyx. “We are grateful to the patients, caregivers, families, dietitians and doctors involved for helping to make this community milestone possible, and we are committed to ensuring that all patients in the U.S. with LC-FAOD who might benefit from Dojolvi will have access to it.”

LC-FAOD are a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders characterized by metabolic deficiencies in which the body is unable to convert long-chain fatty acids into energy. The inability to produce energy from fat can lead to severe depletion of glucose in the body and serious complications, which can lead to hospitalizations or early death. LC-FAOD are included in newborn screening panels across the U.S. and in certain European countries due to the risk for serious outcomes including death early in life. Other current treatment options for LC-FAOD include avoidance of fasting, low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, carnitine and even-carbon medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, a medical food product. LC-FAOD affect an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 children and adults in the United States.

“FDA approval of Dojolvi for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders is a huge milestone for patients and their families, as it is the first such medication,” said Dr. Jerry Vockley, Professor of Human Genetics and Chief of Medical Genetics at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. “While we have been able to identify these disorders at birth for many years, treatment options have been limited. Dojolvi brings hope as a new tool now available to clinicians taking care of these patients. Rare disease research, especially development of new therapies, is an arduous and time consuming process, and today’s announcement represents the culmination of nearly 20 years of work on the part of numerous researchers, clinicians, and patients. I’m tremendously excited to have been a part of this process.”

Ultragenyx expects Dojolvi to be available to patients in the next 30 days. To support access, Ultragenyx’s UltraCare® program helps patients and caregivers understand insurance coverage and assists them in finding financial support for Ultragenyx medicines, including Dojolvi, and for the administration of them. Dedicated in-house UltraCare Guides are available Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Time at 888-756-8657.

37197,ViiV Healthcare's Tivicay PD (dolutegravir) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Children Living with HIV,"ViiV Healthcare announces US FDA approval of the first-ever dispersible tablet formulation of dolutegravir, Tivicay PD, a once-daily treatment for children living with HIV","The approval is based on ongoing P1093 (NCT03016533) and ODYSSEY (PENTA20, NCT02259127) studies in pediatric patients aged 4 weeks to 18 years, while the second study involves 2L pediatric patients aged four weeks to 18 years
 The P1093 study was conducted by IMPAACT network in the USA, Brazil, Thailand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Tanzania and ODYSSEY by the PENTA network in Europe, South America, Thailand, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and South Africa
 Tivicay and Tivicay PD are a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) used in combination with antiretroviral agents to treat HIV-1 infection in adults and in pediatric patients aged at least 4 weeks and weighing at least 3 kg","Dolutegravir is the first integrase inhibitor available as a dispersible tablet for oral suspension for children weighing at least 3kg and from four weeks of age.
The FDA approval is testament to the commitments of global stakeholders spanning regulators, industry and non-profit organisations to develop new and innovative HIV medicines for children, most of whom live in resource-poor settings.1

London, 12 June 2020 – ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority-owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Tivicay PD (dolutegravir) tablets for oral suspension, which are used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in paediatric patients (treatment-naïve or -experienced but INSTI- naïve) aged at least four weeks and weighing at least 3kg, as well as an extended indication to expand the use of the already approved Tivicay (dolutegravir) 50mg film-coated tablet in paediatric HIV patients weighing 20kg and above.2

Paediatric HIV remains a global issue, with children disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. Latest statistics show there are 1.7 million children living with HIV1, and the majority of AIDS-related deaths among children still occur during the first five years of life.3 Major obstacles persist for children, such as continued mother-to-child transmission, the availability of HIV testing, slow initiation of treatment and poor availability of optimised paediatric formulations of antiretrovirals.3,4

Deborah Waterhouse, CEO of ViiV Healthcare, said: “I am delighted that our innovative approach to science has enabled us to achieve FDA approval of the first-ever dispersible tablet formulation of dolutegravir, now making it easier for young children to take this medication by dispersing the tablet in water. The development and availability of age-appropriate formulations is essential in ensuring children have access to life-saving HIV treatments from an early age and as they grow. The support of our partners has been integral for this regulatory approval. We now need to continue our efforts to ensure this new dispersible formulation is available to children who need it around the world, in line with our mission to leave no person living with HIV behind.”

Dolutegravir is the first integrase inhibitor available as a dispersible tablet for oral suspension for children as young as four weeks of age and weighing at least 3kg. Prior to this, dolutegravir was indicated in the US for children from six years of age and weighing more than 30kg.5 This step will expand the use of dolutegravir by providing an age-appropriate formulation to a younger population and will help to close the gap between HIV treatment options available for adults and children.

Chip Lyons, President and CEO of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), said: “Children are often forgotten in the global fight to end HIV/AIDS and face a unique set of challenges, particularly when HIV medication and treatments are often hard to swallow or tolerate. Barriers like these have resulted in only half of the 1.7 million children living with HIV accessing the lifesaving treatment they need—and even fewer still reaching viral suppression. Families affected by HIV will benefit from ViiV Healthcare’s development of child-friendly formulations that aim to close the gap between treatment options available for adults and children. This tailored approach to paediatric treatment of HIV will help meet the urgent needs of this vulnerable population.”

The FDA approval is based on data from the ongoing P1093 and ODYSSEY (PENTA20) studies, which has been generated from ViiV Healthcare’s collaborations with the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network (IMPAACT) for P1093, and the Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (Penta) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Trials Unit at University College London for ODYSSEY.

Through its voluntary licensing policy, ViiV Healthcare enables generic versions of dolutegravir to be manufactured and sold royalty-free in all least-developed, low-income, lower-middle-income and sub-Saharan Africa countries, as well as some upper-middle-income countries. In order to ensure licensees expedite the development and introduction of optimised paediatric formulations of dolutegravir to help the children most affected by HIV, the majority of whom reside in sub-Saharan Africa, ViiV Healthcare has worked with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and Unitaid since 2018 in a public-private partnership. Through this partnership, two generic manufacturers who hold paediatric dolutegravir sub-licences from the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) — Mylan Laboratories Limited and Macleods Pharmaceuticals Limited — have been provided with the technical expertise of ViiV Healthcare and a financial incentive from Unitaid via CHAI, to accelerate the development, registration, manufacture and supply of generic dispersible formulations of dolutegravir for children. A key milestone in this collaboration was recently achieved when Mylan submitted a new drug application for a scored dolutegravir 10mg dispersible tablet for tentative approval under the FDA President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) scheme. The Macleods submission is imminent.

Today’s FDA approval is an important step in fulfilling ViiV Healthcare’s commitment to bring optimised paediatric formulations of dolutegravir to children. Additional regulatory approvals around the world are ongoing and required in order to ensure we and our partners can succeed in delivering these new HIV treatments at the speed and scale that patients need.

Tivicay PD and the extended indication of the existing Tivicay 50mg film-coated tablet are both currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

●Program to focus on clinical and precision medicine research and potential combination strategies

 

Tokyo, Basking Ridge, N.J., Munich and Villejuif – (July 22, 2020) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and Gustave Roussy today announced a multi-year, multi-study research collaboration to enrich and further enable the development of DS-1062 and patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402), two of Daiichi Sankyo’s lead DXd antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in lung and breast cancer.

 

The collaboration will focus on clinical and translational research, including potential combination strategies for DS-1062, a TROP2 directed DXd ADC, in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and for patritumab deruxtecan, a HER3 directed DXd ADC, in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

 

“We look forward to engaging and collaborating with the deep expertise and cutting-edge oncology research capabilities of Gustave Roussy, the premier European Cancer Center, to further advance clinical development of DS-1062 and patritumab deruxtecan,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, AIHP, ACCA Paris, Global Head, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “This innovative research program includes two precision-medicine rich phase 2 trials designed with an adaptive approach to help determine which patients are most likely to benefit from our ADCs with optimal speed and efficiency. Combination therapy strategies will also be explored in other studies.”

 

“This partnership is strategic for Gustave Roussy and it brings together all the skills which are essential for top quality research in oncology. Launching clinical trials to test two promising molecules in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer is essential for diseases which unfortunately have an increasing incidence and for which there is an urgent need to make progress,” said Prof. Jean-Charles Soria, General Director of Gustave Roussy. “It is by pushing the boundaries of innovation that we will further improve the quality of care for our patients.”

 

About the Collaboration
Under the agreement, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. will provide funding and support to Gustave Roussy for a comprehensive, integrative research program including clinical, translational and preclinical studies for DS-1062 and patritumab deruxtecan in lung and breast cancer, respectively.

 

Two adaptive phase 2 trials will be conducted, including a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate efficacy, safety and markers of response and resistance to DS-1062 in patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and platinum-doublet chemotherapy.

 

The second multicenter, open-label phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and biomarkers of response and resistance to patritumab deruxtecan in patients with HER3 expressing metastatic breast cancer.

 

Each study will enroll up to 100 patients and will be conducted in several sites in France.

 

The primary endpoint for both studies is objective response rate as assessed by independent central review. Secondary endpoints include clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival and safety measures. The studies also will primarily be conducted to analyze biomarker expression and tumor sensitivity; the role of receptor biology in the pharmacological activity of the Daiichi Sankyo DXd ADC platform, as well as factors contributing to treatment resistance; immunogenicity and mechanism of action.

 

The adaptive trial design includes ongoing clinical and biomarker assessments to identify factors associated with individual patient response and the ability to fine-tune development accordingly.

 

Additional research to be conducted under the collaboration includes several studies exploring multiple therapeutic combinations for each ADC.

 on June 20, 2020, FabiFlu has received DCGI’s approval, making it the first oral approved medication in India for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. Glenmark has initiated PMS) study on FabiFlu to closely monitor the efficacy and safety of the drug in 1000 patients","Phase 3 Trial Demonstrates Statistically Significant Faster Time to Clinical Improvement with Favipiravir Treatment in Mild to Moderate COVID 19 Patients Compared to Control

MUMBAI, India, July 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. – a global research-led pharmaceutical company – today announced top-line results from a Phase 3 clinical trial in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, conducted across seven clinical sites in India. The open-label randomized, multicenter clinical trial, conducted in 150 patients, evaluated the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir plus standard supportive care (Favipiravir treatment arm), versus standard supportive care alone (control arm), in mild to moderate patients, randomized within a 48 hour window of testing RT-PCR positive for COVID-19.

Favipiravir is a broad spectrum oral antiviral drug that selectively inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral replication phase of SARS-CoV-2, and is being studied in multiple ongoing international clinical trials.

Patients in the Glenmark Favipiravir clinical trial received Favipiravir tablets 3,600 mg (1,800 mg BID) (Day 1) + 1,600 mg (800 mg BID) (Day 2 or later) for up to maximum of 14 days, along with standard supportive care. Randomization was stratified based on disease severity into mild (90 patients) and moderate (60 patients).

Results from the Phase 3 trial showed numerical improvements for the primary efficacy endpoint with 28.6% faster viral clearance in the overall population as measured by the median time until cessation of oral shedding of virus in the Favipiravir treatment arm compared to those in the control arm (Hazard Ratio 1.367 [95%CI 0.944,1.979]; p=0.129).

Key secondary outcome measures for clinical improvement demonstrated the efficacy and benefit of Favipiravir treatment arm over the control arm:

40% faster achievement of “clinical cure” defined as the physician’s assessment of normalization of clinical signs – temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and cough with a statistically significant reduction in median time to clinical cure in the Favipiravir treatment arm (3 days [95%CI 3.0, 4.0]), compared to the control arm (5 days [95%CI 4.0,6.0]) (HR 1.749 [95% CI 1.096, 2.792]; p=0.029).
69.8% of patients in the Favipiravir treatment arm achieved clinical cure by Day 4, which was statistically significant compared to 44.9% observed in the control arm (p=0.019).
Amongst patients who clinically deteriorated and required oxygen support, those receiving Favipiravir had a longer median time to first time use of oxygen of 5 days (95%CI 1.0,6.0) versus 2 days (95% CI 1.0-4.0) in the control arm.
Additionally, Glenmark’s Favipiravir was well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths in the Favipiravir treated arm. One SAE occurred in the control arm and resulted in death due to worsening clinical disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) attributed to COVID-19 infection. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 26 patients in the favipiravir treatment arm (35.6%) as compared to six patients in the control arm (8%) however, most AEs were mild to moderate and none led to drug discontinuation or dosing adjustments. The most commonly observed AE was asymptomatic transient increases in uric acid (12 patients in the Favipiravir treatment arm and zero in the control arm); most resolved on first follow up. Gastrointestinal disturbance was minimal and no clinically significant differences were observed between the treatment groups.

Glenmark plans to submit the clinical trial data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks and share their findings.

Dr Zarir Udwadia, one of the Principal Investigators of this study, commented: “The results of the Indian Favipiravir study are encouraging. The trial was performed with a sense of urgency considering the gravity of the pandemic, yet scientific principles were not sacrificed. I have had a chance to independently view the initial results and they are encouraging: Patients randomised to Favipiravir seemed to have faster clinical cure, and more importantly, faster viral clearance than those randomized to the routine care group. I eagerly await the final analysis and results from other ongoing studies from across the globe. Till then, I feel we have enough evidence to consider using Favipiravir in symptomatic COVID-19 patients who have mild to moderate infection.”

Dr Monika Tandon, Vice President & Head – Clinical Development, Global Specialty/Branded Portfolio, said: “We are encouraged with the top-line results and these indicate that early treatment with favipiravir may improve clinical outcomes for mild to moderate patients and could potentially prevent patients from progressing to ARDS and mortality.”

About Favipiravir / FabiFlu® in India

On June 20th, Glenmark announced that it received manufacturing and marketing approval from India’s drug regulator for FabiFlu® , making it the first oral approved medication in India for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. The manufacturing and marketing approval was granted as part of an accelerated approval process, considering the emergency situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in India. The approval’s restricted use entails responsible medication use where every patient must have signed informed consent before treatment initiation.

Glenmark has commenced a Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study on FabiFlu® to closely monitor the efficacy and safety of the drug in 1000 patients that are prescribed with the oral antiviral, as part of an open label, multicenter, single arm study.

Glenmark is also conducting another Phase 3 clinical trial in India to evaluate the efficacy of two antiviral drugs Favipiravir and Umifenovir as a combination therapy in moderate hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. The combination study, which is called the FAITH trial, is looking to enroll 158 hospitalized patients of moderate COVID-19. Early treatment with combination therapy will be evaluated for safety and efficacy.

About Favipiravir Globally

Favipiravir has been approved in Japan since 2014 for the treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections. It is a broad-spectrum antiviral with a unique mechanism of action: it is converted into an active phosphoribosylated form (Favipiravir-RTP) in cells and recognized as a substrate by viral RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting RNA polymerase activity and viral replication. Favipiravir was granted approval in Russia for treatment of COVID-19 in May 2020 and is being prescribed to patients in multiple countries across the globe under compassionate use for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. It also is being tested in close to 20 clinical trials across 3000+ COVID-19 patients globally, including ongoing clinical trials in the US, Canada, Japan and Italy.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced detailed results from the Phase III Archway study evaluating its investigational Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) for the treatment of neovascular or “wet” age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), a leading cause of blindness in the U.S.1 In Archway, 98.4% of PDS patients were able to go six months without needing additional treatment and achieved vision outcomes equivalent to patients receiving monthly ranibizumab eye injections, a current standard of care.2 In the study, PDS was generally well-tolerated, with a favorable benefit-risk profile.2 PDS is a permanent refillable eye implant, approximately the size of a grain of rice, which continuously delivers a customized formulation of ranibizumab over a period of months. PDS is the first nAMD therapy to achieve positive Phase III results for this extended length of time between treatments.3 These new data will be discussed virtually during the 38th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) on Sunday, July 26, 2020. A recorded presentation of these data is now available to ASRS attendees through the meeting web portal.

“Based on the Archway results, PDS could potentially reduce the number of treatments from as many as 12 per year to two per year for neovascular AMD patients, without sacrificing efficacy”

“Based on the Archway results, PDS could potentially reduce the number of treatments from as many as 12 per year to two per year for neovascular AMD patients, without sacrificing efficacy,” said Carl Regillo, M.D., Chief of Retina Service at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia and an Archway study investigator. “While effective therapies exist for this condition, I know from clinical experience that it can be difficult for patients and caregivers to commit to frequent treatments, and patients who are not treated frequently enough may be at risk of losing vision.”

The current standard of care for nAMD requires patients to visit their ophthalmologist as often as monthly for eye injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy to help maintain vision gains or prevent vision loss.4 This high treatment burden with anti-VEGF therapy can lead to under-treatment of nAMD and, potentially, less than optimal vision outcomes.4,5

“For over a decade, we have been working to develop new treatments that better address the unmet needs of people living with neovascular AMD,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Based on these data, we believe that the continuous delivery mechanism enabled by PDS may offer effective, reliable results while also alleviating the treatment burden. We are excited to share the data with regulatory authorities with the aim of bringing this new treatment option to patients as soon as possible.”

Patients in Archway received either PDS refilled every six months with a customized formulation of ranibizumab or monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg eye injections. Patients in the study had received prior treatment with anti-VEGF therapy and were confirmed anti-VEGF responders. The primary endpoint of the study measured the change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) averaged over Week 36 and Week 40. In the PDS arm, patients gained an average of 0.2 eye chart letters in visual acuity from baseline, with 98.4% (n=244/248) of patients maintaining the fixed six-month refill schedule within the first refill period. Patients treated monthly with ranibizumab injections gained an average of 0.5 letters in visual acuity from baseline. According to pre-specified study criteria, PDS was shown to be non-inferior and equivalent to monthly ranibizumab injections. In addition, PDS controlled retinal thickness as effectively as monthly ranibizumab, with patients in both arms achieving a mean change in center point thickness within 10 μm from baseline. Safety data from the study support a favorable benefit-risk profile for PDS. The PDS implant insertion surgery and refill-exchange procedures were generally well-tolerated by patients and the systemic safety of PDS was comparable to monthly ranibizumab injections.2

In addition to Archway, the Portal long-term extension study is investigating the long-term safety and tolerability of PDS for the treatment of nAMD.6 PDS is also being studied in the Phase III Pagoda trial for the treatment of diabetic macular edema, a vision-threatening complication of diabetes.7 The Pagoda trial is actively recruiting patients.

Results from the Archway study will be submitted to health authorities around the world, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for consideration of regulatory approval for the treatment of nAMD.

About the Archway Study8

Archway (NCT03677934) is a randomized, multicenter, open-label Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS), refilled every six months at fixed intervals, compared to monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in 418 people living with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Patients enrolled in Archway were responders to prior treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. In both study arms, patients were treated with at least three anti-VEGF injections within the six months prior to their Archway screening visit. The primary endpoint of the study is the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score (the best distance vision a person can achieve – including with correction such as glasses – when reading letters on an eye chart) from baseline at the average of week 36 and week 40. Secondary endpoints include safety; overall change in BCVA from baseline; and change from baseline in center point thickness over time.

About Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading and is a leading cause of blindness for people age 60 and over in the U.S.1 Neovascular or “wet” AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss.9 Approximately 11 million people in the United States have some form of AMD and of those about 1.1 million have nAMD.9

Neovascular AMD is caused by growth of abnormal blood vessels, also referred to as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), into the macula. These vessels leak fluid and blood and cause scar tissue that destroys the central retina. This process results in a deterioration of sight over a period of months to years.

About Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS)

Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) is a permanent refillable eye implant, approximately the size of a grain of rice, which is designed to continuously release a customized formulation of ranibizumab into the eye over time. Ranibizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to bind to and inhibit VEGF-A, a protein that is believed to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels and the leakiness of the vessels.10

PDS contains a customized formulation of ranibizumab not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is different from the ranibizumab intravitreal injection, a medicine marketed as Lucentis® (ranibizumab injection) which is FDA-approved to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and other retinal diseases.

By maintaining therapeutic drug concentration levels of ranibizumab with two refills per year, PDS may offer greater outcomes certainty in terms of vision gains and maintaining those gains for people living with nAMD. Additionally, by decreasing the need for frequent injections and physician visits, PDS may reduce the burden of treatment associated with standard anti-VEGF treatments.4 The Archway trial of PDS in nAMD is evaluating a regimen of PDS implantation followed by twice-yearly refills.

About Lucentis® (ranibizumab injection)

Lucentis is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to bind to and inhibit VEGF-A, a protein that is believed to play a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and the hyperpermeability (leakiness) of the vessels.

Lucentis is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).

Lucentis was developed by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. The company retains commercial rights in the U.S. and Novartis has exclusive commercial rights for the rest of the world.

Outside the U.S., Lucentis is approved in more than 120 countries to treat adult patients with wet AMD, for the treatment of visual impairment due to DME, due to macular edema secondary to both branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV).

Lucentis Important Safety Information

Patients should not use Lucentis if they have an infection in or around the eye or are allergic to Lucentis or any of its ingredients.

Lucentis is a prescription medication given by injection into the eye, and it has side effects. Some Lucentis patients have had detached retinas and serious infections inside the eye. If your eye becomes red, sensitive to light, or painful, or if there is a change in vision, call or visit your eye doctor right away.

Some patients have had increased eye pressure before and within 1 hour of an injection.

Uncommonly, Lucentis patients have had serious, sometimes fatal, problems related to blood clots, such as heart attacks or strokes.

Fatal events were seen more often in patients with DME and DR with Lucentis compared with patients who did not receive Lucentis. Although there were only few fatal events which included causes of death typical of patients with advanced diabetic complications, these events may be caused by Lucentis.

Some Lucentis patients have serious side effects related to the injection. These include serious infections inside the eye, detached retinas, and cataracts. The most common eye-related side effects are increased redness in the white of the eye, eye pain, small specks in vision, and increased eye pressure. The most common non–eye related side effects are nose and throat infections, anemia, nausea and cough.

Patients may report side effects to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch. Patients may also report side effects to Genentech at (888) 835-2555.

Ovid and UConn to collaborate on genetic therapy for potential future use alone or in combination with OV101, Ovid’s small molecule therapy for Angelman syndrome in Phase 3 development
NEW YORK and FARMINGTON, Conn., July 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Ovid Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: OVID), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines that transform the lives of people with rare neurological diseases, and the University of Connecticut School of Medicine (“UConn”), today announced a research collaboration and license agreement to accelerate the development of a next-generation short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based therapeutic for Angelman syndrome and potentially other indications. The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is the loss of function of the gene that codes for ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A), which plays a critical role in nerve cell communication, resulting in impaired tonic inhibition. An shRNA-based therapeutic may address this underlying genetic cause of Angelman syndrome by reducing the expression of UBE3A-antisense, potentially restoring the function of UBE3A. This genetic approach may be used in combination with OV101 (gaboxadol), Ovid’s novel, small-molecule delta (δ)-selective GABAA receptor agonist, to restore tonic inhibition and address the underlying symptomology of individuals with Angelman syndrome. OV101 is currently being evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 NEPTUNE trial in Angelman syndrome, with topline results expected in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Under the terms of the research collaboration, Ovid will work closely with UConn’s Stormy J. Chamberlain, Ph.D., and gain exclusive access to identified genetic sequences for a potential shRNA-based therapeutic. Ovid plans to validate select sequences and leverage its translational medicine capabilities and drug development expertise in Angelman syndrome to advance an shRNA-based therapeutic into clinical studies. Dr. Chamberlain is a recognized leader in the field of Angelman syndrome and UBE3A research and currently serves as the John and Donna Krenicki Associate Professor of Genomics and Personalized Healthcare in UConn’s Genetics and Genome Sciences Department. In addition, Dr. Chamberlain chairs the Angelman Syndrome Foundation (ASF) Scientific Advisory Committee and is a member of the Dup15q Alliance Scientific Advisory Board. Ovid will also work closely with UConn’s Noelle Germain, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Genetics and Genome Sciences on these efforts.

“Ovid is deeply committed to the Angelman syndrome community. We have made great progress and are excited to see the topline data from our Phase 3 NEPTUNE trial with OV101 expected in Q4 2020,” said Amit Rakhit, M.D., MBA, President and Chief Medical Officer of Ovid Therapeutics. “We believe OV101 has the potential to serve as a core therapy for this disorder and are now focused on building a comprehensive and strategic Angelman syndrome longer term pipeline. If successful, OV101 may be used in combination with genetic approaches in the future to address the needs of Angelman syndrome. This collaboration with Drs. Chamberlain and Germain, both accomplished scientific leaders in the field of Angelman syndrome, will enable us to accelerate and share in their mission to identify and develop next-generation genetic therapies. Together with our early-stage microRNA approach, this research collaboration now provides us with additional targets against this disorder, greater strategic optionality, and underpins our broad capability to bring new therapies to individuals living with Angelman syndrome both near-term and into the future.”

“Our lab shares in Ovid’s demonstrated commitment to advance innovative therapeutic options for Angelman syndrome,” stated Dr. Chamberlain. “An shRNA therapeutic can target the genetic cause of Angelman syndrome at its source and may offer potential advantages to other next-generation approaches, including antisense oligonucleotide therapy, via a lower rate of degradation and turnover and plasmid delivery allowing for a less-frequent dosing profile. Ovid is uniquely positioned to accelerate an shRNA therapeutic through late preclinical and clinical development, and our lab looks forward to working with the team at Ovid towards our common objective of impacting the lives of individuals living with Angelman syndrome and their families.”

About Angelman Syndrome
Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic condition that is characterized by a variety of signs and symptoms. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, problems with movement and balance, seizures, sleep disorders and anxiety. The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is the loss of function of the gene that codes for ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A), which plays a critical role in nerve cell communication, resulting in impaired tonic inhibition. Individuals with Angelman syndrome typically have normal lifespans but are unable to live independently. Therefore, they require constant support from a network of specialists and caregivers. Angelman syndrome affects approximately 1 in 12,000 to 1 in 20,000 people globally.

There are no approved therapies by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency or rest-of-world for Angelman syndrome, and treatment primarily consists of behavioral interventions and pharmacologic management of symptoms.

Angelman syndrome is associated with a reduction in tonic inhibition, a function of the delta (δ)-selective GABAA receptor that allows a human brain to decipher excitatory and inhibitory neurological signals correctly without being overloaded. If tonic inhibition is reduced, the brain becomes inundated with signals and loses the ability to separate background noise from critical information.

Ovid is developing OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome to potentially restore tonic inhibition and thereby address several core symptoms of Angelman syndrome. Ovid is conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial with OV101 in Angelman syndrome (NEPTUNE), with topline results expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, Ovid is also exploring OV881, a microRNA approach that may reduce the expression of UBE3A-antisense and potentially restore UBE3A expression.

 Vosoritide is an investigational, once-daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for children with achondroplasia and has received FDA’s and EMA’s ODD","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., July 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) announced today that the company submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for vosoritide, an investigational, once daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for children with achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans. Subject to completion of EMA’s validation check, BioMarin anticipates the start of the MAA review to commence in August 2020.

BioMarin Pharmaceutical logo (PRNewsfoto/BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.)

The marketing application is based on the outcomes from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of vosoritide, announced in December 2019, and further supported by the long-term safety and efficacy from the ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 extension studies, and extensive natural history data. If approved, vosoritide would be the first medicine for the treatment of achondroplasia in Europe.

The company remains on track to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the third quarter of 2020. Vosoritide has Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and the EMA.

“Years of scientific research have led to this important point in the development of the potentially first pharmacological treatment option for children with achondroplasia. We have worked alongside patient advocacy groups from around the world throughout the development, and we appreciate the implications of developing a treatment option for this community, recognizing that this potential new treatment would offer a choice for families who have a child with achondroplasia,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President Worldwide Research and Development at BioMarin. “Our goal is to provide a treatment option that addresses the underlying cause of the condition and over time demonstrate a reduction of complications that may result from achondroplasia. We respect the depth and breadth of views among the community about treatment options and have sought to be scientifically rigorous in providing a robust data set for regulators to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide. We remain grateful to the physicians and families who have participated in our studies that have helped increase the scientific understanding of this investigational treatment.”

“This is an important milestone bringing the achondroplasia community one step closer to a potential therapy,” said Klaus Mohnike, Professor of Paediatrics at Magdeburg University Hospital in Germany and investigator for the vosoritide clinical program. “Our scientific and medical knowledge around skeletal dysplasias and achondroplasia in particular continues to increase, which can help us treat the underlying cause of the condition and potentially make a meaningful impact on the lives of children with achondroplasia.”

“It is of critical importance that children with achondroplasia and their families have drug treatment options to advance the standard of care for this condition where currently none are available,” said Carmen Alonso Alvarez, Managing Director of Fundacion ALPE Foundation. “We look forward to expanding treatment options that can contribute to the improvement of the health and well-being of children with achondroplasia.”

About Achondroplasia

Achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans, is characterized by slowing of endochondral ossification, which results in disproportionate short stature and disordered architecture in the long bones, spine, face and base of the skull. This condition is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), a negative regulator of bone growth. Beyond disproportionate short stature, people with achondroplasia can experience serious health complications, including foramen magnum compression, sleep apnea, bowed legs, mid-face hypoplasia, permanent sway of the lower back, spinal stenosis and recurrent ear infections. Some of these complications can result in the need for invasive surgeries such as spinal cord decompression and straightening of bowed legs. In addition, studies show increased mortality at every age.

More than 80% of children with achondroplasia have parents of average stature and have the condition as the result of a spontaneous gene mutation. The worldwide incidence rate of achondroplasia is about one in 25,000 live births. Vosoritide is being tested in children whose growth plates are still “open”, typically those under 18 years of age. This is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia. In the U.S., Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and most of Asia Pacific, there are currently no licensed medicines for achondroplasia.

Ahmedabad, India, July 23, 2020
Zydus, a leading discovery based, global pharmaceutical company today announced that it
has received approval from the USFDA, to initiate clinical trials of Desidustat in
Chemotherapy Induced Anemia (CIA).
Cancer Patients undergoing chemotherapy develop anemia. CIA results in fatigue, impaired
quality of life, discontinuation of chemotherapy and also exposes these cancer patients to redblood cell transfusions. Desidustat is expected to increase the red blood cell count and restore
the erythropoietin levels to the normal levels in the cancer patients with CIA. Estimates
suggest approximately 1.3 million cancer patients undergo chemotherapy every year in the
United States and 30% to 90% of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy develop anemia
Speaking on the development, Pankaj R. Patel, Chairman, Zydus Cadila said,
“Chemotherapy-Induced Anemia or CIA is a serious unmet medical need and there is a need
for novel therapies to address this condition. Desidustat has been specifically designed to
improve haemoglobin, reduce hepcidin and thereby treat anemia. We are committed to
develop Desidustat and support cancer patients battling Chemotherapy Induced Anemia.”
Desidustat is a novel, oral, hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, currently
undergoing Phase 3 trials for treating anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients. Zydus had
initiated two Phase III trials of Desidustat. The DREAM-ND Phase III trial is being conducted in 588
CKD patients not-on-dialysis [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04012957]. The DREAM-D Phase
III trial is being conducted in 392 CKD patients on Dialysis [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT04215120]. Desidustat had previously met its primary endpoints in the Phase II clinical studies
and showed good safety profile. The Phase I trials were earlier completed in Australia.
Zydus has also initiated a Phase II(b) trial of Desidustat in Mexico for the management of patients
with COVID-19. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04463602].

NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the start of a global (except for China) Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy clinical study to evaluate a single nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) candidate from their BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine program against SARS-CoV-2.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200727005800/en/

After extensive review of preclinical and clinical data from Phase 1/2 clinical trials, and in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and other global regulators, Pfizer and BioNTech have chosen to advance their BNT162b2 vaccine candidate into the Phase 2/3 study, at a 30 µg dose level in a 2 dose regimen. BNT162b2, which recently received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Fast Track designation, encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full length spike glycoprotein (S), which is the target of virus neutralizing antibodies.

“Our selection of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate and its advancement into a Phase 2/3 study are the culmination of an extensive, collaborative and unprecedented R&D program involving Pfizer, BioNTech, clinical investigators, and study participants with a singular focus of developing a safe and effective COVID-19 RNA vaccine. The Phase 2/3 study protocol follows all the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on clinical trial design for COVID-19 vaccine studies,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development, Pfizer. “The initiation of the Phase 2/3 trial is a major step forward in our progress toward providing a potential vaccine to help fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and we look forward to generating additional data as the program progresses.”

“Today, we are starting our late-stage global study, which will include up to 30,000 participants. We selected BNT162b2 as our lead candidate for this Phase 2/3 trial upon diligent evaluation of the totality of the data generated so far. This decision reflects our primary goal to bring a well-tolerated, highly effective vaccine to the market as quickly as possible, while we will continue to evaluate our other vaccine candidates as part of a differentiated COVID-19 vaccine portfolio,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-Founder of BioNTech. “Many steps have been taken towards this important milestone and we would like to thank all those involved for their extraordinary commitment.”

About the BNT162b2 Candidate

During preclinical and clinical studies of four BNT162 RNA vaccine candidates, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 emerged as strong candidates based on assessments of safety and immune response. Pfizer and BioNTech selected BNT162b2 as the candidate to progress to a Phase 2/3 study based on the totality of available data from our preclinical and clinical studies, including select immune response and tolerability parameters.

In the preclinical studies, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 candidates induced favorable viral antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+T cell responses, high levels of neutralizing antibody in various animal species, and beneficial protective effects in a primate SARS-CoV-2 challenge model.

Preliminary clinical Phase 1/2 data from nearly 120 patients demonstrated a favorable overall tolerability profile for BNT162b2, as compared to BNT162b1, with generally mild to moderate and transient (1-2 days) systemic events, such as fever, fatigue and chills and no serious adverse events. Two 30 µg doses of BNT162b2 elicited neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) generally similar to the GMTs that were elicited by the BNT162b1 vaccine candidate, as reflected in data the companies have previously posted on a preprint server. In older adults (65-85 years of age), two 30 µg doses, spaced three weeks apart, elicited a neutralizing antibody GMT higher than the GMT in a panel of 38 sera from subjects who had contracted SARS-CoV-2. BNT162b2 vaccinated human participants displayed a favorable breadth of epitopes recognized in T cell responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, as compared to the BNT162b1 candidate. BNT162b2 demonstrated concurrent induction of high magnitude CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. BNT162b2 elicited T cell responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and against the remainder of the spike glycoprotein that is not contained in the BNT162b1 vaccine candidate. The companies believe that immune recognition of more spike T cell epitopes may have the potential to generate more consistent responses across diverse populations and in older adults.

The companies are continuing to collect data from the Phase 1/2 trials for all four vaccine candidates and expect to submit data on BNT162b2 for peer review and potential publication in the near future. In keeping with their commitment to transparency, the companies intend to also post the manuscript on a preprint server at that time.

About the Phase 2/3 Study

Pfizer and BioNTech finalized the Phase 2/3 study protocol in response to feedback from global regulators, including the FDA and the German Paul-Ehrlich-Institut. The Phase 2/3 study is an event driven trial that is planned to enroll up to 30,000 participants between 18 and 85 years of age. The companies plan to enroll a diverse population, including participants in areas where there is significant expected SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

The Phase 2/3 trial is designed as a 1:1 vaccine candidate to placebo, randomized, observer-blinded study to obtain safety, immune response, and efficacy data needed for regulatory review. The trial’s primary endpoints will be prevention of COVID-19 in those who have not been infected by SARS-CoV-2 prior to immunization, and prevention of COVID-19 regardless of whether participants have previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 in those groups. The study also will explore prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The primary efficacy analysis will be an event-driven analysis based on the number of participants with symptomatic COVID-19 disease. The trial design allows for interim analyses and unblinded reviews by an independent external Data Monitoring Committee.

By the end of the trial, the Phase 2/3 study is expected to be active at approximately 120 clinical investigational sites around the world, including 39 states across the United States and countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Germany. Investigator sites are selected based on factors including scientific expertise and capabilities, the epidemiology of the disease, and prior experience conducting clinical trials. For further information about this trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov using the number NCT04368728.

Pfizer and BioNTech are committed to decreasing health disparities in underrepresented populations through the clinical trial process. To that end, many investigator sites are in diverse communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 so that individuals who have been most impacted have the opportunity to participate. The companies are also working together with investigator sites and advocacy partners to raise awareness about the importance of participation in this trial.

BNT162b2 remains under clinical study and is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. If the Phase 2/3 trial is successful, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be ready to seek Emergency Use Authorization or some form of regulatory approval as early as October 2020. If authorization or approval is obtained, the companies currently aim to supply globally up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and approximately 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.

About Fruquintinib

Fruquintinib is a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (“VEGFR”) 1/2/3. VEGFR inhibitors play a pivotal role in blocking tumor angiogenesis. Fruquintinib was designed to improve kinase selectivity to minimize off-target toxicities, improve tolerability and provide more consistent target coverage. The generally good tolerability in patients to date, along with fruquintinib’s low potential for drug-drug interaction based on preclinical assessment, suggests that it may also be highly suitable for combinations with other anti-cancer therapies.

Chi-Med retains all rights to fruquintinib outside of China and is partnered with Lilly in China.

About fruquintinib in metastatic colorectal cancer (“mCRC”)

Fruquintinib was approved for marketing by the China National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) in September 2018 and commercially launched by Lilly in late November 2018 under the brand name Elunate®. Elunate® is for the treatment of patients with mCRC that have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, including those who have previously received anti-VEGF therapy and/or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) therapy (RAS wild type). Results of the FRESCO study, a Phase III pivotal registration trial of fruquintinib in 416 patients with mCRC in China demonstrating improvement in overall survival, were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, in June 2018 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02314819).

In December 2017, Chi-Med initiated a Phase Ib clinical study to evaluate fruquintinib in U.S. patients with advanced solid tumors. Proof-of-concept cohorts in patients with mCRC and metastatic breast cancer were added in 2019 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03251378).

Chi-Med is initiating FRESCO-2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III registration trial in refractory mCRC in the U.S., Europe and Japan. The primary endpoint of the study is overall survival. Over 500 patients will be enrolled from approximately 130 sites in 10 countries. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation for development for mCRC patients in June 2020. The FRESCO-2 study design was also reviewed and endorsed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04322539).

Other Fruquintinib Development

Gastric Cancer in China: In October 2017, Chi-Med initiated the FRUTIGA study, a randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with paclitaxel for second-line treatment of advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. The trial is designed to enroll patients who did not respond to first-line standard chemotherapy. Subjects will receive either fruquintinib combined with paclitaxel or placebo combined with paclitaxel. The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival. In June 2020, Chi-Med completed a planned interim data review. Based on the preset criteria, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended that the trial continue (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03223376).

Immunotherapy combinations: Chi-Med has entered into three collaboration agreements to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of fruquintinib in combination with programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies, including with tislelizumab (BGB-A317), Tyvyt® (sintilimab, IBI308) and geptanolimab (GB226, genolimzumab).

 P-tau217 is better than blood-based biomarkers or MRI but did not perform significantly better than cerebrospinal fluid- or PET-based tau biomarkers. Moreover, the test has the potential together with digital tools for checking memory performance like smartphone apps, to improve the diagnosis of AD","New Alzheimer’s disease blood test could enable early diagnosis and advance understanding of how disease impacts those living with it

INDIANAPOLIS, July 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — A new study on Lilly’s blood test for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), P-tau217 (phosphorylated tau at threonine-217), was published today in JAMA. The results showed that P-tau217 distinguished AD from other neurodegenerative diseases significantly better than other blood-based biomarkers or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These data will also be presented at the upcoming 2020 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference® (AAIC) ®. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Lilly, are studying P-tau217 as a biomarker of AD pathology.

The cross-sectional three-cohort study included patients from an Arizona-based neuropathology cohort, the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort and a cohort of Colombian autosomal-dominant AD relatives. The study findings showed that P-tau217 accurately identified AD from other neurodegenerative diseases in both an Arizona-based neuropathology cohort and in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study. In the third Colombian cohort, P-tau217 in mutation carriers’ blood was elevated about 20 years before anticipated symptom onset and was associated with memory performance. The collaborative study was led by Oskar Hansson, M.D., Professor of Neurology at Lund University and Consultant Neurologist at Skåne University Hospital, with support from Eric Reiman, M.D., CEO of Banner Research and Executive Director of Banner Alzheimer’s Institute, and was co-authored by Shorena Janelidze, Ph.D. and Sebastian Palmqvist, M.D., of Lund University.

“Blood tests like P-tau217 have the potential to revolutionize Alzheimer’s research, treatment and prevention trials, and clinical care,” said Eric Reiman, M.D., a co-senior author who supported the research on the Colombian cohort. “While there’s more work to do, I anticipate that their impact in both the research and clinical setting will become readily apparent within the next two years.”

The JAMA publication provides strong support that P-tau217, measured in plasma, could be used to improve the differential diagnosis of patients with cognitive impairment. The analysis also showed the test did not perform significantly different than cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)- or positron emission tomography (PET)-based tau biomarkers. A timely and accurate diagnosis of patients with cognitive impairment requires an approach which combines a variety of diagnostic tests.

“Differentiating AD pathology from other kinds of cognitive impairment is an important step in advancing our understanding of how the disease is impacting those living with it,” said Jeffrey Dage, Ph.D., senior research advisor, Lilly, and co-author of the study. “As research progresses and we are able to identify AD earlier, we hope to tailor future treatment advances to the right patients at the right time. Lilly and Avid remain committed to conducting robust research in AD, from diagnostic tools through treatment opportunities.”

“Today the majority of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease around the world do not get a timely diagnosis, which results in suboptimal symptomatic treatment and care,” said Oskar Hansson, M.D. “With rising prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease, more patients will be evaluated in primary care and other clinics where CSF and PET biomarkers are not available. Blood-based biomarkers, like plasma P-tau217, together with digital tools for checking memory performance, such as smartphone-based apps, can considerably improve the diagnostic work-up of Alzheimer’s disease patients in such clinics.”

Lilly will continue to optimize the assay and determine its potential role in clinical care. The reliability and efficacy of P-tau217 has not been established and it is not approved by any regulatory authority worldwide. More data on P-tau217 will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings, including AAIC ® (July 27-31) and the Clinical Trials in Alzheimer’s Disease Conference®, CTAD®, (November 4-7).

For more than 30 years, Lilly has been engaged in bringing innovative Alzheimer’s disease therapies and diagnostics to patients and continues to lead the field in research, which also includes identifying biomarkers to support early detection of the disease.

About Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition. Dementia due to Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of all cases1. There are currently over 50 million people living with dementia around the world, with numbers expected to increase to nearly 152 million by 20502. Almost 10 million new cases of dementia are diagnosed each year worldwide, implying one new case every 3 seconds, and a significant increase in the caregiving burden placed on society and families. In the US alone, there was an increase of 8 million new caregivers from 2015 to 20203. The current annual societal and economic cost of dementia is estimated at $1 trillion, an amount that is expected to double by 2030 unless we find a way to slow the disease.

37528,Roche's Actemra/RoActemra (tocilizumab) Fails to Meet the Primary Endpoint in P-III COVACTA Study for Patients with COVID-19 Associated Pneumonia,Roche provides an update on the phase III COVACTA trial of Actemra/RoActemra in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia,"The P-III COVACTA study involves assessing of Actemra/RoActemra (IV) + SOC vs PBO + SOC in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Patients will be followed for 60 days post-randomization
 The study did not meet its 1EPs i.e. improvement in clinical status and 2EPs i.e. difference in patient mortality @4wks. (19.7% vs 19.4%); median time to discharge (20 vs 28days); rate of infection (38.3% vs 40.6%); rates of serious infections (21.0% vs 25.9%)

Roche will continue the clinical study of Actemra in other treatment settings including in combination with an antiviral","Roche provides an update on the phase III COVACTA trial of Actemra/RoActemra in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia
COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality
The study is the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting
Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral
Basel, 29 July – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the phase III COVACTA study of Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia. In addition, the key secondary endpoints, which included the difference in patient mortality at week four, were not met; however, there was a positive trend in time to hospital discharge in patients treated with Actemra/RoActemra. The COVACTA study did not identify any new safety signals for Actemra/RoActemra. Further analysis of the trial results is needed to fully understand the data. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

“People around the world are waiting for further effective treatment options for COVID-19 and we are disappointed that COVACTA did not demonstrate a benefit for patients in either clinical status or mortality at week four. We will continue to generate evidence to provide a more complete understanding of Actemra/RoActemra in COVID-19 associated pneumonia,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are grateful for the patients and physicians around the world who helped us to complete this study quickly during a public health crisis, while upholding the highest standards of scientific rigour. We will keep working to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The COVACTA trial was conducted in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

COVACTA evaluated the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra/RoActemra added to standard-of-care treatment compared to treatment with placebo plus standard of care. The primary endpoint of clinical status in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia was measured by a 7-category ordinal scale, which tracked patients’ clinical status based on the need for intensive care and/or ventilator use, as well as supplemental oxygen requirements. The COVACTA trial is the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study to investigate Actemra/RoActemra in adult patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia, with study locations in the US, Canada and Europe.

Summary of Key COVACTA Clinical and Safety Findings

Primary endpoint not met: The difference in clinical status between Actemra/RoActemra and placebo in patients assessed using a 7-category ordinal scale at week four was not statistically significant (p=0.36; odds ratio [95% CI] = 1.19 [0.81, 1.76], a statistically significant odds ratio greater than 1 would have favoured Actemra/RoActemra).
There was no difference between Actemra/RoActemra and placebo in the percentage of patients that died by week four (Actemra/RoActemra = 19.7% and placebo = 19.4% with a difference [95% CI] of 0.3% [-7.6%, 8.2%], p=0.9410)
Time to hospital discharge or ‘ready to discharge’ was shorter in patients treated with Actemra/RoActemra than in those treated with placebo. The median time to discharge or ‘ready to discharge’ for Actemra/RoActemra was 20 days and for placebo was 28 days (median time [95% CI]: Actemra/RoActemra = 20.0 [17.0, 27.0]; placebo = 28.0 [20.0, NE], p=0.0370). However, the difference cannot be considered statistically significant as the primary endpoint was not met.
The difference in ventilator-free days between Actemra/RoActemra and placebo was not statistically significant (median of 22 days for Actemra/RoActemra and 16.5 days with placebo, difference in medians [95% CI] = 5.5 [-2.8, 13.0], p=0.3202).
At week four, rates of infections were 38.3% and 40.6% in the Actemra/RoActemra and placebo arms, respectively, and the rates of serious infections were 21.0% and 25.9% in the Actemra/RoActemra and placebo arms, respectively. The COVACTA study did not identify any new safety signals for Actemra/RoActemra.
In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. There are also a number of independent trials of Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Actemra/RoActemra has not previously been studied in, nor approved for, COVID-19 associated pneumonia.

About the COVACTA Trial
COVACTA is a global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (COVACTA, NCT04320615) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra/RoActemra added to standard of care in adult patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. The primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) variables at week four. Patients will be followed for 60 days post randomisation.

About Actemra/RoActemra
Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved anti-IL-6 receptor biologic available in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Actemra/RoActemra can be used alone or with methotrexate (MTX) in adult RA patients who are intolerant to, or have failed to respond to, other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In Europe, RoActemra IV and SC are also approved for use in adult patients with severe, active and progressive RA who previously have not been treated with MTX. Actemra/RoActemra IV and SC are approved globally for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and in the US and Europe for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in children two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra SC injection is also the first approved therapy for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in more than 40 countries, including the US and Europe. In the US and Europe, Actemra/RoActemra IV injection is approved for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in people two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved treatment for CRS in this setting. A prefilled auto-injector ACTPen has been approved in the US and Europe. In Japan, Actemra is also approved for the treatment of Castleman’s disease, adult Still’s disease and Takayasu arteritis, in addition to the above mentioned indications. Actemra/RoActemra is part of a co-development agreement with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and has been approved in Japan since April 2005. Actemra/RoActemra is approved in more than 110 countries worldwide.

About Roche’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally, with varying developments from country to country. We are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help ensure patients receive the tests, treatment and care that they need.

Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 12 March, we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA EUA and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June, we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio for COVID-19 and are researching options for the future.

Significantly more patients receiving either dose of upadacitinib plus TCS showed improvement in skin clearance compared to placebo plus TCS at week 16.1 In the study, 65/77 percent of patients receiving upadacitinib 15/30 mg plus TCS achieved EASI 75, respectively, versus 26 percent receiving placebo plus TCS (p<0.001).1 Of patients treated with upadacitinib 15/30 mg plus TCS, 40/59 percent achieved vIGA-AD 0/1, respectively, versus 11 percent of patients receiving placebo plus TCS (p<0.001).1

“These data build on the positive results from our previous studies in atopic dermatitis, now with additional perspective on the efficacy of RINVOQ used with a mainstay treatment for people living with the disease – topical steroids,” said Tom Hudson, M.D., senior vice president of R&D and chief scientific officer, AbbVie. “With our deep heritage in serious skin diseases, we look forward to advancing research with RINVOQ as part of our ultimate goal to address unmet needs and improve care for people living with the relentless itch and skin symptoms of atopic dermatitis.”

Additionally, more patients treated with upadacitinib plus TCS experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch, defined as improvement in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)≥4, compared to patients treated with placebo plus TCS.1 At week 16, 52/64 percent of patients receiving upadacitinib 15/30 mg plus TCS achieved this endpoint compared to 15 percent of patients receiving placebo plus TCS (p<0.001).1

In a pre-specified additional analysis, treatment with either dose of upadacitinib also led to a higher mean number of topical corticosteroid-free days (TCS-free days) up to week 16 versus placebo.1 A TCS-free day is defined by a response of EASI 75 or greater without the use of TCS.1 Patients treated with upadacitinib 15/30 mg had a mean of 34/47 TCS-free days while maintaining EASI 75, respectively, compared with a mean of 8 days for those treated with placebo plus TCS (nominal p<0.001).1

“These results are encouraging, including the analysis showing some patients in the upadacitinib treatment groups were able to control their skin symptoms without topical corticosteroids,” said Kristian Reich, M.D., professor of translational research in inflammatory skin diseases at the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, and Skinflammation Center, Hamburg, Germany and principal investigator. “Many of the current treatment options rely on patients to self-manage their condition, often with multiple applications of topicals. Patients could benefit from more therapeutic options that can help control symptoms without the constant need for concomitant topicals, as they strive for relief from this life-long, chronic disease.”

a EASI 75 is defined as at least a 75 percent reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index.

b vIGA-AD 0/1 is defined as a validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis of clear or almost clear (0/1) with at least two grades of reduction from baseline.

c Improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS≥4 is defined as an improvement (reduction) in Worst Pruritus NRS≥4. The endpoint was analyzed for participants with pruritus NRS≥4 at baseline.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition characterized by a cycle of intense itching and scratching leading to cracked, scaly, oozing skin.12,13 It affects up to an estimated 25 percent of adolescents and 10 percent of adults at some point in their lifetime.13 Between 20 and 46 percent of adults with atopic dermatitis have moderate to severe disease.14 The range of symptoms pose significant physical, psychological and economic burden on individuals impacted by the disease.13,15

Safety results were consistent with the two previously reported Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis, with no new safety risks observed during the 16-week placebo-controlled period.1-3 Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 2.3 percent of patients in the upadacitinib 15 mg plus TCS group and 1.3 percent of patients in the upadacitinib 30 mg plus TCS group compared to 3.0 percent of patients in the placebo plus TCS group.1 The most common AEs for the upadacitinib groups were nasopharyngitis, acne and upper respiratory tract infection.1 Acne was observed at higher rates in the 15 mg and 30 mg upadacitinib plus TCS groups (10.0 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively) versus placebo plus TCS group (2.0 percent); all events were mild or moderate in severity and none led to treatment discontinuation.1 Eczema herpeticum was observed in 1.0 percent of patients on upadacitinib 15 mg plus TCS and 1.3 percent of patients on upadacitinib 30 mg plus TCS; none were reported in patients on placebo plus TCS.1 Serious infections were reported infrequently (1.0 percent in the upadacitinib 15 mg plus TCS group, 1.0 percent in the placebo plus TCS group; none were reported in the upadacitinib 30 mg plus TCS group).1 One event of arterial thrombosis occurred in a patient on placebo plus TCS.1 No deaths, major adverse cardiac events or venous thromboembolic events were reported in any of the treatment groups.1

Full results from the AD Up study will be presented at a future medical meeting and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Use of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by regulatory authorities.

About AD Up1,11

AD Up, together with Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 (top-line results announced in June and July 2020), make up AbbVie’s Phase 3 pivotal trial program evaluating RINVOQ for the treatment of individuals with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (ages 12 and older) who are candidates for systemic treatment.

AD Up is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg or placebo, all in combination with TCS. Patients receiving placebo plus TCS were switched to either upadacitinib 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg plus TCS at week 16.

The co-primary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving EASI 75 and a vIGA-AD of 0/1 after 16 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS≥4, EASI 90, percent change in Worst Pruritus NRS, percent change in EASI at week 16. The trial is ongoing, and the long-term extension period remains blinded to investigators and patients, to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of the two once daily doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib plus TCS in patients who have completed the placebo-controlled period. More information on this trial can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03568318).

About RINVOQ (upadacitinib)

Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is an oral, once-daily, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.1,4-11 It was engineered to have greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 versus JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2.16 In August 2019, RINVOQ received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. In December 2019, RINVOQ also received approval by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The approved dose for RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis are ongoing.5-11 Use of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by regulatory authorities.

Important Safety Information about RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib)

RINVOQ U.S. Use and Important Safety Information
RINVOQ is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate did not work well or could not be tolerated. It is not known if RINVOQ is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.

What is the most important information I should know about RINVOQ?
RINVOQ is a medicine that can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. You should not start taking RINVOQ if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider (HCP) tells you it is okay.

Serious infections have happened in some people taking RINVOQ, including tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your HCP should test you for TB before starting RINVOQ and check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with RINVOQ. You may be at higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster).
Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in people taking RINVOQ.
Blood clots in the veins of the legs or lungs and arteries are possible in some people taking RINVOQ. This may be life-threatening and cause death.
Tears in the stomach or intestines and changes in certain laboratory tests can happen. Your HCP should do blood tests before you start taking RINVOQ and while you take it. Your HCP may stop your RINVOQ treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
What should I tell my HCP BEFORE starting RINVOQ?
Tell your HCP if you:

Are being treated for an infection, have an infection that won’t go away or keeps coming back, or have symptoms of an infection such as:
Fever, sweating, or chills
Shortness of breath
Warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
Muscle aches
Feeling tired
Blood in phlegm
Diarrhea or stomach pain
Cough
Weight loss
Burning when urinating or urinating more often than normal
Have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB.
Have had any type of cancer, hepatitis B or C, shingles (herpes zoster), or blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs, diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine), or ulcers in your stomach or intestines.
Have other medical conditions including liver problems, low blood cell counts, diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune system.
Live, have lived, or have traveled to parts of the country that increase your risk of getting certain kinds of fungal infections, such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest. If you are unsure if you’ve been to these areas, ask your HCP.
Have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People who take RINVOQ should not receive live vaccines.
Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Based on animal studies, RINVOQ may harm your unborn baby. Your HCP will check whether or not you are pregnant before you start RINVOQ. You should use effective birth control (contraception) to avoid becoming pregnant while taking RINVOQ and for at least 4 weeks after your last dose.
Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. RINVOQ may pass into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed while taking RINVOQ and for at least 6 days after your last dose.
Tell your HCP about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. RINVOQ and other medicines may affect each other, causing side effects.

Especially tell your HCP if you take:

Medicines for fungal or bacterial infections
Rifampicin or phenytoin
Medicines that affect your immune system
Ask your HCP or pharmacist if you are not sure if you are taking any of these medicines.

What should I tell my HCP AFTER starting RINVOQ?
Tell your HCP right away if you:

Have any symptoms of an infection. RINVOQ can make you more likely to get infections or make any infections you have worse.
Have any signs or symptoms of blood clots during treatment with RINVOQ, including:
Swelling
Sudden unexplained chest pain
Pain or tenderness in the leg
Shortness of breath
Have a fever or stomach-area pain that does not go away, and a change in your bowel habits.
What are the common side effects of RINVOQ?
These include: upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), nausea, cough, and fever. These are not all the possible side effects of RINVOQ.

RINVOQ is taken once a day with or without food. Do not split, break, crush, or chew the tablet. Take RINVOQ exactly as your HCP tells you to use it.

This is the most important information to know about RINVOQ. For more information, talk to your HCP. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit http://www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

The companies’ first mobile app, CKD&Me, launched in the United States; now preparing for global expansion
Collaboration expected to also bring new patient mobile capabilities to Baxter’s Sharesource telehealth platform to support patient engagement and therapy management
DEERFIELD, Ill. & VANCOUVER, British Columbia–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), a global innovator in renal care, and Ayogo Health Inc., a behavioral science-based digital health company, announced the expansion of their partnership to support the needs of patients with kidney disease through digital health solutions. Ayogo is combining LifePlan—its unique behavior-based digital platform—with Baxter’s expertise in renal care to build mobile apps and digital solutions that bring personalized, relevant and timely support to patients with kidney failure. Baxter also made an equity investment in Ayogo in exchange for minority interest in the company. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.

“As a leader in renal care innovation and pioneer in digital health solutions for patients with kidney failure, our collaboration with Ayogo allows us to provide healthcare professionals and patients more confidence in their therapy options, including home dialysis,” said Laura Angelini, general manager, Baxter’s Renal Care business. “This is particularly important in the midst of the pandemic, when it is critical to support patients with digital health tools that empower them to perform dialysis in the safety of their home, while staying connected with their healthcare team.”

The companies’ initial collaboration resulted in a patient engagement app—CKD&Me—that provides customized disease and therapy education for the individual learning needs of patients with chronic kidney disease. CKD&Me recently launched in the United States for use on smartphones and tablets and is available in the United States on the App Store and on Google Play.

While the companies continue to expand the content and features of CKD&Me, they are also building a new mobile platform for patients using Baxter’s Sharesource remote patient management platform. Sharesource, which is widely used in 65 countries, has helped healthcare professionals remotely manage more than 17 million home patients’ dialysis treatments. The new initiative will provide patients the ability to more proactively manage their home dialysis therapy records in partnership with their healthcare team.

Two retrospective studies conducted at Baxter’s Renal Care Services clinics in Colombia found the use of Baxter’s Sharesource remote patient management platform with automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) therapy was associated with a 56% reduction in technique failure1 and a 39% reduction in hospitalizations.2 Both studies compared metrics for patients on APD and using Sharesource, with those of patients on APD but not using the remote patient management platform. Patients using Baxter’s APD systems with Sharesource to perform therapy can be closely monitored by their healthcare professionals without leaving their homes. Healthcare professionals can then act on this information by remotely adjusting their patients’ home device settings without requiring them to make additional trips to the clinic.

“Ayogo’s vision is of an empowered patient, successful on their own terms, with tools and support dynamically tailored to the unique characteristics and circumstances of their life,” said Michael Fergusson, CEO, Ayogo. “We’re very excited that Baxter shares this vision. We’re proud of our collaboration on CKD&Me, and to grow our partnership with Baxter to bring the power of Sharesource and Ayogo’s LifePlan platform direct to patients around the world.”

37564,BARDA Signs a Multi-Year Agreement with Regeneron for its REGN-EB3 for National Preparedness,BARDA Procures Regeneron’s REGN-EB3 Investigational Ebola Treatment for National Preparedness,"Regeneron will be responsible to deliver treatment doses for six years post-approval of product from the FDA, will receive compensation of ~$10M & average of $67M/year in 2021 and each for the next five years (2022-2026) respectively
 In 2019, the PALM trial evaluated REGN-EB3 vs ZMapp conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was stopped as the REGN-EB3 crossed the pre-specified superiority threshold for preventing death in Ebola patients
 Regeneron’s REGN-EB3 is a novel anti-viral Ab cocktail developed using its VelociSuite platform in collaboration and funding provided by BARDA. The product is under priority review by the US FDA with PDUFA date Oct 25, 2020","TARRYTOWN, N.Y., July 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — 

REGN-EB3 is a novel anti-viral antibody cocktail developed using the same rapid response technologies as REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational COVID-19 antibody cocktail

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) announced today that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has entered into an agreement to procure REGN-EB3 as part of the HHS’ goal of building national preparedness for public health emergencies.

REGN-EB3 is Regeneron’s investigational triple antibody cocktail treatment for Ebola virus infection and is currently under Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with a target action date of October 25, 2020. Contingent on FDA approval, Regeneron expects to deliver an established number of treatment doses over the course of six years and receive compensation of approximately $10 million in 2021 and an average of $67 million per year for each of the next five years (2022-2026).

“Developed using Regeneron’s proprietary VelociSuite® rapid response technologies, REGN-EB3 was shown to save lives in the PALM trial, which evaluated multiple therapies against the previous standard of care for Ebola,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. “Regeneron’s thirty years of investment in our technology and people enabled the development of REGN-EB3, which reinforces the importance of having at-the-ready tools to fight emerging pathogens. As we push through the current COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important for governments and industry to ensure preparedness for the next global health crisis by continuing to invest in innovative science and broad manufacturing capacity.”

“The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an important lesson in preparation for potential biological threats to our nation’s health security,” said BARDA acting director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “REGN-EB3 is the result of years of collaboration, which demonstrates the fundamental value of public-private partnership in protecting Americans from global epidemics. Whether the next one is another coronavirus, an Ebola virus or a completely novel disease, we must do everything we can to be prepared.”

In 2019, the randomized controlled PALM clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was stopped early when preliminary results showed that REGN-EB3 crossed the pre-specified superiority threshold for preventing death compared to the control arm, ZMapp®. REGN-EB3 demonstrated superior efficacy compared to ZMapp across multiple measures, including reduced mortality and fewer days until the Ebola virus was no longer detected in the bloodstream. During the trial, there were three serious adverse events for REGN-EB3, compared to seven for ZMapp. REGN-EB3 is being developed with collaboration and funding provided by BARDA under ongoing USG Contract Nos. HHSO100201700016C and HHSO100201500013C.

37572,UCB Canada's Brivlera (brivaracetam) Receives Health Canada Approval to Treat Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Epilepsy Patients,Health Canada Approves BRIVLERA® (brivaracetam) to treat partial-onset seizures in pediatric epilepsy patients,"The approval is based on the principle of extrapolation of its efficacy data in adults also supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data in children. Additionally, the safety and tolerability data of Brivlera in children 4 years and older were similar to observed in adults
 The usage of Brivlera in pediatric and adolescent patients is supported by the placebo-controlled partial-onset seizure studies in adults, PK study in pediatric aged 4 to 17 years of and for the achievement of similar plasma concentrations as of adults weight-based dose adaptations were practiced
 Brivlera is an anti-epileptic drug (AED) displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) developing anticonvulsant effects, approved by Health Canada as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 4 years of age and older","BRIVLERA is approved as an adjunctive therapy in patients four years of age and older with partial-onset seizures after conventional therapy.
Health Canada’s approval of BRIVLERA provides pediatric epilepsy patients with a treatment option which can be initiated at a therapeutic dose from day one.
BRIVLERA has been available in Canada for the treatment of epilepsy in adults (>18 years of age) since 2016, broadening clinical application for UCB’s newest anti-epilepsy drug.
Epilepsy affects approximately 260,000 Canadians[i], of which 75-85% of patients are diagnosed before age 18ii, making pediatric epilepsy the most common, serious neurological disorder among children and young adults.
OAKVILLE, ON, July 29, 2020 /CNW/ – UCB Canada Inc. announced today that Health Canada has approved BRIVLERA® (brivaracetam) as an adjunctive therapy in the management of partial-onset seizures in patients 4 years of age and older with epilepsy who are not satisfactorily controlled with conventional therapy.iii This approval provides clinicians with a child-friendly option to prescribe BRIVLERA to their pediatric patients as a tablet or oral solution, offering flexible administration options which are important considerations when treating children. BRIVLERA has been approved in Canada for the treatment of epilepsy in adults (>18 years of age) since 2016.

“Pediatric epilepsy can have a significant impact on a child’s development and quality of life. New treatment options, such as BRIVLERA, are important because they expand the opportunity to provide children with individualized treatment aimed at achieving seizure control,” said Dr. Andrea Andrade, Neurologist and Epileptologist, Medical Director, Pediatric Epilepsy Program at Children’s Hospital in London, Ontario.

Epilepsy is a complex disorder affecting approximately 260,000 Canadiansi, of which 75-85% are diagnosed before age 18ii, making pediatric epilepsy the most common, serious neurological disorder among children and young adults. It is estimated that 42,000 children in Canada under the age of 18 have epilepsy.ii Despite its growing prevalence, approximately 10 to 20 per cent of pediatric epilepsy patients experience inadequate seizure control with available anti-epileptic drugs.iv, v, vi

“For children and families living with epilepsy, one of the most frightening things about seizures is their unpredictability,” said Paul Raymond, Chief Executive Officer, Epilepsy Ontario. “Having a new treatment for partial-onset seizures may help to minimize some of the anxiety and challenges associated with epilepsy in children and allow them to live a normal and active life.”

BRIVLERA is the newest anti-epileptic drug (AED) in the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) family of medicines – a class of medicines discovered and developed by UCB. It is easily and extensively absorbed by the body and rapidly permeates the brain where it demonstrates high and selective affinity for SV2A. This may contribute to its anticonvulsant effects. BRIVLERA has a favourable tolerability profile and a titration period is not required when initiating treatment with BRIVLERA for adjunctive therapy. This allows clinicians to start patients within the therapeutic dose range from the first day of treatment.

BRIVLERA was approved by Health Canada based on the principle of extrapolation of its efficacy data from adults to children and is supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data collected in children. This principle of extrapolating clinical data from well controlled studies in adults has been recognized by Health Canada as potentially addressing the challenge of limited pediatric data availability. The safety and tolerability profile of BRIVLERA in children 4 years and older is generally similar to that seen with adult patients. i

Use of BRIVLERA in pediatric and adolescent patients is supported by evidence from placebo-controlled partial-onset seizure studies of BRIVLERA in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and open-label safety studies in pediatric aged 4 to 17 years of age. Weight-based dose adaptations have been established in the pediatric population to achieve similar plasma concentrations as observed in adults.i Specific weight-based dosing has been established which allows clinicians to tailor BRIVLERA treatment to individual patient needs.

About Epilepsy in Canada
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder affecting approximately 50 million people worldwidevii, including about 1 in 100 people in Canada viii. While epilepsy has the highest rate of new cases in seniors and young children, it can affect people of any age, race and sexviii. Next to migraine headaches, epilepsy is the most common neurological disorderix. It is defined as one or more unprovoked seizures with a risk of future seizures. Around one third of people with epilepsy live with uncontrolled seizures.x

About BRIVLERA
BRIVLERA (brivaracetam) is a newer molecular entity that was rationally designed and developed by UCB. Brivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) in the brain, which may contribute to the anticonvulsant effect. However, the precise mechanism of action by which BRIVLERA exerts its anticonvulsant activity is not known.i

In Canada, BRIVLERA is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy 4 years of age and older. As the safety of BRIVLERA injection in pediatric patients has not been established, BRIVLERA injection is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures only in adult patients (18 years of age and older).i

Brivaracetam (marketed as BRIVIACT®) is also approved in the United States and the European Union.

37592,AstraZeneca's Tagrisso (osimertinib) Receives the US FDA's BT Designation for the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients with Stage IB-IIIA EGFR-Mutated Lung Cancer,Tagrisso granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the US for the adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage IB-IIIA EGFR-mutated lung cancer,"The BT designation is based on P-III ADAURA trial which involves assessing Tagrisso (80 mg) vs PBO in 682 patients with Stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated across 20 centers and 200+ countries including the US, EU, South America, Asia, and the Middle East
 The study resulted in improvement in DFS, reduction in risk of disease recurrence, or death by 79% in the adjuvant treatment of Stage IB-IIIA EGFRm NSCLC patients, also presented at ASCO 2020. Additionally, the trial will continue to assess OS
 Tagrisso (osimertinib) is third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI once-daily oral tablets approved 1st-line EGFRm advanced NSCLC and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC in the US, Japan, China, the EU","Designation based on unprecedented results from the Phase III ADAURA trial where Tagrisso reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by c. 80%
AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso (osimertinib) has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the US for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete tumour resection with curative intent.

The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) BTD is designed to accelerate the development and regulatory review of potential new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and address a significant unmet medical need. The new medicine needs to have shown encouraging early clinical results that demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.

While up to 30% of patients with NSCLC may be diagnosed early enough to have potentially curative surgery, disease recurrence is common in early-stage disease and nearly half of patients diagnosed in Stage IB, and over three quarters of patients diagnosed in Stage IIIA, experience recurrence within five years.1-6

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D said: “Patients with early-stage EGFRm lung cancer often experience recurrence even after successful surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, yet there are currently no approved targeted treatments to improve outcomes. The Phase III ADAURA trial with Tagrisso demonstrated an unprecedented level of clinical benefit in these patients, and we are working closely with the FDA to deliver this potentially curative treatment to patients as quickly as possible.”

The FDA granted the BTD based on data from the Phase III ADAURA trial, which were also recently presented during the plenary session of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program.

In the trial Tagrisso demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in the adjuvant treatment of Stage IB-IIIA EGFRm NSCLC patients, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 79% (HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.16-0.28; p<0.0001) in a key secondary endpoint. In April 2020, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended for the trial to be unblinded two years early based on its determination of overwhelming efficacy.

Tagrisso is approved for the 1st-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC and for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many other countries around the world.

Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.7 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.8 The majority of all NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease while approximately 25-30% present with resectable disease at diagnosis.1-3 A significant portion of patients with resectable NSCLC eventually develop recurrence despite complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia have EGFRm NSCLC.9-11 These patients are particularly sensitive to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which block the cell-signalling pathways that drive the growth of tumour cells.12

ADAURA

ADAURA is a randomised, double-blinded, global, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of 682 patients with Stage IB, II, IIIA EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumour resection and adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. In the experimental arm, patients were treated with Tagrisso 80mg once-daily oral tablets for three years or until disease recurrence. The trial enrolled in more than 200 centres across more than 20 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint DFS in Stage II and IIIA patients and a key secondary endpoint is DFS in Stage IB, II and IIIA patients. The data readout was originally anticipated in 2022. The trial will continue to assess OS.

Tagrisso

Tagrisso (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with clinical activity against CNS metastases. Tagrisso 40mg and 80mg once-daily oral tablets have received approval in the US, Japan, China, the EU and many countries around the world for 1st-line EGFRm advanced NSCLC and EGFR T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. Tagrisso is also being developed in the Stage III, unresectable setting (LAURA), in the neoadjuvant resectable setting (NeoADAURA), in combination with chemotherapy (FLAURA2) and in combination with potential new medicines to address resistance to EGFR-TKIs (SAVANNAH, ORCHARD).

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. AstraZeneca aims to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFRm tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and the EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso, and its ongoing Phase III trials LAURA, NeoADAURA, and FLAURA2.9-11

AstraZeneca is committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments. In addition, DS-1062, a trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed ADC, is in early development for advanced NSCLC where TROP2 is overexpressed in the majority of patients.13

An extensive late-stage Immuno-Oncology programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.14 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially curative settings (Phase III trials MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline including Enhertu.

37601,Eli Lilly Reports Results of Jardiance (empagliflozin) in P-III EMPEROR Trial for Heart Failure Patients with Reduced Ejection Fraction with and without Diabetes,Jardiance® meets primary endpoint in reducing risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in phase III trial in adults with and without diabetes,"The P-III EMPEROR Trial involves assessing of Jardiance (10 mg) vs PBO in two studies EMPEROR-Reduced [NCT03057977, N=3,730] & EMPEROR-Preserved [NCT03057951, N=5,990] in patients with HFrEF & HFpEF respectively
 The EMPEROR-Reduced study meets its 1EPs in reducing the risk for the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization due to heart failure while the overall safety profile was similar. Additionally, the full data of the stay will be presented at ESC 2020 on Aug 29, 2020, with expected regulatory submissions are planned in 2020
 Jardiance is a prescribed drug administered along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in and helps in reduction of CV death in adults with T2D","Jardiance (empagliflozin) significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure versus placebo in the EMPEROR-Reduced heart failure trial. The study evaluated adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 

– Treatment of heart failure is an important unmet need with over half of those diagnosed dying within five years

RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, July 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Positive top-line results from the EMPEROR-Reduced phase III trial in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, with and without diabetes, were announced today by Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY). EMPEROR-Reduced met its primary endpoint, demonstrating superiority with Jardiance® (empagliflozin) 10 mg compared to placebo in reducing the risk for the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization due to heart failure, when added to standard of care. Overall the safety profile was similar to the known safety profile of Jardiance.

“Heart failure is a common, but very serious chronic cardiovascular disorder, and it causes substantial disability while threatening the lives of millions of people worldwide,” said Milton Packer, M.D., Chair of the Executive Committee for the EMPEROR Program and Distinguished Scholar in Cardiovascular Science at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. “The results of the EMPEROR-Reduced trial indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to become a new standard of care for this disease, which will be a meaningful addition to currently established treatments.”

Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in the U.S., and the risk of death in people with heart failure rises with each hospital admission. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction occurs when the heart muscle does not contract effectively, and less blood is pumped out to the body compared to a normally functioning heart. Symptoms associated with heart failure, such as breathlessness and fatigue, can impact quality of life.

“With these positive top-line results from the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, we are excited to mark another important advancement for Jardiance,” said Mohamed Eid, M.D., M.P.H, M.H.A, vice president, Clinical Development & Medical Affairs, Cardio-Metabolism & Respiratory Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “There is an urgent need for new heart failure treatments, and these results show promise for the potential role Jardiance can play in improving the lives of adults living with this condition.”

Full results from the EMPEROR-Reduced trial will be presented in a hot line session at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2020 on August 29, and regulatory submissions are planned in 2020. A second trial, EMPEROR-Preserved, is exploring the effect of Jardiance on cardiovascular death or hospitalization in adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction – an area with no approved treatment options. EMPEROR-Preserved results are expected in 2021.

The EMPEROR trials are part of the EMPOWER clinical program, one of the broadest and most comprehensive of any SGLT2 inhibitor, exploring the impact of Jardiance on the lives of people across the spectrum of cardio-renal-metabolic conditions.

“These results build upon the already established cardiovascular benefits of Jardiance in adults living with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly. “Metabolic conditions that affect the heart and kidneys can lead to serious consequences, including hospitalizations and death. Through our EMPOWER clinical program, we are committed to advancing knowledge about these devastating clinical outcomes. We look forward to seeing how Jardiance can help adults around the world living with these conditions.”

About the EMPEROR Heart Failure Studies
The EMPEROR (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in patients with chrOnic heaRt failure) heart failure studies are two phase III, randomized, double-blind trials investigating once-daily Jardiance compared with placebo in adults with heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction*, both with and without diabetes, who are receiving current standard of care:

EMPEROR-Reduced [NCT03057977] investigated the safety and efficacy of Jardiance in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Primary endpoint: time to first event of adjudicated cardiovascular death or adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure
Number of patients: 3,730
Completion: 2020
EMPEROR-Preserved [NCT03057951] investigates the safety and efficacy of Jardiance in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
Primary endpoint: time to first event of adjudicated cardiovascular death or adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure [Time Frame: up to 38 months]
Anticipated number of patients: approx. 5,990
Estimated completion: 2021
*Ejection fraction is a measurement of the percentage of blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction. When the heart relaxes, the ventricle refills with blood.
HFrEF occurs when the heart muscle does not contract effectively, and less blood is pumped out to the body compared with a normally functioning heart.
HFpEF occurs when the heart muscle contracts normally but the ventricle does not fill with enough blood, so less blood can enter the heart compared with a normally functioning heart.

About the EMPOWER Program
The Alliance has developed the EMPOWER program to explore the impact of Jardiance on major clinical cardiovascular and renal outcomes in a spectrum of cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. Cardio-renal-metabolic conditions are the leading cause of mortality worldwide and account for up to 20 million deaths annually. Through the EMPOWER program, Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are working to advance knowledge of these interconnected systems and create care which offers integrated, multi-organ benefits. Comprised of nine clinical trials and a real-world evidence study, EMPOWER reinforces the long-term commitment of the Alliance to improve outcomes for people living with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. With more than 27,000 adults enrolled worldwide in clinical trials, it is one of the broadest and most comprehensive clinical programs for an SGLT2 inhibitor to date.

About Heart Failure
Heart failure is a progressive, debilitating and potentially fatal condition that occurs when the heart cannot supply adequate circulation to meet the body’s demands for oxygenated blood or to do so requires increased blood volume leading to fluid accumulation (congestion) in the lungs and peripheral tissues. It is a widespread condition affecting 60 million people worldwide and expected to increase as the population ages. Heart failure is highly prevalent in people with diabetes; however, approximately half of all people with heart failure do not have diabetes.

The Jardiance heart failure program was initiated based on data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, which assessed the effect of Jardiance (10 mg or 25 mg once daily) added to standard of care compared with placebo added to standard of care.

About Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Conditions
Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are driven to transform care for people with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, a group of interconnected disorders that affect more than one billion people worldwide and are a leading cause of death.

The cardiovascular, renal and metabolic systems are interconnected, and share many of the same risk factors and pathological pathways along the disease continuum. Dysfunction in one system may accelerate the onset of others, resulting in progression of interconnected diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and kidney disease, which in turn leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Conversely, improving the health of one system can lead to positive effects throughout the others.

Through our research and treatments, our goal is to support people’s health, restoring the harmony between the interconnected cardio-renal-metabolic systems and reducing their risk of serious complications. As part of our commitment to those whose health is jeopardized by cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, we will continue embracing a multidisciplinary approach towards care and focusing our resources on filling treatment gaps.

What is JARDIANCE? (www.jardiance.com)
JARDIANCE is a prescription medicine used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.

JARDIANCE is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease.

JARDIANCE is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Do not take JARDIANCE if you are allergic to empagliflozin or any of the ingredients in JARDIANCE.

Do not take JARDIANCE if you have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis.

JARDIANCE can cause serious side effects, including:

Dehydration. JARDIANCE can cause some people to have dehydration (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, light-headed, or weak, especially when you stand up.
You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you:

have low blood pressure
take medicines to lower your blood pressure, including water pills (diuretics)
are on a low salt diet
have kidney problems
are 65 years of age or older.
Vaginal yeast infection. Women who take JARDIANCE may get vaginal yeast infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), and/or vaginal itching.
Yeast infection of the penis. Men who take JARDIANCE may get a yeast infection of the skin around the penis, especially uncircumcised males and those with chronic infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience redness, itching or swelling of the penis, rash of the penis, foul smelling discharge from the penis, and/or pain in the skin around penis.
Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine). Ketoacidosis is a serious condition and may need to be treated in the hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. Ketoacidosis occurs in people with type 1 diabetes and can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes taking JARDIANCE, even if blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL. Ketoacidosis has also happened in people with diabetes who were sick or who had surgery during treatment with JARDIANCE. Stop taking JARDIANCE and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms, and if possible, check for ketones in your urine:
nausea
vomiting
stomach-area (abdominal) pain

– Sangamo will receive a $75M upfront licensing fee and is eligible to receive up to $720M in potential milestones, as well as royalties on potential net commercial sales

July 30, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
BRISBANE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGMO), a genomic medicine company, today announced that it has executed a global licensing collaboration agreement with Novartis to develop and commercialize gene regulation therapies to address three neurodevelopmental targets, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The collaboration will leverage Sangamo’s propriety genome regulation technology, zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs), to aim to upregulate the expression of key genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.

“The goal is to create new gene regulation therapies that act at the genomic level, moving us beyond the symptom focused treatments of today and toward therapies that can address some of the most challenging neurodevelopmental disorders.”

“At Sangamo, we believe that we can engineer zinc finger proteins to address virtually any genomic target, and we are building a broad pipeline of wholly owned and partnered programs with the goal to bring our genomic medicines to patients. In the case of the central nervous system, there are potentially hundreds of neurological disease gene targets that may be addressable by our zinc finger platform,” said Sandy Macrae, CEO of Sangamo. “Partnering Sangamo’s proprietary technology with Novartis’ deep experience in neuroscience drug development is a powerful combination which expands Sangamo’s pipeline and allows us to tackle challenging neurodevelopmental conditions. Our goal in this collaboration is to create genomic medicines for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, that can potentially alter the natural history of these complex lifelong disorders.”

“This collaboration with Sangamo is part of our commitment to pioneering the next generation of neurodevelopmental treatments,” said Jay Bradner, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. “The goal is to create new gene regulation therapies that act at the genomic level, moving us beyond the symptom focused treatments of today and toward therapies that can address some of the most challenging neurodevelopmental disorders.”

Sangamo’s ZFP-TF genome regulation technology, which is currently delivered with adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), functions at the DNA level to selectively repress or activate the expression of specific genes to achieve a desired therapeutic effect. The collaboration will leverage ZFP-TFs engineered by Sangamo scientists in an effort to upregulate, or activate, the expression of genes that are inadequately expressed in individuals with certain types of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Under the terms of the agreement, over a three-year collaboration period, Novartis has exclusive rights to ZFP-TFs targeted to three undisclosed genes which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD and intellectual disability. Novartis also has the option to license Sangamo’s proprietary AAVs. Sangamo is responsible for certain research and associated manufacturing activities, all of which will be funded by Novartis, and Novartis assumes responsibility for additional research activities, investigational new drug-enabling studies, clinical development, related regulatory interactions, manufacturing and global commercialization.

Under the collaboration agreement, Novartis will pay Sangamo a $75 million upfront license fee payment within thirty days. In addition, Sangamo is eligible to earn up to $720 million in other development and commercial milestone payments, including up to $420 million in development milestones and up to $300 million in commercial milestones. Sangamo is also eligible to receive from Novartis tiered high single-digit to sub-teen double-digit royalties on potential net commercial sales of products arising from the collaboration.

37676,Johnson & Johnson Initiates P-I/IIa Study of its Ad26.COV2.S Against COVID-19 in the US and Belgium,Single Dose of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Demonstrates Robust Protection in Pre-clinical Studies,"J&J’s Ad26 vector-based vaccine demonstrated robust immune response in the pre-clinical study by neutralizing Abs, preventing infection and provide complete/ near-complete protection in the lungs from the virus in NHPs
 Based on the preclinical studies, the company has commenced the P-I/IIa study of Ad26.COV2.S, in healthy volunteers in the US and Belgium with expected initiation of P-III study in Sept’2020. The P-I/IIa study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in ~1,000 healthy adults aged 18-55yrs. and 65+ yrs.
 Additionally, the company is planning to initiate P-III clinical trial program, will evaluate both one/two-dose regimens of Ad26.COV2.S initiate in parallel studies while the P-IIa study in the Netherlands, Spain, and Germany and a P-I study in Japan in underway","Study published in Nature shows J&J’s investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicits a strong immune response that protects against subsequent infection

 

First-in-human Phase 1/2a clinical trial now underway in United States and Belgium; Phase 3 clinical trial expected to commence in September
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., July 30, 2020 – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced that its lead vaccine candidate protected against infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in pre-clinical studies. The data, published in Nature, show the Company’s investigational adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccine elicited a robust immune response as demonstrated by “neutralizing antibodies,” successfully preventing subsequent infection and providing complete or near-complete protection in the lungs from the virus in non-human primates (NHPs) in the pre-clinical study. Based on the strength of the data, a Phase 1/2a first-in-human clinical trial of the vaccine candidate, Ad26.COV2.S, in healthy volunteers, has now commenced in the United States and Belgium.

“We are excited to see these pre-clinical data because they show our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate generated a strong antibody response and provided protection with a single dose. The findings give us confidence as we progress our vaccine development and upscale manufacturing in parallel, having initiated a Phase 1/2a trial in July with the intention to move into a Phase 3 trial in September,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson.

The robust Janssen COVID-19 clinical trial program, including the Phase 1/2a clinical trial and the Phase 3 clinical trial program, will evaluate both one- and two-dose regimens of Ad26.COV2.S in parallel studies. The Phase 1/2a trial will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity (expected reactions to vaccination, such as swelling or soreness), and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in over 1,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, as well as adults aged 65 years and older. Planning also is underway for a Phase 2a study in the Netherlands, Spain and Germany and a Phase 1 study in Japan. For more information about these studies, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.

As the Company plans its COVID-19 Phase 3 clinical development program, discussions are underway with partners with the objective to start a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of the single vaccine dose versus placebo in September, pending the interim data of the Phase 1 and 2 trials and approval of regulators. Simultaneously, the Company also is planning to start a parallel Phase 3 clinical trial of a two-dose regimen versus placebo.

The Company also will emphasize representation of populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic as it designs and implements its COVID-19 Phase 3 trial program. In the United States, this would include significant representation of Blacks, Hispanic/Latinx and participants over 65 years of age.

The pre-clinical studies were conducted by researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in collaboration with the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and others as part of its ongoing collaboration to accelerate the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Dan Barouch, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at BIDMC and the Ragon Institute, stated, “The pre-clinical data, generated in collaboration with the Johnson & Johnson team, highlights the potential of this SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. Moreover, the data suggest that antibody levels may serve as a biomarker for vaccine-mediated protection.”

In the studies, researchers first immunized the NHPs with a panel of vaccine prototypes, and then challenged them with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The scientists found that, of seven vaccine prototypes tested in the study, Ad26.COV2.S (referred to in the Nature article as Ad26-S.PP), elicited the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The level of antibodies correlated with the level of protection, confirming previous observations and suggesting they could be a potential biomarker for vaccine-mediated protection. The six NHPs that received a single immunization with Ad26.COV2.S showed no detectable virus in the lower respiratory tract after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and only one of six showed very low levels of the virus in a nasal swab at two time points.

“As we collectively battle this pandemic, we remain deeply committed to our goal of providing a safe and effective vaccine to the world. Our pre-clinical results give us reason to be optimistic as we initiate our first-in-human clinical trial, and we are excited to enter the next stage in our research and development toward a COVID-19 vaccine. We know that, if successful, this vaccine can be rapidly developed, produced on a large scale and delivered around the world,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Johnson & Johnson.

The Company’s fundamental responsibility is to provide patients, consumers and healthcare providers with products that are as safe and effective as possible. Johnson & Johnson takes an evidence- and science-based, ethics- and values-driven approach to medical safety, putting patient and consumer wellbeing first and foremost in its decision making and actions, with an emphasis on transparency.

As Johnson & Johnson progresses the clinical development of SARS-CoV-2, the Company continues to increase manufacturing capacity and is in active discussions with global strategic partners to support worldwide access. Johnson & Johnson aims to meet its goal to supply more than one billion doses globally through the course of 2021, provided the vaccine is safe and effective.

This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under Other Transaction Agreement HHSO100201700018C.

July 31, 2020 07:51 PM Eastern Daylight Time
PLANEGG, Germany & MUNICH & WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–MorphoSys AG (FSE:MOR; Prime Standard Segment; MDAX & TecDAX; NASDAQ:MOR) and Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Monjuvi® (tafasitamab-cxix) in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).1 Monjuvi, a humanized Fc-modified cytolytic CD19 targeting monoclonal antibody, has been approved under accelerated approval by the U.S. FDA based on overall response rate (ORR). Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). The FDA decision represents the first approval of a second-line treatment for adult patients who progressed during or after first-line therapy.

“This approval marks an important step in MorphoSys’ transformation into a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. We remain committed to developing innovative treatments to improve the lives of patients with serious diseases.”

DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults worldwide2, characterized by rapidly growing masses of malignant B-cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow or other organs. It is an aggressive disease with about one in three patients not responding to initial therapy or relapsing thereafter.3 In the United States each year approximately 10,000 patients are diagnosed with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT.4,5,6

“We are incredibly proud that the FDA has approved Monjuvi in combination with lenalidomide as the first treatment in second-line for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, and we thank all the health care professionals, patients and families involved in our Monjuvi trials,” said Jean-Paul Kress, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, MorphoSys. “This approval marks an important step in MorphoSys’ transformation into a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. We remain committed to developing innovative treatments to improve the lives of patients with serious diseases.”

“The FDA approval of Monjuvi in combination with lenalidomide helps address an urgent unmet medical need for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL in the United States,” said Hervé Hoppenot, Chief Executive Officer, Incyte. “At Incyte we are committed to advancing patient care and are proud to bring this new and much-needed targeted therapeutic option to appropriate patients and the clinical community.”

“The FDA approval of Monjuvi brings a new treatment option to patients in dire need across the United States,” said Professor Gilles Salles, M.D., Chair of the Clinical Hematology Department at the University of Lyon, France, and lead investigator of the L-MIND study. “Today’s FDA decision offers new hope for patients with this aggressive form of DLBCL who progressed during or after first-line therapy.”

The FDA approval was based on data from the MorphoSys-sponsored Phase 2 L-MIND study, an open label, multicenter, single arm trial of Monjuvi in combination with lenalidomide as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Results from the study showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% (primary endpoint), including a complete response (CR) rate of 37% and a partial response rate (PR) of 18%. The median duration of response (mDOR) was 21.7 months (key secondary endpoint).1 Warnings and Precautions for Monjuvi included infusion-related reactions (6%), serious or severe myelosuppression (including neutropenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (18%), and anemia (7%)), infections (73%) and embryo-fetal toxicity. Neutropenia led to treatment discontinuation in 3.7% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, cough, pyrexia, peripheral edema, respiratory tract infection, and decreased appetite.

The FDA previously granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the combination of Monjuvi and lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory DLBCL. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite development and review of drug candidates. It is granted if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease. The Biologics License Application (BLA) for Monjuvi was granted Priority Review and approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval program.

Monjuvi is expected to be commercially available in the United States shortly. MorphoSys and Incyte will co-commercialize Monjuvi in the United States. Incyte has exclusive commercialization rights outside the United States.

MorphoSys and Incyte are committed to supporting patients throughout their treatment journeys and are working together to help lower patient access barriers. As part of this commitment, the Companies have launched My Mission Support, a robust patient support program offering financial assistance, ongoing education and other resources to eligible patients who are prescribed Monjuvi in the United States. Program information will be available online at www.MyMissionSupport.com.

IMU-838 is an orally available DHOD inhibitor, acts on activated T and B cells and leave other immune cells largely unaffected, allowing the immune system to stay functioning","NEW YORK, Aug. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Immunic, Inc. (Nasdaq: IMUX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing best-in-class, oral therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, today announced positive top-line data from its phase 2 EMPhASIS trial of lead asset, IMU-838, the company’s selective oral DHODH inhibitor, in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The study achieved all primary and key secondary endpoints, indicating activity in RRMS patients. In particular, the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the cumulative number of combined unique active (CUA) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions up to week 24 in patients receiving 45mg of IMU-838 once daily, by 62% (p=0.0002), as compared to placebo. The study also met its key secondary endpoint, showing a statistically significant reduction in the cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions for the 30mg once daily dose, by 70% (p<0.0001), as compared to placebo.

All other secondary endpoints, including those based on other MRI parameters and on clinical endpoints such as relapse events, also provided a noticeable signal and numerical benefit for the IMU-838 treatment groups, as compared to placebo. Given the study’s design, sample size and the patient’s follow-up duration, full statistical analysis of these secondary endpoints was not deemed appropriate or included in the analysis plan. Nonetheless, we believe data on these endpoints provides useful information for the further development path towards potential approval.

Consistent with prior data sets in other patient populations, administration of IMU-838 in this trial was observed to be safe and well-tolerated, thereby providing evidence of an attractive target product profile for IMU-838 in the RRMS patient population. The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events was 42.9% of IMU-838-treated patients compared with 43.5% of patients on placebo. Likewise, serious treatment-emergent adverse events were rare and only observed in 3 out of 140 IMU-838-treated patients, and in 1 out of 69 patients on placebo. The rate of treatment withdrawals in the 24-week blinded treatment period was only 5.0% in the pooled IMU-838 treatment arms versus 7.2% in the placebo group. In addition, the rate of discontinuations due to adverse events or protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were equivalent between the pooled IMU-838 treatment arms and placebo. There was no increase in liver or renal events for the IMU-838 treatment arms versus placebo. Analysis of the full EMPhASIS data is ongoing and will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.

“Patients in the EMPhASIS trial exhibited robust responses across all study endpoints included in the top-line analysis. In addition to showing consistent activity by IMU-838 in RRMS using different measures, the study data also supports the previously observed favorable safety and tolerability profile of IMU-838 in RRMS patients,” commented Andreas Muehler, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Immunic. “We believe this data strongly supports our goal of developing IMU-838 as an easy, safe and convenient oral treatment option for patients with RRMS and other autoimmune diseases. We are extremely encouraged by these results and intend to now focus on the development plan with the goal of eventually making IMU-838 available as a best-in-class, once-daily oral therapy for RRMS.”

The phase 2 EMPhASIS trial was an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of IMU-838 in patients with RRMS. Of the 210 patients randomized in 36 centers across four European countries, 209 patients received at least one dose of IMU-838 or placebo (placebo n=69, 30mg IMU-838 n=71, 45mg IMU-838 n=69), and 197 patients completed the blinded 24-week treatment period. All enrolled patients were required to have shown disease activity based on clinical evidence of relapse and additional MRI criteria. The primary and key secondary endpoints were the cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions, up to week 24, for 45mg and 30mg of IMU-838, respectively. MRI was performed at baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 18 and 24, and was evaluated centrally by an independent, blinded MRI reader. The study includes an optional, extended treatment period for up to 9.5 years to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of IMU-838.

“These positive phase 2 results impressively show the robust activity of IMU-838 in RRMS and provide further evidence of the favorable safety profile already observed in other patient populations, representing more than 650 human subjects and patients, to date,” stated Daniel Vitt, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Immunic. “We believe that these phase 2 data of IMU-838 speak volumes about its potential to provide a new, convenient, once daily oral front-line treatment option to patients suffering from RRMS, bolstered by a unique combination of potential efficacy, safety and tolerability. Given the strength of these top-line results, we will continue to prepare a clinical phase 3 program for IMU-838 in RRMS and, after a full review of the data, anticipate providing a further update on development strategy. We are also looking forward to reading out clinical data from the other ongoing phase 2 trials of IMU-838 in COVID-19, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis in the upcoming months.”

Financial and Operating Results

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses were $10.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $6.0 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $4.0 million increase was primarily attributable to (i) a $2.2 million increase in external development costs for lead development program, IMU-838, related to the phase 2 clinical trials in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, (ii) a $1.0 million increase in drug supply costs related to IMU-838, (iii) a $1.0 million increase in preclinical, drug supply and phase 1 preparation costs related to IMU-856, (iv) a $1.0 million increase in costs due to drug supply and the start of the phase 1 trial in September 2019 for the IMU-935 program and (v) $0.3 million of increased employee costs. The increase was partially offset by a contingent payment under the asset purchase agreement with 4SC AG settled in stock valued at $1.5 million at the transaction with Vital Therapies in the second quarter of 2019.

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, R&D expenses were $16.4 million compared to $9.4 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $7.0 million increase was primarily attributable to (i) a $3.2 million increase in external development costs for lead development program, IMU-838, related to the phase 2 clinical trials in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, (ii) a $1.2 million increase in drug supply costs related to IMU-838, (iii) $2.2 million of an increase in license fees, preclinical, drug supply and phase 1 preparation costs related to IMU-856, (iv) $1.2 million in costs for drug supply and the start of the phase 1 trial in September 2019 for the IMU-935 program and (v) $0.7 million of increased employee and other costs. The increase was offset by a contingent payment under the asset purchase agreement with 4SC AG settled in stock valued at $1.5 million at the transaction with Vital Therapies in the second quarter of 2019.

General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $9.0 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $6.7 million improvement is primarily due to one-time costs related to the transaction with Vital Therapies including $6.4 million of stock-based compensation for the executives, key employees and members of the board of directors and $1.2 million in investment banking and legal fees in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was offset by a $0.9 million increase in personnel and other expenses.

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, G&A expenses were $4.8 million compared to $10.3 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $5.5 million improvement was primarily due to one-time costs related to the transaction with Vital Therapies including $6.4 million of stock-based compensation for the executives, key employees and members of the board of directors and $2.1 million in investment banking and legal fees in the first six months of 2019. The decrease was partially offset by (i) a $1.6 million increase in personnel expenses, (ii) $0.8 million of increased legal and consultancy costs and (iii) $0.6 million of increased costs across numerous categories primarily due to becoming a public company and expanding operations into the United States.

Other Income was $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $0.3 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $0.5 million increase was primarily attributable to (i) $0.2 million of research and development tax incentives for clinical trials in Australia as a result of increased spending on clinical trials in Australia and (ii) $0.3 million recognized deferred income attributable to reimbursements of research and development expenses in connection with the option and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo.

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, other income was $1.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $0.6 million increase was primarily attributable to (i) $0.3 million of research and development tax incentives for clinical trials in Australia as a result of increased spending on clinical trials in Australia and (ii) $0.3 million recognized deferred income attributable to reimbursements of research and development expenses in connection with the option and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo.

About Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. In MS, myelin, the coating that protects the nerves, is attacked and damaged by the immune system. Thus, MS is considered an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of the disease. Approximately 85% of patients with MS are expected to develop RRMS, with some of these patients later developing more progressive forms of the disease. RRMS is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These relapses are followed by periods of remission, or partial or complete recovery. During remissions, all symptoms may disappear, or some symptoms may continue and become permanent. MS is a progressive disease which, without effective treatment, leads to severe disability. MS affects more than 700,000 people in the United States, and more than 2.2 million people worldwide. The disease mainly affects young adults of prime working age, although MS can occur at any age. MS is at least two to three times more common in women than in men.

About IMU-838
IMU-838 is an orally available, next-generation selective immune modulator that inhibits the intracellular metabolism of activated immune cells by blocking the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). IMU-838 acts on activated T and B cells while leaving other immune cells largely unaffected and allows the immune system to stay functioning, e.g. in fighting infections. In previous trials, IMU-838 did not show an increased rate of infections compared to placebo. In addition, DHODH inhibitors, such as IMU-838, are known to possess a host-based antiviral effect, which is independent with respect to specific virus proteins and their structure. Therefore, DHODH inhibition may be broadly applicable against multiple viruses. IMU-838 was successfully tested in two phase 1 clinical trials in 2017 and is currently being tested in phase 2 trials in patients with COVID-19, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, Immunic’s collaboration partner, the Mayo Clinic, has started an investigator-sponsored proof-of-concept clinical trial testing IMU-838 activity in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. To date, IMU-838 has already been tested in about 650 individuals and has shown an attractive pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability profile. IMU-838 is not yet licensed or approved in any country and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use.

Combines two immunotherapies with complementary mechanisms of action with the aim to accelerate the path to market approval in melanoma if the trial is successful
Development costs for the clinical trial to be shared equally with each company retaining full commercial rights to their respective product candidates
MAINZ, Germany, July 31, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) today announced a strategic collaboration with Regeneron for a clinical trial combining BioNTech’s BNT111 FixVac product candidate and Libtayo® (cemiplimab), a fully human anti-PD-1 therapy, for the treatment of melanoma. The companies plan to jointly conduct a randomized Phase 2 study in patients with anti-PD1-refractory/relapsed, unresectable Stage III or IV cutaneous melanoma. Melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer and estimated to kill more than 63,000 people around the world this year.1

BNT111 is the most advanced of five clinical stage FixVac product candidates within BioNTech’s broader development pipeline. It is an mRNA cancer immunotherapy targeting four antigens frequently expressed in the tumors of patients with melanoma – NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, tyrosinase, and TPTE. BNT111 has demonstrated clinical anti-tumor activity as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in an ongoing Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced melanoma after prior checkpoint blockade.

“We believe our FixVac platform represents a powerful new drug class of mRNA immunotherapies against cancer. We look forward to working together with Regeneron to advance this product candidate into potentially registrational clinical trials,” said Ugur Sahin, CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

The two companies plan to pursue a clinical trial for the combination in the second-line treatment setting for advanced melanoma. The companies plan to disclose more details related to the planned Phase 2 study in the third quarter of 2020, with the goal of initiating the trial in the fourth quarter of 2020.

“Despite recent treatment advances with anti-PD-1 therapies for patients with melanoma, most patients fail to obtain a durable benefit. The combination of Libtayo and BNT111 FixVac has the potential to augment the immune system’s ability to effectively recognize melanoma in multiple ways and hopefully improve immune targeting to control the cancer,” said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational Science and Oncology, at Regeneron.

Under the terms of the agreement, development costs for the clinical trial will be shared equally and both companies will contribute their products for the trial. Each party will retain full commercial rights for its respective product and record revenues related to its own product.

Libtayo is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi.

37772,Roche's Rozlytrek Receives EC's Conditional Marketing Authorization for NTRK Fusion-Positive Solid Tumors and ROS1-Positive Advanced NSCLC,"Rozlytrek, Roche’s first tumour-agnostic therapy, approved in Europe for people with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours and for people with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer","The approval is based on integrated analysis including data from 74 people with LA/ m-NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors (14 tumor types) & 161 people with ROS1+ NSCLC of the pivotal P-II STARTRK-2, P-I STARTRK-1 and P-I ALKA-372-001 trials, and data from the P-I/II STARTRK-NG study in pediatric patients
 Result: in NTRK fusion+ solid tumors, ORR (63.5%); mDoR (12.9mos.); In ROS1+ advanced NSCLC, shrank tumors in 73.4% of patients; DoR of 16.5mos. (14.6-28.6mos.); ORR (67.1%); in patients with CNS metastases with an intracranial ORR (62.5% & 77.8%); In pediatric patients, Rozlytrek shrank tumors in all children and adolescents who had NTRK gene fusions with two achieving a CR
 Rozlytrek (entrectinib, qd) is a tumor-agnostic treatment for LA/m-solid tumors harboring NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions and has received EMA’s PRIME designation to treat NTRK fusion-positive, LA/m- solid tumors in adult and pediatric patients who have either progressed following prior therapies or who have no acceptable standard therapies","Rozlytrek has shown durable responses across multiple tumour types, including cancer that has spread to the brain
This approval shows the value of combining genomic profiling with precision medicine to offer patients with rare and hard-to-treat cancers a personalised treatment option
Basel, 03 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorisation for Rozlytrek® (entrectinib) for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older with solid tumours expressing a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor, who have no satisfactory treatment options. The European Commission has also approved Rozlytrek for the treatment of adults with ROS1-positive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors.1

“We are excited to announce the approval of Rozlytrek in Europe for two indications, bringing patients with NTRK and ROS1 gene fusions a new effective treatment even when their cancer has spread to the brain,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “This advance represents another important step forward in cancer care by allowing us to treat certain genetic drivers of cancer irrespective of the location of the tumour within the body. Roche is deeply committed to driving personalised healthcare and addressing the high unmet need in patients around the world with rare cancers.”

The approval is based on results from the integrated analysis of the pivotal phase II STARTRK-2, phase I STARTRK-1 and phase I ALKA-372-001 trials, and data from the phase I/II STARTRK-NG study. These studies demonstrate that Rozlytrek has durable responses across several NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours, including sarcoma, non-small cell lung, salivary MASC, secretory and non-secretory breast, thyroid, colorectal, neuroendocrine, pancreatic, ovarian, endometrial carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gastrointestinal cancers and neuroblastoma, as well as ROS1-positive NSCLC.1 Results showed:

Rozlytrek shrank tumours in more than half of people with NTRK fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours (overall response rate [ORR]=63.5%; N=74), and objective responses were observed across 14 tumour types (median duration of response [DoR]=12.9 months [9.3 months – not reached], N=21 out of 47 patients defined by ORR).1
In ROS1-positive, advanced NSCLC, Rozlytrek shrank tumours in 73.4% of people with the disease (ORR; N=94 with a minimum of 12 months follow up), with a median DoR of 16.5 months (14.6 – 28.6 months). In a group of 161 patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up, including 29% of patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline, ORR was observed to be 67.1%.1
Objective responses to Rozlytrek were seen in people with CNS metastases at baseline, with an intracranial ORR of 62.5% and 77.8% in both NTRK and ROS1 populations, respectively.1
In paediatric patients, Rozlytrek shrank tumours (ORR) in all children and adolescents who had NTRK gene fusions (N=5), with two achieving a complete response (CR). Two patients with primary high-grade tumours in the CNS had objective responses, including one patient with a CR.1 Rozlytrek was well tolerated.
The most common adverse reactions (≥20 percent) with Rozlytrek were fatigue, constipation, altered sense of taste (dysgeusia), swelling (oedema), dizziness, diarrhoea, nausea, nervous system disorders (dysaesthesia), shortness of breath (dyspnoea), anaemia, increased weight, increased blood creatinine, pain, cognitive disorders, vomiting, cough, and fever (pyrexia).1
Rozlytrek has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation by the EMA for the treatment of NTRK fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours in adult and paediatric patients who have either progressed following prior therapies or who have no acceptable standard therapies.1 NTRK gene fusions have been identified in a range of solid tumour types, and are present in up to 90% of some rare cancer types and less than 1% of other more common tumours, including lung and colorectal.2 ROS1 gene fusions account for 1-2% of NSCLC, the most common type of lung cancer that accounts for up to 85% of all diagnoses.3,4

Biomarker testing for these fusions is the most effective way to identify people who are most eligible for treatment with Rozlytrek. Roche is leveraging its expertise in developing personalised medicines and advanced diagnostics, in conjunction with Foundation Medicine, to develop a companion diagnostic that will help identify people with NTRK and ROS1 gene fusions.

About the integrated analysis
The approval in Europe is based on an integrated analysis including data from 74 people with locally advanced or metastatic NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours (14 tumour types) and 161 people with ROS1-positive NSCLC from the phase II STARTRK-2, phase I STARTRK-1 and phase I ALKA-372-001 trials.1 It is also based on data from the phase I/II STARTRK-NG study in paediatric patients. The studies enrolled people across 15 countries and more than 150 clinical trial sites. Safety was assessed from an integrated analysis of 504 people across these four trials.1

About NTRK fusion-positive cancer
NTRK fusion-positive cancer occurs when the NTRK1/2/3 genes fuse with other genes, resulting in altered TRK proteins (TRKA/TRKB/TRKC) that can activate signalling pathways involved in the proliferation of certain types of cancer.5 NTRK gene fusions are present in tumours irrespective of site of origin. These fusions have been identified in a broad range of solid tumour types, including sarcoma, non-small cell lung, salivary MASC, secretory and non-secretory breast, thyroid, colorectal, neuroendocrine, pancreatic, ovarian, endometrial carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gastrointestinal cancers and neuroblastoma.1

About ROS1-positive NSCLC
ROS1 is a tyrosine kinase, which plays a role in controlling how cells grow and proliferate. When a ROS1 gene fusion occurs, cancer cells grow and proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. Blocking this abnormal signalling can cause tumour cells to shrink or die.3
ROS1 gene fusions account for 1-2% of NSCLC.3 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death across the world.6 Each year, more than one and a half million people die as a result of the disease globally, equating to more than 4,000 deaths every day.6 NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer and accounts for up to 85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.4 While the ROS1 gene fusion can be found in any patient with NSCLC, young never-smokers with NSCLC have the highest incidence of ROS1 gene fusions.3

About Rozlytrek
Rozlytrek® (entrectinib) is a tumour-agnostic once-daily oral medicine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours that harbour NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions. It is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit the kinase activity of the TRKA/B/C and ROS1 proteins, whose activating fusions drive proliferation in certain types of cancer.7,8 Rozlytrek can block NTRK and ROS1 kinase activity and may result in the death of cancer cells with NTRK or ROS1 gene fusions.7,8

Rozlytrek was granted accelerated approval in August 2019 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), following receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation, for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older with solid tumours that have a NTRK gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation, are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and have progressed following treatment or have no satisfactory alternative therapy, and was approved for the treatment of adults with ROS1-positive, metastatic NSCLC. In June 2019, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) also approved Rozlytrek for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with NTRK fusion-positive, advanced recurrent solid tumours, and later approved Rozlytrek in ROS1-positive NSCLC in February 2020. Rozlytrek has also received approvals by health authorities in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan.

Movantik® is the first oral PAMORA approved in the U.S. for the treatment of OIC and is recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines2 and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Movantik® is part of the exclusive worldwide license agreement announced in 2009 between AstraZeneca and Nektar Therapeutics. It was developed using Nektar’s oral small-molecule polymer conjugate technology. Movantik® was first approved in 2014 and launched in the U.S. by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo in 2015. Further information about Movantik® is available at: www.Movantik.com.

About Opioid-Induced Constipation (OIC)
OIC is a condition caused by prescription opioid pain medicines. Opioids play an important role in chronic pain relief and work by binding to mu-receptors in the central nervous system, but they can also bind to mu-receptors in the bowel, which can result in patients suffering from OIC. OIC is the most prevalent and disabling adverse effect associated with opioid therapy, estimated to affect between 40-80% of the millions of patients taking chronic opioid therapy each year4.

37810,Novartis Reports Results of Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) in P-II ELARA Study for Follicular Lymphoma,Novartis announces Kymriah meets primary endpoint at interim analysis of pivotal study in follicular lymphoma,"The P-II ELARA study involves assessing the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in adult patients with r/r FL across 12 countries in 30 sites globally
 At the interim analysis, the study met its 1EPs of CRR, as assessed by IRC. The company will include the results in regulatory submissions, with anticipated filing to the US FDA in 2021, and then in EU, while the results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting
 Kymriah has received FDA’s RMAT designation in r/r FL based on preliminary ELARA trial findings, reflecting the unmet need for additional treatment options for FL. The Therapy was developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania","Global ELARA trial demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL) as measured by complete response rate
Kymriah previously received FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation in r/r FL based on preliminary ELARA trial findings, reflecting the unmet need for additional treatment options for this cancer type
ELARA trial findings will be included in regulatory submissions, with filing in the US anticipated in 2021, and the EU following. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting
Interim analysis comes alongside milestones of 3,000th batch of CAR-T cells manufactured for patients worldwide and approval for commercial manufacturing at two additional sites in Europe
Basel, August 4, 2020 — Novartis today announced positive results from the Phase II ELARA trial of Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL). At the interim analysis, the global study met its primary endpoint of complete response rate (CRR), as assessed by independent review committee. CRR is a standard measure of patient response to therapy in FL. No new Kymriah safety signals were observed. Results from the ELARA trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and included in US and EU regulatory submissions.

Kymriah was the first-ever FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, and the first-ever CAR-T to be approved in two distinct indications. It is a one-time treatment designed to empower patients’ immune systems to fight their cancer. Kymriah is currently approved for the treatment of r/r pediatric and young adult (up to 25 years of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)1.

“We are pleased that Kymriah is showing meaningful results and may provide a potentially definitive treatment option for patients with relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “These results further support our efforts to reimagine medicine in this incurable malignancy and reach this underserved patient population, who are historically burdened with several years of various treatments.”

Kymriah was developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a strategic alliance between industry and academia, which was first-of-its-kind in CAR-T research and development.

Kymriah is currently approved for use in at least one indication in more than 25 countries and at more than 250 certified treatment centers, with the ambition for further expansion to help fulfill the ultimate goal of bringing CAR-T cell therapy to every patient in need. As Novartis prepares for the launch of a potential third indication for Kymriah, manufacturing capacity continues to ramp up. The Novartis global CAR-T manufacturing footprint spans seven facilities total, across four continents. This comprehensive, integrated footprint strengthens the flexibility, resilience and sustainability of the manufacturing and supply chain. With recent approvals from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), commercial manufacturing of Kymriah is now ongoing at the Novartis-owned facilities in Stein, Switzerland and Les Ulis, France, joining the Novartis-owned facility in Morris Plains, New Jersey, USA.

About Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma, the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is an indolent lymphoma, and represents approximately 22% of NHL cases2,3. Despite new treatments that improve overall survival, FL is regarded as an incurable malignancy with a relapsing and remitting pattern4,5. Throughout the lifetime of a patient with relapsing FL, they may be exposed to a median of five lines of prior treatment, with an upper range of 12 lines6,7. Although patients in third or later line treatment for FL have multiple systemic therapies available, the efficacy of these regimens drops off rapidly in later lines5. Additionally, because of this relapsing and remitting pattern, patients who are refractory to treatment or quickly relapse may exhaust available treatment options5.

About the ELARA trial
ELARA is a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in adult patients with r/r FL. This international trial has enrolled patients from over 30 sites in 12 countries worldwide.

In Q2 2020, the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to Kymriah in r/r FL, based on preliminary results from the ELARA trial. RMAT designation is intended to expedite the development and review of Kymriah as a regenerative therapy for this underserved patient population.

About Novartis Commitment to Oncology Cell & Gene
Novartis has a mission to reimagine medicine by bringing curative cell & gene therapies to patients worldwide. Novartis has a deep CAR-T pipeline and ongoing investment in manufacturing and supply chain process improvements. With active research underway to broaden the impact of cell therapy in oncology, Novartis is going deeper in hematological malignancies, reaching patients with other cancer types and evaluating next-generation CAR-T cell therapies that focus on new targets and utilize new technologies.

Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to significantly invest in pioneering CAR-T research and initiate global CAR-T trials. Kymriah, the first approved CAR-T cell therapy, developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is the foundation of Novartis’ commitment to CAR-T cell therapy.

Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety information
Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications.

Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities.

Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.

Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.

Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient’s healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding.

Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah, and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine.

After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer.

Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures.

Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.

Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy.

Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.

37867,AstraZeneca Signs a License Agreement with Redx Pharma for RXC006 to Treat Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Redx signs out licensing agreement with AstraZeneca,"Redx to receive $17M in early payment by the time of successful commencement of a P-I study, $360M as development, a regulatory and commercial milestone along with royalties on sales of the RXC006
 AstraZeneca to get an exclusive global license to further develop & commercialize RXC006 targeting fibrotic diseases including IPF
 Redx continues to progress its lead oncology asset, RXC004 (porcupine inhibitor) targeting Wnt-driven tumors, currently being evaluated in P-I/II clinical trial, and RXC007, the oral Rock 2 inhibitor targeting fibrosis where first in human studies are expected in 2021","Alderley Park, 4 August 2020 Redx Pharma plc (AIM: REDX) announces it has signed a significant out licensing agreement for its porcupine inhibitor, RXC006, with AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will take RXC006 forward into clinical development, targeting fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Porcupine inhibition is a novel anti-fibrotic approach that suppresses Wnt ligand secretion from pro-fibrotic cells. Wnt ligands are known to be strong drivers of fibrotic mechanisms and are highly expressed in diseases such as IPF. Wnt ligands regulate multiple aspects of disease biology so porcupine inhibition presents a potentially powerful anti-fibrotic approach. IPF is a life-threatening and progressive lung disease with a high mortality rate and a prognosis worse than many cancers.

Under the terms of the exclusive global agreement, AstraZeneca will pay Redx several early milestones that amount to $17 million, by the time of successful commencement of a phase 1 study. In addition, Redx is eligible to receive up to a further $360 million from AstraZeneca in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments throughout the course of the programme should it successfully reach these milestones. Redx is also eligible for tiered royalties of mid-single digit percentages, based on any future net sales.

Redx continues to execute on its strategy, progressing its lead oncology and fibrosis programmes. These include the oral porcupine inhibitor, RXC004, targeting Wnt-driven tumours, which is in an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial in oncology patients, and the oral ROCK2 inhibitor, RXC007, which targets fibrosis, where first in human studies are expected in 2021.

Lisa Anson, Chief Executive Officer of Redx Pharma, commented: “We are excited by the potential of porcupine inhibition as a novel approach to tackling fibrotic-associated diseases where there is a real patient need. This agreement, where AstraZeneca will license this first in class porcupine inhibitor for IPF and progress it into development, highlights, once again, Redx’s ability to generate molecules that have significant potential as novel medicines.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca said: “Fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have significant impact on patients’ lives and new therapies are urgently needed. We look forward to progressing this porcupine inhibitor into clinical trials as a novel approach to supress Wnt signalling and potentially modify fibrotic disease processes.”

CHE is defined as hand eczema (HE) that lasts for more than three months or relapsing twice or more within a year.5,6 HE is the most common skin disorder of the hands7 that affects an estimated 1 – 5% of the general population8 with a one-year prevalence rate of approximately 10%.9 It is an inflammatory, non-infectious skin disorder of the hands and wrists5,10 and can cause itching, blisters, swelling and pain so severe that it can impair the ability to work.5,7,11 In a substantial number of patients, HE can develop into a chronic condition.7 There is an unmet need for well-tolerated, effective and safe treatments for long-term control of CHE.8,12,13,14

“Moderate-to-severe CHE can be a disabling skin disease that can disrupt the ability for people to work and be self-sufficient because their hands can feel so raw and painful,” said Kim Kjøller, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, LEO Pharma. “We are delighted that topical delgocitinib cream has been granted Fast Track designation and look forward to collaborating with the FDA during the development process as we aim to accelerate bringing this potential new treatment option to patients.”

Delgocitinib inhibits activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which plays a key role in the immune system in driving the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory skin diseases.15,16 The cream formulation of delgocitinib is not currently approved by any regulatory authorities.

About Fast Track

The FDA Fast Track process facilitates the development and expedites regulatory review of drugs to treat serious conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need.1 According to the FDA, filling an unmet medical need is defined as ‘providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy’.1

The frequency of communication during the FDA Fast Track process allows for questions to be addressed quickly, often leading to earlier drug approval and access by patients.1

37898,Roche's cobas Epstein-Barr Virus Test Receives the US FDA's Authorization for Transplant Patients,Roche announces FDA authorisation for the first Epstein-Barr virus quantitative test on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems to improve care for transplant patients,"The US FDA has granted de novo class II for cobas EBV test, providing HCPs a tool for monitoring transplant patients at risk for complications from infections or reactivations of EBV
 The cobas EBV test is a PCR viral load test that runs on the fully automated and widely available cobas 6800/8800 systems and has been calibrated to WHO’s international standard
 The test has received the FDA’s BDD and has robust coverage with a limit of detection of 18.8 IU/mL and an expanded linear range from 35 IU/mL-1E+08 IU/mL in EDTA plasma","FDA granted de novo class II for cobas EBV test following the agency’s Breakthrough Device designation
Accurate monitoring of Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels is critical, as they are associated with a range of life threatening-diseases including cancer in transplant patients
Test meets World Health Organization standards for consistent result reporting among laboratories across the U.S., allowing for results to be easily comparable across hospitals and labs
 

Basel, 5 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised the cobas® EBV test. This is the first quantitative in vitro diagnostic test for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the United States. This authorisation gives healthcare professionals a key tool in monitoring transplant patients at risk for complications from infections or reactivations of EBV, by providing the ability to run a large number of patient tests for this virus in a short period of time.

“Monitoring of Epstein-Barr virus DNA can help prevent progression of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer in transplant patients,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “The EBV test helps set a new standard of care for patients, as healthcare professionals now can act early in the management of this virus with best-in-class monitoring tools and can make more informed decisions when treating patients.”

The cobas EBV test is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral load test that runs on the fully automated and widely available cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems. The test has been calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard. This means that test results are reported in international measures, making it possible for laboratories anywhere in the U.S. to obtain comparable results when measuring levels of EBV DNA.

The test was previously granted FDA Breakthrough Device designation, which enables an expedited review process for medical devices that provide improved treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening diseases or conditions.

About the cobas EBV test
The cobas EBV test is a real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) viral load test with dual target technology, which provides quantitative accuracy and guards against the risk of sequence variations that may be present in the Epstein-Barr virus. The cobas EBV test has robust coverage with a limit of detection of 18.8 IU/mL and an expanded linear range from 35 IU/mL to 1E+08 IU/mL in EDTA plasma.

The test offers an alternative to lab-developed tests (LDTs) or Assay Specific Reagents (ASR) combinations, potentially minimising variability and complexity in testing, reducing workload and alleviating risk for laboratories. The test supports the goal of result standardisation across institutions by providing reproducible, high-quality results for clinical decision-making.

The fully automated cobas EBV test can be run on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems providing absolute automation with proven performance and flexibility. Simultaneous testing with CMV or other virology tests leads to time savings and increased efficiency.

About Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
Epstein-Barr virus is a member of the herpes virus family and has been associated with a range of cancers in transplant patients, such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Once infection with EBV occurs, the virus establishes as a latent form and can remain in the body. Most people harbor EBV with no long-term clinical ramifications.

EBV spreads most commonly through bodily fluids, primarily saliva. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems, including transplant patients, are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates.1

About the cobas 6800/8800 Systems
When every moment matters, the fully automated cobas 6800/8800 Systems offer the fastest time to results with the highest throughput and the longest walk-away time available among automated molecular platforms. The systems provide up to 96 results in about 3 hours and 384 results for the cobas 6800 System and 1,056 results for the cobas 8800 System in an 8-hour shift.*

Both systems make it possible for labs to perform up to three tests in the same run with no pre-sorting required. The systems also enable up to eight hours (cobas 6800 System) and four hours (cobas 8800 System) of walk-away time with minimal user interaction.*

These real-time PCR systems serve the areas of infectious disease, donor screening, sexual health, transplant, respiratory and antimicrobial stewardship.

Through an ever-increasing worldwide install base of cobas 6800/8800 Systems, labs are quickly and easily processing millions of tests per month to meet the changing demands of their communities, their customers and the patients relying on the results of each assay. Globally, labs know and trust that a Roche assay guarantees high precision, accuracy and traceability to World Health Organization standards.

Total of 144 participants to be enrolled in two age groups (18-55 and >55 years)
Trial participants to receive either 10µg or 30µg of BNT162 or a placebo
Clinical supply from BioNTech’s GMP-certified mRNA production facilities in Europe
MAINZ, Germany, and SHANGHAI, China, Aug. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd (“Fosun Pharma” or “Group”; Stock Symbol: 600196.SH, 02196.HK), today announced that the first 72 participants have already been dosed with BNT162b1 following IND approval by the Chinese regulatory authority, National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). BioNTech and Fosun Pharma are jointly developing the COVID-19 vaccine candidate in China. The trial is part of BioNTech’s global development program aimed at supporting a global supply upon regulatory approval.

The randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded Phase 1 clinical trial in China will enroll 144 healthy subjects to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine as well as to confirm dose selection. The first group of subjects immunized in Stage 1 of the study will be healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, followed by elderly healthy participants (>55 years). As part of the two-dose cohort design, subjects will receive two injections (prime-boost), 21 days apart, of 10µg or 30µg of the vaccine candidate or placebo. The dose range selection was determined based on early data from clinical trials conducted in Germany and the United States. The participants will be dosed in Taizhou Clinical Phase1 Center, Jiangsu province.

The study is designed to support the regulatory approval process for the Chinese market and intends to confirm that the safety and immunogenicity profile observed in participants from the German and US trials is comparable to that of Chinese participants. The ongoing clinical studies conducted in Germany and the United States will continue to support studies in China.

“We are proud to be among the first international biopharmaceutical companies to initiate a clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate in China as part of our effort to make our vaccine available globally, if approved. This is an important step toward our goal to reach marketing authorization and ensure vaccine supply in China to help prevent new COVID-19 outbreaks in the most populous country in the world,” said CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin.

Ai-Min Hui, President of Global R&D, and Chief Medical Officer of Fosun Pharma said: “Dosing the first Chinese subject with BNT162b1 marks a milestone of the global co-development program in China. We are closely working with BioNTech and regulatory authorities to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BNT162b1 and other mRNA vaccine candidates, in order to synchronize the development process in China with other countries, and to bring the vaccine to public as soon as possible, if the vaccine succeeds.”

Following on from the ongoing Phase 1/2 studies in Germany and the United States, the Chinese study will initially evaluate nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) candidate BNT162b1, one of two vaccine candidates based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology to have received FDA Fast Track designation in the United States. Meanwhile, BNT162b2, the other vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 2b/3 trial conducted by BioNTech and Pfizer which commenced on July 27th. The companies also intend to explore the possibility of initiating clinical development of other vaccine candidates based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology in China.

During the clinical development stage, BioNTech will provide the clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe. If the vaccine receives marketing authorization in China, Fosun Pharma will exclusively commercialize the vaccine in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau Special Administration Regions and in Taiwan.

INCHEON, South Korea–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Celltrion Healthcare today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorisation for Remsima® (infliximab, CT-P13) subcutaneous (SC) formulation for the treatment of adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.1

The approval follows a positive opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in June and is based on data from a pivotal study comparing the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of the SC and intravenous (IV) formulations of Remsima® in people with active Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, throughout a 1-year treatment period.2,3 Based on the results of the pivotal study, a 120 mg fixed dose of Remsima® SC has been approved for use in the European Union (EU), in adults regardless of body weight, in both existing and newly added indications.

Professor Stefan Schreiber, Director of the Clinic for Internal Medicine at Kiel Campus of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein in Germany said: “The subcutaneous formulation of Remsima® (Remsima® SC) has been shown to have very high efficacy, and favourable data, which are fully comparable to the efficacy and safety profile of the IV formulation. Today’s approval marks an important progress for the gastroenterology community as it means that treatment can now be administered in significantly less time, thereby providing patients more flexibility and control over how they receive their treatment.”

“We are pleased to announce this important regulatory milestone earlier than we expected, with the European Commission prioritising review of this important new administration option. We will accelerate the launch process on a country-by-country basis in order to expand treatment options for patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis,” said Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare. “We will do our best to make Remsima® SC available as early as possible and hope this medication will contribute to minimising the risks involved with administering medical treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Celltrion anticipates receiving approval of Remsima® SC in 97 countries, including 31 countries in Europe.

The company plans to randomize 240 patients from EU countries","Valby, Denmark, 5 August 2020 – H. Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) announces the decision to discontinue the phase II proof of concept clinical study of Lu AF11167 in patients with schizophrenia, who are experiencing persistent negative symptoms (NCT03793712). The decision to stop the trial is based on the results of a futility interim analysis, which concluded that the trial is unlikely to achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint, mean change from baseline to week 12 on the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). The recommendation to stop the trial is not based on safety concerns.

Lundbeck is incredibly grateful to all the patients with schizophrenia, their families and the investigators who participated in the trials and contributed greatly to this research.

Dr. Johan Luthman, Executive Vice President, R&D at Lundbeck said:

“Negative symptoms are a symptomatology of schizophrenia, for which there is no approved medical treatment today. It is disappointing that Lu AF11167 did not show the efficacy needed to treat this area which impacts many patients and represents a huge unmet medical need. We are very grateful for the patients and the clinical study sites that participated in this proof of concept study. The outcome from this interim analysis helps us to prioritize Lundbeck´s resources towards opportunities that have the highest promise for our patients. We will now close the study in a responsible manner and ensure that valuable knowledge gathered is made accessible to researchers globally.”

The study results are planned to be submitted for scientific publication at a later date.

About the study

The primary objective of the phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy on negative symptoms of two doses of Lu AF11167 versus placebo as monotherapy in patients with schizophrenia and persistent prominent negative symptoms. The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Lu AF11167 on patients’ functioning as well as the safety and tolerability of the compound. This 3-arm study was planned to randomize a total of 240 patients (80 patients per arm) from various European countries.

 

About Lu AF11167

Lu AF11167 is a small molecule and a potent and selective inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase 10A enzyme (PDE10Ai). PDE10Ai modulates dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-mediated intraneuronal signaling without binding to these receptors. PDE10Ai is believed to reduce negative symptoms and to keep positive symptoms stabilized.

 

About schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is caused by an imbalance in the neurotransmitters facilitating the communication between neurons in the brain, leading to the perception (seeing/hearing/thinking) of things that are not real. The factors that create this imbalance are not fully understood. Schizophrenia is a common form of severe mental illness that carries a notable ‘stigma’ and is often misunderstood. People with schizophrenia experience disturbed thoughts, emotions and behavior, and they find it difficult to judge reality[i]. This can have a major impact on the life of the individual and his/her family. Negative symptoms, a diminution or absence of normal behaviors related to motivation and interest or expression, are a core component of schizophrenia and they account for a large part of the long-term morbidity and poor functional outcome in patients with the disorder.

The World Health Organization estimates that over 21 million people suffer from schizophrenia, making it one of the top 20 causes of disability worldwide[ii]. Schizophrenia affects people regardless of race, culture or social class. It typically starts in early adulthood (from age 20)[iii], but it can develop at any age. Schizophrenia affects both men and women, although men tend to develop the condition slightly earlier in life[iv]. The risk of an individual developing schizophrenia during his or her lifetime is approximately 1 percent.

37991,UCB's Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) Receives the EMA's Approval for a Reduced Maintenance Dose in Patients with Axial Spondyloarthritis Spectrum,CIMZIA is the First and Only Biologic Approved in Europe with the Option for a Reduced Maintenance Dose for Patients Across the Full Axial Spondyloarthritis Spectrum,"The P-IIIb C-OPTIMISE study assessing Cimzia (200mg, q2w with a loading dose of 400mg @ 0, 2 & 4wks.) vs PBO during 48wks. open-label induction period in adults with early active axSpA. At 48wks., patients in sustained remission (ASDAS <1.3 @wks. 32/36 & 48) were randomized to Cimzia 200mg, q2w (full maintenance dose) & 200mg q4w (reduced maintenance dose) or PBO (withdrawal) for an additional 48wks.
 The EMA label extension is based on the results of the C-OPTIMISE study that demonstrated @48wks. 43.9% of patients achieved sustained remission, @96wks. 84%, 79% & 20% of patients receiving the full maintenance dose, reduced maintenance dose or PBO respectively remained flare-free
 The approval makes Cimzia the only biologic in EU with a dose reduction option in its label for patients in the broad axSpA population","· European label extended to include a dose reduction option for the treatment of adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including non-radiographic and radiographic axSpA, who are in sustained remission after one year of CIMZIA[®] (certolizumab pegol) treatment,[1] underpinned by results of the Phase 3b C-OPTIMISE study
· C-OPTIMISE showed that, once axSpA patients are in sustained remission, it is possible to benefit from a reduced CIMZIA dosing regimen without compromising clinical efficacy[2]

Brussels, Belgium – 5 August 2020 – UCB today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved a label extension for CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol) for use in adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) at a reduced maintenance dose of 200 mg every four weeks (Q4W), once sustained remission is achieved after one year of CIMZIA 200 mg every two weeks (Q2W) or 400 mg Q4W.1 The approval makes CIMZIA the only biologic in Europe with a dose reduction option in its label for patients in the broad axSpA population.1 

Clinical remission is recommended as a major treatment target in the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for axSpA and treat-to-target recommendations for spondyloarthritis.3,4 Additionally, strategies for the maintenance of remission are necessary to prevent future deterioration in disease status.5

Maintenance dose reduction supports the long-term management of patients with axSpA, when sustained disease remission has been achieved.2 This approach offers an additional option that preserves the clinical benefits to patients of remaining on treatment, while responding to specific patient needs, and can optimise the cost of their therapy.2 The extension of CIMZIA’s label in Europe1 addresses an under-recognised unmet need6,7 by providing the first validated dose reduction strategy for patients across the broad axSpA spectrum who have achieved sustained remission.

“AxSpA patients typically experience symptom onset in their mid-twenties and may therefore be concerned about lifelong continuation of therapy. The CIMZIA label extension now offers healthcare providers a validated dose reduction strategy that can meet the needs of patients. Furthermore, the option to reduce the maintenance dose may provide cost reductions, benefiting the wider healthcare system,” said Robert Landewé, MD, PhD, Amsterdam Rheumatology & Clinical Immunology Center, and lead author of the C-OPTIMISE study.

“C-OPTIMISE is the first and only randomised controlled trial to compare both maintenance dose continuation and dose reduction versus placebo in a broad axSpA population. Taken with previous clinical evidence showing that early treatment of axSpA with CIMZIA provides improved clinical outcomes, axSpA patients have a treatment option that can help address their symptoms at every stage of their disease: from initiation of biologic therapy, to remission and maintenance. Our clinical study package in axSpA showed that r-axSpA and nr-axSpA are part of the same disease entity. If treated early, remission is a realistic target and patients can have the flexibility to reduce their dose once they have achieved sustained remission,” said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President Immunology Solutions and Head of US, UCB.

The EMA label extension is based on data from the Phase 3b C-OPTIMISE trial in adults with early active axSpA.2 At week 48 of the induction period, 43.9 percent (323/736) of patients achieved sustained remission (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) <1.3 at weeks 32 or 36 and 48). Of those patients, 313 were randomised to full maintenance dose (CIMZIA 200 mg Q2W), reduced maintenance dose (CIMZIA 200 mg Q4W), or placebo.2 At week 96, 84 percent, 79 percent and 20 percent of patients receiving the full maintenance dose, reduced maintenance dose, or placebo, respectively, remained flare-free.2 Of patients who flared in the reduced maintenance dose arm, 60 percent regained remission after 12 weeks of treatment with the full maintenance dose of CIMZIA.2 

There were no differences in responses between radiographic axSpA (r-axSpA) and non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) patients in both the induction and maintenance periods.2 No new safety signals with CIMZIA were observed over the course of the study compared to previous studies.1,2 In patients who achieve sustained remission, dose reduction is an option, but treatment should not be withdrawn, because of the high risk of flare.2

About Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA)
Non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) and radiographic axSpA (r-axSpA, also known as ankylosing spondylitis or AS) comprise the axial spondyloarthritis, or axSpA, spectrum of disease, which typically starts in patients in their mid-twenties. Nr-axSpA and r-axSpA share similar symptomology and disease burden. In r-axSpA, there is a definitive structural damage in the sacroiliac joints detectable by x-ray. In nr-axSpA, there is no definitive radiographic sacroiliitis, though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing often shows evidence of active sacroiliitis, visible as inflammation in the sacroiliac joints. Historically, nr-axSpA has not been well-recognised due to a lack of understanding of the disease history, progression, and prognosis, resulting in substantial diagnostic delay. As a result, nr-axSpA is often misdiagnosed and undertreated.

Axial spondyloarthritis is estimated to affect up to 1.4 percent of adults.8,9 Roughly two thirds of nr-axSpA patients are women.10 Yet, axSpA is often overlooked in women, with 89 percent being initially misdiagnosed, leading to a significantly longer time to diagnosis in women compared to men, on average more than two years. Underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis can have long-term consequences for patients with axSpA.11

About the C-OPTIMISE Study2
C-OPTIMISE was a two-part, multicentre Phase 3b trial in adults with early active axSpA (radiographic and non-radiographic). During the 48-week open-label induction period, patients received CIMZIA 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) with loading dose of CIMZIA 400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4. At week 48, patients in sustained remission (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) <1.3 at weeks 32 or 36 and 48) were randomised to CIMZIA 200 mg Q2W (full maintenance dose), CIMZIA 200 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W; reduced maintenance dose) or placebo (withdrawal) for an additional 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients remaining flare-free (flare: ASDAS ≥2.1 at two consecutive visits or ASDAS >3.5 at any time point) during the maintenance period.

C-OPTIMISE is the first and only randomised, interventional, placebo-controlled study in the full axSpA spectrum with three arms (full dose, reduced dose and placebo) that provides strong evidence on the dosing options for healthcare professionals to manage axSpA patients that have achieved sustained remission with CIMZIA treatment.

About CIMZIA® in the EU/EEA
In the EU, CIMZIA® in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients inadequately responsive to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including MTX.

CIMZIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. CIMZIA in combination with MTX is also indicated for the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs.

CIMZIA has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with MTX.

CIMZIA, in combination with MTX, is also indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. CIMZIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

CIMZIA is also indicated in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with severe active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), comprising:

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) – adults with severe active AS who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) without radiographic evidence of AS – adults with severe active axSpA without radiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to NSAIDs.
CIMZIA is also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.

Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) EU/EEA* Important Safety Information 

Cimzia® was studied in 4,049 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in controlled and open label trials for up to 92 months. The commonly reported adverse reactions (1-10 percent) in clinical trials with Cimzia® and post-marketing were viral infections (includes herpes zoster, papillomavirus, influenza), bacterial infections (including abscess), rash, headache (including migraine), asthenia, leukopenia (including lymphopenia, neutropenia), eosinophilic disorder, pain (any sites), pyrexia, sensory abnormalities, hypertension, pruritus (any sites), hepatitis (including hepatic enzyme increase), injection site reactions, and nausea. Serious adverse reactions include sepsis, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis (including miliary, disseminated and extrapulmonary), herpes zoster, lymphoma, leukaemia, solid organ tumours, angioneurotic oedema, cardiomyopathies (includes heart failure), ischemic coronary artery disorders, pancytopenia, hypercoagulation (including thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism), cerebrovascular accident, vasculitis, hepatitis/hepatopathy (includes cirrhosis), and renal impairment/nephropathy (includes nephritis). In RA controlled clinical trials, 4.4 percent of patients discontinued taking Cimzia® due to adverse events vs. 2.7 percent for placebo.

Cimzia® was initially studied in 325 patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in the AS001 clinical study for up to 4 years, which includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and a 156-week open-label treatment period. Cimzia® was subsequently studied in 317 patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in a placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks (AS0006). Cimzia® was also studied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in a clinical study for up to 96 weeks, which included a 48-week open-label run-in phase (N=736) followed by a 48-week placebo-controlled phase (N=313) for patients in sustained remission (C-OPTIMISE). In all 3 studies, the safety profile for these patients was consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous experience with Cimzia®.

Cimzia® was studied in 409 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in a clinical study for up to 4 years which included a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and a 168-week open-label treatment period.

The safety profile for axSpA and PsA patients treated with Cimzia® was consistent with the safety profile in RA and previous experience with Cimzia®.

Cimzia® was studied in 1112 patients with psoriasis in controlled and open-label studies for up to 3 years. In the Phase III program, the initial and maintenance periods were followed by a 96-week open-label treatment period. The long-term safety profile of Cimzia® 400 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia® 200 mg every 2 weeks was generally similar and consistent with previous experience with Cimzia.

Cimzia® is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients, active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis or opportunistic infections, and moderate to severe heart failure.

Serious infections including sepsis, tuberculosis and opportunistic infections (e.g. histoplasmosis, nocardia, candidiasis) have been reported in patients receiving Cimzia®. Some of these events have been fatal. Before initiation of therapy with Cimzia®, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection. If active tuberculosis is diagnosed prior to or during treatment, Cimzia® therapy must not be initiated and must be discontinued. If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy must be started before initiating treatment with Cimzia®.

Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Cimzia® who are chronic carriers of the virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Cimzia®. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Cimzia® should be closely monitored and in the case of HBV reactivation Cimzia® should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.

TNF antagonists including Cimzia® may increase the risk of new onset or exacerbation of GL-P-CZ-axSpA-1900034 Important Safety Information Cimzia Revised April 2020 * EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic Area clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis; of formation of autoantibodies and uncommonly of the development of a lupuslike syndrome; of severe hypersensitivity reactions. If a patient develops any of these adverse reactions, Cimzia® should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF antagonist cannot be excluded. Rare cases of neurological disorders, including seizure disorder, neuritis and peripheral neuropathy, have been reported in patients treated with Cimzia®.

Adverse reactions of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia, have been reported with Cimzia®. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Cimzia®. Consider discontinuation of Cimzia® therapy in patients with confirmed significant haematological abnormalities.

The use of Cimzia® in combination with anakinra or abatacept is not recommended due to a potential increased risk of serious infections. As no data are available, Cimzia® should not be administered concurrently with live vaccines. The 14-day half-life of Cimzia® should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on Cimzia® should be closely monitored for infections.

Please consult the full prescribing information in relation to other side effects, full safety and

37998,Moderna Prices its COVID-19 Vaccine at $32-$37 per Dose for Smaller Volume Agreements,Moderna prices COVID-19 vaccine at $32-$37 per dose for smaller volume deals,"For smaller volume agreements, the company has priced its COVID-19 vaccine ranging from $32-$37/ dose, higher than the price of Pfizer’s vaccine candidate
 The company is in talks with several countries for supply agreements of its vaccine, adding that it had already received about $400M for supply. The P-III study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted in collaboration with NIH and BARDA with an anticipated completion of enrollment in Sept’2020
 Moderna has received $1B from the US government under a plan to ramp up vaccine development. The company’s vaccine candidate is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing","(Reuters) – Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) said on Wednesday smaller volume agreements for its experimental coronavirus vaccine have been priced in the range of $32 to $37 per dose, higher than the price set by the U.S. deal for Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) vaccine candidate.

 

As the race to develop COVID-19 vaccines reach a decisive stage, with several candidates being tested in pivotal late-stage studies, pricing has come under increasing scrutiny.

“We will be responsible on price well below (its) value during the pandemic,” Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said on a conference call, adding that larger volume agreements for its vaccine will be priced lower.

Last month, the U.S. government struck a deal for an experiment vaccine being developed by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.F) that secures enough vaccine to inoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person. Moderna’s two-dose vaccine regimen would cost between $64 and $74 per person.

Moderna, which has no drugs on the market, has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government under a plan to speed up vaccine development. It has not struck a supply agreement with the United States.

The company said on Wednesday it was in talks with several countries for supply agreements for its vaccine, adding that it had already received about $400 million in deposits for eventual supply.

Moderna said enrolment for its late-stage vaccine study that aims to include 30,000 people is on track to be completed in September.

The company’s vaccine candidate is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing. Effective vaccines are seen as essential to halting a pandemic that has claimed more than 700,000 lives worldwide.

Moderna said last month it plans to price its coronavirus vaccine in a way that ensures broad access and that it did not intend to conduct late-stage trials of the vaccine outside the United States.

 The medical device was investigated in Australia for >12 years with >1600 examinations across normal, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, concussion, and other neuro-vision disorders
 objectiveFIELD is a novel, FDA approved human visual field device used to test both the eyes simultaneously in minutes with no manual efforts, using multi-focal pupil objective perimetry method (mfPOP)","objectiveFIELD is a novel, FDA-cleared device designed to assess the human visual field in a completely objective and non-contact manner. Unlike the conventional method currently in use in most eye doctors’ offices, there is no need for any manual input from the patient. Using a patented multi-focal pupil objective perimetry method (mfPOP), objectiveFIELD tests both eyes simultaneously in only a few minutes.

objectiveFIELD has been clinically researched in Australia over more than a 12-year period with more than 16,000 examinations across normal, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine, concussion, and other neuro-vision conditions.1 objectiveFIELD was acquired from the Australian National University (ANU), includes novel features licensed from Seeing Machines™, and is the brain-child of noted researcher Ted Maddess, PhD, with his team “The Maddess Group – Diagnostics for Eye Diseases”, at the John Curtin School of Medical Research. Intellectual property acquired by Konan includes 15 issued patents in 9 countries, 6 patents in process, and clinical data to support a wide range of important diagnostic indications.

The worldwide premiere of objectiveFIELD will be at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting in Chicago from October 26-30, 2018 at Konan Medical Booth # 2515 and it will also be showcased at the American Academy of Optometry in San Antonio, TX, November 7-9, 2018.

“The initial roll-out of objectiveFIELD will feature an easy-to-use, easy-to-administer, engaging experience for the patient,” said Charles Wm. Stewart, Chief Executive Officer of Konan Medical USA. “The test is administered with both eyes open, takes only minutes to complete and represents a welcome new paradigm for patients, technicians and doctors. Additional features with supportive data are expected to be delivered as regulatory requirements are met.”

Ted Maddess, PhD added, “Konan Medical, with their expertise both in pupil tracking applications and with high precision ophthalmic diagnostic devices, was a great selection for ANU. We are excited to get objectiveFIELD to market after an extensive research, development and clinical testing phase.”

objectiveFIELD has also been clinically researched for use in concussion assessment at ANU that are thought to have visual-field manifestations. Recently Gordon Waddington, Professor of Sports Medicine at the Australian Institute of Sport, and Professor Braden McGrath, at the University of Canberra, additionally have helped conduct novel measures of visual function related to concussion injuries with objectiveFIELD technology.

 Deflux IV & Solesta are novel FDA approved treatments for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) & fecal incontinence respectively. Barrigel IV is EU approved treatment for protection of the rectal wall when treating prostate cancer with radiation","Transaction creates a fully-integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving patient outcomes for urology & urogynecology disorders, colorectal conditions, radiot

STOCKHOLM, Palette Life Sciences AB (formerly known as Pharmanest AB*) has entered into definitive agreements with Nestlé Skin Health to license worldwide commercialization and development rights for Deflux®, Solesta® and Barrigel™. Palette is currently developing Lidbree™ for pain relief for gynecological applications.
Key highlights for the Nestlé Skin Health transaction include:
Exclusive rights to fully develop and commercialize the three products:
Deflux – the only FDA-approved injectable treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a malformation of the urinary bladder that affects 1% of children worldwide. VUR can cause severe infections of the urinary tract and lead to irreversible kidney damage.
Solesta – the only FDA-approved injectable treatment for fecal incontinence, which is also cleared for commercialization in Europe. Fecal incontinence is a debilitating health problem afflicting about 2% of people worldwide with four times more prevalence in women than men.
Barrigel – a biodegradable injectable treatment for protection of the rectal wall when treating prostate cancer with radiation. The product is approved in Europe and will be further developed for future market introduction in the US.
Palette Life Sciences will focus immediately on commercialization activities for Deflux and Solesta, and will begin activities to enable worldwide commercialization of Barrigel.
The license can enable future new products intended for management of urological and gastroenterological conditions, and protection of adjacent healthy organs and tissue during radiation therapy for cancer.
The products are all based on the Nestlé Skin Health’s well-known and widely utilized NASHA™ technology. Millions of patients have been treated with NASHA based products for various medical conditions world-wide. The most well-known NASHA product marketed by Nestlé Skin Health is Restylane®, a leading dermal filler.
Nestlé Skin Health will continue to manufacture the licensed products on behalf of Palette Life Sciences.
As part of the transaction, Pharmanest AB will be renamed Palette Life Sciences AB with offices in Sweden and the US.
*Name change pending
“We are very pleased with the transaction with Nestlé Skin Health. It represents a first and significant step in the development of a global medical device company with significant commercial assets in several underserved medical conditions,” said Mattias Klintemar, Investor Director at The Baltic Sea Foundation, a lead investor in Palette Life Sciences. “Our ambition is to develop Palette Life Sciences into a global leader in the medical categories in which the company provides solutions.”
In a comment on the partnership, Andrew J. Kirsch, M.D., Professor and Chief of Pediatric Urology at Emory University School of Medicine and Director of Robotic Surgery at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta said, “I have used endoscopic injection of Deflux for decades and I am enthusiastic about the new ownership’s commitment to education and research within our subspecialty surrounding Deflux. We have studied Deflux extensively in a systematic fashion and have found it to be safe and effective in preventing UTIs (urinary tract infections) in children.”
NASHA technology is easy to inject and can create a precise and firm gel texture intended for creating and maintaining a pronounced space in the body. This versatility is a benefit in a wide variety of medical applications including the creation and maintenance of space around cancer tumors during different forms of radiation therapy. NASHA gel was the first HA spacer used for to protect sensitive tissue such as the rectal wall during radiation treatment of prostate cancer in 2007.
“The NASHA technology offers an advanced gel solution for spacing critical healthy tissues from high dose target regions, preventing toxicities and giving physicians confidence that they are using a gel designed with the patient’s safety in mind with a favorable ease of use,” said Dr. Jean-Philippe Pignol MD, PhD, Professor of Radiation Oncology, Dalhousie University, Canada, and previous Chair of Radiation Oncology at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “We have used this product on many patients and were very impressed by the possibility of sculpting with a great degree of precision the exact spacer we needed during radiation treatment. We are thrilled that Palette Life Sciences is bringing Barrigel to the market and will make it available to the radiation oncology field.”
In addition to the newly licensed NASHA products, Palette Life Sciences’ product portfolio includes Lidbree, a proprietary novel delivery technology that provides short-acting mucosal topical pain relief during placement of an intrauterine device (IUD). The product has additional potential applicability to other important medical procedures including certain types of hysteroscopies. Lidbree will be submitted for European regulatory review later this year.
Back Bay Life Science Advisors, an international strategy and M&A advisory firm, served as strategic and transaction advisor to Palette Life Sciences. Lindahl Law firm and Faber Daeufer & Itrato served as legal advisors.

 The transaction is expected to enhance and strengthen J&J’s footprints in Japan with its effective dermatology products
 On 29 Oct, 2018 J&J will announce its tender offer (acquisition of all remaining shares) for the acquisition, with its expected closure in H1’19","Acquisition is Expected to Expand J&J’s Consumer Portfolio of Science-based Dermocosmetic Beauty Products

NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ, – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced that they have agreed with Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd. (TYO: 4924) (the “Company”), a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products, to launch an all-cash offer (the “tender offer”) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company not already held by Johnson & Johnson and its affiliates for ¥5,900 per share, which equates to approximately ¥230 billion. The acquisition will include the Company’s range of brands comprising Dr.Ci:Labo, Labo Labo and Genomer line of skincare products.
The Company’s skincare portfolio is expected to strengthen Johnson & Johnson’s market presence in Japan with key customers, and more broadly bolster its offering in science-based, efficacious dermocosmetic brands.
“Health and beauty consumers are actively seeking science-based innovation to improve their skin,” said Jorge Mesquita, Worldwide Chairman, Johnson & Johnson Consumer. “This transaction will maximise value creation for Johnson & Johnson’s Consumer business by bringing in an agile innovation model and rapidly accelerating sales through our global commercialization expertise.”
In July 2016, Cilag GmbH International, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson (“Cilag”), entered into a long-term strategic collaboration with the Company, to distribute the Company’s brands outside of Japan. As part of this collaboration, Cilag acquired approximately 19.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company. The tender offer is part of a series of transactions pursuant to which Johnson & Johnson intends to acquire all the outstanding shares of the Company, including a separate transaction whereby Johnson & Johnson will acquire the shares of the Company held by CIC Corporation, the ownership vehicle of the Company’s founder, Dr. Yoshinori Shirono.
Benefits of the Proposed Transaction

Compelling, all-cash transaction for the Company’s shareholders: The transaction will deliver a significant and immediate premium to the Company’s shareholders;
Value-enhancing transaction for Johnson & Johnson shareholders: The transaction would enhance long-term growth and value creation of the Johnson & Johnson Consumer business;

Expanding and improving distribution through well-established networks: The addition of the Company to the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies will provide the opportunity to expand and improve retail presence through Johnson & Johnson’s Consumer capabilities and well-established distribution networks; and
Strengthening international innovation pipeline: The transaction will provide a strong platform for portfolio expansion by leveraging Johnson & Johnson’s global innovation pipeline.

Upon completion of the tender offer, Johnson & Johnson intends to conduct a squeeze-out procedure to purchase the remaining shares in the Company that were not tendered in the tender offer, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019.
The proposed transaction is conditioned upon:

Johnson & Johnson’s having acquired, directly or indirectly, at least two-thirds of all Company shares that are issued and outstanding at the end of the tender offer period, which may be extended, including for this purpose: the shares tendered, the shares already held by Cilag, and the shares held by CIC Corporation that will be separately acquired by Johnson & Johnson;

40679,Novartis Receives EU Approval for Cosentyx's (secukinumab) Label Update in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA),Novartis receives approval for Cosentyx label update in Europe to include dosing flexibility in psoriatic arthritis,"The label update includes dosing flexibility of Cosentyx up to 300 mg based on clinical response & SC structural data of 24 wks., showing inhibition in progression of joint damage in PsA
 Cosentyx label update is based on safety and efficacy of 300mg in follow-up titration & results from P-III FUTURE 5 study (N=996) @24 wks. showing results of no radiographic disease progression in 90% of patients
 Cosentyx is novel inhibitor for IL-17A in PsA & AS, prescribed to 160,000 patients WW. The updated label is applicable in EU including all EEA countries","New Cosentyx (secukinumab) label to include dosing flexibility up to 300 mg, based on clinical response, and 24-week structural data with subcutaneous (sc) regimens[1]
Cosentyx inhibits progression of joint damage in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and shows rapid and sustained resolution of enthesitis, by inhibiting IL-17A[2]-[4]
PsA is a chronic, progressive and irreversible disease leading to pain, fatigue, activity impairment and significant mobility loss due to structural damage[5]
Basel, – Novartis, a leader in immuno-dermatology and rheumatology, announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved a label update for Cosentyx (secukinumab). Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human treatment that specifically inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), in psoriatic arthritis (PsA)[1]. The new label update includes dosing flexibility of up to 300 mg based on clinical response that will provide clinicians with greater choice for their patients[1].
The label update also includes 24-week structural data with subcutaneous (sc) regimens demonstrating that Cosentyx inhibits progression of joint damage in PsA[1].
“Cosentyx has shown that it can slow the progression of joint damage inflicted by psoriatic arthritis, which can lead to significant mobility loss for patients,” said Paul Emery
Professor of Rheumatology, Arthritis Research UK and Director Leeds NIHR Biomedical Research Centre. “The label update allows dosing flexibility up to 300 mg, giving clinicians and patients greater choice in how to target this progressive and debilitating condition, based on individual response to treatment.”
This label update is significant as PsA can lead to significant mobility loss and irreversible joint damage if sub-optimally-treated[5]. PsA is a chronic, progressive and irreversible disease leading to pain, fatigue, as well as activity impairment and significant mobility loss due to structural damage[5].
The label update is based on Cosentyx sustained efficacy and consistent safety following up-titration to 300 mg in PsA. Cosentyx specifically inhibits IL-17A – a cornerstone cytokine involved in the development of spondyloarthritis and psoriatic disease[1],[6]-[8]. The 24-week structural disease progression data are from FUTURE 5, the largest Phase III study for a biologic conducted in PsA to date (996 patients)[2]. In this study, almost 90% of patients treated with Cosentyx 300 mg had no radiographic disease progression at 24 weeks[2].
“Cosentyx is the only IL-17A inhibitor to demonstrate 5-year safety and efficacy in Phase III studies of PsA and AS. We are reimagining the well-being of patients living with all facets of psoriatic arthritis,” said Eric Hughes, Global Development Unit Head, Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology. “This label update further supports prescribing doctors and patients in their treatment choice.”
The label update is applicable to all European Union and European Economic Area countries and is effective immediately. To date, Cosentyx has been prescribed to more than 160,000 patients worldwide[9].
About Cosentyx
Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that specifically inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and PsA[1],[6]-[8]. IL-17A is produced by various cells from both the innate immune system (which can be triggered by mechanical stress) and the adaptive immune system[3]. To date, Cosentyx has been prescribed to more than 160,000 patients worldwide[9] and is being evaluated in 100 studies, including a comprehensive head-to-head clinical trial program[10]-[16].

40680,AstraZeneca Divests US Rights of Synagis &amp; MEDI8897 to Sobi for Prevention of Serious Lower Respiratory Tract infection (LRTI),AstraZeneca to divest US Synagis rights to Sobi,"AstraZeneca to get $1.5B upfront ($1B in cash & 0.5B equity) plus $470M sales based milestones for Synagis. AZ has also sold US rights for its new candidate MEDI8897 to Sobi, for $175M milestone for BLA submission plus $110M development milestones & $60M non-contingent payment during 2019-2021
 Sobi to get hold of the US rights for Synagis and MEDI8897 plus additional 8% equity in AZ (with terms & condition of not selling it before 12 mos. on closing of transaction). The profit and loss will be shared for AZ will continue to develop Synagis in collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur (division of Sanofi)
 Synagis (palivizumab) is a novel mAb, inhibiting RSV F protein approved for RSV disease. MEDI8897 is a mAb, anti-RSV F indicated for prevention of LRTI caused by RSV","Transaction grants Sobi the right to participate in US profits and losses for MEDI8897
Upfront consideration of $1.5bn plus further contingent payments
AstraZeneca has agreed to sell US rights to Synagis (palivizumab) used for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi). Sobi will commercialise Synagis in the US and around 130 AstraZeneca employees will transfer to Sobi as part of the transaction.
Sobi will also have the right to participate in AstraZeneca’s share of US profits and losses related to potential new medicine MEDI8897. AstraZeneca will continue to develop MEDI8897 in collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi S.A.
Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “We continue to streamline our portfolio, allowing AstraZeneca to allocate resources more effectively, while Sobi’s focus on Synagis will enable infants in the US to continue benefiting from this important treatment. Meanwhile, the successful development and commercialisation of MEDI8897 remains important for AstraZeneca.”
Sobi President and CEO Guido Oelkers said: “I am excited about adding Synagis to our portfolio as it remains the only product preventing RSV infection in this vulnerable patient group with a great medical need. The addition of Synagis will become an important catalyst for Sobi’s future development and will form a powerful platform for growth in rare diseases.”
Financial considerations
Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will receive an upfront consideration of $1.5bn, consisting of $1.0bn in cash and $500m in ordinary shares of Sobi upon completion. This would equate to an ownership interest of 8%, based on the current Sobi share price. AstraZeneca has undertaken not to sell the shares received as consideration for a period of 12 months following the closing date of the transaction. The cash proceeds from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes.
AstraZeneca will also receive up to $470m in sales-related payments for Synagis, a $175m milestone following the submission of the Biologics License Application for MEDI8897; potential net payments of approximately $110m on achievement of other MEDI8897 profit and development-related milestones; and a total of $60m in non-contingent payments for MEDI8897 during 2019-2021. Under the agreement, Sobi will have the right to participate in payments that may be received by AstraZeneca from the US profits or losses for MEDI8897. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions and is currently expected to complete very early 2019. AstraZeneca will provide additional information if closing conditions are achieved earlier and the agreement can complete late 2018.
Net income attributable to the arrangements will be recorded in the Company’s financial statements upon completion as Other Operating Income.

40681,GSK's Trelegy Ellipta (Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol â€˜FF/UMEC/VI') Receives Expanded Level Approval from EU for COPD,Once-daily Trelegy Ellipta gains expanded COPD indication in Europe,"The IMPACT study involves assessing of Trelegy Ellipta (qd,100/62.5/25mcg) vs (ICS/LABA Relvar/Breo Ellipta (FF/VI)) (100/25mcg) & ((LAMA)/LABA Anoro Ellipta (UMEC/VI)) (62.5/25mcg) in patients with COPD
 The Expanded label approval will serve as a maintenance treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and shown effective results in comparison to ICS, LABA & LAMA. In 2017, Trelegy Ellipta has also received EU approval for this indication
 Trelegy Ellipta is a novel triple therapy inhaler, with combination of three molecules and is approved in US for airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema","First single inhaler triple therapy to be specifically indicated for COPD patients not adequately treated with dual bronchodilation.
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVA) today announced that the European Commission has authorised an expanded label for once-daily Trelegy Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol ‘FF/UMEC/VI’), recognising its effect on exacerbations and making it the first single inhaler triple therapy indicated for patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) not adequately treated with dual bronchodilation or with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA).
Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D, GSK, said, “We are pleased that the European Commission has approved the expanded use of Trelegy Ellipta as this will enable even more COPD patients to benefit from this important medicine.”
While bronchodilation is recognised as the foundation of COPD therapy, many patients may continue to struggle with symptoms and exacerbations over time. The expanded indication for Trelegy Ellipta reflects the evidence supporting its potential benefits in a broader group of patients than originally indicated, giving them the option of taking a once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for the first time.
Dr. Paul Meunier, VP, Respiratory Medicine at Innoviva, added, “We are delighted that once-daily single inhaler triple therapy will now be available for COPD patients requiring a step up from dual bronchodilation, giving them a new option to help manage their disease.”
The label update is based on data from the landmark InforMing the PAthway of COPD Treatment (IMPACT) study which showed Trelegy Ellipta was superior to both the ICS/LABA Relvar/Breo Ellipta (FF/VI) and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)/LABA Anoro Ellipta (UMEC/VI) in patients with moderate to severe COPD on multiple clinically important endpoints, including reducing exacerbations and improving lung function and health related quality of life.
The new indication for Trelegy Ellipta is as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately treated by a combination of an ICS and a LABA or a combination of a LABA and a LAMA (for effects on symptom control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). It was originally approved in the European Union (EU) in November 2017 as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately treated by a combination of an ICS and a LABA (for effects on symptom control see section 5.1).
About IMPACT
The landmark 10,355-patient InforMing the PAthway of COPD Treatment (IMPACT) study is the first study to directly compare three commonly-used COPD combination treatment classes delivered using the same dose and inhaler. It is the second of two Phase III studies designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of FF/UMEC/VI in a single inhaler compared to other commonly-used COPD combination treatments.[1]
IMPACT evaluated as its primary endpoint the annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbations for FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25mcg) compared with its components, FF/VI (100/25mcg) and UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg), two once-daily dual COPD therapies from GSK’s existing portfolio. Results from IMPACT were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.[2]

About Trelegy Ellipta (FF/UMEC/VI)
FF/UMEC/VI is the first COPD treatment to provide a combination of three molecules in a single inhaler that is taken in a single inhalation, once a day. It contains fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid, umeclidinium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist; and vilanterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, delivered in GSK’s Ellipta dry powder inhaler, which is used across the entire new portfolio of inhaled COPD medicines.
Data from across multiple clinical programmes have demonstrated the benefit/risk of the molecules in FF/UMEC/VI alone and in combination for the treatment of COPD and it has been approved for use in appropriate patients with COPD in both the US and the EU.
FF/UMEC/VI is approved in Europe as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately treated by a combination of an ICS and a LABA or a combination of a LABA and a LAMA (for effects on symptom control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). The European Summary of Product Characteristics is available at: https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/34357
FF/UMEC/VI is approved in the US for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. It is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. It is not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma. Full US Prescribing Information, including Patient Information is available here.
FF/UMEC/VI has been approved in a number of other countries with further regulatory applications ongoing.

About COPD
COPD is a progressive lung disease that is thought to affect around 384 million people worldwide.[3]
For people living with COPD, the inability to breathe normally can consume their daily lives and make simple activities, like walking upstairs, an everyday struggle. Patients with COPD suffer from symptoms of breathlessness and many have a significant risk of exacerbations. Managing these aspects of the disease drives physician treatment choice.
Long-term exposure to inhaled irritants that damage the lungs and the airways are usually the cause of COPD. Cigarette smoke, breathing in second hand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes or dust from the environment or workplace can all contribute to COPD. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin.[4]
Every person with COPD is different, with different needs, different challenges and different goals. Understanding this and providing support to help meet these needs is the foundation of GSK’s work.

GSK’s commitment to respiratory disease
GSK has led the way in developing innovative medicines to advance the management of asthma and COPD for nearly 50 years. Over the last five years we have launched six innovative medicines responding to continued unmet patient need, despite existing therapies. This is an industry-leading portfolio in breadth, depth and innovation, developed to reach the right patients, with the right treatment.
We remain at the cutting-edge of scientific research into respiratory medicine, working in collaboration with patients and the scientific community to offer innovative medicines aimed at helping to treat patients’ symptoms and reduce the risk of their disease worsening. While respiratory diseases are clinically distinct, there are important pathophysiological features that span them, and our ambition is to have the most comprehensive portfolio of medicines to address a diverse range of respiratory diseases. To achieve this, we are focusing on targeting the underlying disease-driving biological processes to develop medicines with applicability across multiple respiratory diseases. This approach requires extensive bioinformatics, data analytic capabilities, careful patient selection and stratification by phenotype in our clinical trials.

Important Safety Information for FF/UMEC/VI in the EU
The following Important Safety Information is based on a summary of the Summary of Product Characteristics for Trelegy Ellipta (FF/UMEC/VI). Please consult the full Summary of Product Characteristics for all the safety information.
FF/UMEC/VI is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either fluticasone furoate (FF), umeclidinium (UMEC), vilanterol (VI) or any of the excipients.
FF/UMEC/VI should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this patient population. FF/UMEC/VI is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.
In the event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with FF/UMEC/VI, a re-evaluation of the patient and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken.
Administration of FF/UMEC/VI may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening.
Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen after the administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists and sympathomimetics, including FF/UMEC/VI. Therefore, FF/UMEC/VI should be used with caution in patients with unstable or life-threatening cardiovascular disease.
Systemic steroid effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment receiving FF/UMEC/VI should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions.
If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical corticosteroids.
FF/UMEC/VI should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, in patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists and in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or in patients with chronic or untreated infection.
Consistent with its antimuscarinic activity, FF/UMEC/VI should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention or with narrow-angle glaucoma.
An increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been observed in patients with COPD receiving ICS. There is some evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all studies. There is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia risk among ICS products.
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. No clinically relevant effects of hypokalaemia were observed in clinical studies with FF/UMEC/VI at the recommended therapeutic dose. Caution should be exercised when FF/UMEC/VI is used with other medicinal products that also have the potential to cause hypokalaemia.
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients. No clinically relevant effects on plasma glucose were observed in clinical studies with FF/UMEC/VI at the recommended therapeutic dose. Upon initiation of treatment with FF/UMEC/VI, plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in diabetic patients.
There have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in diabetic patients treated with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol and this should be considered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus.
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take FF/UMEC/VI.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with FF/UMEC/VI were nasopharyngitis (7%), headache (5%) and upper respiratory tract infection (2%). Other common adverse reactions (reported with a frequency of ≥1/100 to <1/10) include: pneumonia, pharyngitis, rhinitis, influenza, cough, arthralgia and back pain.

40688,Eli Lilly's Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes,"FDA approves Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection), Lilly’s new rapid-acting insulin","The approval is based on P-III PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D studies assessing Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 units/mL) and Humalog (insulin lispro injection, 100 units/mL), both in combination with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec in adults with T1D and T2D, respectively
 Both the studies resulted in meeting its 1EPs of non-inferior A1C reduction @26wks., when both the therapies dosed at mealtime, Lyumjev demonstrated a superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both 1hr. & 2hrs. after a test meal, safety & tolerability profile is similar for both
 Lyumjev is a novel formulation of insulin lispro, developed to speed the absorption of insulin into the bloodstream and reduce A1C levels and is contraindicated during episodes of hypoglycemia and in patients with hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or one of the excipients in Lyumjev","INDIANAPOLIS, June 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Lyumjev™ (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL), Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) new rapid-acting insulin indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Lyumjev is a novel formulation of insulin lispro, developed to speed the absorption of insulin into the blood stream and reduce A1C levels. As a rapid-acting mealtime insulin, Lyumjev controls high blood sugar levels after meals in adults with diabetes, similar to how natural insulin works after meals in people without diabetes.

“Thanks to advances in glucose monitoring, the people with diabetes I treat in my practice are able to more clearly see the blood glucose spikes that happen naturally after a meal,” said Mark Warren, M.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine, Campbell University of Osteopathic Medicine. “With its fast onset, Lyumjev is a meaningful development for people who want their insulin to help manage their A1C and reduce those post-meal spikes.”

The approval of Lyumjev was based on data from the Phase 3 studies PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D, which were randomized, active controlled, treat-to-target comparisons of Lyumjev and Humalog® (insulin lispro injection, 100 units/mL) in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Both studies met the primary endpoint of noninferior A1C reduction from baseline compared to Humalog at 26 weeks, when Lyumjev and Humalog were dosed at mealtime. Key endpoints were adjusted for multiple testing, including the comparisons of one- and two-hour postprandial glucose. In both studies, Lyumjev demonstrated superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both one hour and two hours after a test meal compared to Humalog.

In Phase 3 studies, Lyumjev and Humalog had similar safety and tolerability profiles. Lyumjev is contraindicated during episodes of hypoglycemia and in patients with hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or one of the excipients in Lyumjev. Hypoglycemia, which can be serious and life-threatening, is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including Lyumjev.

“We are proud to build on our long heritage of developing new insulins with the approval of Lyumjev, an important new treatment option to help control post-meal blood sugar levels,” said Leonard Glass, M.D., F.A.C.E., vice president of Medical Affairs, Lilly. “Keeping blood sugar in the target range following meals can be challenging for people living with diabetes, and the approval of Lyumjev underscores our commitment to meeting their needs.”

Lyumjev will be included in the Lilly Insulin Value Program, allowing anyone with commercial insurance and those without insurance at all to fill their monthly prescription of Lyumjev for $35. When Lyumjev is available in U.S. pharmacies, this savings option can be obtained by calling the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center at (833) 808-1234, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (ET). The list price of Lyumjev will be the same as the list price for Humalog. Lilly is in discussions with insurance providers to make Lyumjev available to as many people as possible.

“Lilly is committed to ensuring all of our insulins, including Lyumjev, are accessible to people living with diabetes through our wide range of affordability options, such as the Lilly Insulin Value Program,” said Adrienne Brown, vice president, U.S. Connected Care and Insulins, Lilly. “We want people who use Lilly insulin and need help affording their medicine to know that we’re here to support them.”

Lyumjev has been approved by regulatory authorities in several global markets, including Japan and the European Union in March 2020. Lilly is currently working to make Lyumjev available to adults with diabetes in the U.S. as quickly as possible.

Patients and healthcare providers with questions about Lyumjev can visit http://www.Lyumjev.com or call The Lilly Answers Center at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979), Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET.

About the Lyumjev clinical studies
PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D were randomized, active controlled, treat-to-target comparisons of Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc injection, 100 units/mL) and Humalog (insulin lispro injection, 100 units/mL), both in combination with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The studies were designed as treat-to-target trials in which each arm was treated to achieve the same level of blood glucose control and evaluated other important treatment effects, such as rates of hypoglycemia and post-meal glucose control. A subset of patients randomized to PRONTO-T1D participated in an evaluation of 24-hour ambulatory glucose profiles captured with blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) over a two-week period. Both studies met the primary endpoint of noninferior A1C reduction from baseline compared to Humalog at 26 weeks, when Lyumjev and Humalog were dosed at mealtime. Key endpoints were adjusted for multiple testing, including the comparisons of one- and two-hour postprandial glucose. In both studies, Lyumjev demonstrated superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both one hour and two hours after a test meal compared to Humalog. Additionally, in studies evaluating the time action profile of this new insulin, Lyumjev appeared in the blood stream approximately one minute after injection.

PURPOSE and SAFETY SUMMARY
Important Facts About LYUMJEV™ (LOOM-jehv) and Humalog® (HU-ma-log)

Lyumjev is also known as insulin lispro-aabc injection. Humalog is also known as insulin lispro injection.
Lyumjev is a fast-acting insulin. Lyumjev is used to control high blood sugar in adults with diabetes. Humalog is a fast-acting insulin. Humalog is used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes. Lyumjev and Humalog are available only with a prescription.
Lyumjev comes in two strengths: U-100 (100 units per milliliter) and U-200 (200 units per milliliter). The Lyumjev U-200 prefilled pen contains 2 times as much insulin per 1 milliliter as standard (U-100) insulin. Humalog U-100 contains 100 units of insulin per milliliter. The dose window of the pen shows the number of insulin units to be delivered.
It is not known if Lyumjev is safe and effective for children. It is not known if Humalog is safe and effective for children with type 2 diabetes or for children younger than 3 years of age with type 1 diabetes as there were no studies done with Humalog in these groups of children. If your doctor decides to give your child any insulin products, he or she may give you special instructions.
All Lyumjev and Humalog products contain insulin lispro. 

Warnings

Do not take Lyumjev or Humalog if you have:

symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
an allergy to Lyumjev or Humalog or any of their ingredients.
Do not reuse needles or share your insulin injection supplies with other people. This includes your:

prefilled pen for use by a single patient
cartridges
reusable pen that works with Lilly 3mL cartridges available for Humalog
needles
syringes
You or the other person can get a serious infection. This can happen even if you change the needle. 

Do not change the type of insulin you take or your dose, unless your doctor tells you to. This could cause low or high blood sugar, which could be serious.

Do not use a syringe to remove Lyumjev or Humalog from your prefilled pen. This can cause you to take too much insulin. Taking too much insulin can lead to severe low blood sugar. This may result in seizures or death.

Lyumjev and Humalog may cause serious side effects. Some of these can lead to death. The possible serious side effects are:

Low blood sugar. This can cause:
• dizziness or lightheadedness • sweating • confusion
• headache • blurred vision • slurred speech
• shakiness • fast heartbeat • anxiety
• irritability • mood change • hunger
If you are at risk of having severely low blood sugar, your doctor may prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. These are used when your blood sugar becomes too low and you are unable to take sugar by mouth. Glucagon helps your body release sugar into your bloodstream.

Severe allergic reaction.
Get emergency help right away if you have:
• a rash over your whole body • trouble breathing • a fast heartbeat
• sweating • a faint feeling • shortness of breath
• extreme drowsiness • dizziness • confusion
• swelling of your face, tongue, or throat 
Low potassium in your blood. This can lead to severe breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and death.
Heart failure. Taking diabetes pills called thiazolidinediones (thIE-uh-zOH-li-dEEn-dIE-OHns), or “TZDs,” with Lyumjev or Humalog may cause heart failure in some people. This includes people who do not have any heart problems. If you have heart failure, it may get worse if you take TZDs with Lyumjev or Humalog. Tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms of heart failure, or if they get worse. Some symptoms of heart failure include: shortness of breath, swelling of ankles and feet, and sudden weight gain. Your doctor may need to change or stop treatment with TZDs and your insulin lispro product.
High blood sugar and ketoacidosis for Humalog insulin pump users. You can have these serious problems when your insulin pump or infusion set stops working. They can also happen if your insulin is no longer effective. For these reasons, always keep extra insulin injection supplies with you.
Common side effects

The most common side effects of Lyumjev and Humalog are:

• low blood sugar • allergic reactions
• reactions where you have injected insulin • skin thickening or pits at the injection site
• itching • rash
• weight gain 
Other most common side effects with Humalog include swelling of your hands or feet.

These are not all of the possible side effects. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. You can report side effects at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

Before using

Talk with your doctor about low blood sugar and how to manage it. Also tell your doctor:

about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
about any other prescription medicines you take, especially ones called TZDs.
about all of your medical conditions, including if you have heart failure or other heart, liver, or kidney problems.
if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed.
How to take

Read the Instructions for Use that come with your Lyumjev or Humalog. Be sure to take your Lyumjev or Humalog and check your blood sugar levels exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to change your dose because of illness, increased stress, or changes in your weight, diet, or physical activity level. He or she may also tell you to change the amount or time of your dose because of other medicines or different types of insulin you take.

Before injecting your Lyumjev or Humalog

You can inject your insulin dose yourself, or you can have a trained caregiver inject it for you. Make sure you or your caregiver:

Check the insulin label before each injection. This will help you make sure that you are taking the correct insulin.
Use a new needle for each injection. You can get a serious infection or the wrong dose of insulin if you re-use needles.
Change (rotate) where you inject your insulin with each dose. This can reduce your chance of getting pits, lumps, or thickened skin where you inject your insulin. Do not inject your insulin into the exact same spot or where the skin has pits or lumps. Avoid injecting into thickened, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred, or damaged skin.
When you are ready to inject

Inject Lyumjev under your skin at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start eating a meal.
Inject Humalog under your skin within 15 minutes before or right after you eat a meal.
Staying safe while taking your Lyumjev or Humalog

To stay safe while taking your insulin, be sure to never inject Lyumjev U-200 in your vein, muscle, or with an insulin pump. Also be sure not to:

mix Lyumjev with other insulins
drive or use heavy machinery until you know how your Lyumjev or Humalog affects you.
drink alcohol or use other medicines that contain alcohol when taking your Lyumjev or Humalog.

 The approval will serve as a novel treatment for gastroparesis with expected commercialization in Q4’20
 Gimoti nasal spray is the novel nasally administered product while Eversana will be responsible for its launch","Commercial Partner EVERSANA Prepares for GIMOTI Launch
Evoke Extends Cash Runway into 2021

SOLANA BEACH, Calif., June 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Evoke Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVOK), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for GIMOTI™ (metoclopramide) nasal spray, the first and only nasally-administered product indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.

“We are extremely pleased to have received FDA approval to commercially market GIMOTI in the United States. This approval represents the first novel pharmaceutical treatment for gastroparesis in several decades. Many times, patients do not experience adequate relief of their gastroparesis symptoms from current treatments, representing a significant need for a new approach to therapy. We are excited to be able to offer health care providers and their patients a unique non-oral treatment option to relieve symptoms and help improve their quality of life,” said David Gonyer, R.Ph., President and CEO.

“Patients with gastroparesis suffer from characteristic symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, bloating, early satiety as well as vomiting which can be severe and debilitating. These patients often have erratic absorption of orally administered drugs due to delayed gastric emptying,” stated Henry Parkman, MD, Stanley H. Lorber Research Endowment Fund and Chair, and Director, Gastroenterology Motility Laboratory, School of Medicine at Temple University. “Unlike oral medications, GIMOTI is administered nasally, bypassing the diseased GI track, allowing the drug to enter the bloodstream directly and therefore may provide predictable delivery of the therapy.”

“Together with our partner EVERSANA, we are now fully focused on executing our commercialization strategy for GIMOTI by leveraging EVERSANA’s integrated suite of capabilities and highly experienced sales and marketing team,” continued David Gonyer, R.Ph. “We anticipate initiating commercial sales in the fourth quarter of 2020.”

The FDA approval of GIMOTI allows Evoke to access its existing $5 million line of credit from EVERSANA to support manufacturing and other aspects of GIMOTI’s commercialization. As of May 31, 2020, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $4.7 million. Evoke believes, based on its current operating plan, that its cash and cash equivalents, together with the EVERSANA line of credit, will support the company’s operations into 2021, without consideration of potential GIMOTI revenue.

About GIMOTI™ (metoclopramide) nasal spray
GIMOTI is indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.

Important Safety Information
WARNING: TARDIVE DYSKINESIA

Metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. The risk of developing TD increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dosage.
Discontinue GIMOTI in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. In some patients, symptoms may lessen or resolve after metoclopramide is stopped.
Avoid treatment with metoclopramide (all dosage forms and routes of administration) for longer than 12 weeks because of the increased risk of developing TD with longer-term use.
GIMOTI is not recommended for use in:

Pediatric patients due to the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and other extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the risk of methemoglobinemia in neonates.
Moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child‑Pugh B or C), moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute), and patients concurrently using strong CYP2D6 inhibitors due to the risk of increased drug exposure and adverse reactions.
GIMOTI is contraindicated:

In patients with a history of tardive dyskinesia (TD) or a dystonic reaction to metoclopramide.
When stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous (e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation).
In patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas. Metoclopramide may cause a hypertensive/pheochromocytoma crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor.
In patients with epilepsy. Metoclopramide may increase the frequency and severity of seizures.
In patients with hypersensitivity to metoclopramide. Reactions have included laryngeal and glossal angioedema and bronchospasm.
Potential adverse reactions associated with metoclopramide include: Tardive dyskinesia (TD), other extrapyramidal effects (EPS), parkinsonism symptoms, motor restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), depression, suicidal ideation and suicide, hypertension, fluid retention, hyperprolactinemia, effects on the ability to drive and operate machinery.

Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) for GIMOTI are: dysgeusia, headache, and fatigue.

These are not all of the possible side effects of GIMOTI. Call your doctor for medical advice about whether you should take GIMOTI and the possible risk factors and side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

About Evoke Pharma, Inc.
Evoke is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat GI disorders and diseases. The Company developed GIMOTI, a nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide, for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults.

Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents resulting in serious GI symptoms as well as other systemic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications. Prior to FDA approval to commercially market GIMOTI, metoclopramide was only available in oral and injectable formulations and remains the only drug currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis.

(TOKYO: 4519) and Biofourmis, a Boston-based digital therapeutics company, announced that they have partnered to develop a digital solution for the objective assessment of pain associated with endometriosis.

Pain is one of the main symptoms of endometriosis and therapeutically important. The severity of pain may vary from day to day, and it can be a major issue that affects patients’ quality of life. However, because pain can be a subjective symptom, patients often have difficulty quantifying their level of pain when communicating with healthcare professionals and family members.

The partnership leverages Biofourmis’ Biovitals® platform to co-develop a novel digital technology for the objective assessment of pain using biosensors and artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. The solution will be validated in a global, multi-center observational study enrolling more than 120 endometriosis patients.

Biofourmis has demonstrated its ability to discover, develop and clinically validate multivariate digital biomarkers across multiple therapeutic areas. The digital solution for managing patients with endometriosis in an ambulatory setting will include a wearable, clinical-grade biosensor to capture physiology biomarkers and a patient-facing mobile app to monitor symptoms, with a gamification engine for patient engagement. The AI-based technology will provide a continuous quantification of pain by applying analytics to physiology biomarkers. The platform will also include a clinician-facing web dashboard for remote review and intervention.

“Through the partnership with Biofourmis, a leading company in research, development and commercialization of digital therapeutics, Chugai will set out to objectively assess pain associated with endometriosis and better understand its pathology,” said Satoko Shisai, Chugai’s Vice President, Head of Digital & IT Supervisory Division. “Through this partnership, Chugai is demonstrating its commitment to applying the most advanced digital technologies to better understand the real-life needs of patients and to develop innovative solutions for society, as outlined in the CHUGAI DIGITAL VISION 2030.”

Kuldeep Singh Rajput, CEO and founder of Biofourmis, said: “Chugai aims to become a top innovator by utilizing digital technologies, and we are thrilled to partner with them.” He added: “This unique collaboration with Chugai is another indicator of the growing consensus in the healthcare industry that combining digital solutions with therapeutic developments—from discovery to patient care—is a powerful way to augment efficiency. Digital solutions can deliver faster, more reliable insights to clinicians to aid interventions, while increasing engagement and improving outcomes for patients and lowering healthcare costs for all stakeholders.”

About Endometriosis1
Affecting one out of 10 women in their 20s to 40s, endometriosis is the repeated proliferation and shedding of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, accompanied by dysmenorrhea (pain with menstruation) and chronic lower abdominal pain. It is also a cause of infertility. The disease can interfere with daily life, including absences from work or school, as sufferers find it difficult to do more than lie still when symptoms are severe. The only existing medications are hormonal agents. Moreover, if the pain cannot be controlled by drugs, the only treatment is surgical removal of the endometriotic tissue. Unfortunately, many patients experience a recurrence several years after surgery, making this a disease that has a high level of unmet medical need.

40691,Abbott's IOS-Compatible App Receives the US FDA's Approval for Patients with Neurological Disorder,ABBOTT RECEIVES FDA APPROVAL FOR IOS-COMPATIBLE APP ALLOWING PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND MOVEMENT DISORDERS TO PERSONALIZE THERAPY VIA THEIR MOBILE DEVICE,"The US FDA approves Abbott’s patient controller app for use on Apple’s smartphone devices, allowing patients with neurological conditions such as chronic pain or movement disorders to manage their therapy directly from their smartphone
 The company plans to integrate the app into Abbott’s NeuroSphere Digital Care, launched in May’2020 which is compatible with Infinity DBS System for patients with PD or essential tremor, Proclaim XR SCS system and Proclaim DRG Neurostimulation system for patients with chronic pain and chronic pain in the lower limbs caused by complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia respectively
 The integration across all Abbott neuromodulation technologies allows physicians to treat patients more easily within their practice who have an Abbott device and Apple smartphone. The patient controller app with personalized access to therapy will be available imminently","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., July 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of the company’s Patient Controller app on compatible personal Apple‡ smartphone devices. At Abbott, this approval allows patients living with neurological conditions, including chronic pain or movement disorders, the ability to manage therapy directly from their personal smartphone.2

With this app approval, the need to carry a separate patient programmer device is eliminated, streamlining the patient’s experience and seamlessly integrating therapy management into their life. This is an important step in the integration and connection of digital health tools that ultimately help patients live fuller, healthier lives.

“For physicians who are prescribing and implanting neuromodulation technologies, the ability to integrate therapies into one’s everyday life is key,” said Alexander Escobar, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at The University of Toledo, OH. “The COVID-19 global health crisis has demanded access to virtual treatment options, especially for those individuals with chronic medical conditions that may have difficulty coming to see their physician or would prefer not to leave their own home. To ensure our patients are receiving the care they need in the appropriate setting, close follow up is critical. Physicians have the ability to remain engaged with their patients through the Apple device, allowing them to interact and treat debilitating chronic pain.”

“The ability to support the changing needs of individuals living with debilitating chronic conditions, like Parkinson’s, without them having to leave their homes is vitally important in today’s world,” said Drew Falconer, M.D., Director of the Parkinson’s and Movement Disorders Center, Inova Health System in Virginia. “Abbott’s NeuroSphere Digital Care solution, including the new Patient Controller app, allows patients to handle one single device and using the FaceTime application, interact with their provider teams in a convenient, easy-to-use interface — an important attribute for those with tremors or have challenges with mobility.”

The Patient Controller app will be integrated into Abbott’s broader NeuroSphere Digital Care connected care management platform, which became available in May. It is compatible with Abbott’s suite of neuromodulation technologies, including Infinity™ DBS System for patients with Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor, Proclaim™ XR SCS System for patients living with chronic pain, and Proclaim™ DRG Neurostimulation System for patients with chronic pain in the lower limbs caused by complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia. This integration across all Abbott neuromodulation technologies allows physicians to more easily treat the individual needs of each patient within their practice who have an Abbott device and Apple smartphone.

“Patients are seeking digital options to better engage with their healthcare providers and manage their chronic conditions remotely – and this has never been more evident than in today’s pandemic where virtual care is necessary,” said Keith Boettiger, vice president, Neuromodulation, Abbott. “With the continuing rise in interest and demand for these technologies, Abbott, as a pioneer in patient-centric neuromodulation technology, is advancing the field of digital health to deliver on the promise of digital care. The approval of Abbott’s Patient Controller app with personalized access to therapy is a landmark event, as we are now able to provide patients a way to access personalized therapy from a compatible and secure iOS device so that people can live their lives and seamlessly manage conditions like chronic pain and movement disorders.”

The Patient Controller app with personalized access to therapy will be made available starting in the coming weeks. For important safety information please visit the websites for Infinity DBS, Proclaim XR and Proclaim DRG devices.

 Breztri Aerosphere is an approved therapy in Japan and China for patients with COPD and is under regulatory review in the EU. As per the agreement to acquire Pearl Therapeutics, AstraZeneca paid $150M as a milestone on US approval of the therapy for COPD","24 July 2020 07:00 BST
Approval based on Phase III ETHOS trial which showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of exacerbations compared with dual-combination therapies
AstraZeneca’s Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) has been approved in the US for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on positive results from the Phase III ETHOS trial in which Breztri Aerosphere, a triple-combination therapy, showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with dual-combination therapies Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate).1 The approval was also supported by efficacy and safety data from the Phase III KRONOS trial.2

Dr. Fernando J. Martinez, Chief of Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, US and Investigator in the ETHOS trial, said: “Preventing exacerbations is central to the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Even a single exacerbation can have a negative impact on a patient’s lung function and quality of life, and it can increase the risk of death. Breztri Aerosphere has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing exacerbations in patients suffering from COPD.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Breztri Aerosphere has demonstrated a strong clinical profile compared with dual-combination therapies and offers a meaningful new treatment option for patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a debilitating progressive condition and the fourth leading cause of death in the US. We look forward to discussing all-cause mortality data from the Breztri Aerosphere ETHOS trial with health authorities.”

Results from the Phase III ETHOS trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine1 in June 2020 and results from the Phase III KRONOS trial were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine in September 2018.2 In both trials, the safety and tolerability of Breztri Aerosphere were consistent with the profiles of the dual comparators.1,2

Breztri Aerosphere is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma in the US or other countries. Breztri Aerosphere is approved in Japan and China for patients with COPD and under regulatory review in the EU.

Financial considerations

Under the terms of the past agreement to acquire Pearl Therapeutics Inc., AstraZeneca will make a $150m milestone payment upon US regulatory approval of Breztri Aerosphere for COPD. This is the final development and regulatory milestone under that agreement.

COPD

COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.3 It affects an estimated 384 million people4 and is the third leading cause of death globally.5 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.3 Even a single COPD exacerbation may be associated with a significant increase in the rate of decline in lung function,6 a significant deterioration in quality of life,7 and can significantly reduce life expectancy and increase the risk of mortality.8,9

ETHOS, KRONOS and the ATHENA clinical trial programme

ETHOS is a randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, parallel-group, 52-week trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Breztri Aerosphere in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbation(s) in the previous year. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations.1

KRONOS is a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Breztri Aerosphere in patients with moderate to very severe COPD regardless of whether or not they had an exacerbation in the previous year. The primary endpoints were lung function parameters.2

ETHOS and KRONOS are part of AstraZeneca’s ATHENA Phase III clinical trial programme for Breztri Aerosphere, which included more than 15,500 patients globally across 11 trials.

Breztri Aerosphere

Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) is a single-inhaler, fixed dose triple-combination of budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), with glycopyrrolate, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), delivered in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler.

AstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology

Respiratory & Immunology is one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company.

AstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care, and its inhaled and biologic medicines reached more than 53 million patients in 2019. Building on a 50-year heritage, the Company aims to transform the treatment of asthma and COPD by focusing on earlier biology-led treatment, eliminating preventable asthma attacks, and removing COPD as a top-three leading cause of death. The Company’s early respiratory research is focused on emerging science involving immune mechanisms, lung damage and abnormal cell-repair processes in disease and neuronal dysfunction.

With common pathways and underlying disease drivers across respiratory and immunology, AstraZeneca is following the science from chronic lung diseases to immunology-driven disease areas. The Company’s growing presence in immunology is focused on five mid- to late-stage franchises with multi-disease potential, in areas including rheumatology (including systemic lupus erythematosus), dermatology, gastroenterology, and systemic eosinophilic-driven diseases. AstraZeneca’s ambition in Respiratory & Immunology is to achieve disease modification and durable remission for millions of patients worldwide.

The company expects the EC’s decision in Q3’20","Clinical Development Program of Filgotinib Demonstrated Durable Efficacy Balanced with a Consistent Safety Profile in Rheumatoid Arthritis Through 52 Weeks —

Foster City, Calif., and Mechelen, Belgium, July 24 2020, 14:10 CET; regulated information – Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Galapagos NV (Euronext & Nasdaq: GLPG) announced today the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Jyseleca® (filgotinib 200 mg and 100 mg tablets), an investigational, once-daily, oral, selective JAK1 inhibitor for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The CHMP positive opinion is a scientific recommendation to the European Commission to grant marketing authorization in Europe.

The CHMP positive opinion is supported by data from the Phase 3 FINCH and Phase 2 DARWIN programs, which included 4,544 RA patient-years of experience with filgotinib. All three FINCH trials, involving a broad range of patients, met their primary endpoints. In the trials, filgotinib consistently achieved ACR20/50/70 and other relevant treatment targets, such as DAS28(CRP)<2.6. Filgotinib also inhibited the progression of structural joint damage assessed by modified total Sharp score (mTSS) compared with placebo. Across the FINCH and DARWIN trials, once-daily filgotinib demonstrated a consistent clinical safety profile when administered as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX). Rates of serious infections and herpes zoster were generally similar to adalimumab and MTX, while rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were infrequently reported.

The CHMP positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to authorize medicines in the 27 countries of the European Union, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and UK. A Commission decision is expected in the third quarter of 2020.

Filgotinib is an investigational agent and is not approved for use by any regulatory authority.

About the FINCH Program 

The FINCH Phase 3 program investigated the efficacy and safety of filgotinib 100 mg and 200 mg once-daily, in RA patient populations ranging from early stage to biologic-experienced patients. FINCH 1 was a 52‑week, randomized, placebo- and adalimumab-controlled trial in combination with MTX, enrolling 1,759 adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who had inadequate response to MTX. The primary endpoint in FINCH 1 was ACR20 at Week 12. The trial included radiographic assessment at Weeks 24 and 52. FINCH 2 was a global, 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study evaluating filgotinib on a background of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug(s) (csDMARDs) among 449 adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who had not adequately responded to biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). The primary endpoint in FINCH 2 was ACR20 at Week 12. FINCH 3 was a 52‑week, randomized trial in 1,252 MTX-naïve patients to evaluate filgotinib 200 mg alone and filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg combined with MTX versus MTX alone in MTX-naïve patients. The primary endpoint in FINCH 3 was ACR20 at Week 24. The trial included radiographic assessment at Weeks 24 and 52. Filgotinib is an oral, selective JAK inhibitor with preferential activity for JAK1 and JAK 1/3 signaling.

In vitro results demonstrated STI-1499’s ability to completely neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection @low doses, making it lead candidate for potential treatment against COVID-19","SAN DIEGO and BOSTON, July 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) and SmartPharm Therapeutics, Inc. (“SmartPharm”) announced today the signing of a letter of intent for Sorrento to acquire SmartPharm, a gene-encoded therapeutics company developing non-viral DNA and RNA gene delivery platforms for COVID-19 and rare diseases, with broad potential for application in enhancing antibody-centric therapeutics, including against COVID-19. The transaction is expected to close in August 2020. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Sorrento and SmartPharm previously announced a research and development collaboration to encode and express in vivo Sorrento’s proprietary SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies utilizing SmartPharm’s Gene Mab plasmid nanoparticle platform.

Sorrento plans to accelerate the development of multiple candidates for in vivo gene-encoded expression of Sorrento’s antibodies, starting with Sorrento’s previously announced STI-1499, or COVI-GUARD™, which is currently moving through preclinical and manufacturing requirements with an IND submission targeted for August 2020. The initial clinical trial for STI-1499 is expected to be in ICU patients to ensure safety and potentially allow a preliminary look at efficacy. In vitro results so far have demonstrated STI-1499’s ability to completely neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection at low doses, making STI-1499 Sorrento’s lead candidate for potential cost-effective passive protection against COVID-19.

SmartPharm’s Gene Mab™ platform delivers to muscles a novel low-immunogenic DNA plasmid encoded with a therapeutic antibody for long-lasting expression in vivo. If clinical trials are successful, a single administration of STI-1499dpi (DNA plasmid injection) could allow the recipient’s own muscle cells to produce the antibody for a prolonged period of time after a single injection, potentially providing extended protection against COVID-19 for periods of time that might provide an alternative to vaccines. Manufacturing of DNA plasmids (in bacterial fermenters) can be done with Sorrento’s in-house cGMP capabilities for a fraction of the cost associated with traditional antibody manufacturing.

“We are very encouraged by the preclinical data generated thus far by our STI-1499 neutralizing antibody against COVID-19,” said Henry Ji, Ph.D., CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “We are excited about the prospect of leveraging SmartPharm’s Gene Mab platform in combination with our G-MAB library to produce next-generation gene-encoded antibody candidates against a host of pathogens and cancer cell types. Being able to stimulate the body to produce in vivo our most potent antibodies at optimized manufacturing costs will offer an additional competitive advantage as Sorrento transitions from product development to full scale manufacturing and commercialization.”

● AstraZeneca to pay Daiichi Sankyo up to $6 billion in total consideration, including a $1 billion upfront payment and up to an additional $5 billion contingent upon achievement of future regulatory and sales milestones

 

Tokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ – (July 27, 2020) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) announced today that it has entered into a global development and commercialization agreement with AstraZeneca (LSE, STO, NYSE: AZN) for Daiichi Sankyo’s DS-1062, a TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), currently in phase 1 clinical development for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

 

Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca will jointly develop and commercialize DS-1062 worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo will manufacture and supply DS-1062.

 

This agreement represents the second global ADC collaboration between the two companies following a similar agreement in March 2019 for Daiichi Sankyo’s ENHERTU®, a HER2 directed DXd ADC.

 

“DS-1062, one of our lead DXd ADCs that will form a pillar of our next mid-term business plan, has the potential to become a best-in-class TROP2 ADC in multiple tumors, including lung and breast cancers,” said Sunao Manabe, Representative Director, President and CEO of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited. “This new strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca, a company with extensive experience and significant expertise in the global oncology business, will enable us to deliver DS-1062 to more patients around the world as quickly as possible. As we have done with ENHERTU, we will jointly design and implement strategies to maximize the value of DS-1062.”

 

“We see significant potential in this antibody drug conjugate in lung as well as in breast and other cancers that commonly express TROP2,” said Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca. “We are delighted to enter this new collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo and to build on the successful launch of ENHERTU to further expand our pipeline and leadership in oncology. We now have six potential blockbusters in oncology with more to come in our early and late pipelines.”

 

Financial Terms

Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo an upfront payment of $1 billion, of which $350 million is due upon execution, $325 million after 12 months and $325 million after 24 months. Contingent payments of up to $5 billion include $1 billion for achievement of future regulatory milestones, and $4 billion for sales-related milestones. Total payments under the agreement have the potential to reach up to $6 billion.

 

Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca will share equally development and commercialization costs as well as profits from DS-1062 worldwide, except for Japan. Daiichi Sankyo is expected to book sales in U.S., certain countries in Europe, and certain other markets where Daiichi Sankyo has affiliates. AstraZeneca is expected to book sales in other markets worldwide, including China, Australia, Canada and Russia.

 

The upfront payment and regulatory milestones will be booked as revenue over the period in which Daiichi Sankyo has contractual performance obligations under this collaboration. Impact on Daiichi Sankyo’s consolidated financials for fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 will be announced at an appropriate time in the future. The collaboration is expected to enhance the corporate and shareholder value for Daiichi Sankyo over the mid- to long-term.

 

About TROP2

TROP2 (trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many cancers including up to 80 percent of patients with triple negative breast cancer.[1],[2] High TROP2 expression also has been identified in a majority of NSCLCs.[3] Research indicates that high TROP2 expression is associated with cancer cell growth and proliferation and poor patient survival.[4] TROP2 is recognized as a promising molecular target for therapeutic development in various cancers.4

 

About DS-1062

DS-1062, a TROP2 directed ADC, is one of three lead DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo.

 

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, DS-1062 is comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker with a customized drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of four to optimize the benefit-risk ratio for the intended patient population.

 

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that DS-1062 selectively binds to the TROP2 receptor on the surface of a tumor cell. It is proposed that DS-1062 is then internalized into the cancer cell where lysosomal enzymes break down the tetrapeptide-based linker and release the DXd payload.

 

DS-1062 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to or relapsed from standard treatment or for whom no standard treatment is available. The study is currently enrolling patients with unresectable advanced NSCLC and unresectable/advanced or metastatic TNBC.

 

DS-1062 is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

 

About the Collaboration between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo

Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU (a HER2 directed ADC) in March 2019, and DS-1062 (a TROP2 directed ADC) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and DS-1062.

 

ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only) currently is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial, and is under accelerated assessment in the EU for a similar potential indication.

 

U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU

ENHERTU is a HER2 directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.

 

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

 

WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY

● Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.

● Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.

 

Contraindications
None.

 

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).

 

Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).

 

Neutropenia

Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.

 

Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.

 

Left Ventricular Dysfunction

Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.

 

Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.

 

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 
ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.

 

Adverse Reactions
The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).

 

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.

 

ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.

 

The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

 

Use in Specific Populations

● Pregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.

● Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.

● Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.

● Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.

● Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%).

● Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

 Equidacent will be available as 25 mg/ml as the solution for infusion targeting VEGF and act by inhibiting the binding of VEGF to its receptors on endothelial cell
 The company anticipates EC’s decision in ~60days. The clinical data demonstrated that Equidacent has comparable quality, safety, and efficacy to Avastin","On 23 July 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Equidacent, intended for the treatment of carcinoma of the colon or rectum, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, and carcinoma of the cervix. The applicant for this medicinal product is Centus Biotherapeutics Europe Limited.

Equidacent will be available as 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The active substance of Equidacent is bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody (ATC code: L01XC07) which binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, thereby inhibiting the binding of VEGF to its receptors on endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF regresses the vascularisation of tumours, normalises remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the formation of new tumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth.

Equidacent is a biosimilar medicinal product. It is highly similar to the reference product Avastin (bevacizumab), which was authorised in the EU on 12 January 2005. Data show that Equidacent has comparable quality, safety and efficacy to Avastin.

— Kite Becomes First Company with Multiple Approved CAR T Therapies —

SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to Tecartus™ (brexucabtagene autoleucel, formerly KTE-X19), the first and only approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The approval of this one-time therapy follows a priority review and FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and is based on results of ZUMA-2, a single-arm, open-label study in which 87 percent of patients responded to a single infusion of Tecartus, including 62 percent of patients achieving a complete response (CR). Among patients evaluable for safety, 18 percent experienced Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 37 percent experienced Grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicities.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200724005428/en/

“Despite promising advances, there are still major gaps in treatment for patients with MCL who progress following initial therapy,” said Michael Wang, MD, ZUMA-2 Lead Investigator and Professor, Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, Division of Cancer Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “Many patients have high-risk disease and are more likely to keep progressing, even after subsequent treatments. The availability of Tecartus as the first-ever cell therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory MCL provides an important option with a response rate of nearly 90 percent and early clinical evidence suggesting durable remissions in later lines of therapy.”

“Kite is committed to bringing the promise of CAR T therapy to patients with hematological cancers, and as such, we are proud to launch our second cell therapy,” said Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite. “I extend my thanks to the patient study participants, caregivers, clinical researchers, regulators and dedicated colleagues at Kite who helped make this approval possible, and we look forward to partnering with the lymphoma community to deliver this potentially transformative therapy to patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.”

Tecartus has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicities. A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) has been approved by the FDA for Tecartus and has been combined with the Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) REMS. The REMS program will inform and educate healthcare professionals about the risks associated with Tecartus therapy, and training and certification on the REMS program will be an integral part of the final authorization for centers offering Tecartus. Additional information about the REMS program can be found at www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com. Please see below for Important Safety Information.

MCL is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that arises from cells originating in the “mantle zone” of the lymph node and predominantly affects men over the age of 60. MCL is highly aggressive following relapse, with many patients progressing following therapy.

“This approval marks the first CAR T cell therapy approved for mantle cell lymphoma patients and represents a new frontier in the treatment of this disease,” said Meghan Gutierrez, Chief Executive Officer at the Lymphoma Research Foundation. “In the past decade, researchers have made significant progress in our understanding of this disease and we have seen an increase in clinical trials for patients, which we hope will continue to improve treatment strategies and the options available to people with mantle cell lymphoma. Today’s news builds upon this progress and provides hope to mantle cell patients and their loved ones.”

Tecartus will be manufactured in Kite’s commercial manufacturing facility in El Segundo, California. In the ZUMA-2 trial, Kite demonstrated a 96 percent manufacturing success rate and a median manufacturing turnaround time of 15 days from leukapheresis to product delivery. Manufacturing speed is especially critical for patients with advanced disease, who are very ill and at risk for quick progression.

Patients whose healthcare professionals have prescribed Tecartus therapy can work with Kite Konnect®, an integrated technology platform that provides information and assistance throughout the therapy process for Kite’s commercialized CAR T therapies, including courier tracking for shipments and manufacturing status updates. Kite Konnect provides support for eligible patients receiving Yescarta and Tecartus, and it provides information for the healthcare teams supporting their patients. Healthcare providers and patients can reach Kite Konnect at www.KiteKonnect.com or 1-844-454-KITE (1-844-454-5483).

KTE-X19 is currently under review in the European Union and has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency for relapsed or refractory MCL.

Tecartus Trial Results
The approval of Tecartus is supported by data from the ongoing, single arm, open-label ZUMA-2 pivotal trial. The study enrolled 74 adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL who had previously received anthracycline- or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 antibody therapy and a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per the Lugano Classification (2014), defined as the combined rate of CR and partial responses as assessed by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRRC).

In the study, 87 percent of patients (n=60 evaluable for efficacy analysis) responded to a single infusion of Tecartus, including 62 percent of patients who achieved a CR. Among all patients, follow-up was at least six months after their first objective disease response. Median duration of response has not yet been reached.

In the trial, 18 percent of patients (n=82 evaluable for safety) experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS and 37 percent experienced neurologic events. The most common (≥ 10 percent) Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, hypophosphatemia, encephalopathy, leukopenia, hypoxia, pyrexia, hyponatremia, hypertension, infection-pathogen unspecified, pneumonia, hypocalcemia and lymphopenia. The FDA approved Tecartus with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). The Tecartus REMS has been combined with the Yescarta REMS and is now called the “Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel) REMS Program” (www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com).

About Tecartus
Tecartus is an autologous, anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy. Tecartus uses the XLP™ manufacturing process that includes T cell enrichment, a necessary step in certain B-cell malignancies in which circulating lymphoblasts are a common feature. In addition to MCL, Tecartus is also currently in Phase 1/2 trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The use of Tecartus in ALL and CLL is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been established in these cancer types.

Tecartus Indication
Tecartus is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME and NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Tecartus. Do not administer Tecartus to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.
Neurologic toxicities, including life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Tecartus, including concurrently with CRS or after CRS resolution. Monitor for neurologic toxicities after treatment with Tecartus. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.
Tecartus is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS),including life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with Tecartus. In ZUMA-2, CRS occurred in 91% (75/82) of patients receiving Tecartus, including ≥ Grade 3 CRS in 18% of patients. Among the patients who died after receiving Tecartus, one had a fatal CRS event. The median time to onset of CRS was three days (range: 1 to 13 days) and the median duration of CRS was ten days (range: 1 to 50 days). Among patients with CRS, key manifestations (>10%) included fever (99%), hypotension (60%), hypoxia (37%), chills (33%), tachycardia (37%), headache (24%), fatigue (19%), nausea (13%), alanine aminotransferase increased (13%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (12%), and diarrhea (11%). Serious events associated with CRS included hypotension, fever, hypoxia, acute kidney injury, and tachycardia.

Ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient prior to infusion of Tecartus. Following infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS daily for at least seven days at the certified healthcare facility, and for four weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

Neurologic Toxicities, including those that were life-threatening, occurred following treatment with Tecartus. In ZUMA-2, neurologic events occurred in 81% of patients, 37% of whom experienced Grade ≥3 adverse reactions. The median time to onset for neurologic events was six days (range: 1 to 32 days). Neurologic events resolved for 52 out of 66 (79%) patients with a median duration of 21 days (range: 2 to 454 days). Three patients had ongoing neurologic events at the time of death, including one patient with serious encephalopathy. The remaining unresolved neurologic events were either Grade 1 or Grade 2. Fifty-four (66%) patients experienced CRS by the onset of neurological events. Five (6%) patients did not experience CRS with neurologic events and eight patients (10%) developed neurological events after the resolution of CRS. 85% of all treated patients experienced the first CRS or neurological event within the first seven days after Tecartus infusion.

The most common neurologic events (>10%) included encephalopathy (51%), headache (35%), tremor (38%), aphasia (23%), and delirium (16%). Serious events including encephalopathy, aphasia, and seizures occurred.

Monitor patients daily for at least seven days at the certified healthcare facility and for four weeks following infusion for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities and treat promptly.

REMS Program: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Tecartus is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that:

Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Tecartus must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements. Certified healthcare facilities must have on-site, immediate access to tocilizumab, and ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available for each patient for infusion within two hours after Tecartus infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS.
Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe, dispense, or administer Tecartus are trained in the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities. Further information is available at www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com or 1-844-454-KITE (5483).
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or residual gentamicin in Tecartus.

Severe Infections: Severe or life-threatening infections occurred in patients after Tecartus infusion. In ZUMA-2, infections (all grades) occurred in 56% of patients. Grade 3 or higher infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, occurred in 30% of patients. Tecartus should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to local guidelines.

Febrile neutropenia was observed in 6% of patients after Tecartus infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.

Viral Reactivation
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

Prolonged Cytopenias: Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Tecartus infusion. In ZUMA-2, Grade ≥3 cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Tecartus infusion occurred in 55% of patients and included thrombocytopenia (38%), neutropenia (37%), and anemia (17%). Monitor blood counts after infusion.

Hypogammaglobulinemia and B-cell aplasia can occur in patients receiving treatment with Tecartus. In ZUMA-2, hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 16% of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with Tecartus and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Tecartus treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least six weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with Tecartus.

Secondary Malignancies may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that it occurs, contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Tecartus infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this period.

Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) were pyrexia, CRS, hypotension, encephalopathy, fatigue, tachycardia, arrhythmia, infection – pathogen unspecified, chills, hypoxia, cough, tremor, musculoskeletal pain, headache, nausea, edema, motor dysfunction, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dyspnea, rash, insomnia, pleural effusion, and aphasia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 66% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (> 2%) were encephalopathy, pyrexia, infection – pathogen unspecified, CRS, hypoxia, aphasia, renal insufficiency, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, bacterial infections, dyspnea, fatigue, arrhythmia, tachycardia, and viral infections.

GAITHERSBURG, Md., July 27, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (NYSE:EBS) today announced that it has signed an agreement to provide contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services for large-scale commercial drug substance manufacturing for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, AZD1222. The agreement is valued at approximately $174 million through 2021 and follows an $87 million contract in June for development services, performance and process qualification, raw materials and an initial capacity reservation.

“Emergent is driven by our desire to advance solutions that will make an impact on this pandemic,” said Robert G. Kramer Sr., president and chief executive officer of Emergent BioSolutions. “Sharing a passion for science, we are encouraged by AstraZeneca’s investigational COVID-19 vaccine and look forward to supporting its continued progress.”

The adenovirus vector-based vaccine candidate, AZD1222, was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech, and licensed by AstraZeneca. The vaccine candidate is currently in clinical trials. It is one of the candidates funded and supported by Operation Warp Speed (OWS), the U.S. government’s program to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 medical countermeasures that aims to have substantial quantities of a safe and effective vaccine available.

Syed T. Husain, senior vice president and CDMO business unit head at Emergent, stated, “As COVID-19 vaccine candidates progress through the pipeline, Emergent stands ready alongside leading innovators to rapidly deploy our CDMO services to help meet the substantial demand for a vaccine – anchored on our foundational expertise in development and manufacturing and propelled by our commitment to our mission – to protect and enhance life.”

This agreement follows and is in addition to the landmark public-private CDMO partnership between Emergent and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) announced in June to pave the way for OWS high-priority innovators.

Activities under this agreement will be performed at Emergent’s Baltimore Bayview facility, where certain manufacturing capacity reserved by BARDA through the CDMO task order issued to Emergent under OWS will be used. Emergent’s Baltimore Bayview facility is a designated Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) designed for rapid manufacturing of large quantities of vaccines and treatments during public health emergencies.

The CIADM has unique capabilities across four independent suites to produce at clinical scale to get candidates rapidly into the clinic, while at the same time scaling up to enable large-scale manufacturing to up to 4000L to prepare for production of commercial volumes to meet customer demand. The CIADM has the capacity to produce tens to hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine on an annual basis, based upon the platform technology being used.

Financial Considerations
The company will provide an update to its 2020 financial outlook incorporating expectations related to this agreement and any other relevant information when it reports its second quarter financial results on July 30, 2020.

Emergent’s Response to COVID-19
Emergent BioSolutions is deploying its decades of experience in vaccine and hyperimmune development and manufacturing, as well as its molecule-to-market contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services to provide comprehensive medical countermeasure solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using its established hyperimmune platforms, Emergent is developing two investigational plasma-based treatments – COVID-Human Immune Globulin (COVID-HIG) and COVID-Equine Immune Globulin (COVID-EIG). COVID-HIG is being developed as a human plasma-derived therapy candidate with $14.5 million in HHS funding and will be evaluated in two studies of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, for potential treatment of COVID-19 in severe hospitalized and high-risk patients. With $34.6 million in funding from the Department of Defense and in collaboration with the Mount Sinai Health System and ImmunoTek Bio Centers, COVID-HIG will also be evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis in populations at high risk of COVID-19, such as front-line health care workers and the military. COVID-EIG is being developed as an equine plasma-derived therapy candidate for potential treatment of severe disease in humans. Both candidates are anticipated to be in Phase 2 clinical studies in 2020. These investigational products are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and their safety and effectiveness have not been established.

Emergent is deploying its CDMO capabilities, capacities, and expertise to support the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed to pave the way for innovators to advance COVID-19 programs. The company is working with four innovators to develop and manufacture COVID-19 vaccine candidates. For the COVID-19 vaccine response, Emergent’s integrated CDMO network provides development services from its Gaithersburg facility, drug substance manufacturing at its Baltimore Bayview facility, and drug product manufacturing at its Baltimore Camden and Rockville facilities, all in Maryland.

For 22 years Emergent has focused on advancing public health, and its multi-pronged approach to tackling COVID-19 demonstrates its commitment to its mission – to protect and enhance life.

40702,AstraZeneca Report Results of Farxiga in P-III DAPA-CKD Study for Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease,Farxiga met all primary and secondary endpoints in groundbreaking Phase III DAPA-CKD trial for the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease,"The P-III DAPA-CKD involve assessing of Farxiga ((dapagliflozin, 10mg, qd) + SOC vs PBO in 4,304 patients with CKD Stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D
 The study met its 1EPs i.e. worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite of an eGFR decline ≥50%, the onset of ESKD and death from CV/ renal cause) and 2EPs i.e. time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, ESKD, and renal death
 Farxiga (PO, qd) is an SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monothx. and combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control, weight loss and BP reduction","This announcement contains inside information
28 July 2020 07:00 BST

Farxiga significantly reduced the worsening of renal function or risk of death in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type-2 diabetes
High-level results from Farxiga’s (dapagliflozin) Phase III DAPA-CKD trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on its primary endpoint of a composite of worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite endpoint of ≥50% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), onset of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) or cardiovascular (CV) or renal death) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The trial also met all its secondary endpoints in CKD patients with and without type-2 diabetes (T2D), making Farxiga the first medicine to significantly reduce the risk of death from any cause in this patient population.

CKD is a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function affecting nearly 700 million people worldwide,1,2 many of them still undiagnosed.3,4 Currently there are limited treatment options for these patients.5 CKD is associated with significant patient morbidity and an increased risk of CV events,6 such as heart failure (HF) and premature death.7

The co-chairs of the trial and its Executive Committee Prof. David Wheeler, University College London, and Prof. Hiddo L. Heerspink, University Medical Center Groningen, said: “The DAPA-CKD trial has shown dapagliflozin’s potential as a long-awaited new treatment option for patients with chronic kidney disease. The data will be transformative for these patients.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “DAPA-CKD is the first trial to demonstrate overwhelming efficacy, including improvement on survival, in chronic kidney disease patients both with and without type-2 diabetes. We look forward to sharing these exciting Farxiga results with the scientific community and health authorities worldwide.”

The safety and tolerability profile for Farxiga was consistent with the well-established safety profile of the medicine.

The full DAPA-CKD trial results will be submitted for presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting.

In March 2020, AstraZeneca announced that the DAPA-CKD trial was being stopped early following a recommendation from an independent Data Monitoring Committee based on its determination of overwhelming efficacy.

Additionally, in May 2020, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hospitalisation for heart failure (hHF) in adults with HF (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with and without T2D. Farxiga is also under review with the European Medicines Agency, as well as in other regions, for the treatment of patients with HF.

Chronic kidney disease

CKD can be a serious, progressive condition defined by decreased kidney function (shown by reduced eGFR or markers of kidney damage, or both, for at least three months).1 The most common causes of CKD are diabetes, hypertension and glomerulonephritis.8 In its most severe form, known as ESKD, kidney damage and deterioration of kidney function have progressed to the stage where dialysis or kidney transplantation are required.9 The majority of patients with CKD will die from CV causes before reaching ESKD.10

DAPA-CKD

DAPA-CKD is an international, multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded trial in 4,304 patients designed to evaluate the efficacy of Farxiga 10mg, compared with placebo, in patients with CKD Stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D. Farxiga is given once daily in addition to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is worsening of renal function or risk of death (defined as a composite of an eGFR decline ≥50%, onset of ESKD and death from CV or renal cause). The secondary endpoints included the time to first occurrence of the renal composite (sustained ≥50% eGFR decline, ESKD and renal death), the composite of CV death or hHF, and death from any cause. The trial was conducted in 21 countries.

Farxiga

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, Farxiga reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for HF or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care.

Farxiga is currently being tested for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) trials. Farxiga will also be tested in patients without T2D following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack in the DAPA-MI trial – a first of its kind, indication-seeking registry-based randomised controlled trial. Farxiga has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.

Zebra Medical’s algorithm empowers breast radiologists by prioritizing and identifying suspicious mammograms, providing a safety net for radiologists. The suspicious mammograms are identified faster and read earlier than the current “first-in first-out” standard of care.

“Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthMammo may help radiologists deal with the screening management strategy of the post COVID backlog and triaging.”

This is Zebra Medical Vision’s first solution for Oncology to receive FDA clearance, as part of the company’s AI1 “All-In-One” bundle. Zebra Medical is also the first startup to receive FDA clearances for AI based technology across three imaging modalities – CT, x-ray and mammography, providing coverage for roughly 80% of the total imaging volumes.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women, impacting 2.1 million women worldwide each year and causing the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. It is estimated that 627,000 women died from breast cancer in 2018, approximately 15 percent of all cancer-related female deaths. While breast cancer rates are higher among women in more developed regions, rates are increasing in nearly every region globally1.

Zebra Medical’s HealthMammo solution is an automatic AI tool that indicates “suspicious” or “not suspicious” for every 2D mammography performed. The mammograms are automatically sent to Zebra Medical’s imaging analytics platform, where they are processed and analyzed for suspected breast lesions. The HealthMammo product then returns its result to the radiologist, either by signaling within the worklist or by notifying the user in a dedicated application.

The algorithm can be used in single reader paradigms, supporting triage and workflow improvement (as cleared by the FDA) or in double reading paradigms, already available outside of the US, supporting the second radiologists and reducing their workload.

Supporting early detection protocols, Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthMammo product helps health providers minimize the COVID-19-induced care gaps with an automated AI tool that can identify faster patients with suspicious lesions. According to the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Mammography Quality Standards program (MQSA), approximately 40 million mammograms are performed in the U.S. every year. With the outbreak of coronavirus, annual mammography tests during lockdown were postponed or canceled. As a result, providers are dealing with substantial growing backlogs, as 100,000 screens are added every day in the US alone2, in addition to a 94% drop in mammography imaging volumes during lockdown3. Patients are experiencing increasing anxiety waiting to be tested and run the risk of missing the early detection component of annual screening which could result in an undetected cancer that keeps growing.

“As restrictions are lifted from the COVID-19 crisis, the backlog of mammograms has increased,” says Dr. Michael Fishman, Breast Imaging Section Chief at Boston Medical Center (BMC), Massachusetts. “Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthMammo may help radiologists deal with the screening management strategy of the post COVID backlog and triaging.”

“Our work is twofold: supporting the medical team’s overload and ensuring the well-being of patients, by supporting early detection and reducing the anxiety surrounding uncertainty,” says Ohad Arazi, CEO of Zebra Medical Vision. “The fact that during initial testings we were able to identify 2 cases that were missed, and to have these women be recalled and diagnosed with cancer, shows the vast impact and potential contribution of AI in Oncology. With this fully commercial and regulated product, we aim to provide even more value and help patients and providers navigate the new COVID effected reality we are all facing. We’re proud of the achievements we’ve made in the past few months, providing U.S. healthcare with a growing portfolio of automatic solutions to enhance patient care, especially during these times.”

UCB continues to develop UCB0107 in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), with a confirmatory phase 3 study due to commence in Q2 2021.

About UCB0107

UCB0107 is a recombinant, humanized, full-length IgG4 monoclonal antibody, targeting a central Tau epitope, which is being developed to block/reduce the spread of Tau pathology.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein expressed in the central nervous system, which supports the assembly and stabilization of neuronal microtubules.[1] In tauopathies, Tau becomes pathogenic, forming tangles, which cause cell damage and ultimately neuronal death.[1.2.3] It is hypothesised that the spread of Tau protein from neuron to neuron underpins disease progression in tauopathies[4] providing the rationale for antibody therapies.

Forward looking statements UCB

This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’ efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB’s data and systems.

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.

UCB is providing this information, including forward-looking statements, only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release, either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

Additionally, information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

 Sanofi leads the clinical development and registration of the vaccine and expects a P-I/II study to be initiated in Sept’2020, followed by a P-III study by the end of 2020. Additionally, the companies are expecting the approval in H1’21
 The vaccine is deploying Sanofi’s S-protein COVID-19 antigen together with GSK’s adjuvant technology. Both the companies are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to 1B doses per year","Agreement relates to vaccine candidate using Sanofi’s recombinant protein-based technology combined with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system
Both companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine candidate affordable and available globally
Ongoing discussions with the European Commission, with France and Italy on the negotiation team, and other governments to ensure global access to a novel coronavirus vaccine
PARIS and LONDON – July 29, 2020 – Sanofi and GSK have reached an agreement, subject to final contract, with the UK government for the supply of up to 60 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidate, developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on the recombinant protein-based technology used by Sanofi to produce an influenza vaccine, and GSK’s established pandemic adjuvant technology.

“With our partner GSK, we are pleased to cooperate with the UK government as well as several other countries and global organizations as part of our ongoing efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine and make it available as quickly as possible. We greatly appreciate the UK government’s support of this shared vision,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur.

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added, “We believe that this adjuvanted vaccine candidate has the potential to play a significant role in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the UK and around the world. We thank the UK Government for confirmation of purchasing intent, which supports the significant investment we are already making as a company to scale up development and production of this vaccine.”

Sanofi is leading the clinical development and registration of the COVID-19 vaccine and expects a Phase 1/2 study to start in September, followed by a Phase 3 study by the end of 2020. If the data are positive, regulatory approval could be achieved by the first half of 2021. In parallel, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to one billion doses per year overall.

UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: “Our scientists and researchers are racing to find a safe and effective vaccine at a speed and scale never seen before. While this progress is truly remarkable, the fact remains that there are no guarantees.”

“In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a diverse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works so we can protect the public and save lives.” 

Kate Bingham, Chair of the UK Government’s Vaccines Taskforce, said: “Through this agreement with GSK and Sanofi, the Vaccine Taskforce can add another type of vaccine to the three different types of vaccine we have already secured. 

“This diversity of vaccine types is important because we do not yet know which, if any, of the different types of vaccine will prove to generate a safe and protective response to COVID-19. Whilst this agreement is very good news, we mustn’t be complacent or over optimistic.” 

“The fact remains we may never get a vaccine and if we do get one, we have to be prepared that it may not be a vaccine which prevents getting the virus, but rather one that reduces symptoms.” 

Sanofi and GSK are committed to making the vaccine available globally

Active discussions on supply of the vaccine are ongoing with global organizations, the U.S. and the EU Commission, with France and Italy on the negotiation team. The partners plan to provide a significant portion of total worldwide available supply capacity in 2021/22 to the global initiative, “Access to COVID‐19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator”, a global collaboration of leaders of governments, global health organizations, businesses and philanthropies to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

On the front lines in the fight against COVID-19

In addition to the recombinant protein-based vaccine in collaboration with GSK, Sanofi is also developing a messenger RNA vaccine candidate in partnership with Translate Bio. With several innovative vaccine platforms currently being investigated across the industry, mRNA is considered among the most promising. Sanofi expects a Phase 1 study to start by the end of the year, and, if the data are positive, an approval at the earliest in the second half of 2021​. Translate Bio has established mRNA manufacturing capacity and Sanofi expects to be able to supply annual capacity of 90 to 360 million doses.

 MK-6482 (formerly PT2977) is an investigational oral HIF-2α inhibitor, currently being evaluated in a P-III trial in advanced RCC (NCT04195750), a P-II trial in VHL-associated RCC (NCT03401788), and a P-I/II dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial in advanced solid tumors, including advanced RCC (NCT02974738)","Reinforces Important Progress in Merck’s Oncology Pipeline to Advance Novel Therapeutic Candidates

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to the hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α) inhibitor MK-6482, a novel investigational candidate in Merck’s oncology pipeline, for the treatment of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC)with nonmetastatic RCC tumors less than three centimeters in size, unless immediate surgery is required. The FDA also granted orphan drug designation to MK-6482 for VHL disease. These designations are based on data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating MK-6482 in patients with VHL-associated clear cell RCC, which were presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.

“Merck’s diverse and expansive oncology pipeline is focused on bringing forward innovative new treatments to patients in need and continues to show important progress,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “These designations for MK-6482 support the potential of targeting HIF-2α in certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease, who currently have limited treatment options and face an increased risk for benign tumors as well as several types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma.”

The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is granted to expedite the development and review of medicines that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that have demonstrated preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the medicine may provide a substantial improvement over available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint. The FDA’s orphan drug designation is granted to medicines that are intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.

About MK-6482

MK-6482 (formerly PT2977) is an investigational, novel, potent, selective, oral HIF-2α inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial in advanced RCC (NCT04195750), a Phase 2 trial in VHL-associated RCC (NCT03401788), and a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial in advanced solid tumors, including advanced RCC (NCT02974738). Proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors, including HIF-2α, can accumulate in patients when VHL, a tumor-suppressor protein, is inactivated. The accumulation of HIF-2α can lead to the formation of both benign and malignant tumors. This inactivation of VHL has been observed in more than 90% of ccRCC tumors. Research into VHL biology that led to the discovery of HIF-2α was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2019.

About Von Hippel-Lindau Disease and Renal Cell Carcinoma

Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare genetic disease that affects one in 36,000 people (200,000 cases worldwide and 10,000 cases in the U.S. alone). Patients with VHL disease are at risk for benign blood vessel tumors as well as several cancers, including RCC. As many as 60% of people with VHL disease develop RCC, which is a leading cause of death for patients with VHL disease.

Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs, and about seven of 10 RCCs are clear cell. Worldwide, it is estimated there were about 403,000 cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and about 175,000 deaths from the disease in 2018. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated there will be nearly 74,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and almost 15,000 deaths from the disease in 2020.

Merck’s Focus on Cancer

Our goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck, the potential to bring new hope to people with cancer drives our purpose and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment.

40708,Roche's Tecentriq + Cotellic and Zelboraf Receives the US FDA's Approval for Patients with Advanced Melanoma,FDA approves Roche’s Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf for people with advanced melanoma,"The approval is based on P-III IMspire150 study assessing Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Cotellic (cobimetinib) + Zelboraf (vemurafenib) vs PBO + Cotellic + Zelboraf in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma
 Results: mPFS (15.1 vs 10.6mos.); the safety profile of the Tecentriq combination was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines. The review was conducted under Project Orbis
 Tecentriq is a mAb targeting PD-L1, acts by blocking is its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptor. Cotellic is a MEK1/2 inhibitor in a cell signaling pathway that helps control cell growth and survival while Zelboraf is a prescription medicine for melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery and has a BRAF V600 mutation","Basel, 31 July 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) plus Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma patients. The safety profile observed in the Tecentriq combination was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines.

The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Tecentriq was granted under priority review. The review was also conducted under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners.

“When receiving a cancer immunotherapy combined with targeted therapies, patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma were able to live for more than 15 months without their disease worsening,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Genentech’s chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Today’s FDA approval of this Tecentriq combination represents an important step forward for many patients living with advanced melanoma.”

The approval is based on results from the Phase III IMspire150 study, in which the addition of Tecentriq to Cotellic and Zelboraf helped people live longer without disease worsening or death compared to placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (median PFS 15.1 months versus 10.6 months respectively; hazard ratio, HR=0.78; confidence interval: 0.63-0.97; P=0.025). The most common adverse reactions (rate ≥20%) in patients who received Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf were rash (75%), musculoskeletal pain (62%), fatigue (51%), hepatotoxicity (50%), pyrexia (49%), nausea (30%), pruritus (26%), edema (26%), stomatitis (23%), hypothyroidism (22%), and photosensitivity reaction (21%).

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMspire150 study
IMspire150 is a Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study in people with previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. The study compared the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf to the combination of placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf. The primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS. Key secondary endpoints include PFS by an independent review committee, overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response and other safety and pharmacokinetic measures.

Five hundred and fourteen adult patients took part in the study. Randomisation was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and geographic region. Eligible patients were randomised 1:1 to one of two treatment groups, to receive 28-day cycles of either: Tecentriq plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (the Tecentriq group) or Placebo plus Cotellic and Zelboraf (the control group). In cycle 1, all patients received once-daily oral Cotellic 60 mg plus twice-daily oral Zelboraf 960 mg for 21 days followed by twice-daily Zelboraf 720 mg or 960 mg for 7 days in the Tecentriq group or control group, respectively. Patients in the Tecentriq group received Zelboraf 720 mg Days 1–28 of each subsequent cycle. The lower 720 mg dose of Zelboraf in the Tecentriq group was a safety measure to mitigate the risk of overlapping toxicities, while ensuring an efficacious dose of Zelboraf. Treatment was continued until investigator-determined disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, patient or physician decision to withdraw, whichever occurred first.

About advanced melanoma
Melanoma is a less common, but more aggressive and potentially deadly form of skin cancer.1,2 When melanoma is diagnosed early, it is generally a curable disease,3,4 but most people with advanced melanoma have a poor prognosis.2 More than 287,000 people worldwide are currently diagnosed with melanoma each year.5 BRAF is mutated in approximately half of melanomas.6 In recent years, there have been significant advances in treatment for advanced melanoma and people with the disease have more options. However, it continues to be a serious health issue with a high medical need and a steadily increasing incidence over the past 30 years.7

About Tecentriq (atezolizumab)
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1. Tecentriq is designed to bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the re-activation of T cells. Tecentriq may also affect normal cells.

 The 1EPs of the study include OS, EFS, CR and transfusion independence, and AE profile. The designation addresses the needs of people living with HR-MDS, for whom few therapies exist, and the benefits are limited
 Pevonedistat is a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor. The pre-clinical studies demonstrated the inhibition of NAE, blocked the modification of select proteins, which resulted in the disruption of cell cycle progression and cell survival, leading to cancer cell death","– Designation Based on Phase 2 Data and Reinforces Significant Treatment Need for HR-MDS 

– Pevonedistat Could be First Novel Treatment Option for HR-MDS in More Than a Decade 

 

Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, Japan, July 30, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for its investigational drug pevonedistat for the treatment of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS). Pevonedistat, a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, could be the first novel treatment for HR-MDS patients in more than a decade, expanding treatment options that have so far been limited to hypomethylating agent (HMA) monotherapy alone. Even with current treatment options, outcomes for people living with HR-MDS remain poor.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on the final analysis of the Pevonedistat-2001 Phase 2 study, which evaluated pevonedistat plus azacitidine versus azacitidine alone in patients with rare leukemias, including HR-MDS. The FDA considered a number of endpoints, including overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), complete remission (CR) and transfusion independence, as well as the adverse event profile. This designation signals a potential advancement in addressing the needs of people living with HR-MDS, for whom few therapies exist and the benefits are limited.

“Higher-risk MDS is associated with poor prognosis, diminished quality of life and a higher chance of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, another aggressive cancer. The combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine is a promising therapeutic approach with the potential to be the first novel treatment advancement for higher-risk MDS in more than 10 years,” said Christopher Arendt, Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “We thank the FDA for recognizing pevonedistat, and the urgency to develop innovative therapies that address critical treatment needs for higher-risk MDS, a patient population with few options.”

Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. FDA is granted to accelerate the development and regulatory review of investigational drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening ailments. Agents with this designation have shown preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.

Takeda presented results of the Pevonedistat-2001 trial during oral sessions at the virtual 56th American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and virtual 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress.

 

About Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat is a first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor. In pre-clinical studies, the inhibition of NAE by pevonedistat blocked the modification of select proteins, which resulted in disruption of cell cycle progression and cell survival, leading to cancer cell death. Pevonedistat in combination with azacitidine demonstrated promising clinical activity in a Phase 2 study of patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS), higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (HR-CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a Phase 1 study of patients with AML. Pevonedistat is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 studies as a first-line treatment for patients with HR-MDS, HR-CMML and AML, who are ineligible (unfit) for transplant or intensive induction chemotherapy, and in a Phase 2 study in unfit AML in a triple combination with azacitidine and venetoclax. Pevonedistat is an investigational drug for which safety and efficacy have not been established.

About MDS
MDS is a rare form of bone marrow-related cancer caused by irregular blood cell production within the bone marrow. This cancer most commonly affects older patients, with the median age of diagnosis ranging from 60 to 74 years. As a result of this irregular production, a person with MDS does not have enough normal red blood cells, white blood cells and/or platelets in circulation. Symptoms for MDS are often vague and related to low blood counts, and may include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite, weakness, pale skin, fever and frequent or severe infections.

There are several classifications of MDS – very low-risk to very high-risk – determined by blood counts, blast counts, mutations and cytogenetics. Higher-risk disease is defined as intermediate, high or very high risk on the International Prognostic Scoring System – Revised (IPSS-R), and these patients have a poorer prognosis. Approximately 40% of patients with HR-MDS transform to AML, another aggressive cancer with poor outcomes.

About Herceptin (trastuzumab)
Herceptin® is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target and block the function of the HER2 receptor, a protein found on the outside of many normal cells and in high quantities on the outside of cancer cells in HER2-positive cancers. Herceptin binds to a specific section of the HER2 protein, inhibiting the signals it sends that encourage tumour cell growth, while also calling on the body’s immune system to attack the cancer cells.

Since it was first approved in 1998, Herceptin has been used to treat over two million patients worldwide, diagnosed with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. It has also become the backbone of other innovative treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer, which have continued to improve the outcomes of patients with this otherwise aggressive disease. In addition to the standard intravenous formulation, Herceptin is available in a subcutaneous (SC) formulation which was first approved in 2013. Herceptin SC represents a significant step forward in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer as it offers patients a faster, more convenient and less painful way to receive treatment with Herceptin.

40711,Sanofi and GSK Receive $2.1B from the US Government to Supply 100M Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine,Sanofi and GSK in advanced discussions with European Union to supply up to 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine,"The US government will provide ~$2.1B to support the development of the vaccine, including clinical trials with some amount to be used for ramping up the manufacturing and delivery of an initial 100M dose of the vaccine
 The US government has an option to supply an additional 500M dose and helps the government’s Operation Warp Speed goals for providing millions of doses of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine
 Additionally, the companies are in discussion with the EC for the supply of up to 300M doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Both the companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine affordable and available globally","Issued: London, UK and Paris, France

Discussions relate to vaccine candidate using Sanofi’s recombinant protein-based technology combined with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system
Both companies are committed to making their COVID-19 vaccine affordable and available globally
Sanofi and GSK are in advanced discussions with the European Commission (EC) for the supply of up to 300 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine candidate developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on the recombinant protein-based technology used by Sanofi to produce an influenza vaccine, and GSK’s established adjuvant technology. The doses would be manufactured in European countries including France, Belgium, Germany and Italy. This marks a key milestone in protecting and serving the European population against COVID-19.

“Today’s announcement helps to ensure that millions of Europeans will have access to a potential vaccine protecting against COVID-19, once proven safe and effective. It has been our steadfast commitment to provide a vaccine that is affordable and accessible to everyone, and we are grateful to the European Commission for their ongoing engagement and shared support of this effort,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “Together with GSK, we are working relentlessly to develop and produce a vaccine to address this global health crisis.”

Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added “GSK is proud to be working in partnership with Sanofi to make this vaccine available as soon as possible in Europe. Both companies have significant R&D and manufacturing capability in Europe and are already working hard to scale up production across our networks. This announcement from the EC supports our ongoing efforts.”

Sanofi is leading the clinical development and registration of the COVID-19 vaccine and expects a Phase 1/ 2 study to start in September, followed by a Phase 3 study by the end of 2020. If data are positive, regulatory approval could be achieved by the first half of 2021. In parallel, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing of the antigen and adjuvant to produce up to one billion doses per year overall.

Sanofi and GSK are committed to making the vaccine available globally
Sanofi and GSK recently signed agreements with the United States where they have a longstanding partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and also with the UK Government. The partners plan to provide a significant portion of total worldwide available supply capacity in 2021/22 to the global initiative “Access to COVID‐19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator,” a global collaboration of leaders of governments, global health organizations, businesses and philanthropies to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

GSK commitment to tackling COVID-19
GSK is collaborating with companies and research groups across the world working on promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates through the use of our innovative vaccine adjuvant technology. The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protecting more people. GSK does not expect to profit from COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic phase, and will invest any short-term profit in coronavirus related research and long-term pandemic preparedness, either through GSK internal investments or with external partners.

About GSK
GSK is a science-led global healthcare company with a special purpose: to help people do more, feel better, live longer. For further information please visit www.gsk.com/about-us.

About Sanofi
Sanofi is dedicated to supporting people through their health challenges. We are a global biopharmaceutical company focused on human health.

INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced the initiation of BLAZE-2, a Phase 3 trial studying LY-CoV555 for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities in the U.S. (skilled nursing facilities, commonly referred to as nursing homes, and assisted living facilities). LY-CoV555, the lead antibody from Lilly’s collaboration with AbCellera, is a neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 among residents of long-term care facilities combined with the higher mortality rate for the elderly creates the urgent need for therapies to prevent COVID-19 in this vulnerable population.

“COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on nursing home residents. We’re working as fast as we can to create medicines that might stop the spread of the virus to these vulnerable individuals. While it’s not easy to conduct clinical trials in this setting, we’re taking on the challenge in an effort to help those who need us the most,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We are grateful to the NIAID team for their exceptional partnership on this innovative trial and we are deeply appreciative of the care facilities, their staff and the many residents who will be participating in this important study.”

The Lilly-sponsored BLAZE-2 study is a first-of-its-kind COVID-19 trial and is being conducted in partnership with NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), along with the COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) and several long-term care facility networks across the country. The study will enroll residents and staff who live or work at facilities that have had a recently diagnosed case of COVID-19 and who are now at a high risk of exposure. It will evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY-CoV555 for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, testing whether a single dose of LY-CoV555 reduces the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 4 weeks, as well as complications of COVID-19 through 8 weeks. It is expected to enroll up to 2,400 participants.

“The mission of the COVID-19 Prevention Network is to conduct Phase 3 vaccine and monoclonal antibody efficacy studies for the prevention of COVID-19,” said Myron Cohen, M.D., director of UNC’s Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases and a CoVPN leader. “We’re excited to partner with Lilly to determine whether LY-CoV555 can prevent or mitigate progression of COVID-19 infection in this vulnerable population that has been greatly impacted by this virus.”

To address the challenging aspects of running a clinical trial in a long-term care facility during a pandemic, Lilly created customized mobile research units to support the on-site study. These units include a custom retrofitted recreational vehicle (RV) to support mobile labs and clinical trial material preparation, along with a trailer truck that will deliver all clinical trial supplies needed to create an on-site infusion clinic. To further minimize the burden on these facilities that normally do not conduct clinical trials, additional staff will be at the facilities to assist with the operations of the study. Lilly will deploy its mobile research unit fleet in response to outbreaks of the virus at long-term care facilities across the U.S.

“We commend Lilly and NIH in recognizing the critical need for developing medicines to combat the spread of the virus among some of the most vulnerable populations,” said Dr. Alexander Stemer, a board certified infectious disease expert and co-chair of Symphony Care Network’s COVID-19 task force. “As the scientific community searches for safe and effective therapies for COVID-19, we are proud to participate in this leading-edge study given its potential to save lives.”

Clinical investigators, hospitals or clinical sites interested in participating in one of Lilly’s clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 treatment should call 1-877-CT-LILLY (1-877-285-4559) or email covid19potentialsite@lilly.com. Patients interested in participating in one of Lilly’s clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 treatment should visit Lilly TrialGuide for information regarding eligibility for ongoing trials.

About LY-CoV555
LY-CoV555 is a potent, neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially preventing and treating COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and tested by the scientists at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed dosing of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628) and long-term follow-up is ongoing. BLAZE-1, a Phase 2 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (NCT04427501), is ongoing. Based on current trends, enrollment is estimated to be completed in September, with initial data readout soon thereafter followed by full data in Q4. LY-CoV555 has been well tolerated at all doses tested and no drug-related severe adverse events (SAEs) have been observed to date. Efficacy data are not yet available.

Lilly is committed to the rapid release of important scientific data. Large-scale manufacturing of this potential therapy continues, with the goal of having more than one hundred thousand doses available by the end of the year should LY-CoV555 prove to be a meaningful therapeutic option for COVID-19.

In the Phase 3 COLUMBA study published in The Lancet, DARZALEX® SC demonstrated a consistent overall response rate (ORR) and pharmacokinetics and a similar safety profile compared with IV DARZALEX® in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In addition, there was a nearly two-thirds reduction in systemic administration-related reactions (ARRs) for DARZALEX® SC compared to IV DARZALEX® (13 per cent vs. 34 per cent, respectively).3

“DARZALEX® has become a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, supported by a robust body of evidence in both the frontline and relapsed and refractory settings,” says Dr. Darrell White, Hematologist, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax. “With this new subcutaneous formulation, not only is treatment much more convenient for patients, but it will also play a very important role in reducing wait times and the burden on our busy healthcare system, especially during this time.”

The approval is based on data from the Phase 3 COLUMBA and Phase 2 PLEIADES studies.4,5 In the COLUMBA study, the ORR was non-inferior for patients taking DARZALEX® SC as monotherapy compared to those taking IV DARZALEX® as monotherapy (41 per cent vs. 37 per cent, respectively). 6 Additionally, in the Phase 2 PLEIADES study evaluating the efficacy and safety of DARZALEX® SC in combination therapies, objective responses were demonstrated in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP) in newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients. In addition, objective responses were demonstrated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) in relapsed or refractory patients who received one prior line of therapy.7 In a pooled safety population of 490 patients who received DARZALEX® SC as monotherapy or in combination, the ARR rate was 11 per cent.8

DARZALEX® SC is approved in all current IV indications including (1) in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, (2) in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy, (3) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy, and (4) as monotherapy, in patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.9

Active discussions are ongoing with public insurers to determine how DARZALEX® SC can be made accessible for both relapsed or refractory patients as well as newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible patients.

“This approval exemplifies Janssen’s mission and commitment to bringing together passion, science and ingenuity to advance novel solutions for patients,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC.

About the COLUMBA Study
The randomised, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 COLUMBA study included 522 patients (median age of 67 years) with multiple myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), or whose disease was refractory to both a PI and an ImiD. In the arm that received DARZALEX® SC (n=263), patients received a fixed dose of DARZALEX® SC 1,800 milligrams (mg), co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) 2,000 Units per milliliter (U/mL), subcutaneously weekly for Cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for Cycles 3 – 6 and every four weeks for Cycle 7 and thereafter. In the IV DARZALEX® arm (n=259), patients received DARZALEX® for IV infusion 16 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) weekly for Cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for Cycles 3 – 6 and every four weeks for Cycle 7 and thereafter. Each cycle was 28 days. In the arm that received DARZALEX® SC, it was given in a fixed volume of 15 mL over three to five minutes; the median injection time was five minutes. In the arm that received the IV administration, the median durations of the first, second and subsequent IV DARZALEX® infusions were 7.0, 4.3 and 3.4 hours, respectively. Patients in both arms continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.10,11

About the PLEIADES Study
The non-randomised, open-label, parallel assignment Phase 2 PLEIADES study included adults with multiple myeloma, including 67 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were treated with 1,800 mg of DARZALEX® SC in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) and 65 patients with relapsed or refractory disease who were treated with 1,800 mg of DARZALEX® SC plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd). The primary endpoint for the D-VMP and D- Rd cohorts was overall response rate.12

About DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC
DARZALEX® is the first CD38-directed monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved to treat multiple myeloma and in 2020, DARZALEX® SC (daratumumab) follows as the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with multiple myeloma.13 It binds to CD38, a surface protein highly expressed across multiple myeloma cells.14 DARZALEX® induces tumor cell death through cell lysis via multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).15 DARZALEX® has also demonstrated immunomodulatory effects such as increasing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells counts, which may contribute to clinical response.16

In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize DARZALEX®. Janssen Inc. commercializes DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC in Canada. For full Prescribing Information and more information about DARZALEX® and DARZALEX® SC, please visit www.janssen.com/canada.

About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.17 When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow. In 2020, it is estimated that 3,400 Canadians will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and there will be 1,600 deaths associated with the disease.18 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms in the early stages, patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone disease or pain, anemia, calcium elevation, and kidney problems.19

The vaccine will be provided at a global not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use","Company working to ensure broad global access to COVID-19 vaccine candidate, following approval from regulators

NEW BRUNSWICK, New Jersey, Aug. 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced its Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies have entered into an agreement with the U.S. government for the large scale domestic manufacturing and delivery in the U.S. of 100 million doses of Janssen’s SARS-CoV-2 investigational vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, for use in the United States following approval or Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, is committing over $1 billion for this agreement. The vaccine will be provided at a global not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The U.S. government may also purchase an additional 200 million doses of Ad26.COV2.S under a subsequent agreement.

“Johnson & Johnson’s global team of experts has worked tirelessly alongside BARDA and scientific partners to pursue a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that can help to stop the spread of COVID-19. We greatly appreciate the U.S. government’s confidence in, and support for, our R&D platform and efforts and the scalability of our vaccine technology. We are scaling up production in the U.S. and worldwide to deliver a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for emergency use,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson.

Johnson & Johnson’s efforts to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been undertaken pursuant to an ongoing research and development collaboration with BARDA and under the oversight of the FDA. Based on the positive preclinical data recently published in the peer reviewed journal Nature, the Phase 1/2a first-in-human clinical trial of the vaccine candidate, Ad26.COV2.S, is underway in healthy volunteers in the United States and Belgium.

The Company is evaluating one- and two-dose regimens, in its clinical program and working diligently to ensure broad, global access to the vaccine following approval or authorization by regulators. Johnson & Johnson aims to meet its goal to supply more than one billion doses globally through the course of 2021, provided the vaccine is safe and effective.

Johnson & Johnson’s SARS-CoV-2 vaccine program leverages Janssen’s AdVac® technology. The same technology was used to develop Janssen’s European Commission-approved Ebola vaccine and construct its HIV, RSV and Zika vaccine candidates. More than 90,000 individuals have been vaccinated to date using the Janssen AdVac®-based platform.

August 04, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
OAKLAND, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Eko today announced a global collaboration with AstraZeneca to accelerate the development of digital health tools for the earlier screening of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure.

“Eko’s collaboration with AstraZeneca will allow us to expand the capability of our technology, generate real-world data, and explore disease management solutions while leveraging AstraZeneca’s global expertise and existing relationships across the treatment continuum for heart failure.”

Through the collaboration, AstraZeneca and Eko will explore accelerating the development of Eko algorithms, enhancing clinical trials with Eko technology and potentially building new heart failure detection solutions.

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, affecting approximately 64 million people worldwide. Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood into the body and is most commonly detected by echocardiogram imaging tests that are not normally conducted during a physical exam. Because of the limited access to echocardiography or other diagnostic tests, heart failure is frequently diagnosed late, making life-prolonging treatment more challenging. Heart failure remains as fatal as some of the most common cancers and is the leading cause of hospitalization for those over the age of 65, representing a significant clinical and economic burden.

Joris Silon, Senior Vice President, Cardiovascular Renal and Metabolism, AstraZeneca, said, “There are millions of people living with or at risk for heart failure. AstraZeneca’s collaboration with Eko will tap into cutting-edge digital health technologies that could allow us to harness the potential to improve access to individualized care and generate better patient outcomes.”

Over the past year, Eko has made significant advances in improving the detection of heart failure at the point of care. In December 2019, Eko announced FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for a novel ECG-based algorithm that can identify reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), a measure commonly used to diagnose patients with heart failure. This algorithm, when cleared by the FDA, will be compatible with the DUO, Eko’s handheld stethoscope and ECG device. By leveraging artificial intelligence, everyday in-office exams can be turned into a powerful, accessible screening tool.

“Eko was founded to provide a better way to understand our heart and lung health and to improve cardiopulmonary care for patients through digital technology and novel algorithms,” said Connor Landgraf, CEO and co-founder of Eko. “Eko’s collaboration with AstraZeneca will allow us to expand the capability of our technology, generate real-world data, and explore disease management solutions while leveraging AstraZeneca’s global expertise and existing relationships across the treatment continuum for heart failure.”

40721,Novartis Reports Results of Ofatumumab (OMB157) in P-III ASCLEPIOS Trials for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,Novartis announces NEJM publication of Phase III ASCLEPIOS trials demonstrating superior efficacy of ofatumumab in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis,"The two P-III studies, ASCLEPIOS I & II involves assessing of ofatumumab (20mg, monthly SC) vs teriflunomide (14mg) in 1882 patients aged 18-55yrs with MS and EDDS score b/w 0 and 5.5. The studies were conducted across 37 countries in 350+ sites 
 Results of ASCLEPIOS I & II: 51% & 58% reduction in ARR (0.11 vs 0.22 & 0.10 vs 0.25); reduction Gd+T1 lesions (97% & 94%); reduction in new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% & 85%); superior in reducing neuroaxonal damage in both studies, as measured by NfL serum concentrations; 34% and 32% risk reduction in 3mos. and 6mos. CDW; favorable trend in rate of 6mos. CDI; no difference in annual rate of brain volume loss
 Ofatumumab (SC, once monthly) is a CD20 mAb, targeting CD20 molecule on the B-cell surface and inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion with its anticipated US FDA’s approval in Sept’20 and in EU by Q2’21","Ofatumumab is a targeted B-cell therapy that delivers superior efficacy with a similar safety profile when compared with teriflunomide, a commonly prescribed oral treatment for multiple sclerosis1
ASCLEPIOS I and II demonstrated significant reductions in risk of relapses, confirmed disability worsening and profound reduction of active or new brain lesions1
The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency are currently reviewing ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults
If approved, ofatumumab will be the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home and has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for use in RMS patients 
Basel, August 5, 2020 — Novartis today announced that The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published the positive results from the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab (OMB157) 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). Both studies met the primary endpoints where ofatumumab showed a significant reduction in the number of confirmed relapses, evaluated as the annualized relapse rate (ARR)1.

“ASCLEPIOS I and II demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab and its potential to become a first-choice treatment option that offers RMS patients the flexibility as they continue to live their lives,” said Krishnan Ramanathan, Neuroscience Global Program Head at Novartis. “Ofatumumab is a testament to our commitment to advance science and investigate potential treatments that reimagine care and address significant unmet needs at all parts of the RMS journey.”

Results from the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies showed that compared with teriflunomide, ofatumumab:

Significantly reduced the ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 58% (0.10 vs 0.25) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (P<.001 in both studies) (primary endpoints)1
Showed a relative risk reduction of 34% (P=.002) in 3-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW) and 32% (P=.01) in 6-month CDW in a pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS (disability-related secondary endpoints)1
Showed significant reduction of both gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) T1 lesions with a 97% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, (both P<.001), and an 82% and 85% relative reduction in new or enlarging T2 lesions in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (both P<.001) (MRI-related secondary endpoints)1
Showed superiority in reducing neuroaxonal damage in both studies, as measured by neurofilament light chain (NfL) serum concentrations (biomarker secondary endpoint)1; axonal loss, which begins at disease onset, is a detrimental consequence of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and is a major determinant of irreversible neurological disability in MS patients2
Demonstrated a favorable trend in rate of 6-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI) events but did not reach significance (disability-related secondary endpoint)1
Showed the annual rate of brain volume loss was not significantly different (MRI-related secondary endpoint)1
Demonstrated an overall safety profile similar to teriflunomide, the frequency of serious infections and neoplasms was similar across both treatment groups. Injection-related reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly observed adverse events across both treatment groups, occurring in ≥10% of patients1,3
“The ASCLEPIOS studies found that ofatumumab produced a significant reduction in new inflammation, as well as fewer clinical relapses and progression events,” said Professor Stephen L. Hauser, Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and co-chair of the steering committee for the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies. “A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated that nearly 9 out of 10 patients experienced no evidence of disease activity in the second year of treatment4. Ofatumumab represents a potential new option for RMS patients with greater efficacy compared to teriflunomide, a comparable safety profile, and the convenience of once monthly self-administration without the need for infusions.”

These data were published in the August 6, 2020 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

In February, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted the company’s Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults. If approved, ofatumumab will be the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home and has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for use in RMS patients.

Regulatory approval for ofatumumab in the US is expected in September 2020 and in Europe by Q2 2021. Novartis is committed to bringing ofatumumab to patients worldwide and additional regulatory filings are currently underway.

About ofatumumab
Ofatumumab (OMB157) is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in development for RMS that is self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,3. As shown in preclinical studies, ofatumumab is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion5. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen6. Once-monthly dosing of ofatumumab also allows faster repletion of B-cells and offers flexibility7. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 20158.

About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies
The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.51. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries9. Ofatumumab demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 58% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P<.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Ofatumumab also showed a relative risk reduction of 34% (P=.002) in 3-month CDW and 32% (P=.01) in 6-month CDW compared with teriflunomide in a pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS1.

Ofatumumab showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (97% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) vs teriflunomide1. Ofatumumab demonstrated that it lowered NfL levels in serum at the first assessment at Month 3 compared with teriflunomide. There was no difference in slope of brain volume change from baseline between treatments. In a measure of 6-month CDI events, a favorable trend for ofatumumab was seen but this did not reach significance vs teriflunomide1.

Ofatumumab had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and neoplasms also being similar across both treatment groups1. Injection-related reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache, injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were the most commonly observed adverse events across both treatment groups, occurring in ≥10% of patients1.

Overall, ofatumumab, a fully-human antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide1.

About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord10. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide11, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)12. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease10.

Denali to receive a $560 million upfront payment, a $465 million equity investment and potential milestone payments, profit sharing and royalties
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Aug. 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Denali Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: DNLI) today announced that they have signed a binding agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali’s small molecule inhibitors of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) for Parkinson’s disease. Biogen will also receive rights to opt into two programs and a right of first negotiation for two additional programs, in each case for neurodegenerative diseases leveraging Denali’s Transport Vehicle (TV) technology platform to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

“Our collaboration with Denali represents an opportunity to advance the development of a potential first-in-class oral therapy that may slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease,” said Michel Vounatsos, Biogen’s Chief Executive Officer. “Denali’s LRRK2 program is highly complementary to our existing Parkinson’s disease pipeline and its successful development would enhance Biogen’s portfolio of medicines for treating serious neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. We look forward to leveraging our neurology capabilities and infrastructure with Denali’s scientific expertise to accelerate advancement of this program.”

“We are very excited to collaborate with Biogen, a company with an impressive history in inventing and developing medicines for neurological diseases,” said Ryan Watts, Ph.D., Denali’s Chief Executive Officer. “This collaboration will allow us to accelerate the development of our LRRK2 program and gives us the resources to build a fully integrated company with the goal of bringing transformative medicines to patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.”

Under the agreement, Biogen will collaborate with Denali to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali’s small molecule inhibitors of LRRK2 for Parkinson’s disease. Biogen and Denali will co-commercialize the LRRK2 product in the U.S. and China, and Biogen will commercialize in all other markets. DNL151 has been selected to progress into late stage clinical studies expected to commence in 2021.

Mutations in the LRRK2 gene can cause Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2 is a regulator of lysosomal function, which is impaired in Parkinson’s disease and may contribute to neurodegeneration. Inhibition of LRRK2 activity may slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease in patients with and without known genetic risks based on restoration of lysosomal function. People who have Parkinson’s disease experience numerous symptoms, including tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness and impaired balance. As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking or completing other simple tasks. Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with significant unmet medical needs due to the absence of approved therapies that may slow disease progression.

In addition to the LRRK2 program, Biogen will also receive an exclusive option to license two preclinical programs from Denali’s TV platform, which aims to improve brain uptake of biotherapeutics, including its Antibody Transport Vehicle (ATV): Abeta program (ATV enabled anti-amyloid beta program) and a second program utilizing its TV technology. Further, Biogen will have right of first negotiation on two additional TV-enabled therapeutics, currently at a preclinical stage, should Denali decide to seek a collaboration for such programs. Denali’s TV platform is a proprietary technology designed to effectively deliver large therapeutic molecules such as antibodies, enzymes, proteins and oligonucleotides across the BBB after intravenous administration.

Terms of the Collaboration

Under the terms of the agreement, Biogen will make an upfront payment to Denali of $560 million and make a $465 million equity investment in Denali from the purchase of 13.3 million newly issued shares of Denali common stock at approximately $34.94 per share, representing 11.2 percent of Denali’s pro-forma outstanding stock.

Should the LRRK2 program achieve certain development and commercial milestones, Denali will be eligible to receive up to $1.125 billion in potential milestone payments.

In the LRRK2 collaboration, Biogen and Denali will share responsibility and costs for global development (60 percent Biogen; 40 percent Denali), and will share responsibility and costs as well as profits and losses for commercialization in the U.S. (50 percent Biogen; 50 percent Denali) and China (60 percent Biogen; 40 percent Denali). Outside the U.S. and China, Biogen will be responsible for commercialization and pay Denali tiered royalties.

Closing of the collaboration is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S., and other customary closing conditions.

About Denali’s LRRK2 DNL151 Program

DNL151 is a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2 invented at Denali which has completed dosing of 162 healthy volunteers in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical study and completed dosing in 25 Parkinson’s patients in a Phase 1b clinical study. Denali is currently completing further dose escalation cohorts in an expanded Phase 1 and an additional cohort in the Phase 1b study to define the full therapeutic window of the molecule. Based on the clinical data to date that has been generated in Europe, DNL151 appears to have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and has met desired target engagement goals. An Investigational New Drug application for DNL151 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2020 and enables expansion of Denali clinical trials for DNL151 globally.

40723,Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Paclitaxel Fail to Meet the Primary Endpoint in P-III IMpassion131 Study for Patients with Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,Roche provides update on Phase III study of Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel for people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer,"The P-III IMpassion131 study involves assessing of Tecentriq + paclitaxel vs PBO + paclitaxel, in 651 people in a ratio (2:1) with previously untreated, inoperable, LA/ m-TNBC
 The study did not meet its 1EPs of PFS for 1L treatment of people with m-TNBC) in the PD-L1+ population. The data for 2EPs of OS showed a negative trend, however, the study was not powered for the 2EPs of OS and data were immature at the time of analysis while OS follow-up is planned to continue until the final analysis
 In the previous IMpassion130 study, Tecentriq + Abraxane demonstrated PFS benefit and, while not formally tested, showed improvements in OS for people with metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1","Basel, 06 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Phase III IMpassion131 study, evaluating Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with paclitaxel (chemotherapy), in comparison to placebo plus paclitaxel, did not meet statistical significance on its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) for the initial (first-line) treatment of people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in the PD-L1-positive population.

The data for the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) showed a negative trend, however, the study was not powered for the secondary endpoint of OS and data were immature at time of analysis. OS follow-up is planned to continue until final analysis. Safety for the Tecentriq combination appeared to be consistent with the known safety profile of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified.

In the previous IMpassion130 study, Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with Abraxane® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound); nab-paclitaxel) demonstrated a statistically significant PFS benefit and, while not formally tested, showed clinically meaningful improvements in OS for people with metastatic TNBC whose tumours express PD-L1 (≥1%). Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is approved in over 70 countries for the treatment of adults with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC whose tumours express PD-L1 (≥1%).

“While we are disappointed by the results from the IMpassion131 study, we are grateful for all the patients, families and physicians who were involved in the study,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Today’s results underscore the need to better understand the cancer and immune system interactions, including the chemotherapy backbone and associated regimens. We remain committed to finding optimal treatments for all people living with this aggressive disease.”

Full results from IMpassion131 are being discussed with global health authorities and will be presented at a future medical meeting. The insights will also be used to inform existing and future studies in triple-negative breast cancer with Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMpassion131 study
The IMpassion131 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with paclitaxel, in comparison to placebo plus paclitaxel, in people with previously untreated, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. The study enrolled 651 people who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive Tecentriq or placebo plus paclitaxel. The primary endpoint is PFS per investigator assessment (RECIST 1.1) in the PD-L1-positive population followed by intention-to-treat (ITT) populations. Secondary endpoints include OS, objective response rate and duration of response in the PD-L1-positive and ITT populations.

About triple-negative breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with more than 2 million diagnosed worldwide each year.1 TNBC represents ~15% of all breast cancers and is more common in women under the age of 50, compared with other forms of breast cancer.2-4 It is defined by the lack of expression and/or amplification of the targetable receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 amplification.5 Patients with metastatic TNBC generally experience rapid progression and shorter OS compared to other subtypes of breast cancer.3

About Roche in breast cancer
Roche has been advancing breast cancer research for more than 30 years with the goal of helping as many people with the disease as possible. Our medicines, along with companion diagnostic tests, have contributed to bringing breakthrough innovations in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers. As our understanding of breast cancer biology rapidly improves, we are working to identify new biomarkers and approaches to treatment for all forms of early and advanced breast cancer, including triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive.

Our targeted medicines Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla and Tecentriq are continuing to transform the treatment of early and advanced HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers and, through our Tecentriq and ipatasertib clinical programmes, we hope to bring new treatment combinations to people with breast cancer, ultimately improving outcomes.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

40724,AstraZeneca Collaborates with Daiichi Sankyo to Evaluate the Combination of Patritumab Deruxtecan (U3-1402) + Tagrisso for EGFR-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Daiichi Sankyo Announces Clinical Trial Collaboration with AstraZeneca to Evaluate Patritumab Deruxtecan (U3-1402) in Combination with TAGRISSO in EGFR-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Daiichi Sankyo to conduct two-part P-I study assessing U3-1402+ Tagrisso as both a 1L and 2L dual regimen in patients with advanced or mNSCLC with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation
 The dose-escalation part will assess the safety & tolerability of different dosing combinations of dual regimen to determine the recommended dose while the second part of the study (dose expansion) will include a 1L and 2L cohort to further evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of the regimen
 In the 1L cohort, patients will receive dual regimens and patients in the 2L cohort will be randomized in a ratio (1:1) to receive treatment with U3-1402 as monothx. or in combination with Tagrisso. 258 patients will be enrolled in the study, which will be conducted in NA, EU, and Asia including Japan","Tokyo, Basking Ridge, N.J. and Munich – (August 6, 2020) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) to evaluate the combination of patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402), a HER3 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), and TAGRISSO (osimertinib), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

 

There are no HER3 directed therapies approved for the treatment of NSCLC or any cancer. The frequency of HER3 overexpression in EGFR-mutated NSCLC has been reported to be as high as 75 percent, and there is evidence that HER3 expression may be associated with resistance to TKIs.[1],[2]

 

“The majority of patients with activating mutations of EGFR, or EGFR-mutated NSCLC, overexpress the HER3 protein in the cancer cells, and there is evidence that HER3 expression is a passenger marker of resistance to TKIs. Clinical and preclinical data, as well as biomarker expression and resistance mechanism research, support the further evaluation of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO as a treatment combination for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with a TKI, typically TAGRISSO,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “This clinical trial collaboration supports our goal to optimize development of patritumab deruxtecan in patients with EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC to further improve current standards of care. Daiichi Sankyo is pleased to begin this focused collaboration with AstraZeneca on this important aspect of patritumab deruxtecan development.”

 

“In this trial, we will explore a new potential way to treat patients with advanced disease by combining TAGRISSO with patritumab deruxtecan, a HER3 directed ADC,” said Cristian Massacesi, Senior Vice President, Head of Late Stage Development Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “This combination approach represents one of our strategies of addressing tumor resistance. As we work to continue maximizing the benefit TAGRISSO can bring to patients, we look forward to collaborating with Daiichi Sankyo in this new area of study.”

 

About the Study

Under the terms of the agreement, Daiichi Sankyo will sponsor and conduct a multicenter, open-label, two-part phase 1 study evaluating patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO as both a first-line and second-line combination treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation.

 

The first part of the study (dose escalation) will assess the safety and tolerability of different dosing combinations of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO to determine the recommended combination dose. The second part of the study (dose expansion) will include a first-line and second-line cohort that will further evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of the combination. Patients enrolled in the first-line cohort will receive patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO combination treatment, and patients in the second-line cohort will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with patritumab deruxtecan alone or in combination with TAGRISSO. Up to 258 patients will be enrolled into the study, which will be conducted in North America, Europe, and Asia including Japan.

 

The primary study objectives for the dose escalation part of the study include the assessment of the safety and tolerability of patritumab deruxtecan and TAGRISSO. The primary objective for the dose expansion part of the study for both cohorts is the assessment of anti-tumor activity as measured by objective response rate (ORR) and as assessed by independent central review.

 

Unmet Need in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

Lung cancer is the most common cancer and is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide with an estimated 2.1 million new cases of lung cancer in 2018 and 1.8 million deaths.[3] Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.[4]

 

Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are among the most frequently observed genomic alterations in NSCLC, affecting approximately 14 to 30 percent of patients with NSCLC.[5] For patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, targeted therapy with EGFR TKIs offers higher response rates, overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy.[6] However, most patients eventually develop resistance to the TKIs, and new treatment approaches including combination strategies designed to overcome TKI resistance are needed.[7]

 

About HER3

HER3 is a member of the EGFR family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which are associated with normal as well as aberrant cell proliferation and survival.2 HER3 expression has been associated with an increased incidence of metastases and reduced survival in patients with NSCLC with expression frequency reported to be as high as 75 percent.1 A majority of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs show some level of HER3 expression.[8],[9] Currently, no HER3 directed therapies are approved for NSCLC or any cancer.

 

About Patritumab Deruxtecan (U3-1402)

Patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402) is one of three lead DXd antibody drug conjugates (ADC) in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo.

 

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, patritumab deruxtecan is comprised of a human anti-HER3 antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker. It is designed to target and deliver chemotherapy inside cancer cells that express HER3 as a cell surface antigen.

 

Patritumab deruxtecan is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 study in previously treated patients with metastatic or unresectable NSCLC. Patritumab deruxtecan is also being evaluated in a phase 1/2 study in patients with HER3 expressing metastatic breast cancer.

 

Patritumab deruxtecan is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

40725,Bausch Health to Spin off its Eye Health Business,Bausch Health to Spin off its Eye Health Business,"Bausch Health spin-off its leading eye health business into an independent publicly-traded company under the name Bausch + Lomb. The spinoff is expected to be completed in H1’21
 The spinoff will lead to the formation of two separate companies that include an eye-health company built on the iconic Bausch + Lomb brand and a diversified company with leading positions in gastroenterology, aesthetics/dermatology, neurology, and international pharmaceuticals
 Bausch + Lomb will consist of Bausch Health’s global vision care, surgical, consumer and ophthalmic Rx businesses which had generated $3.7B revenue in 2019. The other company would comprise brands across the Salix, International Rx, neurology and medical dermatology businesses that generated a revenue pf ~$4.9B in 2019","Spinoff Would Unlock Value in the Iconic Bausch + Lomb Brand and Integrated Portfolio of Eye Health Products

Transaction Will Enable BHC to Focus on Expanding Its Leadership in Gastroenterology, Aesthetics/Dermatology, Neurology and International Pharma

New Segmentation Enhances Focus and Highlights Two Highly Attractive, but Dissimilar Businesses

LAVAL, QC, Aug. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC) (“Bausch Health” or the “Company”) today announced that it intends to spin off its leading eye health business into an independent publicly traded entity (“Bausch + Lomb – NewCo”) from the remainder of Bausch Health (“BHC”). The spinoff will establish two separate companies that include:

A fully integrated, pure play eye-health company built on the iconic Bausch + Lomb brand and long history of innovation; and
A diversified pharmaceutical company with leading positions in gastroenterology, aesthetics/dermatology, neurology and international pharmaceuticals.
The benefits of separating these attractive, but disparate businesses include improved strategic focus and enhanced financial transparency to better enable stakeholders to value each business independently. The timing of the anticipated spinoff will be tied to certain conditions and approvals, and the Company’s completion of several important actions, including the reorganization of the reporting segments, which we expect to begin reporting in the first quarter of 2021.

“We are committed to taking action to unlock what we see as unrecognized value in Bausch Health shares, and we believe that separating our business into two highly focused, stand-alone companies is the way to accomplish that goal,” said Joseph C. Papa, chairman and CEO of Bausch Health. “Four years ago, we initiated a multi-phase plan, first to stabilize and then to transform Bausch Health into a company positioned to deliver long-term organic growth. We have divested approximately $4 billion of non-core assets, paid down over $8 billion of debt, resolved numerous legacy legal issues and managed a loss of exclusivity on an approximately $1.4 billion product portfolio, while also investing in R&D, new product launches­­ and core franchises with attractive growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors and management team have been working on alternatives over the last 12 months to determine how to best unlock value across our businesses, and we believe that the time is right to begin the separation process, so each business has greater flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities in their respective markets.”

Bausch + Lomb – NewCo
Bausch + Lomb – NewCo, which will consist of Bausch Health’s global vision care, surgical, consumer and ophthalmic Rx businesses, would have had 2019 revenue of approximately $3.7 billion and a CAGR of 4.1% (2017-2019). We believe that Bausch + Lomb – NewCo is well-positioned to continue delivering consistent organic revenue growth across the globe, with more than half of its sales outside of the United States. The combination of pipeline expansion and established durable eye care brands, including BAUSCH + LOMB ULTRA®, Biotrue® ONEday, LUMIFY®, Ocuvite® and PreserVision®, among others, as well as the launch of BAUSCH + LOMB INFUSE™ contact lenses, is expected to drive this growth.

BHC
BHC, which would have had 2019 revenue of approximately $4.9 billion and CAGR of 1.8% (2017-2019), will comprise a diversified portfolio of leading durable brands across the Salix, International Rx, Solta, neurology and medical dermatology businesses. Core products include XIFAXAN®, TRULANCE® and RELISTOR® for gastrointestinal diseases; JUBLIA®, DUOBRII® and Thermage® FLX for dermatologic conditions; and WELLBUTRIN® and APLENZIN® for neurological conditions.

Transaction Information
Bausch Health will need to take several steps to facilitate the completion of the spinoff. As a first step to preparing stand-alone carve-out financial statements, Bausch Health expects to report Bausch + Lomb as a separate segment beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Furthermore, there are several important internal and external considerations, approvals and conditions that will drive the ultimate timing and structure of any transaction, including, but not limited to, consideration of one-time costs; capital market conditions; determination of the pro forma capitalizations of Bausch + Lomb – NewCo and BHC; final approval by Bausch Health’s Board of Directors; receipt of applicable regulatory approvals; tax considerations, including receipt of any applicable opinions and/or rulings with respect to the Canadian and U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction; and compliance with U.S. and Canadian securities laws and stock exchange rules and any shareholder vote requirements that may be applicable. Many of these considerations, approvals and conditions will be influenced by and/or be dependent on the specific structure that is ultimately selected.

Bausch Health’s management has initiated a process to determine the future executive leadership teams for each company. As the separation process commences, the Company looks forward to providing additional information on the future management teams and Boards of Directors for both companies.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs are serving as financial advisors; Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz in the United States, and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt in Canada are acting as lead legal counsels; and Davis, Polk & Wardwell is acting as tax counsel.

GREENFIELD, Ind. (June 8, 2020) – Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted approval of Elanco’s pending acquisition of Bayer AG’s (ETR: BAYN) animal health business. The company continues to progress toward a mid-year closing, anticipated August 3, 2020.

“Approval from the European Commission is an important milestone toward the completion of our acquisition of Bayer Animal Health,” said Jeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco. “As the transaction edges closer to fruition, we look forward to turning our full attention to delivering innovation and an expanded portfolio of solutions for farmers, veterinarians and pet owners across the globe. The recent months have only underscored the critical work our farmers do in delivering meat, milk, fish and eggs, and the importance of providing pet owners and veterinarians with a variety of solutions in multiple channels from telemedicine and e-commerce to direct home delivery. Combining Bayer Animal Health’s leadership in these areas better positions Elanco to deliver on these needs.”

The complementary nature of this transaction, combining Elanco’s long-standing focus on the veterinarian with Bayer’s direct-to-consumer expertise, will strengthen and accelerate the company’s Innovation, Portfolio and Productivity strategy. The transaction advances Elanco’s portfolio transformation, creating a balance between the farm animal and pet businesses. It will also expand Elanco’s omnichannel approach, substantially diversifying its pet health business into the retail and e-commerce channels as Elanco continues to determine the best methods for reaching pet owners and veterinarians.

Elanco previously announced divestiture agreements in the range of $120 million to $140 million of revenue to help advance the needed regulatory reviews. The EC’s approval is conditional on several of these proposed divestitures, including:

Divestiture of the worldwide rights for Osurnia®, a treatment for otitis externa in dogs, being sold to Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC (LON: DPH)
Divestiture of the worldwide rights for Vecoxan®, used for prevention and treatment of coccidiosis in calves and lambs being sold to Merck Animal Health (also known as MSD Animal Health).
Divestiture of European Economic Area and UK rights to the Drontal® and Profender® product families and related pipeline assets from Bayer Animal Health being sold to Vetoquinol SA (EURONEXT: VETO), a French pharmaceutical company. These products are broad-spectrum de-wormers for dogs and cats.
In addition to EC approval, Elanco has received antitrust clearance for the transaction in China, Colombia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam, and provisional clearance in Brazil. Elanco continues to cooperate with agencies in other jurisdictions. Further, Elanco fully secured financing early in the first quarter of 2020 to complete the transaction through its completed equity issuance and pricing of its Term Loan B, which will fund at deal close.

The transaction remains subject to additional regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

“Veterinary medicines, including parasiticides, and vaccines have transformed the health of animals over the past decade,” said Rick DeLuca, president, Merck Animal Health. “This product acquisition reinforces Merck Animal Health’s commitment to our customers and our position in the United States Companion Animal category. We plan to use the extensive breadth and depth of our product portfolio, which includes BRAVECTO, a range of Companion Animal vaccines and the Sure Petcare portfolio of digital products, along with the SENTINEL branded products, to enhance our offerings of comprehensive pet care solutions. These products will provide a full range of complementary solutions for our customers to improve the health and well-being of animals and the people who care for them.”

Scott Bormann, senior vice president, North America Commercial Operations, Merck Animal Health, said, “Our unconditional commitment to the veterinary community is steadfast as we offer a broad range of products and services to our customers.

We believe that Merck Animal Health is the right company, ideally positioned to keep developing these products in a sustainable manner.”

The closing of the transaction is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by mid-year 2020.

MADISON, N.J., July 9, 2020 – Merck Animal Health, known as MSD Animal Health outside the United States and Canada, a division of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA [NYSE: MRK], today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of BRAVECTO® 1-MONTH (fluralaner) Chews for dogs and puppies 8 weeks of age and older. The product is administered as a single, monthly flavored chew formulation for treatment and prevention of fleas and treatment and control of ticks. BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is expected to be available in the coming months.

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is an important addition to the company’s parasiticide portfolio, which are extended duration flea and tick protection products that offer broad-spectrum, comprehensive parasite protection for dogs. This new product is suitable for dogs in the early stages of life to begin a regimen of monthly flea and tick protection. Pet owners now can begin their dog’s early life experience on this monthly product and have the option to easily transition to the extended duration BRAVECTO products as the dog reaches 6 months of age, helping to ensure consistent treatment and compliance.

“The approval of this additional BRAVECTO product builds on the strong foundation and body of scientific evidence that we have established over the years with our broad-spectrum, comprehensive line of parasite protection products,” said KJ Varma, BVSc, PhD, senior vice president, Research and Development, Merck Animal Health. “With BRAVECTO 1-MONTH, we have expanded our portfolio with a superior advance in the fight against parasites, as well as provided both adult dogs and puppies with flea and tick protection that delivers immediate and persistent killing activity.”

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH kills adult fleas and is indicated for the treatment and prevention of flea infestations (Ctenocephalides felis) and the treatment and control of tick infestations [Ixodes scapularis (black-legged tick), Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (brown dog tick)] for one month in dogs and puppies 8 weeks of age and older and weighing 4.4 pounds or greater. BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is also indicated for the treatment and control of Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) infestations for one month in dogs and puppies 6 months of age and older and weighing 4.4 pounds or greater.

“Parasites pose serious animal and human health risks as fleas and ticks can transmit disease,” said Christine Royal, DVM, executive director, U.S. Companion Animal and Equine Professional Services, Merck Animal Health. “Effective protection against these parasites is essential to safeguard our pets as well as our homes. The approval of BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is an ideal start for dogs in the early stages of life with the benefit of a tasty, monthly chew formulation that is fast-acting and efficacious.”

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH contains fluralaner, an ectoparasiticide belonging to the isoxazoline class, which has systemic activity against ticks and fleas. The product is available in five strengths (45, 100, 200, 400 and 560 mg) per chew.

BRAVECTO 1-MONTH is part of the Merck Animal Health companion animal portfolio, which includes Sure Petcare, a range of digitally connected products, as well as a broad range of veterinary medicines and vaccines.

On July 2, 2020, Merck Animal Health announced the completion of its product acquisition for the U.S. rights to SENTINEL® FLAVOR TABS® and SENTINEL® SPECTRUM® Chews in the Companion Animal category. Comprehensive parasite protection is an essential part of canine overall health and well-being. The BRAVECTO product line, which are our extended duration flea and tick protection products, and the SENTINEL branded products, which control all common intestinal parasites, provide broad-spectrum, year-round comprehensive internal and external parasite protection for dogs. These complementary products will cover the seven common, harmful parasites that affect dogs inside and out by preventing ticks and multiple stages of the flea lifecycle, including eggs and adult fleas, as well as treating and controlling all common intestinal parasites, including roundworms, hookworms, whipworms and tapeworms and preventing heartworm disease.

40911,Boehringer Ingelheim Receives Approval for its Classical Swine Fever Live Vaccine in China,Boehringer Ingelheim’s China-developed Classical Swine Fever live vaccine approved,"Boehringer’s Ingelvac CSF MLV has obtained a New Veterinary Drug Registration Certificate from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China
 The vaccine is jointly developed by Boehringer and Chinese research institutes and will be produced at BI’s Taizhou plant, Jiangsu province, and is expected to be commercialized in H1’21
 The vaccine is the BI’s first swine vaccine product, developed, manufactured and distributed in China. The plant also manufactures Ingelvac PRRS MLV (live vaccine for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome)","Shanghai, China, June 10, 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim is proud to announce that its China-developed Classical Swine Fever Vaccine, Live (C-strain, PK/WRL Cell Line Origin) (English trade name: Ingelvac® CSF MLV) has recently obtained a “New Veterinary Drug Registration Certificate” from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China. It is the first Classical Swine Fever live vaccine jointly developed by a multinational company and Chinese research institutes. It marks another milestone for Boehringer Ingelheim’s “in China, for China”, as the company is committed to providing innovative and high-quality swine vaccines for the Chinese swine industry, as well as holistic swine disease solutions to pig farms.

Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is a highly contagious and lethal infectious disease in pigs, caused by Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV). As the disease has caused huge economic losses to the pig farming industry, it is classified as Class A Animal Disease in China. Even though massive vaccination with CSF live vaccine in China now effectively controls the outbreak of CSF, endemic and sporadic spread still exists.

Most Classical Swine Fever live vaccines currently available on the market can only be stored at -15℃ for 18 months. Cold-chain transportation, storage and dilution all need a strict temperature control. The newly approved Ingelvac® CSF MLV uses state-of-the-art microcarrier-based suspension culture and freeze-drying technologies to ensure high-titer virus, stable vaccine production process, and controllable quality. It can be stored at 2-8℃ for 24 months. This high-quality product will provide China’s pig farming industry with breakthrough immunization programs and supporting disease solutions. It will contribute to the efforts and challenge of eradicating the Classical Swine Fever in China.

Ingelvac® CSF MLV will be produced by Boehringer Ingelheim’s Taizhou plant, Jiangsu province, and it is expected to be commercialized in early 2021. It will become Boehringer Ingelheim’s first swine vaccine product, developed, manufactured and distributed in China. The Taizhou plant already manufactures Ingelvac® PRRS MLV (live vaccine for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome).

Elanco to host investor call at 8:00 a.m. EDT
GREENFIELD, Ind., (August 20, 2019) Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today announced it has entered into an agreement with Bayer AG (ETR: BAYN) to acquire its animal health business in a transaction valued at US$7.6 billion. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, creates the second largest animal health leader while strengthening and accelerating the company’s proven Innovation, Portfolio and Productivity (IPP) strategy.
The transaction will double Elanco’s Companion Animal business, advancing the company’s intentional portfolio mix transformation and creating a balance between its Food Animal and Companion Animal segments. Elanco expects the combined organization to continue to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth, while accelerating achievement of adjusted gross margin goals and delivering double digit adjusted EBITDA margin growth.
“In our first four quarters as an independent company, we have validated the significant value creation potential from a dedicated focus on animal health and a targeted strategy,” said Jeffrey N. Simmons, president and chief executive officer of Elanco. “Joining Elanco and Bayer Animal Health strengthens and accelerates our IPP strategy, transforms our portfolio with the addition of well-known pet brands, brings an increased presence in key emerging markets, expands innovation, and accelerates our margin expansion journey. The move combines our long-standing focus on the veterinarian while meeting pet owners’ changing expectation of pet care and access to products.”
Bayer AG’s chief executive officer, Werner Baumann, added: “Our Animal Health business is among the pioneers of this sector, having built up an attractive portfolio and secured well-established market positions in the companion and farm animal segments. And now, the combination with Elanco will give rise to a leading competitor in the animal health industry, benefiting customers, employees and shareholders alike.”
The addition of Bayer Animal Health enhances all major drivers of Elanco’s IPP strategy.

Portfolio: Adding Bayer Animal Health’s business accelerates Elanco’s portfolio transformation by elevating Companion Animal to nearly half of the overall business. The combination creates access to new segments of the parasiticides market with topical treatments and collars, and propels Elanco into expanding pet e-commerce and retail spaces. This complements Elanco’s already strong veterinary presence, enabling the company to reach more pet owners. In the Food Animal business, the acquisition will add a number of anchor cattle brands, create a bio-protection portfolio and expand Elanco’s aqua presence into warm water fish. The enhanced global presence will allow Elanco to better serve veterinarians, farmers and pet owners.
Innovation: The transaction augments Elanco’s already strong R&D pipeline with eight significant new development projects and 30+ lifecycle products, while providing certain access rights to Bayer’s CropScience R&D pipeline and de-prioritized clinical pharma assets. It adds superior capabilities for R&D platforms in key areas along with innovative dosing and delivery technology platforms. The acquisition also adds additional bench strength and scale to Elanco’s world-class R&D team.
Productivity: The combination of Bayer and Elanco accelerates Elanco’s margin expansion opportunity and delivers adjusted EPS accretion in the first full year post-closing, then high single to low double-digit percentage accretion in year two. The acquisition also unlocks Elanco’s ability to achieve 60 percent adjusted gross margin and 31 percent adjusted EBITDA margin faster than on a stand-alone basis,2 with the increased ability to improve beyond. It brings operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion annually by the third year post-closing, allowing Elanco to reach 3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA in the same time period, along with the potential for $275 to $300 million in synergies. Finally, Elanco will bring together two complementary dedicated animal health businesses to operate on one fit-for-future infrastructure.
“This combination will join two complementary animal health-focused entities previously under the human pharma umbrella into a dedicated company focused on delivering for farmers, veterinarians and pet owners. It creates increased speed, attention and investment to bring customers greater access and options at a variety of price points to make a difference in the lives of animals,” Simmons said. “We look forward to adding Bayer Animal Health’s employees’ breadth of expertise. Ultimately, we believe these increased capabilities and knowledge will allow us to better support the veterinarian, creating a bridge between the pet owner and the veterinarian where relationships don’t exist today.”
Key Terms and Financing
Elanco will finance the transaction through both cash and equity. Bayer AG will receive $5.32 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and $2.28 billion or approximately 68 million Elanco Animal Health common shares. This represents a 70 percent to 30 percent cash-to-equity mix. Stock received by Bayer is subject to a 7.5 percent symmetrical collar centered on Elanco’s volume-weighted average price for the 30 trading days ended August 6, 2019 of $33.60. Elanco has secured a bridge commitment for the cash portion of the consideration. It intends to fund the cash consideration through a combination of new debt and equity. At close, Elanco expects its gross debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be ~5x, including the benefit of expected cost synergies. The strong cash flow generation profile of the combined businesses will allow Elanco to de-lever rapidly to below 3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2022. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2020, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Advisors
Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Elanco and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Hengeler Mueller acted as legal counsel to Elanco. Elanco’s Board of Directors was provided a fairness opinion by Duff & Phelps.

The NuPTH is used for treatment of osteoporosis and in patients with increased risk of fracture. The biosimilar NuPTH aims to be cost-effective for patients and will be available as easy to use, pre-filled disposable pen
 NuPTH is the third biosimilar launched by the company following the launch of Rituximab and Bevasizumab biosimilars, recommended in multiple indications under the brand names Ritucad and Bevaro respectively
 The launch strengthens the company’s ortho care portfolio and helps in increasing choice and access for osteoporosis care to patients in the Indian Market","Ahmedabad-based Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited has announced the launch of NuPTH an Osteoporosis biosimilar of Forteo in India. The Forteo biosimilar is used for treatment of osteoporosis and in patients with increased risk of fracture.

India is the Osteoporosis capital of the world. It is a very common problem. As per a study in 2003 the number of osteoporosis patients in India were approximately 26 million. It is estimated that by 2050, half of the world’s fractures will occur in Asia.*

“Difficulty in use and early drop-outs is often cited as a common reason for non-compliance of osteoporosis medication. The medication is primarily used by people of 50 years and above. We realized that if the delivery system is complex, people stop using it. The ease of use of delivery device is as important as development of new drugs. The biosimilar NuPTH aims to be a cost effective solution for patients and will be sold as an easy to use, pre-filled disposable pen,” shared Amit Ajmera, Vice President, Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited.

“Cadila has always been committed to quality and affordable care. With the launch of NuPTH we intend to strengthen our orthocare portfolio and help increase choice, and access for osteoporosis care to patients in the Indian Market. NuPTH builds new bones with ease, and we want all patients to have access to it. Biosimilars market is a focus area for us and we will continue to strengthen our portfolio”, said Mr. O.P. Singh, President -Sales and Marketing, Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited.

NuPTH is the third biosimilar announced by the organization in the past one month. The pharma giant has recently launched Rituximab and Bevasizumab biosimilars, recommended in multiple indications under the brand names Ritucad™ and Bevaro™ respectively.

August 4 is celebrated as National bone and joint day by Indian orthopaedic association. Lack of Nutrition is often cited as the cause of brittle bones. While supplements, help in prevention of osteoporosis, the biosimilar product is the only agent which helps build new bones.

Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (www.cadilapharma.com) is one of the largest privately-held pharmaceutical companies of India. It has recently concluded and cleared USFDA inspection successfully in February 2020. Over the past six decades, Cadila Pharmaceuticals has been engaged in development and manufacturing of affordable medicines and in making them available for patients across the world.

Evrysdi helped infants survive without permanent ventilation and achieve the ability to sit without support, a key motor milestone not normally seen in the natural course of the disease
Evrysdi is the first and only medicine for SMA that can be taken at home
 
Basel, 10 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) Roche announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children 2 months of age and older. Evrysdi showed clinically-meaningful improvements in motor function across two clinical trials in people with varying ages and levels of disease severity, including Types 1, 2, and 3 SMA. Infants achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, a key motor milestone not normally seen in the natural course of the disease. Evrysdi also improved survival without permanent ventilation at 12 and 23 months, compared to natural history. A liquid medicine, Evrysdi is administered daily at home by mouth or feeding tube.

“Given the majority of people with SMA in the U.S. remain untreated, we believe Evrysdi, with its favorable clinical profile and oral administration, may offer meaningful benefits for many living with this rare neurological disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph. D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “The strength and resolve of the SMA community has continually inspired us as we developed this first-of-its-kind medicine for SMA, so today we celebrate our collective accomplishment together with them.”

Evrysdi is being studied in more than 450 people as part of a large and robust clinical trial program in SMA. The program includes infants aged 2 months to adults aged 60 with varying symptoms and motor function, such as people with scoliosis or joint contractures, and those previously treated for SMA with another medication. The approval is based on data from two clinical studies designed to represent a broad spectrum of people living with SMA: FIREFISH in symptomatic infants aged 2 to 7 months; and SUNFISH in children and adults aged 2 to 25 years. SUNFISH is the first and only placebo-controlled trial to include adults with Types 2 and 3 SMA.

In FIREFISH, 41% (7/17) of infants treated with the therapeutic dose achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III). Additionally, 90% (19/21) of infants were alive without permanent ventilation at 12 months of treatment and reached 15 months of age or older. As described in the natural history of untreated infantile-onset SMA, infants would not be expected to be able to sit independently, and only 25 percent would be expected to survive without permanent ventilation beyond 14 months of age. In SUNFISH, children and adults treated with Evrysdi experienced a clinically-meaningful and statistically significant improvement in motor function at 12 months (1.55 point mean difference; p=0.0156) compared to placebo (1.36 points [95% CI: 0.61, 2.11]; -0.19 points [95% CI: -1.22, 0.84], respectively), as measured by a change from baseline in the Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM-32) total score.

Evrysdi demonstrated a favorable efficacy and safety profile, with the safety profile established across the FIREFISH and SUNFISH trials. The most common adverse reactions were fever, diarrhea, and rash in later-onset SMA. In infantile-onset SMA, the most common adverse events were similar and also included upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, and vomiting. There were no treatment-related safety findings leading to withdrawal from either study.

“Throughout their lives, many people with SMA may lose their ability to perform critical movements, which can impact the ability to independently participate in aspects of daily life and even be life altering,” said Kenneth Hobby, president of Cure SMA. “The approval of Evrysdi is an eagerly awaited milestone for our community. We appreciate Genentech/Roche’s commitment to reflecting the full scope of the real-world SMA population in their clinical trial program and developing a treatment that can be administered at home.”

Evrysdi is designed to treat SMA by increasing production of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Roche leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.

Evrysdi will be available in the United States within two weeks for direct delivery to patients’ homes through Accredo Health Group Inc., an Express Scripts specialty pharmacy.

About Evrysdi™ (risdiplam)
Evrysdi is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.

Risdiplam was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by FDA and EMA in 2017 and 2019, respectively. At this time, risdiplam has been filed in Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. A Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission to the EMA for Evrysdi is imminent.

About the Pivotal Studies
FIREFISH (NCT02913482)
FIREFISH, an open-label, two-part pivotal study, was designed to assess Evrysdi safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in patients aged 1 to 7 months with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 evaluated several doses of Evrysdi and determined the therapeutic dose of 0.2 mg/kg for Part 2. In Part 1, after 12 months of Evrysdi treatment:

41% (7/17) of infants treated with the therapeutic dose achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds as measured by the BSID-III gross motor scale.
90% (19/21) of all infants were alive without permanent ventilation* and reached 15 months of age or older
81% (17/21) of all patients were alive without permanent ventilation* after a minimum of 23 months of treatment and reached an age of 28 months or older (median 32 months; range 28 to 45 months)
* Permanent ventilation defined as tracheostomy or ≥16 hours of noninvasive ventilation per day or intubation for ≥21 consecutive days in the absence of, or following the resolution of, an acute reversible event.

SUNFISH (NCT02908685)
SUNFISH, a two-part placebo-controlled multicenter pivotal trial, was designed to assess Evrysdi safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD in people with Type 2 or 3 SMA aged 2 to 25, including those with scoliosis (67% in Part 2) and joint contractures at baseline. In Part 2, after 12 months, Evrysdi treatment led to:

A clinically-meaningful and statistically significant improvement in motor function among children and adults, as measured by a change from baseline in the MFM-32 total score (1.55 point mean difference; p=0.0156), at 12 months as compared to placebo (1.36 points [95% CI: 0.61, 2.11]; -0.19 points [95% CI: 1.22, 0.84], respectively). MFM-32 assesses 32 different motor functions across a wide range of people with SMA.
Improved upper limb motor function compared to baseline, as measured by the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), a secondary independent motor function endpoint of the study (1.59 point difference; p=0.0028).
Pivotal Trial Safety Data
The safety profile of Evrysdi was established across the FIREFISH and SUNFISH pivotal trials. The most common adverse reactions in later-onset SMA (incidence of at least 10% of patients treated with Evrysdi and more frequently than control) were fever, diarrhea, and rash. The most common adverse reactions in infantile-onset SMA were similar to those observed in later-onset SMA patients. Additionally, the most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 10%) were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, and vomiting.

About the Evrysdi Clinical Trial Program
In addition to FIREFISH and SUNFISH, Evrysdi is being evaluated in a broad range of people with SMA, including in:

JEWELFISH (NCT03032172): an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. Recruitment for this study is complete with 174 people enrolled.
RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334): an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Evrysdi in infants (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.

About SMA
SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement. Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

41316,The US FDA Approves Guardant360 CDx as the First Liquid Biopsy NGS Assay to Identify EGFR Mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,FDA Approves First Liquid Biopsy Next-Generation Sequencing Companion Diagnostic Test,"The FDA has approved Guardant360 CDx as a liquid biopsy companion diagnostic that uses NGS to identify EGFR mutations in patients with metastatic NSCLC
 The assay utilizes two technologies- i) liquid biopsy that uses a blood sample to provide HCPs with genetic information about the patient’s tumor and ii) NGS that uses large-panel genetic sequencing, allowing clinicians to better assess tumor composition
 Today’s approval is specific to its use in identifying NSCLC patients with EGFR alterations who may benefit from AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso. The assay has also received FDA’s breakthrough device designation","SILVER SPRING, Md., Aug. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first liquid biopsy companion diagnostic that also uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to identify patients with specific types of mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in a deadly form of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This is the first approval to combine two technologies — NGS and liquid biopsy — in one diagnostic test in order to guide treatment decisions.

“Approval of a companion diagnostic that uses a liquid biopsy and leverages next-generation sequencing marks a new era for mutation testing,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “In addition to benefitting from less invasive testing, patients are provided with a simultaneous mapping of multiple biomarkers of genomic alterations, rather than one biomarker at a time, which can translate to decreased wait times for starting treatment and provide insight into possible resistance mechanisms.”

The Guardant360 CDx assay utilizes two technologies. The first is called liquid biopsy, which uses a blood sample to provide health care professionals with genetic information about the patient’s tumor. It is less invasive and more easily repeatable in comparison to standard tissue biopsies. Furthermore, liquid biopsy tests can be used in cases in which standard tissue biopsies are not feasible, for instance, due to the location of the tumor.

The second technology is NGS, which uses large-panel genetic sequencing, known as high-throughput tumor profiling. Compared to older technologies that required multiple tests, NGS requires only one test and allows clinicians to better assess tumor composition, giving providers an advantage in evaluating which mutations are problematic. The Guardant360 CDx assay uses NGS technology to simultaneously detect mutations in 55 tumor genes, rather than one gene at a time.

While the Guardant360CDx can provide information on multiple solid tumor biomarkers, today’s approval is specific to its use in identifying EGFR mutations in patients who will benefit from treatment with TAGRISSO (osimertinib), an FDA-approved therapy for a form of metastatic NSCLC. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women in the United States, and NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer. Genomic findings for other biomarkers evaluated are not validated for choosing a particular corresponding treatment with this approval. If the specific NSCLC mutations associated with today’s approval are not detected in the blood, then a tumor biopsy should be performed to determine if the NSCLC mutations are present.

The Guardant360 CDx assay was granted a Breakthrough Device designation, in which the FDA provides intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development.

The FDA granted approval for the Guardant360 CDx test to Guardant Health.

In the HICKORY study, in patients with prior anti-TNF treatment, therapy met its 1EPs at induction but not at maintenance
 In the LAUREL maintenance study in people without prior anti-TNF treatment, etrolizumab failed to meet its 1EPs while the safety profile of therapy was consistent with previous studies and no major safety issues were reported till date in the four P-III studies
 The therapy is currently being evaluated as an induction/maintenance treatment in people with mod. to sev. active CD with/out prior anti-TNF treatment in a global P-III study (BERGAMOT) and OLE and safety monitoring study (JUNIPER), involving 1,100+ people with CD. In addition, Roche is studying other therapies in IBD and is committed to further understanding this disease","Etrolizumab met its primary endpoint of inducing remission versus placebo for people with ulcerative colitis in only two of three studies
Etrolizumab failed to meet its primary endpoint versus placebo as maintenance therapy in people with ulcerative colitis
Analyses of these data are ongoing to better understand the results
Pivotal phase III study of etrolizumab in Crohn’s disease is ongoing
Roche is studying additional investigational medicines in inflammatory bowel diseases
Basel, 10 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced topline results from its phase III study programme evaluating the investigational medicine etrolizumab in people with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Mixed results were seen in studies evaluating etrolizumab as an induction therapy, and both studies evaluating etrolizumab as a maintenance therapy failed to meet their primary endpoints, showing no significant difference in the proportion of people achieving remission with subcutaneous etrolizumab versus placebo.

In the HIBISCUS I induction study, in people without prior anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment, etrolizumab met the primary endpoint. In contrast, the HIBISCUS II induction study, which also included people without prior anti-TNF treatment, did not meet its primary endpoint. In the HICKORY study, in people with prior anti-TNF treatment, etrolizumab met the primary endpoint at induction but not at maintenance. In the LAUREL maintenance study in people without prior anti-TNF treatment, etrolizumab failed to meet its primary endpoint. The safety profile of etrolizumab was consistent with previous studies and no major safety issues were identified in the four phase III clinical trials reported to date.

“We are disappointed with these results, because we know that people with ulcerative colitis need new treatment options,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are fully analysing these data to learn more about how we might address the needs of people with this devastating disease. These studies were part of the largest clinical trial programme ever undertaken in inflammatory bowel diseases, and we thank all the patients, investigators and healthcare professionals for their participation.”

Further analyses of the data, including secondary endpoints, are ongoing and will be submitted for presentation at upcoming medical meetings.

Etrolizumab continues to be studied as an investigational induction and maintenance treatment in people with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease with and without prior anti-TNF treatment in a global phase III study (BERGAMOT) and open-label extension and safety monitoring study (JUNIPER), involving more than 1,100 people with Crohn’s disease. In addition, Roche is studying other investigational medicines in inflammatory bowel diseases and is committed to further understanding this disease.

About inflammatory bowel diseases and ulcerative colitis
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic gastrointestinal disorders affecting almost 7 million people worldwide.1 The two main types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (mainly affecting the colon and rectum) and Crohn’s disease (affecting the entire gastrointestinal tract).2,3 Patients can experience unpredictable symptoms that include abdominal pain and cramping, frequent and urgent bowel movements, diarrhoea, leakage, rectal bleeding, weight loss, energy loss and fatigue.2,3 About 80% of all individuals with IBD do not experience lasting remission, which can have a long-term impact on quality of life and leave many feeling like they have little control over their daily lives.4

Ulcerative colitis is most commonly diagnosed in young people aged 15 to 30 years, affecting them over the course of their entire future lives.5 Up to a quarter of people with ulcerative colitis will require a colectomy within 10 years of diagnosis, in which all or part of the colon is removed.6

About etrolizumab
Etrolizumab is the first investigational dual anti-integrin studied in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It is designed to target IBD on two fronts by selectively inhibiting α4β7 and αEβ7 to control both trafficking of immune cells into the gut and their inflammatory effects on the gut lining.7

Etrolizumab is being studied in the largest clinical trial programme in inflammatory bowel diseases to date, comprised of eight randomised-controlled and open-label trials.8-15 The landmark study programme includes more than 3,100 patients across six phase III studies, plus two open-label extension (OLE) and safety monitoring studies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, spanning more than 40 countries globally, including head-to-head trials against the most common current treatments.

The etrolizumab study programme consists of:

Phase III HIBISCUS I and II: Two identical, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies evaluating the efficacy (induction of remission) and safety of etrolizumab versus adalimumab and placebo in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have not been previously treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents8,9
Phase III LAUREL: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy (maintenance of remission) and safety of etrolizumab in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have not been previously treated with anti-TNF agents10
Phase III GARDENIA: Randomised, multicentre double-blind, double-dummy study evaluating the efficacy (sustained remission) and safety of etrolizumab versus infliximab in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have not been previously treated with anti-TNF agents11
Phase III HICKORY: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of etrolizumab during induction and maintenance in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have been previously treated with anti-TNF agents12
COTTONWOOD study: An open-label extension and safety monitoring study of patients with moderately to severely ulcerative colitis previously enrolled in etrolizumab phase II/III studies13
Phase III BERGAMOT: A phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of etrolizumab as an induction and maintenance treatment in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease14
JUNIPER study: An open-label extension and safety monitoring study of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease previously enrolled in the etrolizumab phase III BERGAMOT study15

The studies demonstrated that Veklury led to faster time to recovery and that a 5-day or 10-day treatment duration led to similar clinical improvement
 Across multiple studies, Veklury was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups, with no new safety signals identified
 Veklury (remdesivir) is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro/ in vivo in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens. The therapy has been approved by multiple regulatory authorities across the globe, including the EU and Japan","FOSTER CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) announced today that it has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Veklury® (remdesivir), an investigational antiviral for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Veklury is currently available in the U.S. under an Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The filing is the final tier of the rolling NDA submission that was initiated on April 8, 2020.

The filing is supported by data from two randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase 3 clinical studies of Veklury conducted by Gilead and the Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study of Veklury conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). These studies demonstrated that treatment with Veklury led to faster time to recovery compared with placebo and that a 5-day or 10-day treatment duration led to similar clinical improvement. Across studies, Veklury was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups, with no new safety signals identified.

“Since the beginning of the pandemic, Gilead has worked with urgency to establish the efficacy and safety profile of Veklury, and we now have a robust data set supporting the evaluation of use of the drug across a range of hospitalized COVID-19 patient populations,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “Today’s filing is an important milestone as we continue to partner with the U.S. government and healthcare authorities around the globe to address the treatment needs of patients with COVID-19.”

Veklury has been approved by multiple regulatory authorities around the world, including in the European Union and Japan. In countries where Veklury has not been approved, including the United States, Veklury is an investigational drug and the safety and efficacy of remdesivir have not been established. Please see below for additional important warnings and information about the authorized use of Veklury in the United States.

About Veklury

Veklury (remdesivir) is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens. Multiple ongoing international Phase 3 clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of Veklury for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, in different patient populations, formulations, and in combination with other therapies.

Important Information about Veklury in the United States

In the United States, Veklury (remdesivir) is authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only for the treatment of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. Severe disease is defined as patients with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen or requiring mechanical ventilation or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Veklury must be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion and is supplied two ways: Veklury (remdesivir) for injection, 100 mg, lyophilized powder, or Veklury (remdesivir) injection, 100 mg/20 mL (5 mg/mL), concentrated solution.

Veklury is an investigational drug that has not been approved by the FDA for any use, and the safety and efficacy of Veklury for the treatment of COVID-19 have not been established. This authorization is temporary and may be revoked, and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process. For information about the authorized use of Veklury and mandatory requirements of the EUA in the U.S., please review the Fact Sheets and FDA Letter of Authorization available at www.gilead.com/remdesivir.

There are limited clinical data available for Veklury. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with Veklury use. Hypersensitivity reactions, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, have been observed during and following administration of Veklury. The use of Veklury is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to remdesivir. Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers and patients with COVID-19 in clinical trials who received Veklury. Patients should have appropriate clinical and laboratory monitoring to aid in early detection of any potential adverse events. Monitor renal and hepatic function prior to initiating and daily during therapy with Veklury; additionally monitor serum chemistries and hematology daily during therapy. Do not initiate Veklury in patients with ALT ≥5x ULN or with an eGFR <30 mL/min. The decision to continue or discontinue Veklury therapy after development of an adverse event should be made based on the clinical risk/benefit assessment for the individual patient.

Due to a risk of reduced antiviral activity, coadministration of Veklury and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended.

Healthcare providers and/or their designee are responsible for mandatory FDA MedWatch reporting of all medication errors and serious adverse events or deaths occurring during Veklury treatment and considered to be potentially attributable to Veklury. These events must be reported within 7 calendar days from the onset of the event. MedWatch adverse event reports can be submitted to FDA online at www.fda.gov/medwatch or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.

41337,Olympus to Acquire Arc Medical Design for Expanding its Product Portfolio,Olympus announces acquisition of Arc Medical Design Limited from Norgine B.V.,"The acquisition will expand Olympus’ offerings in GI therapeutic devices and the development of advanced colonoscopy tools with the aim of improving early detection and treatment of CRC
 Olympus will obtain full rights to Arc Medical Design’s medical products and will convert its current exclusive distribution rights of Endocuff Vision to a full acquisition of the Endocuff family of products
 Endocuff Vision is a device attached to the distal end of a colonoscope, designed to maintain and maximize visibility during colonoscopy. The Endocuff technology will increase the 11% ADR that will improve clinical outcomes, reduce overall costs and enhance QoL for patients","Tokyo, August 7, 2020 – Olympus Corporation today announced it has signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Arc Medical Design Limited (Arc Medical Design), a
subsidiary of Norgine B.V. The acquisition underscores Olympus’ commitment to
expanding its offering in gastrointestinal therapeutic devices and the development of
advanced colonoscopy tools through M&A (mergers and acquisitions) opportunities as
well as through R&D (research and development) with the overarching goal of
improving early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC).
Under the agreement Olympus will acquire Arc Medical Design and obtain full rights to its suite
of innovative medical products. Olympus will convert its current exclusive distribution rights of
ENDOCUFF VISION™ to a full acquisition of the ENDOCUFF family of products, which also
includes ENDOCUFF™, ENDOCUFF GLIDE™ and ENTEROCUFF™, as well as WIDEEYE™ POLYTRAP and several products currently in development.
By acquiring Arc Medical Design, Olympus is assuming worldwide responsibility for design,
manufacturing, distribution and business strategy for the product portfolio with an immediate
effect. It will further enable the company to improve clinical outcomes, reduce overall costs and
enhance quality of life for patients.
“It is a great pleasure to announce our acquisition of Arc Medical Design”, said Mike
Callaghan, Vice President/General Manager of Global GI EndoTherapy Business Unit at
Olympus. “ENDOCUFF VISION has been a pivotal tool in our EndoTherapy portfolio, and we
are delighted to expand our product portfolio to include the entire ENDOCUFF family.”
The flagship product ENDOCUFF VISION is a
device attached to the distal end of a colonoscope,
designed to maintain and maximize visibility during
colonoscopy. Through its unique design,
ENDOCUFF VISION can manipulate large folds,
anchor the scope tip during loop reduction and
stabilize during complex procedures, such as a
polypectomy.
Data has shown a colonoscopy with ENDOCUFF technology can increase the adenoma
detection rate (ADR) by up to 11% compared to a standard colonoscopy*1. Research shows
ENDOCUFF VISION™
– 2 –
that, for every 1% increase in ADR, there is a 3% decrease in CRC risk*2. Higher detection
rates and more accurate diagnosis could, therefore, help reduce the number of deaths from
preventable digestive cancers, such as CRC. CRC is a leading cause of cancer death for both
men and women and screening is one of the powerful weapons against the disease.
Colonoscopy is considered the beneficial method for detection and removal of hard-to-find
adenomatous polyps.
Callaghan sums up: “We are excited about the acquisition of Arc Medical Design as it expands
our expertise in innovative medical technology, strengthens our global leadership in endoscopy
and reinforces the commitment to our purpose of making people’s lives healthier, safer and
more fulfilling.”

Up to 75% of women, over the age of 50, going through menopausal transition, experience menopausal vasomotor symptoms.1 These symptoms can be debilitating for several years for those affected and may result in significant incremental healthcare and economic costs.2

Under the terms of the agreement Bayer will pay an upfront consideration of $425 million, potential milestone payments of up to $450 million until launch followed by potential additional triple digit million sales milestone payments. Closing is subject to customary conditions, in particular anti-trust approval, and is expected by September 2020.

“As a leader in Women’s Health, Bayer is focused on providing new options for women and their healthcare needs,” said Dr. Sebastian Guth, Bayer’s President of Pharmaceuticals, Americas Region. “This acquisition is another testament to our commitment to the health of women, which not only broadens our pipeline, but has the potential, if approved, to deliver a new treatment option that could have a meaningful impact on women’s lives.”

“Bayer has been our preferred partner due to its leading position in the area of women’s healthcare”, said Dr. Mary Kerr, Co-Founder and CEO of KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd.. “We believe that under the ownership of Bayer, this potential first in class medicine can be optimally developed to become an important non-hormonal treatment option for women suffering vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.”

The acquisition of KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd. is another important milestone in augmenting Bayer’s own women’s healthcare portfolio through strategic collaborations and agreements. Earlier in 2020, Bayer announced the expansion of its partnership with Evotec with a new five-year, multi-target collaboration to develop multiple clinical candidates for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most frequent endocrine disorder in pre-menopausal women. Also, in January 2020, Bayer signed an exclusive license agreement with Daré Bioscience for the U.S. market, focused on its investigational, hormone-free, monthly vaginal contraceptive currently in clinical development for the prevention of pregnancy.

The Pharmaceuticals Business Development & Licensing team of Bayer facilitated this collaboration.

“Pfenex is an ideal strategic, business and cultural fit with Ligand. The acquisition holds potential to have a significantly positive scientific and financial impact on our business in the short and long term, similar to how our Captisol and OmniAb acquisitions have played out,” said John Higgins, Chief Executive Officer of Ligand. “Pfenex will add an established, proven protein expression platform to Ligand that is highly complementary to our essential, proprietary drug discovery and formulation technologies. We are confident we will be able to quickly and efficiently grow the Pfenex business, along with our core existing technologies. It has been a very positive experience working with the Pfenex executive leadership and senior scientists while we put this deal together. We look forward to welcoming the talented Pfenex team to Ligand.”

“The Ligand-Pfenex combination is an excellent strategic and cultural fit, presenting a unique opportunity to leverage the complementary strengths of robust platforms and rich pipelines, we expect it to position us even better to deliver on our joint vision to develop therapeutics that provide patients a better future,” said Eef Schimmelpennink, Chief Executive Officer, Pfenex. “I want to recognize and thank the Pfenex team, and express deep gratitude to each of you for your many contributions over the years, which have enabled us to reach this milestone.”

Financial Outlook

Ligand will provide a detailed outlook for the Pfenex business and financial contribution after the transaction has closed. At this time, Ligand expects the transaction will be modestly dilutive to 2020 adjusted diluted EPS, will provide $0.10 to $0.30 of adjusted diluted EPS accretion in 2021, and will provide significant annual adjusted diluted EPS accretion thereafter with the current forecast of $0.60 to $0.80 in 2022 and $1.25 to $1.50 in 2023.

Transaction Terms

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Ligand will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pfenex common stock for $12.00 per share, or $438 million upfront in cash. This represents a 57% premium to the closing price of Pfenex’s stock on August 10, 2020. Ligand will also pay holders of Pfenex common stock a price of $2.00 per share, or $78 million, as a Contingent Value Right in the event a predefined regulatory milestone is achieved by December 31, 2021. The tender offer is subject to customary conditions, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Pfenex common stock, and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020 and be funded by Ligand with cash on hand.

 The study met its 1EPs & 2EPS, demonstrating OS, PFS, and ORR for the dual immunotherapy. @12.7mos. follow up mOS (15.6 mos. vs 10.9 mos.)
 The approval marks the availability of the first dual immuno-oncology in NSCLC treatment in Canada","CheckMate -9LA trial results demonstrated superior overall survival versus chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression or tumor histology1

MONTREAL, Aug. 11, 2020 /CNW/ – Today, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada (BMS) announces Health Canada’s approval of OPDIVO® (nivolumab) in combination with YERVOY® (ipilimumab) with two cycles of platinum-double chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) or Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) tumour aberrations and no prior systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC.1 Unlike traditional cancer therapies that target the tumour directly, immuno-oncology activates the body’s own immune system to help recognize and attack cancer cells.2 This approval marks the availability of the first dual immuno-oncology plus limited course chemotherapy NSCLC treatment in Canada.

“Despite NSCLC being the most common form of lung cancer, every patient’s lung cancer and treatment journey is unique,” says Dr. Rosalyn Juergens, Associate Professor at McMaster University in the Department of Oncology, Division of Medical Oncology. “This approval provides a novel dual immuno-oncology-based option that may provide longer survival for patients within the Canadian treatment landscape.”

The Health Canada approval was based on results from the randomised phase III clinical trial CheckMate -9LA. The study met both its primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) for the dual immunotherapy plus limited chemotherapy combination versus chemotherapy alone.

Study results showed a statistically significant improvement in OS for metastatic NSCLC patients treated with OPDIVO®, YERVOY® and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone at a prespecified interim analysis (at a minimum follow-up of 8.1 months, [HR 0.69; 96.71% CI: 0.55, 0.87; p=0.0006]).3 With longer follow-up (minimum of 12.7 months), the dual immunotherapy with two cycles of chemotherapy continued to show sustained overall survival (OS) improvements over chemotherapy alone (median OS of 15.6 months versus 10.9 months, respectively [HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.80]). 3

“Over four years ago, OPDIVO® became the first immunotherapy approved for use in previously treated patients, defining a new era and changing the way NSCLC is treated. We are so proud to build on this legacy as OPDIVO® plus YERVOY® is approved as the first dual immunotherapy in a first-line NSCLC setting,” said Al Reba, General Manager, BMS Canada. “We are committed to pursuing innovative approaches to lung cancer treatment so we can continue to deliver the right medicines for patients, increase their quality of life, and improve their chances of survival.”

“Receiving a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer is devastating,” says Shem Singh, Executive Director, Lung Cancer Canada. “We welcome this new Health Canada approval for a novel treatment regimen for patients where there is still significant unmet need.”

CheckMate -9LA Study Design 
CheckMate -9LA (NCT03215706) is Phase III, randomized open-label, multi-centre study evaluating OPDIVO® plus YERVOY® combined with two cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (four cycles followed by optional pemetrexed maintenance therapy if eligible) as a first-line treatment in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression and histology.

The study demonstrated improvement in PFS with no new safety signals
 Additionally, the therapy in combination with CT has met its 1EPs in ORIENT-11 study in 1L non-squamous NSCLC patients. Today’s acceptance marks the second sNDA of Tyvyt for 1L NSCLC indication","SUZHOU, China, Aug. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (“Innovent”) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today jointly announced with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”,NYSE: LLY) that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China has accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum as first-line therapy in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (squamous NSCLC). Recently, the NMPA accepted sNDA for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) as first-line therapy in non-squamous NSCLC on Apr 23, 2020.

The sNDA was based on the analysis of a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study (ORIENT-12)—TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) or placebo in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum as first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. Based on the analysis conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum, which met the pre-defined efficacy criteria. The safety profile is consistent with previously reported sintilimab studies, and no new safety signals were identified. Detailed data will be released in an upcoming international academic conference and journal.

Professor Caicun Zhou, Head of Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, stated: “We are pleased to see that sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy has met predefined primary endpoint in ORIENT-12 study. There still exists large unmet medical needs in squamous NSCLC patients. Globally, ORIENT-12 has demonstrated for the first time survival benefit by treatment with PD-1 inhibitor in combination with gemcitabine and platinum in first-line squamous NSCLC. The result of this study has great clinical value.”

Dr. Hui ZHOU, Vice President of Medical Science and Strategy Oncology of Innovent, stated: “For Innovent, this is the second double-blind, randomized Phase 3 study of NSCLC that met primary endpoint following ORIENT-11, a randomized Phase 3 study of 1L non-squamous NSCLC (NCT03607539). This is also the second sNDA of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) for first-line NSCLC indication. The acceptance of the sNDA by NMPA represents further progress in covering first-line NSCLC disease area. We will actively cooperate with the regulatory authority to bring the high quality therapy to more patients with advanced squamous NSCLC as soon as possible.”

“Lilly and Innovent are committed to bring new anti-tumor treatments, developed with global standards, to patients in China. TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) is the first success of this partnership. After being included in the NRDL for relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the acceptance of the sNDA for new indication of NSCLC is another important milestone of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in the field of oncology therapy,” said Dr. Li WANG, Senior Vice-President of Lilly China and Head of Lilly China Drug Development and Medical Affairs. “ORIENT-12 provides new combination option of chemotherapy for squamous NSCLC patients and we look forward to bringing this new treatment solution to lung cancer patients in China as soon as possible. In the future, we will continue to strengthen cooperation with Innovent to further explore TYVYT® (sintilimab injection)’s potential in the field of immuno-oncology therapy and the potential benefits TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) may bring to more patients.”

About squamous NSCLC

Lung cancer is a malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality in China. NSCLC accounts for approximately 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnosis. About 70% of NSCLC are locally advanced or metastatic at initial diagnosis, rendering the patients with no chance of radical resection. Meanwhile, even after radical surgery the patients still have a high chance of recurrence and eventually die from disease progression. About 35% of patients with NSCLC in China are of squamous subtype without driver genes. There are limited treatment options available to them.

About ORIENT-12 Study

ORIENT-12 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) or placebo in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum as first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03629925). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee based on RECIST v1.1. The key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and safety profiles.

A total of 357 subjects have been enrolled in ORIENT-12 study and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either sintilimab 200mg or placebo in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and platinum every 3 weeks for up to 4 or 6 cycles, followed by either sintilimab or placebo maintenance therapy. The subjects will receive treatment until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other conditions that require treatment discontinuation. Conditional crossover is permitted.

About ORIENT-11 Study

ORIENT-11 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) or placebo in combination with ALIMTA® (pemetrexed) and platinum as first-line therapy for advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03607539). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by Independent Radiographic Review Committee based on RECIST v1.1. The key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and safety profile.

A total of 397 subjects have been enrolled in ORIENT-11 study and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sintilimab 200mg or placebo in combination with ALIMTA® (pemetrexed) and platinum every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles, followed by either sintilimab or placebo plus ALIMTA® maintenance therapy. The subjects will receive treatment until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other conditions that require treatment discontinuation. Conditional crossover is permitted.

This study has met primary endpoint and NMPA accepted the sNDA for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) as first-line therapy in non-squamous NSCLC on Apr 23, 2020.

About TYVYT® (Sintilimab Injection)

TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), an innovative drug developed with global quality standards jointly developed in China by Lilly and Innovent, has been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy, and included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies. TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) is the only PD-1 inhibitor that has been included in the new Catalogue of the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in November 2019.

In April 2020, the NMPA accepted the sNDA for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with ALIMTA® (pemetrexed) and platinum as first-line therapy in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In May 2020, TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) combined with Gemzar® (gemcitabine for injection) and platinum chemotherapy met the predefined primary endpoint in the Phase 3 ORIENT-12 study as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC, and TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) monotherapy met the primary endpoint in the ORIENT-2 study as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well. In August, the NMPA accepted the sNDA for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in combination with Gemzar® (gemcitabine for injection) and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC.

TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1/ PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells.

About emactuzumab

Emactuzumab (RG7155) is an investigational monoclonal IgG1 antibody designed to target and deplete tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumour tissue. TAMs are an abundant component of the tumour microenvironment of many tumour types supporting tumorigenesis by suppressing the local immune system and promoting growth of tumour cells. Emactuzumab specifically targets TAMs by binding to colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) on the cell surface and blocking its activation by CSF-1. Emactuzumab therapy has been shown to significantly reduce CSF-1 dependent macrophages in tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TGCT) and in tumours of cancer patients.

About tenosynovial giant cell tumour

Tenosynovial giant cell tumour is a rare disease characterized by proliferation of synovial tissue in the joint and tendon sheath. The neoplastic process is driven by a specific genetic translocation leading to the overexpression of CSF-1 and a massive recruitment of CSF-1R-expressing macrophages that form the bulk tumorous mass. Even though the disease rarely metastasizes, it is locally aggressive and disabling. Patients are usually diagnosed at an age between 20 and 50 with equal sex distribution. Standard therapy is surgery but relapse rates are high. Patient’s quality of life is often impacted by tumour-related symptoms and surgical sequelae.

The target action date for the FDA decision is February 11, 2021. The FDA granted evinacumab Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2017 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients with HoFH.

HoFH is an ultra-rare inherited disease that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the U.S. Patients with HoFH have severely elevated levels of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C), which increases their risk for premature atherosclerotic disease and cardiac events as early as their teenage years. Treatment guidelines recommend early and intensive LDL-C lowering, but patients with HoFH are less responsive (or unresponsive) to standard lipid-lowering therapies, including statins and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors.

The BLA was supported by a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of evinacumab in patients with HoFH. Results from this trial were presented as a late-breaking presentation at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Session together with World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.20) in March 2020.

Previous research published in NEJM in 2017 by the Regeneron Genetics Center found that patients with loss-of-function mutations in their ANGPTL3 gene have significantly lower levels of key blood lipids, including LDL-C. By blocking the ANGPTL3 protein, evinacumab was designed to replicate this loss-of-function mutation effect to lower LDL-C in patients with HoFH.

Regulatory submissions for evinacumab are also progressing in the European Union. In June 2020, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended an accelerated assessment for evinacumab based on the high unmet medical need and therapeutic innovation demonstrated by the product. The safety and efficacy of evinacumab have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About evinacumab and the ELIPSE HoFH Trial
Regeneron invented evinacumab using the company’s VelocImmune® technology, a proprietary genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human monoclonal antibodies. VelocImmune technology has been used to create multiple FDA-approved antibodies including Praluent® (alirocumab), Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) and Kevzara® (sarilumab). Regeneron previously used these technologies to rapidly develop a treatment for Ebola virus infection, which is currently under review by the FDA, and is now being used in efforts to create prophylactic and treatment medicines for COVID-19.

Evinacumab is an investigational fully-human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the function of ANGPTL3 and is currently being studied in patients with HoFH (ongoing Phase 3 extension trial), refractory hypercholesterolemia (Phase 2) and severe hypertriglyceridemia (Phase 2).

ELIPSE (Evinacumab LIPid StudiEs) HoFH was a multi-national Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of evinacumab 15 mg/kg administered intravenously every four weeks in 65 patients aged 12 years or older with HoFH (43 evinacumab, 22 placebo). The primary endpoint was reduction of LDL-C from baseline with evinacumab compared to placebo at 24 weeks.

August 13, 2020 01:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for a new self-administration option for Xolair® (omalizumab) across all approved U.S. indications. If approved, Xolair prefilled syringe would become available for either self-administration by select patients or administration by their caregivers. A decision on approval is anticipated by Q1 2021. In the U.S., Xolair is currently approved for administration by a healthcare provider in a healthcare setting, and is the only approved biologic designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE) for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).

“We look forward to working closely with the FDA to make Xolair self-administration available as quickly as possible to provide patients with greater flexibility to manage their treatment needs.”

Tweet this

“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to provide self-administration of Xolair to our patients, particularly those who are considered high-risk for severe illness,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We look forward to working closely with the FDA to make Xolair self-administration available as quickly as possible to provide patients with greater flexibility to manage their treatment needs.”

If approved, once Xolair therapy has been established and closely observed by a healthcare provider, self-administration of Xolair prefilled syringe outside of a healthcare setting by a patient or caregiver may be deemed appropriate by the healthcare provider for select patients. In those instances, the patient or caregiver would be trained by a healthcare provider in the correct subcutaneous injection technique and recognition of the early signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis.

Approximately 460,000 patients have been treated in the U.S. with Xolair since its initial approval for allergic asthma in 2003. The use of Xolair in allergic asthma and CIU is supported by a robust clinical development program, including eight Phase III studies. Independent clinical studies involving patients with allergic asthma and CIU on Xolair treatment suggest that Xolair may be self-administered with proper training and monitoring.

In the U.S., Genentech and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation work together to develop and co-promote Xolair.

About Allergic Asthma and Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

Asthma is a serious and chronic lung disease affecting an estimated 24 million people in the U.S. It causes swelling and narrowing of the airways, making breathing difficult. Allergic asthma, the most common form of asthma, accounts for approximately 60 percent of asthma cases in adults.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a skin condition that can cause hives and severe itch that can last many months and years. CIU is characterized by hives that spontaneously occur without an identifiable cause, and recur for six weeks or more. It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million people in the U.S. have CIU.

About Xolair

Xolair is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimizes the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.

Xolair U.S. Indications

Xolair for subcutaneous use is an injectable prescription medicine approved by the FDA to treat:

Moderate to severe persistent asthma in patients six years of age or older whose asthma symptoms are not controlled by asthma medicines called inhaled corticosteroids. A skin or blood test is performed to see if a patient has allergies to year-round allergens.
Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU; chronic hives without a known cause) in patients 12 years of age and older who continue to have hives that are not controlled by H1 antihistamine treatment.
Xolair is not used to treat other allergic conditions, other forms of urticaria, acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

Important Safety Information

The most important information patients should know about XOLAIR is that a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis can happen when you receive XOLAIR. The reaction can occur after the first dose, or after many doses. It may also occur right after a XOLAIR injection or days later. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition and can lead to death. Go to the nearest emergency room right away if you have any of these symptoms of an allergic reaction:

wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, or trouble breathing
low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, rapid or weak heartbeat, anxiety, or feeling of “impending doom”
flushing, itching, hives, or feeling warm
swelling of the throat or tongue, throat tightness, hoarse voice, or trouble swallowing
The patient’s healthcare provider will monitor you closely for symptoms of an allergic reaction while you are receiving XOLAIR and for a period of time after the patient’s injection. The patient’s healthcare provider should talk to the patient about getting medical treatment if they have symptoms of an allergic reaction after leaving the healthcare provider’s office or treatment center.

Patients must not receive XOLAIR if they are allergic to omalizumab or any of the ingredients.

Before receiving XOLAIR, patients must tell their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions, including if they:

have a latex allergy or any other allergies (such as food allergy or seasonal allergies). The needle cap on the XOLAIR prefilled syringe may contain latex.
have sudden breathing problems (bronchospasm)
have ever had a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis
have or have had a parasitic infection
have or have had cancer
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if XOLAIR may harm your unborn baby.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if XOLAIR passes into your breast milk. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby while you receive XOLAIR.
Patients must tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements.

Receiving XOLAIR

XOLAIR should be given by your healthcare provider, in a healthcare setting.
XOLAIR is given in 1 or more injections under the skin (subcutaneous), 1 time every 2 or 4 weeks.
In asthma patients, a blood test for a substance called IgE must be performed prior to starting XOLAIR to determine the appropriate dose and dosing frequency.
In patients with chronic hives, a blood test is not necessary to determine the dose or dosing frequency.
Do not decrease or stop taking any of your other asthma or hive medicine unless your healthcare providers tell you to.
You may not see improvement in your symptoms right away after XOLAIR treatment.
Possible Side Effects of XOLAIR

XOLAIR may cause serious side effects, including:

See, “What is the most important information I should know about XOLAIR” in the XOLAIR Medication Guide at http://www.xolair.com regarding the risk of anaphylaxis.
Cancer. Cases of cancer were observed in some people who received XOLAIR.
Inflammation of your blood vessels. Rarely, this can happen in people with asthma who receive XOLAIR. This usually, but not always, happens in people who also take a steroid medicine by mouth that is being stopped or the dose is being lowered. It is not known whether this is caused by XOLAIR. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have rash; chest pain; shortness of breath; or a feeling of pins and needles or numbness of your arms or legs.
Fever, muscle aches, and rash. Some people who take XOLAIR get these symptoms 1 to 5 days after receiving a XOLAIR injection. If you have any of these symptoms, tell your healthcare provider.
Parasitic infection. Some people who are at a high risk for parasite (worm) infections, get a parasite infection after receiving XOLAIR. Your healthcare provider can test your stool to check if you have a parasite infection.
Heart and circulation problems. Some people who receive XOLAIR have had chest pain, heart attack, blood clots in the lungs or legs, or temporary symptoms of weakness on one side of the body, slurred speech, or altered vision. It is not known whether this is caused by XOLAIR.
The most common side effects of XOLAIR:

In adults and children 12 years of age and older with asthma: pain especially in your arms and legs, dizziness, feeling tired, skin rash, bone fractures, and pain or discomfort of your ears.
In children 6 to less than 12 years of age with asthma: common cold symptoms, headache, fever, sore throat, pain or discomfort of your ear, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and nose bleeds.
In people with chronic idiopathic urticaria: nausea, headaches, swelling of the inside of your nose, throat or sinuses, cough, joint pain, and upper respiratory tract infection.
These are not all the possible side effects of XOLAIR. Patients should call their doctor for medical advice about side effects.

41516,Alphabet's Verily Establishes CLIA-Certified Lab Focusing on COVID-19 Testing,"Verily stands up CLIA-certified lab focused on COVID-19 testing: an interview with Deb Hanks, MD, Verily’s head of Pathology","Verily has expedite the COVID-19 testing with a new lab-based at South San Francisco. The lab will use the technology from Thermo Fisher Scientific’s‎ TaqPath test kit that has received the US FDA’s EUA to test COVID-19
 Verily has submitted a EUA for an adaptation of the TaqPath test to use in testing pooled patient specimens. Pooling is expected to enable our clinical lab to increase our testing capacity even further while maintaining a high level of overall test performance.
 Additionally, the company has verified the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab test and plans to implement additional tests in our lab","Surging COVID-19 testing demand is once again outpacing lab capacity, and nationwide, people are waiting a week or sometimes longer to get test results. In response to the continued demand for testing, Verily has established a CLIA-certified lab at our South San Francisco headquarters to create additional lab capacity in support of programs in the COVID-19 testing space, including our own return-to-work efforts for our own employees.

What are the challenges we’re seeing right now with testing?
Diagnostic labs are experiencing unprecedented demand for their services, sometimes resulting in longer turnaround times from sampling to return of results. Highly experienced labs, adept at handling high volumes of testing, have gone from a two-to-three day turnaround time for a molecular-based RT-PCR COVID-19 test to seven days or longer. When test results are delayed, not only do everyday decisions become harder for the person tested – for example, whether it’s safe to return to work – but it becomes challenging for our public health departments to trace local outbreaks, interrupt transmission, and formulate guidance for their communities.

How is the testing backlog impacting therapeutic development efforts?
The time it takes to return test results can be a rate-limiting factor for the development of new treatment interventions. For example, trials for new potential therapies may require only a few days from initial collection of a COVID-19 test sample to a patient joining an interventional trial. Reducing the testing turnaround time can help support research needed to bring new therapies and treatments to market by identifying infected individuals quickly enough for them to join these studies.

How are participants in Verily’s programs today getting COVID-19 testing?
We have established partnerships with several leading test providers for our COVID-19 testing programs and plan to continue scaling with existing lab partners, as well as with the Verily lab, to meet our customers’ and community partners’ needs for testing across the country.

What is the status of Verily’s efforts to establish a CLIA-certified lab on the Verily campus?
When the pandemic hit, it became clear that we needed to rapidly establish a lab and to receive California state licensure and CLIA certification, which we have done. We’ve verified the performance in our lab of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test via ThermoFisher Scientific’s‎ TaqPath test kit. This test kit has received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This test is intended to tell you whether you’re currently infected with COVID-19.

In addition, we have submitted an EUA application for an adaptation of the TaqPath test for use in testing pooled patient specimens. Pooling is expected to enable our clinical lab to increase our testing capacity even further, while maintaining a high level of overall test performance. We have also verified the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, and we plan to implement additional tests in our lab.

The lab infrastructure is now up and running, and we have created a lab information system that will enable us to implement a strict chain of custody procedure for the specimens in our care. Patient privacy is also important to us, and our systems and practices are intended to safeguard the privacy of patient information.

How will Verily use the lab?
We’ve established this lab to provide a focused specialty service with rapid turnaround time. We are launching with the capacity to run several thousand tests per day, primarily focused on our Healthy at Work customers.

41554,AstraZeneca to Initiate Production of its COVID-19 Vaccine Early in 2021,AstraZeneca set to start making 400 million COVID-19 vaccines for Latam early in 2021,"AstraZeneca collaborates with the Mexican and Argentinean governments to initially produce 150M doses of the vaccine and eventually make at least 400M for distribution throughout the region
 The price for the vaccine is not final but it is expected not to exceed $4/ dose. The vaccine will initially supply to all Latin American countries except Brazil
 The clinical trial conducted in the US, South Africa, England, and Brazil is expected to be completed in Nov or Dec’2020, after which the company would seek approvals. If approved, AstraZeneca will transfer technology to Argentina’s INSUD Group and Mexico’s Laboratorios Liomont at the end of the year and begin manufacturing in Q1’21","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) – Production of 400 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine for Latin America could begin early next year, an executive for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) said on Thursday, as the region’s coronavirus death toll stands at nearly 230,000.

In partnership with the Mexican and Argentinean governments, AstraZeneca plans to initially produce 150 million doses, and eventually make at least 400 million for distribution throughout the region, said Sylvia Varela, head of AstraZeneca Mexico.

Home to some 650 million people, Latin America has registered the world’s highest tallies for coronavirus cases and deaths, with Brazil and Mexico trailing only the United States in record numbers of fatalities.

“We’ll be prioritizing the vulnerable populations,” Varela said at the Mexican president’s daily news conference, noting that the pricing, while still not final, was not expected to exceed $4 per dose. That could bring the cost of the first 150 million doses to $600 million.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador hailed the agreement as “good news” for Mexico, and said the vaccine would be distributed without cost in the country, which ranks third worldwide in number of fatalities.

Lopez Obrador said he expected the country to still be suffering from the pandemic by the time the vaccine goes into production.

Argentina’s president flagged the agreement with Mexico and AstraZeneca, Britain’s second-largest drugmaker, on Wednesday, noting that the initial supply is meant to reach all Latin America except Brazil.

Brazil earlier this month committed $355 million to purchase and produce the AstraZeneca vaccine.

The Mexico-Argentina plan, whose cost is unclear, has significant funding from the foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. A spokesman declined to give a sum.

Varela said Phase III trials taking place in the United States, South Africa, England and Brazil were expected to conclude by November or December, after which the company would seek government approvals.

If granted, the company would then transfer technology to Argentina’s INSUD Group and Mexico’s Laboratorios Liomont at the end of the year, and begin manufacturing in the first quarter of 2021, she said.

The active substance in the vaccine would be made in Argentina and sent to Mexico to be completed for distribution, Varela said.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EfXHw-HU0AA9ywx.jpg,Biotech|COVID-19,AstraZeneca,COVID-19 Vaccine,covid-19 | biotech | 2021|AstraZeneca|Early|Initiate|production|vaccine,publish,14/8/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/astrazeneca-set-to-start-making-400-million-covid-19-vaccines-for-latam-early-in-2021/,https://pharmashots.com/41554/astrazeneca-to-initiate-production-of-its-covid-19-vaccine-early-in-2021/

The agreement includes an option to purchase up to an additional 200M dose
 If approved, the EC expects to facilitate a process for the allocation of the vaccine doses among the member states.
 The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds for vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies","The European Commission has today concluded exploratory talks with Johnson & Johnson to purchase a potential vaccine against COVID-19. This is following the first positive steps with Sanofi-GSK on 31 July. The envisaged contract with Johnson & Johnson would provide for the possibility for all EU Member States to purchase the vaccine, as well as to donate to lower and middle income countries or re-direct to EEA countries. It is anticipated that, once a vaccine has proven to be safe and effective against COVID-19, the Commission would have a contractual framework in place for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU Member States, and could further purchase up to an additional 200 million vaccine doses. The Commission pursues intensive discussions with other vaccine manufacturers.

Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: “Our citizens’ lives and our economy need a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus. Today’s talks bring us closer to achieving this. The Commission is making every effort, in close cooperation with the Member States and with pharmaceutical companies to actively contribute to this end.”

Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “Today we take a further step in ensuring rapid access to an innovative vaccine being developed against the coronavirus. Our negotiations to secure a broad portfolio of vaccines for our citizens and the world will continue unabated. A safe and effective vaccine will decisively contribute to protecting citizens against the virus. We will keep working shoulder to shoulder with our Member States until the vaccine reaches everyone.”

The exploratory talks concluded today are intended to result in an Advance Purchase Agreement to be financed with the Emergency Support Instrument, which has funds dedicated to the creation of a portfolio of potential vaccines with different profiles and produced by different companies.

Background

Today’s conclusion of the exploratory talks with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, is an important step towards the conclusion of an Advance Purchase Agreement, and therefore towards the implementation of the European Vaccine Strategy, adopted by the Commission on 17 June 2020. This strategy aims to secure for all European citizens high-quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccines within 12 to 18 months. To do so, and together with the Member States, the Commission is agreeing Advance Purchase Agreements with vaccine producers reserving or giving the Member States the right to buy a given number of vaccine doses for a certain price, as and when a vaccine becomes available.

The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.

This is why it has raised almost €16 billion since 4 May 2020 under the Coronavirus Global Response, the global action for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.

Builds on and complements Novavax-CEPI collaboration to develop and distribute NVX-CoV2373
Novavax, SK bioscience and Republic of Korea intend to partner for manufacture and supply of vaccine for global markets including South Korea
GAITHERSBURG, Md. and SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a late stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, and SK bioscience, a vaccine business subsidiary of SK Group, today announced a development and supply agreement for the antigen component of NVX-CoV2373, Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate, for supply to global markets including the COVAX Facility. In addition, the companies have signed a letter of intent with the Republic of Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare to work toward broad and equitable access to NVX-CoV2373 for the global market as well as to make the vaccine available in South Korea.

Under the terms of the agreement, SK bioscience will manufacture the vaccine antigen component for use in the final drug product globally during the pandemic period.

NVX-CoV2373 was developed using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate a stable, prefusion antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein. It contains Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant to enhance the immune response and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Phase 1 data from the Company’s Phase 1/2 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial shows that NVX-CoV2373 was generally well-tolerated and elicited robust antibody responses numerically superior to that seen in human convalescent sera.

SK bioscience, using its cell culture and recombinant protein capability, will initiate the production of the NVX-CoV2373 antigen at its vaccine facility in Andong L-house, South Korea beginning in August 2020.

This contract development and manufacturing organization agreement leverages the capacity reservation agreement between SK bioscience and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Novavax’ NVX-CoV2373 will be manufactured using a part of the reserved capacity at SK Bioscience’s “L-House” facility.

This agreement further boosts the potential global supply of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine and is an important component of Novavax’ collaboration with CEPI. Through that partnership with CEPI, Novavax has committed to develop and manufacture significant amounts of NVX-CoV2373, including vaccine derived from antigen coming from SK bioscience, if proved safe and effective, to be procured and distributed by the COVAX Facility through a globally fair allocation framework.

“We are proud to partner with SK bioscience to fulfill our commitment to ensure global supply of NVX-CoV2373 in alignment with our partnership with CEPI,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and CEO of Novavax. “SK bioscience shares our sense of urgency to ensure broad and equitable access for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate around the world.”

Jaeyong Ahn, CEO of SK bioscience said, “SK’s accumulated vaccine R&D and production capability has been spotlighted by the world’s most advanced global pharmaceutical companies as well as the global initiatives for the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and supply such as CEPI.” He added, “We will cooperate with the government supporting its two-track strategy, developing vaccine in Korea and securing COVID-19 vaccine from a global manufacturer in a short period of time.”

 The Principia’s BTK inhibitor ‘168 is developed using its Tailored Covalency platform and was evaluated in P-IIb study for MS leading reduction of 85% Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions vs PBO. In 2017, Sanofi signed exclusive WW license agreement with Principia to develop and commercialize BTK inhibitor ‘168 in MS and other CNS diseases","Sanofi to acquire Principia Biopharma

Further strengthens core R&D areas of autoimmune and allergic diseases
Provides full control of brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor SAR442168 in multiple sclerosis (MS), making commercialization more efficient and eliminating future royalty payments
Allows expansion of SAR442168 development program into other central nervous system diseases and therapeutic areas
Adds clinically advanced oral BTK inhibitor rilzabrutinib with potential across a range of immunology and inflammation indications, complementing Sanofi’s existing R&D pipeline
PARIS and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – August 17, 2020 – Sanofi and Principia Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ: PRNB), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for immune-mediated diseases, entered into a definitive agreement under which Sanofi will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Principia for $100 per share in cash, which represents an aggregate equity value of approximately $3.68 billion (on a fully diluted basis). The Sanofi and Principia Boards of Directors unanimously approved the transaction.

“This acquisition advances our ongoing R&D transformation to accelerate development of the most promising medicines that will address significant patient needs,” said Paul Hudson, Sanofi Chief Executive Officer. “The addition of multiple BTK inhibitors to our pipeline demonstrates our commitment to strategic product acquisitions in our priority therapeutic areas. Full ownership of our brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor ‘168 removes complexities for this priority development program and simplifies future commercialization.”

“The Phase 2b data in relapsing multiple sclerosis showed the strong potential of ‘168 to address disability and disease progression, and triggered the start of Phase 3 studies across the full spectrum of MS. Through this acquisition, we will be able to expand and accelerate development of BTK inhibitors across multiple indications. Both ‘168 and rilzabrutinib, have ‘pipeline in a product’ potential, and we look forward to unlocking their full treatment benefits across an array of diseases,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research & Development at Sanofi.

“Principia’s successful design and development of a whole portfolio of BTK inhibitors for immunology is aimed to transform the treatment for patients with immune-mediated diseases. By combining with Sanofi, we will bring significant resources to expand and accelerate the potential benefits of these therapies. The benefit of developing several BTK inhibitors will allow us to target specific organ systems for optimal patient benefit. The merger will provide global resources to get these novel therapies to patients faster,” said Martin Babler, President and CEO at Principia Biopharma.

Principia’s Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors add to Sanofi’s efforts to accelerate and build a portfolio of the next generation of transformative treatments for autoimmune diseases. BTK is present in the signaling pathways of key innate and adaptive cell types of the immune system. Being able to block or disrupt these signaling processes can help in stopping inflammation and tissue destruction related to autoimmune diseases and target some of the underlying pathophysiology.

BTK inhibitor ‘168: In a Phase 2b study in patients with multiple sclerosis, ‘168 reduced Gd-enhancing T1 hyperintense lesions by 85% compared to placebo. In June, Sanofi announced the first multiple sclerosis patient was enrolled in the Phase 3 program for the BTK inhibitor, comprising four pivotal clinical trials across the disease spectrum. The Principia acquisition will provide an opportunity to expand the development program to evaluate indications beyond central nervous system diseases.
Rilzabrutinib: This oral BTK inhibitor is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 program for patients with moderate to severe pemphigus, a rare, debilitating autoimmune disease that causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. A Phase 3 program for immune thrombocytopenia, a disease that causes high risk for bleeding events, is expected to be initiated by the end of 2020, assuming no COVID-19 related impact. The company also has an ongoing Phase 2 program for IgG4-related diseases, which is driven by chronic inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and fibrosis within organs that can lead to severe morbidity.
PRN473 Topical: This BTK inhibitor is a topical agent currently in Phase 1 trials and is being developed for immune-mediated diseases that could benefit from localized application to the skin.
The Principia BTK inhibitor franchise is based on its proprietary Tailored Covalency® platform that has generated potential best-in-class clinical candidates. The platform allows the design of both reversible covalent and irreversible covalent small molecule inhibitors that are more selective with less off-target effects. The optimized target residence time has potential to deliver a desired efficacy with a stronger safety profile.

In 2017, Sanofi formed a collaboration with Principia under which Principia granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize BTK inhibitor ‘168 in multiple sclerosis and other central nervous system diseases.

Transaction Terms

First and only FDA-approved subcutaneous treatment option for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody positive NMOSD that can be self-administered by a person with NMOSD or a caregiver every four weeks
First and only approved therapy for NMOSD designed to target and inhibit interleukin-6 receptor activity, using novel recycling antibody technology
Approval supported by one of the largest clinical trial programmes undertaken for this rare disease
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ENSPRYNG™ (satralizumab-mwge) as the first and only subcutaneous treatment for adults living with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). NMOSD is a rare, lifelong and debilitating autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, that primarily damages the optic nerve(s) and spinal cord, causing blindness, muscle weakness and paralysis.

“Today’s FDA approval of ENSPRYNG, the first subcutaneous NMOSD treatment using novel recycling antibody technology, builds upon the work we’ve done in multiple sclerosis with OCREVUS to develop first-in-class medicines and further the scientific understanding of neuroimmunological diseases,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We thank the NMOSD community, including patients and investigators who participated in ENSPRYNG clinical trials.”

ENSPRYNG is a humanised monoclonal antibody and the only approved therapy designed to target and inhibit interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor activity, believed to play a key role in the inflammation associated with NMOSD. The treatment was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche group, using novel recycling antibody technology, which compared to conventional technology, allows for longer duration of antibody circulation and subcutaneous dosing every four weeks.

“For people with NMOSD, relapses can cause devastating, irreversible and disabling neurological effects,” said Professor Jeffrey Bennett, University of Colorado Neurology & Ophthalmology, and investigator for the ENSPRYNG pivotal clinical trials. “Having an approved therapy that can be administered subcutaneously in the home, and has demonstrated an impact on the frequency of relapses, is an important advancement for patients.”

“We are very optimistic the addition of this new approved treatment option will make a meaningful difference for those living with NMOSD, those who love and support them and the doctors who treat them,” said Victoria Jackson, founder, The Guthy-Jackson Charitable Foundation. “When my daughter was diagnosed with NMOSD in 2008, there were no approved treatment options, and a critical lack of resources and understanding for people living with this disabling disorder. After years of dedicated effort and collaboration, the FDA approval of ENSPRYNG exemplifies how patients, industry, and academia can find solutions together.”

ENSPRYNG can be administered in the home by a person living with NMOSD or a caregiver following training from a healthcare provider. ENSPRYNG treatment is administered every four weeks after an initial loading dose.

ENSPRYNG will be available in the United States in two weeks.

FDA approval is based on results from one of the largest pivotal clinical trial programmes undertaken for this rare neurological disorder

This approval is supported by results from two randomised controlled Phase III clinical trials, the SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky studies, in which ENSPRYNG demonstrated robust and sustained efficacy and a favourable safety profile in adults with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD. Results were sustained for 96 weeks, significantly reducing the risk of relapse compared with placebo as a monotherapy and when used concurrently with baseline immunosuppressant therapy (IST), which has commonly been used to manage NMOSD symptoms associated with relapses.

In the SAkuraStar monotherapy study’s AQP4 antibody positive subgroup, 76.5% of ENSPRYNG-treated patients were relapse-free at 96 weeks, compared to 41.1% with placebo. In the SAkuraSky study, which evaluated ENSPRYNG when used concurrently with baseline IST, 91.1% of ENSPRYNG-treated AQP4 antibody positive subgroup patients were relapse-free at 96 weeks, compared to 56.8% with placebo. The primary endpoint of both SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky was time to first protocol-defined relapse (PDR) adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period.

The most common adverse reactions with ENSPRYNG (incidence ≥ 15%) were nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, gastritis, rash, arthralgia, extremity pain, fatigue and nausea.

About SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky in NMOSD
SAkuraStar is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG monotherapy administered to patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint is the time to first protocol-defined relapse (PDR), adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Results from the SAkuraStar study were presented at the 35th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), September 11-13, 2019, and were published in The Lancet Neurology in April 2020.

Ninety-five adult patients were randomised to either of the following two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio: ENSPRYNG (120 mg) or placebo. Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment period ended at 1.5 years after the enrolment of the last patient. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with ENSPRYNG in an open label extension (OLE) period. Patients with aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive or negative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by the diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD were enrolled. The number of AQP4 antibody negative patients was limited to approximately 33% of the total population of the study. Data have shown that AQP4 antibody positive patients may experience a greater likelihood of relapse and poorer long-term outcomes than AQP4 antibody negative patients.

SAkuraSky is a Phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENSPRYNG added to baseline immunosuppressant therapy in patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint was the time to first relapse as adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Results from the SAkuraSky study were published in the November 28, 2019 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

Seventy-six adult patients were randomised to either of the following two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: ENSPRYNG (120 mg) or placebo added to baseline therapy (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and/or corticosteroids). Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment ended when patients experienced a PDR; the study ended when the total number of PDRs reached 26. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with ENSPRYNG in an OLE period. Patients with AQP4 antibody positive or negative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD were enrolled. AQP4 antibody negative patients represented approximately 30% of the SAkuraSky study population.

About neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)
NMOSD is a rare, lifelong and debilitating autoimmune condition of the central nervous system that primarily damages the optic nerve(s) and spinal cord, causing blindness, muscle weakness and paralysis. People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses directly causing cumulative, permanent, neurological damage and disability. In some cases, relapse can result in death. NMOSD affects over 10,000 people in Europe, up to 15,000 people in the US and approximately 200,000 people worldwide. NMOSD can affect individuals of any age, race and gender, but is most common among women in their 30s and 40s, and appears to occur at higher rates in people of African or Asian background. There is some evidence that people of African or Asian descent may also experience a more severe disease course.

NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies (AQP4) that target and damage a specific cell type, called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain. AQP4 antibodies are detectable in the blood serum of around 70-80% of NMOSD patients.

Although most cases of NMOSD can be confirmed through a diagnostic test, people living with the condition are still frequently misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This is due to overlapping characteristics of the two disorders, including a higher prevalence in women, similar symptoms and the fact that both are relapse-based conditions.

About ENSPRYNG™ (satralizumab-mwge)
ENSPRYNG, which was designed by Chugai, a member of the Roche group, is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets IL-6 receptor activity. The cytokine IL-6 is believed to be a key driver in NMOSD, triggering the inflammation cascade and leading to damage and disability. ENSPRYNG was designed using novel antibody recycling technology, which compared to conventional technology, allows for longer duration of the antibody and subcutaneous dosing every four weeks.

Positive Phase III results for ENSPRYNG, as both monotherapy and used concurrently with baseline immunosuppressant therapy, suggest that IL-6 inhibition is an effective therapeutic approach for NMOSD. The Phase III clinical development programme for ENSPRYNG includes two studies: SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky.

ENSPRYNG is also approved in Canada, Japan and Switzerland. Applications are under review with numerous regulators, including in the EU and China.

ENSPRYNG has been designated as an orphan drug in the US, Europe and Japan. In addition, it was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of NMOSD by the FDA in December 2018.

About CLN1 disease (Infantile Batten disease)
CLN1 disease, also known as Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis or infantile Batten disease, is a rapidly progressing rare lysosomal storage disease with no approved treatment. It primarily affects the central nervous system and typically manifests during the first year of life with vision impairment that can progress to blindness, progressive motor and cognitive decline, seizures and ultimately early death. The underlying cause of the disorder is a defect in the PPT1 gene that encodes the enzyme of the same name, resulting in the accumulation of lipopigments within cells, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Some patients with CLN1 disease develop symptoms later in childhood or in adulthood; these variants are called late-infantile, juvenile, or adult-onset CLN1.

About ABO-202
ABO-202 is a novel, one-time gene therapy for CLN1 disease, a rapidly progressing rare lysosomal storage disease with no approved therapy. ABO-202 delivers a functional copy of the PPT1 gene to address the underlying gene and enzyme deficiency that leads to abnormal buildup of lipopigments and results in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

– Under Agreement, Gilead will Have Rights to Opt-in to up to 15 Targets for up to $410 Million per Program in Total Payments –

FOSTER CITY, Calif. & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Tango Therapeutics today announced an expanded strategic collaboration focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative targeted immune evasion therapies for patients with cancer.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005606/en/

Under the expanded multi-year collaboration, which builds on an agreement signed in 2018, Tango will continue to leverage its proprietary, CRISPR-enabled functional genomics target discovery platform to identify novel immune evasion targets. The number of targets covered will expand from five to 15. Gilead will have options to worldwide rights for programs directed at these targets over the next seven years. Gilead will also have the right to pay option extension fees for Tango to lead activities through early clinical development, to which Gilead will retain its option rights. Tango will have the option to co-develop and co-promote the lead products for up to five programs in the United States.

“Since we signed the original agreement two years ago, we have been very pleased with the productivity of the collaboration and with the quality of scientific discovery that has come from this partnership,” said William A. Lee, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research at Gilead Sciences. “We are looking forward to working with Tango to run additional cancer context dependent screens to identify a broader set of targets based on our immuno-oncology strategy.”

“Gilead has been a valuable strategic partner and strong scientific collaborator and we look forward to advancing programs beyond target validation under this expanded collaboration,” said Barbara Weber, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tango Therapeutics. “The productivity of our platform allows us to generate multiple targets for the collaboration while continuing to discover and develop targets independently, with the shared goal of bringing transformational therapies to patients.”

The collaboration excludes Tango’s lead programs, including one program that is expected to be in investigational new drug (IND) applicatation-enabling studies next year. Tango also retains the rights to identify targets outside the immune evasion space as it continues to build its wholly owned pipeline.

Under the terms of the collaboration, Gilead will make a $125 million upfront payment to Tango and a $20 million equity investment in the company. In addition, Gilead will have the right to option up to 15 programs over the seven-year collaboration for up to $410 million per program in opt-in, extension and milestone payments. Tango will also be eligible to receive up to low double-digit tiered royalties on net sales. For those products that Tango opts to co-develop and co-promote, the parties will equally split profits and losses, as well as development costs, in the U.S., and Tango will be eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on ex-U.S. sales.

 Roche will grant $15M as milestones to PTC following MAA acceptance. Evrysdi is an SMN2-directed RNA splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q leading to SMN protein deficiency","SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., Aug. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTCT) today announced the acceptance of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The EMA previously granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation to risdiplam for the treatment of people with SMA, providing a pathway for accelerated evaluation by the agency. The milestone triggers a $15 million payment to PTC from Roche.

“The acceptance of the MAA for Evrysdi™ marks an important milestone as we continue towards the goal of making this ground-breaking therapy available globally to a broad range of SMA patients,” said Stuart W. Peltz, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of PTC Therapeutics. “Evrysdi™ has consistently demonstrated clinically meaningful results in multiple clinical trials with a favorable safety profile. Evrysdi™ is an oral medicine that can be delivered and taken at-home, which is particularly important for SMA patients during the COVID-19 global pandemic.”

The submission, which was filed by Roche, is based on data from the dose-finding Part 1 and confirmatory Part 2 of the FIREFISH and SUNFISH studies which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) in symptomatic infants with type 1 SMA aged 2 to 7 months and in people with types 2 or 3 SMA aged 2 to 25 years, respectively. In addition, the submission incorporates safety data from JEWELFISH, a trial in people with all types of SMA aged 1 to 60 years previously treated with other SMA therapies. The results of an exploratory efficacy analysis from SUNFISH Part 1 showed Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) significantly improved motor function after 24 months of treatment compared to natural history data. Part 2 of the FIREFISH study met its primary endpoint of infants sitting without support for five seconds by month 12, as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III). Part 2 of the SUNFISH trial in non-ambulatory children and adults demonstrated that change from baseline in total Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) score was significantly greater at 12 months in people treated with Evrysdi™ (risdiplam), compared to placebo.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of SMA for adults and children 2 months and older. Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) is based on PTC science and is commercialized in the United States by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Evrysdi™ is a product of the SMA collaboration between PTC, the SMA Foundation, and Roche.

About Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications. It is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately one in 11,000 babies. SMA leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

SMA is caused by loss of function mutations or deletions of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that results in a deficiency of SMN protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests SMA is a multi-system disorder and the loss of SMN protein may affect many tissues and cells.

About Evrysdi™ (risdiplam)

Evrysdi™ is a survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2)-directed RNA splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Evrysdi™ is designed to distribute evenly to all parts of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Evrysdi™ is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or feeding tube. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy for adults and children 2 months and older. Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) is marketed in the United States by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group.

About the Risdiplam Clinical Studies

FIREFISH (NCT02913482): an open-label, two-part pivotal study, was designed to assess Evrysdi™ safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in patients aged 1 to 7 months with type 1 SMA. Part 1 evaluated several doses of Evrysdi™ and determined the therapeutic dose for Part 2.

SUNFISH (NCT02908685): a two-part, placebo-controlled, multicenter pivotal trial, was designed to assess Evrysdi™ safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD in people with type 2 or 3 SMA aged 2 to 25, including those with scoliosis and joint contractures at baseline.

Clinical Trial Safety Data

The safety profile of Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) was established across FIREFISH and SUNFISH pivotal trials. The most common adverse reactions in later-onset SMA (incidence of at least 10% of patients treated with Evrysdi™ and more frequently than control) were fever, diarrhea, and rash. The most common adverse reactions in infantile-onset SMA were similar to those observed in later-onset SMA patients. Additionally, the most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 10%) were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, and vomiting.

In addition to FIREFISH and SUNFISH, Evrysdi™ is being evaluated in a broad range of people with SMA, including in:

JEWELFISH (NCT03032172): an open-label, exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi™. Recruitment for this study is complete with 174 people enrolled.

RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334): an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study investigating the efficacy, safety, PK and PD of Evrysdi™ in infants (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.

45957,AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) Receives the US FDA's Priority Review for Less Frequent Fixed-Dose Use in NSCLC and Bladder Cancer,"Imfinzi granted FDA Priority Review for less-frequent, fixed-dose use","The US FDA has accepted sBLA and granted PR to Imfinzi (1500mg) for a new 4wks. FD regimen to treat patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC after CT and prior treated advanced bladder cancer, consistent with the approved dosing in ES-SCLC
 The company anticipates the PDUFA date in Q4’20. The sBLA is based on multiple clinical trials, including results of P-III CASPIAN trial in ES-SCLC which used the 4wks., FD regimen during maintenance
 If approved, the new dosing will be available as an alternative to the approved weight-based dosing of 10mg/kg q2w","Option would extend dosing to four weeks in non-small cell lung and bladder cancer reducing medical visits by half
AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) has received acceptance for its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and has also been granted Priority Review in the US for a new four-week, fixed-dose regimen for treatment in the approved indications of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bladder cancer.

If approved, Imfinzi could be administered intravenously every four weeks at a fixed dose of 1500mg in unresectable Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy and previously treated advanced bladder cancer, consistent with the approved dosing in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that offer significant advances over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions, or enhancing patient compliance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for their regulatory decision, is during the fourth quarter of 2020.

If approved, the new dosing will be available as an alternative to the approved weight-based dosing of 10mg/kg every two weeks. The sBLA was based on data from several Imfinzi clinical trials, including results from the Phase III CASPIAN trial in ES-SCLC which used the four-week, fixed-dose regimen during maintenance.

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “The new less-frequent dosing option for non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer will simplify and improve treatment by enabling continuity of care while minimising the risk of exposure to infection in the healthcare setting. This takes on particular urgency during the current pandemic, as doctors care for patients at high risk of COVID-19 complications. We are working with health authorities in the US and other countries to bring the option of four-week, fixed dosing for Imfinzi to patients around the world as soon as we can.”

Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and several other countries. Additionally, it is approved in the US and under review in Japan and other countries for ES-SCLC. Imfinzi was also recently recommended for marketing authorisation in the EU for this indication.

Stage III NSCLC

Stage III (locally-advanced) NSCLC is commonly divided into three sub-categories (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), defined by how much the cancer has spread locally and the possibility of surgery.1 Stage III disease is different from Stage IV disease, when the cancer has spread (metastasised), as the majority of Stage III patients are currently treated with curative intent.1,2

Stage III NSCLC represents approximately one-third of NSCLC incidence and in 2015 was estimated to affect nearly 200,000 patients in the following eight key countries: China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and the US, with approximately 43,000 cases in the US alone.3,4 The majority of Stage III NSCLC patients are diagnosed with unresectable tumours.5 Prior to approval of Imfinzi in this setting, no new treatments beyond chemoradiation therapy had been available to patients for decades.6-9

Bladder cancer

In 2018, approximately 550,000 people were diagnosed with bladder cancer around the world and 200,000 died from the disease.10 Locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer remains an area of unmet medical need and typically only one in seven patients are alive five years after diagnosis.11 Urothelial cancer (UC) is the most common form of bladder cancer.12 UC is the 10th most common cancer worldwide and the 13th most common cause of cancer death.10,13 PD-L1 is widely expressed in tumour and immune cells in patients with bladder cancer and helps tumours evade detection from the immune system.14

Imfinzi

Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.

AstraZeneca in lung cancer

AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. AstraZeneca aims to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso (osimertinib) and its ongoing Phase III trials LAURA, NeoADAURA and FLAURA2.15-17

AstraZeneca is committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate, is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments. In addition, DS-1062, a trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed ADC, is in early development for advanced NSCLC where TROP2 is overexpressed in the majority of tumours.18

An extensive Immuno-Oncology development programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.19 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials MERMAID-1, AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline including Enhertu.

AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology

Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

AstraZeneca in oncology

AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas – Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism, and Respiratory & Immunology. Based in Cambridge, UK, AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide.

– Priority Review for trilaciclib is based on positive data from three randomized clinical trials showing robust myelopreservation benefits
– G1 launching expanded access program (EAP) for patients with small cell lung cancer in the U.S.

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Aug. 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — G1 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GTHX), a clinical-stage oncology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for trilaciclib for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients being treated with chemotherapy and granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of February 15, 2021. Trilaciclib is a first-in-class investigational therapy designed to preserve bone marrow and immune system function during chemotherapy and improve patient outcomes.

“There are currently no available therapies to protect patients from chemotherapy-induced toxicities before they occur,” said Raj Malik, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, R&D. “If approved, trilaciclib would be the first proactively administered myelopreservation therapy that is intended to make chemotherapy safer and reduce the need for rescue interventions, such as growth factor administrations and blood transfusions.”

The FDA grants Priority Review to applications for potential therapies that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. The trilaciclib NDA was supported by compelling myelopreservation data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which trilaciclib was administered prior to chemotherapy treatment in patients with SCLC. Trilaciclib has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA. In the NDA acceptance letter, the FDA also stated that it is currently not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application.

“While undergoing chemotherapy, many patients experience significant myelosuppression, become fatigued and susceptible to infection, and often require transfusions and growth factor administrations,” said Jared Weiss, M.D., Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC. “Preventing bone marrow damage proactively is an opportunity to improve the quality of life of patients receiving chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer and reduce costly rescue interventions.”

Myelosuppression is the result of damage to bone marrow stem cells and is one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy. Myelosuppression can lead to serious conditions such as anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, which have broad ranging clinical, patient experience and economic impacts on ongoing cancer treatment and overall outcomes. In clinical trials, trilaciclib significantly reduced chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and patients receiving trilaciclib experienced fewer dose delays/reductions, infections, hospitalizations, and need for rescue therapies compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

Expanded Access Program
G1 is making trilaciclib available to SCLC patients in the U.S., who are unable to enter clinical trials and for whom there are no appropriate alternative treatments while the trilaciclib NDA is under regulatory review, pursuant to FDA’s expanded access program (EAP). To facilitate needed access through the EAP, G1 is collaborating with Bionical Emas, a global specialist clinical research organization (CRO). For more information about the EAP access to trilaciclib, email patient.access.us@Bionical-emas.com.

“Complications from myelosuppression have been a long-standing challenge when treating patients with SCLC,” said Dr. Malik. “Establishing an expanded access program provides qualified patients in serious need with access to trilaciclib while the NDA is under review.”

Trilaciclib in Small Cell Lung Cancer
Trilaciclib is a first-in-class investigational therapy designed to improve outcomes for people with cancer treated with chemotherapy. In 2019, trilaciclib received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and, in June 2020, G1 submitted the NDA based on myelopreservation data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which trilaciclib was administered prior to chemotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In August 2020, G1 received FDA Priority Review with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of February 15, 2021.

In June 2020, G1 announced a co-promotion agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim for trilaciclib in small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. If approved, G1 will lead marketing, market access and medical engagement initiatives for trilaciclib. The Boehringer Ingelheim oncology commercial team, well-established in lung cancer, will lead sales force engagement initiatives. G1 will book revenue and retain development and commercialization rights to trilaciclib and pay Boehringer Ingelheim a promotional fee based on net sales. The three-year agreement does not extend to additional indications that G1 is evaluating for trilaciclib. Press release details of the G1/ Boehringer Ingelheim agreement can be found here.

Evaluating Trilaciclib in Other Cancers
In a randomized trial of women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, preliminary data showed that trilaciclib improved overall survival when administered in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The company plans to present final overall survival data from this trial in the fourth quarter of 2020. Trilaciclib is being evaluated in neoadjuvant breast cancer as part of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL™, and the company expects to initiate a Phase 3 trial in patients treated with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer in the fourth quarter of 2020.

 In 2019, Lilly and Innovent began commercializing Tyvyt in China after receiving approval for r/r classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma post-2L systemic CT and was included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies","INDIANAPOLIS and SUZHOU, China, Aug. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Innovent Biologics, Inc. (HKEX: 01801) today announced a global expansion of their strategic alliance for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody immuno-oncology medicine that was co-developed by Innovent and Lilly in China.

Innovent logo (PRNewsFoto/Eli Lilly and Company)
In 2019, Lilly and Innovent began commercializing TYVYT in China after being granted marketing approval for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy. TYVYT is the only PD-1 inhibitor to be included in China’s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and is included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies.

Lilly and Innovent currently co-commercialize TYVYT in China. Under the terms of the expanded license agreement, Lilly will obtain an exclusive license for TYVYT for geographies outside of China and plans to pursue registration of TYVYT in the U.S. and other markets. In return, Innovent will receive an upfront payment of $200 million and will be eligible for up to $825 million in potential development and commercial milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales. Both companies will also retain the right to study TYVYT in combination with other medicines as part of their own clinical programs.

The two companies are also studying TYVYT as a potential therapy in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and several other types of cancer. Earlier this month, the two companies released encouraging interim analysis data from ORIENT-11 at the IASLC World Conference on Lung Cancer 2020 Virtual Presidential Symposium. ORIENT-11 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating TYVYT or placebo in combination with Alimta® (pemetrexed for injection) and platinum chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. Based on the interim analysis conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, TYVYT in combination with Alimta and platinum chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with placebo in combination with Alimta and platinum chemotherapy, which met the pre-defined efficacy criteria. A supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for this indication is under regulatory review in China. The companies look forward to future submissions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies for this and other indications.

“We are thrilled to expand on our successful China TYVYT collaboration with Lilly to now include markets outside of China. This agreement also marks the first solid step in getting Innovent’s innovative portfolio into the global market,” said Michael Yu, Ph.D., Founder, Chairman and CEO of Innovent. “We are confident that pairing Lilly’s global commercial expertise with TYVYT’s clinical profile will further accelerate our mission, benefitting patients globally.”

“Lilly Oncology is dedicated to delivering life-changing medicines and support to people living with cancer and those who care for them,” said Anne White, president of Lilly Oncology. “Our alliance with Innovent successfully brought TYVYT to market in China. Through this expansion of our collaboration, we hope to make TYVYT accessible to patients globally. We believe TYVYT could deliver significant value to people living with cancer around the world and we intend to continue to study its potential across tumor types.”

This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The transaction will be reflected in Lilly’s reported results and financial guidance according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). There will be no change to Lilly’s 2020 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance as a result of this transaction.

About TYVYT (Sintilimab Injection)
TYVYT (sintilimab injection) is an innovative drug with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Lilly in China. TYVYT has been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy and was included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies.

In April 2020, the NMPA accepted the supplemental new drug application for TYVYT in combination with ALIMTA (pemetrexed for injection) and platinum as first-line therapy in advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In May 2020, TYVYT combined with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy met the predefined primary endpoint in the Phase 3 ORIENT-12 study as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. TYVYT monotherapy met the primary endpoint in the ORIENT-2 study as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well. In August 2020, the NMPA accepted the sNDA for TYVYT in combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC.

TYVYT is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1/ PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies with TYVYT to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials.

TYVYT (sintilimab injection) is not an approved product in the United States. ALIMTA(pemetrexed for injection) is not approved for use in combination with TYVYT in the United States.

U.S. INDICATIONS FOR ALIMTA® (pemetrexed for injection)
ALIMTA is indicated:

in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with nonsquamous metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.
in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
as a single agent for the maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.
as a single agent for the treatment of patients with recurrent metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy. Limitation of Use: ALIMTA is not indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer.
in combination with cisplatin, for the initial treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) whose disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery.
U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ALIMTA® (pemetrexed for injection)
CONTRAINDICATION

ALIMTA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression Without Vitamin Supplementation

ALIMTA can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation.
Prior to treatment with ALIMTA, patients must be instructed to initiate supplementation with oral folic acid. Intramuscular injections of vitamin B12 are also required prior to ALIMTA treatment. Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation should be continued during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of ALIMTA as they may reduce the severity of treatment-related hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities. Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer ALIMTA until the ANC is at least 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm3. Permanently reduce ALIMTA in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm3 or platelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm3 in previous cycles.
In Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%, respectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the ALIMTA arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm. In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%.
Renal Failure

ALIMTA can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal toxicity. Determine creatinine clearance before each dose and periodically monitor renal function during treatment with ALIMTA.
The incidences of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA with cisplatin were 2.1% in Study JMDB and 2.2% in Study JMCH. The incidence of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA as a single agent ranged from 0.4% to 0.6% (Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI).
Withhold ALIMTA in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 mL/min.
Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity

Serious and sometimes fatal, bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin toxicity, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, can occur with ALIMTA. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for severe and life-threatening bullous, blistering, or exfoliating skin toxicity.
Interstitial Pneumonitis

Serious interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal cases, can occur with ALIMTA treatment. Withhold ALIMTA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, or fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, permanently discontinue ALIMTA.
Radiation Recall

Radiation recall can occur with ALIMTA in patients who have received radiation weeks to years previously. Monitor patients for inflammation or blistering in areas of previous radiation treatment. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for signs of radiation recall.
Increased Risk of Toxicity With Ibuprofen in Patients With Renal Impairment

Exposure to ALIMTA is increased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment who take concomitant ibuprofen, increasing the risks of adverse reactions of ALIMTA. In patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA. If concomitant ibuprofen use cannot be avoided, monitor patients more frequently for ALIMTA adverse reactions, including myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in developmental delays and increased malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg/m2. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 3 months after the final dose.
DRUG INTERACTIONS

Ibuprofen increases exposure (AUC) of pemetrexed. In patients with creatinine clearance between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min:
Avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA.
Monitor patients more frequently for myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity, if concomitant administration of ibuprofen cannot be avoided.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

Severe adverse reactions (Grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) versus ALIMTA with platinum chemotherapy + placebo for initial treatment (KEYNOTE-189), respectively, were fatigue (12% vs 6%); diarrhea (5% vs 3%); dyspnea (3.7% vs 5%); vomiting (3.7% vs 3%); nausea (3.5% vs 3.5%); rash (2% vs 2.5%); decreased appetite (1.5% vs 0.5%); constipation (1% vs 0.5%); and pyrexia (0.2% vs 0%).
Common adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in ≥20% of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ALIMTA in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) versus ALIMTA with platinum chemotherapy + placebo for initial treatment (KEYNOTE-189), respectively, were nausea (56% vs 52%); fatigue (56% vs 58%); constipation (35% vs 32%); diarrhea (31% vs 21%); decreased appetite (28% vs 30%); rash (25% vs 17%); vomiting (24% vs 23%); cough (21% vs 28%); dyspnea (21% vs 26%); and pyrexia (20% vs 15%).
USE IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS

Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of pemetrexed or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from ALIMTA, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIMTA and for one week after the last dose.
Males of Reproductive Potential: ALIMTA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible.
Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ALIMTA in pediatric patients have not been established. Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients studied were similar to those observed in adults.
Patients with Renal Impairment: ALIMTA is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Decreased renal function results in reduced clearance and greater exposure (AUC) to ALIMTA compared with patients with normal renal function. No dose is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min.
Geriatric: The incidences of Grade 3-4 anemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and neutropenia were higher in patients 65 years of age and older as compared to younger patients: in at least one of five randomized clinical trials.

46073,Regeneron Collaborates with Roche to Improve the Global Supply of REGN-COV2 Against COVID-19,Roche and Regeneron collaborate to significantly increase global supply of REGN-COV2 investigational antibody combination for COVID-19,"The two global companies collaborated to develop, manufacture, and distribute REGN-COV2 across the globe. The agreement is expected to increase the supply of REGN-COV2 to at least 3.5 times the current capacity with the potential for expanding it further
 Regeneron will lead the distribution in the US while Roche will be responsible for the distribution outside the US, both will bear distribution expenses in their designated territories. Each partner will dedicate a manufacturing capacity to REGN-COV2 every year while the collaborators have started the technology transfer process
 The partners will jointly fund and execute the ongoing P-III prevention and P-I healthy volunteers safety studies as well as additional global studies to assess the potential for REGN-COV2 against COVID-19. Additionally, Roche will solely responsible for the initial EMA’s approval or conducting any additional studies required for approval outside the US","REGN-COV2 is Regeneron’s two-antibody combination currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection.
The companies will collaborate on developing and manufacturing REGN-COV2. Regeneron will distribute REGN-COV2 in the U.S. and Roche will be responsible for distribution outside the U.S.
Under this collaboration, the overall capacity of REGN-COV2 is expected to increase by at least three and a half times, substantially increasing the number of doses available to patients in the U.S. and around the world. 
Basel, 19 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) announced today that they are joining forces in the fight against COVID-19 to develop, manufacture and distribute REGN-COV2, Regeneron’s investigational antiviral antibody combination, to people around the globe. REGN-COV2 could provide a much-needed treatment option for people already experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, and also has the potential to prevent infection in people exposed to the virus, thus slowing the spread of the global pandemic. This collaboration is expected to increase supply of REGN-COV2 to at least three and a half times the current capacity, with the potential for even further expansion.

REGN-COV2 is currently being studied in two Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and in a Phase 3 trial for the prevention of COVID-19 in household contacts of infected individuals. If it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted, Regeneron will distribute and record sales for REGN-COV2 in the U.S. and Roche will be responsible for distribution outside the U.S.

“We are excited about the potential for one medicine to serve both as a treatment for those infected as well as protection for people exposed to the virus. REGN-COV2 could be a critical line of defense against the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Bill Anderson, Chief Executive Officer of Roche Pharmaceuticals. “We’re committing our manufacturing expertise and capacity, and our global distribution network to bring Regeneron’s potential antibody combination to as many people around the world as we possibly can.”

“Regeneron has progressed the REGN-COV2 research and development program at record speed and worked tirelessly to maximize our in-house manufacturing capacity,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. “This major collaboration with Roche provides important scale and global expertise to bring REGN-COV2 to many more patients in the United States and around the globe.”

Under the terms of the agreement, each company has committed to dedicate a certain manufacturing capacity to REGN-COV2 each year, and the collaborators have already begun the technology transfer process. Each company will bear its own distribution expenses in their designated territories. The collaborators will jointly fund and execute the ongoing Phase 3 prevention and Phase 1 healthy volunteers safety studies as well as additional global studies to evaluate further the potential for REGN-COV2 in treating or preventing COVID-19. Roche will be primarily responsible for securing regulatory approvals outside the U.S., following the initial European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval, and conducting any additional studies specifically required for approval by regulators outside the U.S.

About REGN-COV2
REGN-COV2 was designed specifically by Regeneron scientists to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s proprietary VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form REGN-COV2 bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in recent Science publications.

REGN-COV2’s development, manufacturing and clinical trials have been funded in part by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need. This partnership is an additional step in Roche’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already included:

Launching COVID-19 diagnostic tests for active infection and the detection of antibodies in patients who have been exposed to the virus,
Investigating treatments from our existing portfolio to better understand their potential to treat patients with COVID-19,
Increasing manufacturing and supply chain capacity to meet product demand across our portfolio within the wider context of COVID-19 treatment, and
Ensuring the supply of our existing medicines and diagnostics to patients around the world under exceptional conditions.
Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Also in June we received an FDA EUA for the Elecsys® IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as launching Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. Roche has an ongoing clinical trial program evaluating the role of Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) in COVID-19 pneumonia. On 29 July we announced that the COVACTA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality. The study was the first global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial investigating Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. Roche remains committed to continuing the Actemra/RoActemra clinical trial programme in COVID-19 to further explore Actemra/RoActemra in other treatment settings, including in combination with an antiviral. In addition to COVACTA, Roche has initiated several studies to further investigate Actemra/RoActemra as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, including two phase III clinical trials, REMDACTA and EMPACTA, as well as the phase II MARIPOSA trial. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

46085,Sanofi's Dupixent (dupilumab) Receives the Health Canada Approval for Severe Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis,DUPIXENT (dupilumab injection) now approved by Health Canada for severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis,"The Health Canada has approved a new indication as an add-on maintenance treatment with intranasal corticosteroids in patients with CRSwNP, inadequately controlled by systemic corticosteroids or surgery
 The approval is based on P-III studies (24wks. SINUS-24 and 52wks. SINUS-52) assessing Dupixent (300mg, q2w) + SOC intranasal corticosteroids vs PBO + intranasal corticosteroids. The studies demonstrated improvement in its 1EPs and 2EPs @24wks.
 The approval makes the Dupixent first approved biologic in Canada for CRSwNP. Dupixent is a fully mAb inhibiting the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 proteins and is not an immunosuppressant","First biologic approved in Canada for adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)1
Third indication for DUPIXENT® in Canada following moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents2
MISSISSAUGA, ON, Aug. 18, 2020 /CNW/ – Sanofi Canada announced today that Health Canada approved a new indication for DUPIXENT® (dupilumab injection), as an add-on maintenance treatment with intranasal corticosteroids in adult patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) inadequately controlled by systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery,3 making it the first biologic for the treatment of this disease in Canada.4

CRSwNP is a chronic, type 2 inflammatory disease of the upper airway that obstructs the sinuses and nasal passages. It can lead to breathing difficulties, nasal congestion and discharge, reduced or loss of sense of smell and taste and facial pressure.5

“At Sanofi Genzyme, we are committed to making a difference for patients by introducing innovative therapies that address unmet needs. The approval of Dupixent® for CRSwNP provides patients with the first biologic treatment to address the type 2 inflammation that underlies this debilitating disease,” says Marissa Poole, Country Lead, Sanofi Canada and General Manager, Sanofi Genzyme Canada.

DUPIXENT® is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) proteins6 and is not an immunosuppressant. Data from DUPIXENT® clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis and CRSwNP.

“Current standard of care therapies for CRSwNP use combinations of intranasal and systemic corticosteroids, with endoscopic sinus surgery, or ESS, used to treat patients not controlled by medication. Unfortunately, surgery is not universally effective, and in certain instances, disease can recur in as little as six months after surgery,“ says Dr. Martin Desrosiers, Clinical Professor, Program Director, ORL-HNS, Université de Montréal. “Until now, therapeutic options for patients with surgery-unresponsive disease has been repeat surgery, with some patients undergoing as many as 10 previous surgeries. In clinical trials, DUPIXENT® has shown the capacity to control disease in this hard to treat group of patients, without resorting to surgery. The availability of DUPIXENT® thus provides a welcome new treatment option to help Canadian patients living with the burden of uncontrolled CRSwNP.”

About the DUPIXENT® Clinical Program

The Health Canada approval is based on two pivotal Phase 3 trials (the 24-week SINUS-24 and 52-week SINUS-52) that evaluated DUPIXENT® 300 mg every two weeks plus standard-of-care intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo plus intranasal corticosteroids.7 In these trials, patients treated with DUPIXENT® achieved statistically significant improvements in all primary and secondary endpoints at 24 weeks.8 Treatment effects on nasal congestion and loss of smell were observed with the first assessment at 4 weeks and showed continued improvement for the duration of the trials.9 In the CRSwNP clinical trials, the common (at least 1%) adverse events in the DUPIXENT® group were inflammation of the eye and eyelids (conjunctivitis), high count of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia), injection site reactions and injection site swelling.10

About DUPIXENT®

DUPIXENT® was first approved by Health Canada on November 30, 2017 and remains the only biologic medicine for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.11 In September 2019, Health Canada expanded the approval to include adolescents aged 12 years and older.12

DUPIXENT® is jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

46095,Johnson & Johnson to Acquire Momenta Pharmaceuticals for $6.5B,"Johnson & Johnson to Acquire Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Expanding Janssen’s Leadership in Novel Treatments for Autoimmune Diseases","J&J acquires Momenta in all-cash transaction at a price of $52.50/ share, making a total deal value as $6.5B. The transaction is expected to be closed in H2’20
 The acquisition allows J&J to expand its portfolio for autoimmune diseases with the addition of Momenta’s Nipocalimab (M281) to its pipeline. In addition to nipocalimab, Janssen will acquire Momenta’s pipeline of clinical and pre-clinical assets
 Janssen plans to retain Momenta’s presence in Cambridge, Massachusetts which will increase J&J footprint and capabilities in the key innovation hub. Nipocalimab provides an opportunity for Janssen to deliver transformative treatments in autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases","NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases, in an all cash transaction for approximately $6.5 billion.

This acquisition provides an opportunity for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson to broaden its leadership in immune-mediated diseases and drive further growth through expansion into autoantibody-driven disease. The transaction will include full global rights to nipocalimab (M281), a clinically validated, potentially best-in-class anti-FcRn antibody. Nipocalimab gives Janssen the opportunity to reach significantly more patients by pursuing indications across many autoimmune diseases with substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Nipocalimab recently received a rare pediatric disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Momenta’s expertise in FcRn mechanisms is especially important for nipocalimab as it supports and accelerates the development of a medicine designed to target a number of autoantibody-driven conditions across several of Janssen’s established therapeutic areas. Janssen expects nipocalimab to contribute to its goals of achieving above-market growth over the mid and long term.

Autoimmune diseases driven partially or completely by autoantibodies represent a novel area where Janssen can significantly improve health outcomes for patients. In autoantibody-driven diseases, the body’s antibodies attack or damage its own proteins, cells and tissues, often with devastating consequences. Autoantibody-driven diseases include Myasthenia Gravis, Hemolytic Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn, warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, and other serious dermatologic, rheumatic, neurologic, hematologic and renal diseases. An estimated 2.5 percent of the population, or approximately 195 million people worldwide, suffer from some form of autoantibody-driven disease, many of which are orphan and rare diseases.

With competitively differentiated, parallel development programs and full worldwide commercial rights for nipocalimab, Janssen will have the potential to introduce multiple launches, many as first-in-class indications with potential for significant peak year sales, some of which could exceed $1 billion, supporting Janssen’s goal of continuing to deliver above-market performance over the long term.

“This acquisition broadens Janssen’s leadership in autoimmune diseases and provides us with a major catalyst for sustained growth. Autoantibody-driven diseases are often serious, and patients are underserved by current treatment options,” said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson. “We’re excited by the opportunity to further advance patient care by combining Johnson & Johnson’s world-class R&D, commercial and supply chain capabilities with Momenta’s talented people, pipeline and deep expertise in this important area.”

In addition to Momenta’s employees and lead asset nipocalimab, Janssen will acquire Momenta’s pipeline of clinical and pre-clinical assets. The acquisition was driven by the significant opportunity seen in nipocalimab, along with the scientific capability Janssen is acquiring with the Momenta team. Janssen’s plans for additional assets in the Momenta pipeline will be determined as more data become available and could offer further upside potential.

“Nipocalimab, and the rest of Momenta’s pipeline, built over many years by outstanding scientists who have turned important insights into actionable biology, expands and complements our portfolio by giving us clinical-stage and discovery-stage compounds in autoantibody biological pathways. Combining Momenta’s discoveries with our 20-year heritage in immunology, global scope, and scientific and medical expertise, we see a real opportunity to create an entire ‘pipeline in a pathway,'” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “We are excited about the significant potential to expand on Momenta’s excellent progress in rare diseases, and to increase our impact on patients both within and beyond our current focus areas.”

Janssen plans to retain Momenta’s presence in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This site will increase Johnson & Johnson’s existing innovation footprint and capabilities in the greater Boston area given Momenta’s talented scientists, suite of proprietary technologies, sophisticated laboratories and proximity to top talent in this innovation hub.

About the Agreement
Under the terms of the transaction, which was approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Vigor Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (the Company), will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Momenta for $52.50 per share. The closing of the offer is conditioned on the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Momenta’s common stock on a fully diluted basis, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The $6.1 billion estimated net value of the transaction is based on Momenta’s estimated fully diluted shares outstanding, less estimated net cash at time of closing. Assuming the closing of the tender offer, the Company will acquire any shares of Momenta not tendered into the tender offer through a merger of Merger Sub with and into Momenta for the same per share consideration as will be payable in the tender offer. The merger will be effected as soon as practicable after the closing of the tender offer. Following completion of the merger, Momenta’s common stock will no longer be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. While the closing of the transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive, the Company is maintaining its current 2020 Adjusted EPSi guidance range. Looking ahead, the costs associated with the development of Momenta’s portfolio are expected to be incremental to planned R&D investment levels over the next few years given the value creation potential of our current portfolio, and thus expect this incremental investment in R&D to have an EPS impact worth approximately $0.10–$0.15 in 2021. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination.

About Janssen’s Approach to Autoimmune Disease
Janssen has pioneered breakthrough science in autoimmune diseases with five approved therapies to treat more than 30 pediatric and adult indications. Significant unmet need remains, since many autoimmune diseases have few or no approved treatments, and only a small fraction of those living with autoimmune disease ever achieve sustained clinical remission.

Janssen pursues research and development in both functional manifestations of disease (disease area strongholds) and biological pathways (pathway area strongholds). Biological pathways identify mechanisms through which seemingly dissimilar diseases can be connected by genetic, molecular or cellular systems in the body. It is now understood that multiple, diverse autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need are linked by the same immune pathways.

Janssen’s pathways-centric strategy opens the door to fully develop compounds for multiple diseases sharing a common pathway, thus challenging the concept of one drug for one disease. In addition, as scientific understanding of the immune system expands, there is increasing recognition of its impact on more diseases than previously understood.

46114,Roche's Tecentriq + Bevacizumab Receive Health Canada's Approval as 1L Treatment for Unresectable or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Health Canada grants market authorization for Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab, the first immunotherapy combination treatment, for the most common form of liver cancer","The approval is based on P-III IMbrave150 study assessing Tecentriq (1200 mg) + bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, q3w, IV) vs sorafenib (400mg, bid) in 501 patients in a ratio (2:1) with unresectable or metastatic HCC, prior not treated with systemic therapies
 Results: 42% reduction in risk of death (OS); 41% reduction the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS); @primary analysis, median survival follow up time (8.6mos.); 7.6mos. delay in median time to deterioration of patient-reported QoL
 The approval is part of Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA’s OCE which provides a framework for simultaneous submission and review of oncology products among international partners","Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to the previous standard of care[3]

MISSISSAUGA, ON, Aug. 19, 2020 /CNW/ – Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) today announced that Health Canada has granted market authorization for Tecentriq (atezolizumab for injection), in combination with bevacizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who require systemic therapy.[4]

HCC is one of the fastest rising cancers in Canada with incidence rates almost tripling since the early 1980s.[5] In 2019, an estimated 3,000 Canadians were diagnosed with liver cancer[6] and of those, HCC was the most common form.[7] Liver cancer is often diagnosed at the advanced stage of the disease[8] resulting in limited treatment options and poor prognosis.[9],[10] On average, 5-year survival rates are 19%,[11] which underscores the need for new effective treatment options. The main risk factors for liver cancer are chronic liver disease and cirrhosis caused by viral hepatitis and excessive alcohol intake.[12]

The Canadian authorization was granted by Health Canada as a part of Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) which provides a framework for simultaneous submission and review of oncology products among international partners.[13] This important initiative gives international regulators the ability to provide patients with cancer, like those with HCC, access to pivotal products sooner.[14] Simultaneous applications were submitted in Canada, the United States, Australia and Singapore.

The approval of Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab is likely to change clinical practice for many patients with previously untreated unresectable HCC,” said Dr. Jennifer Knox, Staff Medical Oncologist, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto. “I’m pleased that for the first time in over a decade I am able to offer patients a new therapy that data indicates can delay progression and improve overall survival in a more meaningful way for my patients.”

This authorization is based on results from the randomized Phase III IMbrave 150 study.[15] The study showed Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab reduced the risk of death (overall survival; OS) by 42% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.58; 95% CI: 0.42-0.79; p=0.0006) and reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival; PFS) by 41% (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.47-0.76; p<0.0001), compared with sorafenib,[16] the current standard of care for the treatment of HCC in Canada.[17]

IMbrave150 is the first Phase III cancer immunotherapy study to show an improvement in OS and PFS in people with unresectable HCC compared with sorafenib. This marks the first time in more than a decade that a new treatment showed a significant improvement and a clinical benefit over standard of care for patients with unresectable HCC.[18]

“Hepatocellular carcinoma is a fast-growing cancer in Canada and one often diagnosed late and is without multiple treatment options,” said Jackie Manthorne, President and CEO, Canadian Cancer Survivors Network. “We are pleased to see this combination gain approval in Canada providing new and important treatment options for patients.”

About the IMbrave150 study
IMbrave150 is a global Phase III, randomized, multi-center, open-label study, conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab, in patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC, who have not received prior systemic treatment. A total of 501 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either Tecentriq 1,200 mg and 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab every three weeks administered via IV infusion, or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice per day.[19]

The co-primary efficacy endpoints as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF) were OS and PFS according to evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST v1.1). At the time of the primary analysis, patients had a median survival follow up time of 8.6 months. The data demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS as assessed by IRF per RECIST v1.1 with Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab compared to sorafenib. A statistically significant improvement was also observed in confirmed objective response rate (ORR).[20]

The study findings also demonstrated a 7.6-month delay in median time to deterioration of patient-reported quality of life (a predefined descriptive secondary endpoint) with Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab compared with sorafenib (11.2 versus 3.6 months; HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.46–.85).[21]

The most common adverse reactions (≥10 %) in the IMbrave150 study included: hypertension (29.8%), fatigue (20.4%), pyrexia (17.9%), proteinuria (20.1%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (19.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased (14%), blood bilirubin increased (13.1%), weight decreased (11.2%), platelet count decreased (10.6%), pruritus (19.5%), rash (12.5%), diarrhea (18.8%), constipation (13.4%) , abdominal pain (12.2%), nausea (12.25), vomiting (10%), decreased appetite (17.6%), cough (11.9%), epistaxis (10.3%), infusion related reaction (11.2%).[22]

About the Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) and bevacizumab combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of Tecentriq plus bevacizumab in combination. The combination may enhance the ability of the immune system to combat a broad range of cancers. Bevacizumab, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance Tecentriq’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression, promoting T-cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T-cell responses against tumour antigens.[23]

About Tecentriq® (atezolizumab)
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to directly bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells. This blocks the interactions of PD-L1 with other cell-surface receptors which regulate the activation or suppression of T-cells.[24]

Roche has a development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across several types of lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.[25]

In Canada, Tecentriq is authorized in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) for the first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, as well as in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of people with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations, and no prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Tecentriq is also authorized for the treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations should have disease progression on a therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving Tecentriq. It is also authorized in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy. In addition, Tecentriq is authorized conditionally and is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression with 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing therapy. It is also conditionally authorized in combination with chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

46161,Fitbit Reports Results of its COVID-19 Study for Early Detection of Diseases,Early Findings from Fitbit COVID-19 Study Suggest Fitbit Devices Can Identify Signs of Disease at Its Earliest Stages,"In May’2020, Fitbit has launched its COVID-19 study to build an algorithm that detects COVID-19 before symptoms starts. The study has enrolled 1000+ positive patients across the US and Canada is now delivering its first, preliminary results 90 days later
 The study demonstrated that its devices could detect ~50% of COVID-19 cases one day before participants reported the onset of symptoms such as fever, cough, or muscle aches
 The algorithm is under development and worked with 70% specificity, or a 30% rate of false positives. The study reinforces that breathing rate, resting heart rate and HRV are all useful metrics for indicating onset of illness and are best tracked at night, when the body is at rest","The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of staying healthy, and our mission to help people live healthier lives has never been more important. Since the start of this global health crisis, the Fitbit research team has been diligently working to help make a difference in the fight against COVID-19. This includes accelerating work on early disease detection, an effort led by our team of data scientists with deep expertise in machine learning and predictive modeling.

In May, we announced the launch of the Fitbit COVID-19 study aimed at building an algorithm that detects COVID-19 before symptoms start. In just over two months, more than 100,000 Fitbit users across the US and Canada have enrolled, with more than 1,000 positive cases of the virus reported. This study presents an exciting opportunity to see how the power of the Fitbit community will help us better understand this new and complex disease. If you’re interested in contributing to this research, you can join here or in the Assessments & Discover tab in the Fitbit app.

Because data to help detect COVID-19 is of critical global importance, we’ve submitted our early research for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. While we work to finalize the publication, we have made the full manuscript publicly available as a preprint, which allows us to share some of the preliminary findings.

Early Findings From Fitbit COVID-19 Study
So far, we’re encouraged to see physiological signs of disease detected by Fitbit devices simultaneously with study participants’ reporting the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and in some cases even before.

Based on the findings of our study, we can detect nearly 50 percent of COVID-19 cases one day before participants reported the onset of symptoms with 70 percent specificity.

This is important because people can transmit the virus before they realize they have symptoms or when they have no symptoms at all. If we can let people know they should get tested a day before symptoms begin, they can isolate and seek care sooner, helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

As researchers, we are always working to find a balance between sensitivity (alerting people who may be sick) and specificity (the ability to identify people who are healthy), as there are trade-offs to both. We will continue to work with the clinical and public health communities to evaluate different models for developing this technology to ensure the optimal balance.

Our study also reinforces that breathing rate, resting heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) are all useful metrics for indicating onset of illness and are best tracked at night, when the body is at rest. Our research shows that HRV, which is the beat-to-beat variation of the heart, often decreases in people who are exhibiting symptoms of illness, while resting heart rate and breathing rate are often elevated. In some cases, those metrics begin to signal changes nearly a week before participants reported symptoms.

Other findings include:

On average, heart rate variability hits its lowest point the day after symptoms are reported
Increases in resting heart rate normalize, on average, at least 5–7 days after the start of symptoms
Breathing rate peaks typically on day 2 of symptoms, but there is a slight elevation, on average, for up to 3 weeks after symptoms start

Understanding Symptoms and Severity of COVID-19
In addition to detecting early signals of COVID-19, we also are gleaning some insights into common symptoms, as well as severity, duration of illness and the symptoms most likely linked to hospitalization. Many of these observations align with what we’re hearing from other researchers and public health officials. For example, being older, male, or having a high BMI increases the likelihood of severe outcomes.

In addition, our study found that shortness of breath and vomiting are the symptoms most likely to predict that someone with COVID-19 will need to be hospitalized, while sore throat and stomachache were the symptoms least likely to predict the need for hospitalization.

We’re also seeing that the most common symptom reported by individuals with COVID-19 was fatigue, which was present in 72 percent of participants reporting having COVID-19. This was followed by headache (65 percent), body ache (63 percent), decrease in taste and smell (60 percent), and cough (59 percent). Of note, fever was present in just 55 percent of people reporting COVID-19, an indicator that temperature screening alone may not be enough to understand who might be infected.

Mild cases (those who recovered at home on their own) show a median duration of 8 days, while moderate cases (those who recovered at home with help from others) last about a week longer, with a median duration of 15 days. For severe cases (patients who end up requiring hospitalization), the median duration of illness was approximately 24 days. But this duration had a large spread, with several cases lasting longer than two months.


What’s Next for the Fitbit COVID-19 Study
It’s clear that our bodies start to signal impacts from the disease before more noticeable symptoms appear. With these initial signals identified, we’ll continue our work in developing an algorithm to detect diseases like COVID-19 and focus on expanded research in a real-world environment.

Early detection is critical, and we hope to bring this type of information to consumers as soon as possible. As a next step, we’ll continue to work with our research partners like Scripps Research Translational Institute and Stanford Healthcare Innovation Lab to further validate the technology and intend to engage with the appropriate regulators globally to determine the best path to bring this to consumers.

The two-step process uses advanced QIAseq technologies to conduct reverse transcription and cDNA synthesis from a viral RNA sample, then generate libraries compatible with Illumina sequencing platforms. The workflow is faster and has lower-input requirements compared to hybrid capture solutions.

The panel is supported with software pipelines tailored to SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis using QIAGEN’s CLC Genomics Workbench. The optimized and configurable pipelines allow researchers to identify viral genome sequence variation across samples, and to visualize strain divergence across populations and geographies using phylogenetic approaches. QIAGEN also provides a complete Sample to Insight SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing Service covering all aspects of the workflow, from RNA isolation to NGS library preparation and data analysis.

The first independent study using the new QIAGEN workflows, an analysis of COVID-19 epidemiology in India, has been published in the Journal of Biosciences. The study used QIAGEN’s QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit for extraction of RNA. Researchers used the QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel for viral genome amplification in samples that did not generate sufficient NGS reads, converting the RNA to double-stranded cDNA and amplifying it, then generating libraries for sequencing on an Illumina instrument. The sequences were assembled and analyzed using QIAGEN CLC Genomics Workbench. The full study can be found at https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/045/0076.

“We urgently need more research into the evolution of this virus. As we found in eastern India, mutations are emerging in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that might modulate viral transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world. Genomic research is required to improve understanding of transmission patterns, tracking of the outbreak and formulation of effective containment measures,” said Dr. Arindam Maitra, Associate Professor at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics in India, one of the authors. “We found that a viral genome amplification method like the QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel was ideal for looking at low copy number, or high CT samples when compared to other methods.”

As a global leader in NGS solutions for evaluation of microbiomes and metagenomics, QIAGEN also offers a complete QIAseq workflow to expedite metatranscriptomics research and efficiently decipher the complex interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the host and its microbiota. A recently published study by Shah, S.J., et al. (2020) has illustrated the application of QIAseq FastSelect rRNA removal technology in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 metatranscriptomics, leading to a more comprehensive evaluation of co-infection rates in COVID-19 patients.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, QIAGEN’s initiatives focus on building the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions for COVID-19 testing. These include ramping up production of viral RNA extraction for use on QIAGEN’s QIAcube, QIAsymphony and EZ1 platforms as well as third-party instruments; building up a range of PCR tests on the QIAstat-Dx and NeuMoDx systems that enable COVID-19 detection while analyzing samples at the same time for other respiratory infections; and delivering universal next-generation sequencing (NGS) solutions for use with any sequencer, in particular gene panels like the QIAseq SARS-CoV-2, which are integrated with bioinformatics for analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. QIAGEN is also scaling up production capacity for reagents sold to other companies for use in their own COVID-19 tests.

The initial trial is expected to be followed by pivotal trials with a goal of potentially receiving an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) as early as the end of this year.
Animal model data (Syrian Golden Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2) confirm the neutralizing profile and high potency of this antibody, expected effective dose in human to be at least 5 times lower than current known antibodies being assessed in other active trials.
Additional in-vitro experiments demonstrated the complete virus neutralizing property of STI-1499 against the highly contagious D614G SARS-CoV-2 variant.
Sorrento has initiated cGMP manufacturing to produce 50,000 doses, expected to be available by the end of this year, in anticipation of a potential EUA.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) announced that it is filing an investigational new drug application (IND) for COVI-GUARD (STI-1499) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients today.

Sorrento has previously received guidance from the FDA in response to a pre-IND meeting package and believes it has addressed all questions and followed the recommendations from the agency for all sections of the IND.

As Sorrento previously announced, in preclinical studies, STI-1499 demonstrated 100% neutralizing effect (in vitro) of the antibody and that a low dose prevented SARS-CoV-2 from infecting healthy cells in such preclinical in vitro studies.

Animal data generated by Dr. Paessler’s laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) in Syrian Golden Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, justify the IND filing and continued clinical development. This established model, while limited, is the most predictive animal model currently available for this disease. The data were presented to federal agencies and will be published as soon as possible in a scientific journal.

The highest proposed dose (200 mg per patient) in the phase 1 safety trial is a much lower dose than currently being tested for other known antibodies in active clinical studies. The potentially higher potency of the antibody may allow for faster scaled manufacturing (availability to patients) and potentially a lower cost per dose as compared to other known antibodies currently being evaluated.

STI-1499 antibody has also been evaluated in preclinical studies against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the highly contagious D614G mutant, the current dominant strain globally. In such preclinical studies, the antibody has been 100% effective against the highly contagious D614G mutant strain at a low dose.

More information about the phase 1 clinical trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT# 04454398).

Under the terms of the expanded agreement, CENTOGENE and Evotec will work together to research, discover, and develop therapeutic options related to the deficiency of the protein GBA, a gene linked to Gaucher disease. The collaboration brings together Evotec’s leading induced pluripotent stem cell (“iPSC”) platform and broad drug discovery and development capabilities with CENTOGENE’s global proprietary rare disease platform, including iPSC lines, to address the needs of this orphan drug indication. The collaboration builds on the partnership Evotec and CENTOGENE entered in 2018 with the goal to discover and develop novel small molecules in rare hereditary metabolic diseases.

Dr Cord Dohrmann, Chief Scientific Officer of Evotec, commented: “The partnership with CENTOGENE supports and complements our patient-centric drug discovery approach in Gaucher disease. We highly value CENTOGENE’s biomarker expertise and real-world data-based global proprietary rare disease platform, which fits perfectly to our iPSC-based drug discovery platform. The combination should help identify disease-modifying treatments for this underserved patient population.”

Prof. Arndt Rolfs, CEO of CENTOGENE, said: “Our collaboration with Evotec further underlines CENTOGENE’s commitment to driving biomarker discoveries and accelerating orphan drug by leveraging our global expertise in rare hereditary diseases. In particular, we are able to draw on over 20 years of knowledge and research of Gaucher disease. By continuing our work alongside Evotec, we will accelerate transformational medical solutions in the rare disease field.”

Basel, August 20, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kesimpta® (ofatumumab, formerly OMB157) as an injection for subcutaneous use for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that has shown superior efficacy with a similar safety profile compared with teriflunomide and is a first-choice treatment option for RMS patients1. Kesimpta is the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered once monthly at home via the Sensoready® autoinjector pen3.

“This approval is wonderful news for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In the key clinical studies, this breakthrough treatment produced a profound reduction in new brain lesions, reducing relapses and slowing underlying disease progression1,” said Professor Stephen L. Hauser, Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and co-chair of the steering committee for the ASCLEPIOS I and II studies. “Through its favorable safety profile and well-tolerated monthly injection regimen, patients can self-administer the treatment at home, avoiding visits to the infusion center1.”

One of the goals when managing RMS is to preserve neurological function to slow down the worsening of disability4. Despite the availability of several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the treatment of RMS, the majority of individuals with RMS continue to experience disease activity5. Evidence suggests early initiation of high-efficacy treatment can improve long-term outcomes for patients with RMS6.

“Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex disease, and response to disease modifying treatment will vary among individuals,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research at the National MS Society. “This makes it important to have a range of treatments available with different mechanisms of action and routes of administration. We are pleased to have an additional option approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.”

Traditionally, B-cell treatments, which bind to and deplete B-cells associated with disease activity in MS, have predominantly been available in hospitals or infusion treatment centers, which can add costs to the healthcare system and present a lifestyle burden for some patients7,8. Kesimpta provides patients the flexibility of self-administering via once-monthly subcutaneous dosing requiring no premedication, eliminating the need to travel to an infusion center. The positive results from the APLIOS study—an open-label Phase II study to determine the bioequivalence of subcutaneous delivery of Kesimpta via a prefilled syringe and a Sensoready pen in patients with RMS—and the ASCLEPIOS studies show Kesimpta to be a highly effective B-cell therapy that can be easily self-administered at home1,3.

“At Novartis, we challenge treatment paradigms and strive to offer the best treatment choice for patients,” said Marie-France Tschudin, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “When treating patients with RMS, Kesimpta is a meaningful treatment option that delivers both high efficacy and safety with the ability for patients to have more freedom in managing their disease. The development of Kesimpta is a great example of our commitment, knowledge and understanding of multiple sclerosis, which enabled us to identify a targeted treatment that can significantly improve patient outcomes and experience.”

Ofatumumab was first approved by the FDA in 2009 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as an intravenous infusion with a high dose, administered by a healthcare provider. Ofatumumab was then investigated in an entirely new development program in RMS, as B-cells are known to play a critical role in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as MS7. The clinical development program for ofatumumab in RMS took 10 years and has involved more than 2,300 patients around the world as part of rigorous studies that were reflective of the broad patient population. Kesimpta was found to work through a distinct mode of action, and the treatment regimen (dosing)—which was specifically designed for RMS—plays a critical role in the outcome9. This is a different dosing regimen and route of administration than was previously approved for the CLL indication.

The approval of Kesimpta is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority versus teriflunomide in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR, primary endpoint), 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions1. Results from these two studies were recently published in the August 6, 2020 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

Kesimpta is expected to be available in the United States in early September.* Additional regulatory filings are currently underway across the world, and regulatory approval for Kesimpta in Europe is expected by Q2 2021.

*Time of availability may vary as healthcare providers integrate Kesimpta into their practices.

About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies
The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Kesimpta 20 mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus teriflunomide 14 mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1,882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.51. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries10. Kesimpta demonstrated a significant reduction in ARR by 51% (0.11 vs 0.22) and 59% (0.10 vs 0.25) compared with teriflunomide (P<.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively (primary endpoint). Kesimpta also showed a relative risk reduction of 34.4% (P=.002) in 3-month CDP compared with teriflunomide in pre-specified meta-analysis, as defined in ASCLEPIOS1.

Kesimpta showed significant reduction of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions. It significantly reduced the mean number of both Gd+ T1 lesions (98% and 94% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (82% and 85% relative reduction in ASCLEPIOS I and II, respectively, both P<.001) vs teriflunomide1.

Kesimpta had a similar safety profile to teriflunomide, with the frequency of serious infections and malignancies also being similar across both treatment groups1. Upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection-related reactions, and local injection site reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions with Kesimpta (incidence greater than 10%)1.

A separate post hoc analysis demonstrated Kesimpta may halt new disease activity
in RMS patients. It showed the odds of achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3; no relapses, no MRI lesions, and no disability worsening combined) with ofatumumab versus teriflunomide were >3-fold higher at Months 0–12 (47.0% vs 24.5% of patients; P<.001) and >8-fold higher at Months 12–24 (87.8% vs 48.2% of patients; P<.001)2.

Overall Kesimpta, an antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered superior efficacy and demonstrated a safety profile with infection rates similar to teriflunomide1.

About APLIOS study
The APLIOS study is a 12-week, open-label, Phase II bioequivalence study to determine the onset of B-cell depletion with Kesimpta subcutaneous monthly injections and the bioequivalence of subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta via a prefilled syringe—as used in ASCLEPIOS I and II—and a Sensoready pen in patients with RMS. Patients were randomized according to injection device and site including the abdomen and the thigh. B-cell depletion was measured nine times over 12 weeks and Gd+ lesion counts were assessed at baseline and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. Regardless of injection device or site, Kesimpta 20 mg subcutaneous monthly injections resulted in rapid, close to complete and sustained B-cell depletion; the proportion of patients with B-cell concentrations of <10 cells/μL was >65% after the first injection by Day 7, 94% by Week 4, and sustained >95% at all following injections. Kesimpta treatment reduced the mean number of Gd+ lesions from baseline (1.5) to 0.8, 0.3 and 0.1 by Weeks 4, 8 and 12, respectively; the proportion of patients free from Gd+ lesions at the corresponding time points were 66.5%, 86.7% and 94.1%, respectively3.

About Kesimpta® (ofatumumab, formerly OMB157)
Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that provides the flexibility of self-administration for adults with RMS. It is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously1,3. Initial loading doses of Kesimpta are given at Weeks 0, 1 and 2, with the first injection performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As shown in preclinical studies, Kesimpta is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion9. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen11. Once-monthly dosing of Kesimpta also allows faster repletion of B-cells and offers more flexibility12. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 201513.

About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage in the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord14. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide15, can be characterized into four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS)16. The various forms of MS can be distinguished based on whether a patient experiences relapses (clearly defined acute inflammatory attacks of worsening neurological function), and/or whether they experience progression of neurologic damage and disability from the onset of the disease14.

46452,"Jazz Pharmaceuticals' Xywav (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Cataplexy or Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Associated with Narcolepsy","Jazz Pharmaceuticals Announces U.S. FDA Approval of Xywav(calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) Oral Solution for Cataplexy or Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Associated with Narcolepsy","The FDA approval is based on P-III study results assessing Xywav vs PBO in 201 patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy in the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy
 The study resulted in statistically significant differences in weekly number of cataplexy attack and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores
 Xywav, also known as JZP-258 is targeted for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. Additionally, the USDEA has designated Xywav as a Schedule III medicine also contains a boxed warning of as a central nervous system depressant","Xywav is the first FDA approved new treatment option indicated for both cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in people living with narcolepsy in more than 15 years 

Xywav contains 92 percent less sodium per nightly dose than sodium oxybate, a current standard of care for this patient population as designated by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Guidelines 

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder and is associated with an increased prevalence of certain comorbid conditions, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease

DUBLIN, July 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Xywav™ (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution on July 21, 2020 for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy.1,2 Xywav is an oxybate product with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92 percent less sodium – or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night – than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6 to 9 grams.1

The company plans to launch Xywav by the end of the year following Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) implementation. Jazz is committed to ensuring access to our medicines and will work to secure the broadest access possible for appropriate patients.

The FDA approval of Xywav is based on a global Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study that demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Xywav in the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy. In the study, which enrolled 201 patients, Xywav demonstrated highly statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) in weekly number of cataplexy attacks and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores compared to placebo.3

Multiple Xywav dosing options are available for adult and pediatric patients. Prescribers can titrate Xywav into unequal doses taken over the course of the night. When patients start Xywav after sodium oxybate, Xywav treatment is initiated at the same dose and regimen as sodium oxybate (gram for gram) and titrated as needed based on efficacy and tolerability.1

“Based on the efficacy demonstrated in the clinical program, the approval of Xywav is important for people living with cataplexy or EDS associated with narcolepsy.1 Xywav makes it possible for patients to have a lower-sodium oxybate treatment option. This may help patients taking sodium oxybate better align with daily sodium intake recommendations including those by the American Heart Association,4” said Richard K. Bogan, MD, FCCP, FAASM, associate clinical professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, a medical officer at SleepMed in Columbia, SC and lead investigator of the Phase 3 study. “The average American consumes too much sodium.5 Excess sodium intake has been linked with increases in blood pressure, hypertension, stroke, and other cardiovascular disease.6,7,8,9”

Sodium oxybate carries warnings about its high sodium content,10 and was previously the only product approved to treat both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy 7 years of age and older11 and designated as a standard of care for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.12 With the goal of establishing a new standard of care, Xywav was developed to provide people with narcolepsy an oxybate therapy with lower sodium, and does not carry warnings about sodium content.

Xywav has a Boxed Warning as a central nervous system depressant, and for its potential for abuse and misuse. Because of the risks of CNS depression and abuse and misuse, Xywav is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the Xywav and Xyrem REMS Program. Most common adverse reactions in adults (≥5%) were headache, nausea, dizziness, decreased appetite, parasomnia, diarrhea, hyperhidrosis, anxiety and vomiting.1

“We have been working for nearly a decade to develop Xywav, a unique oxybate product with a significant reduction in sodium. We are proud to advance the science behind our sleep research program in order to continue making a difference for people living with narcolepsy,” said Bruce Cozadd, chairman and CEO of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. “Jazz is committed to addressing unmet needs in sleep medicine, which includes our innovative and long-standing oxybate program.”

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurologic condition with no cure and the illness burden can have a far-reaching impact on a patient’s health over time.13,14,15,16 As an established leader in sleep medicine, Jazz is commited to raising awareness about narcolepsy and helping patients find strategies to manage this sleep disorder.

“Many people with narcolepsy can go years before being properly diagnosed and this can have a significant impact to their everyday life,” said Julie Flygare, president and CEO of Project Sleep. “Narcolepsy is a life-long condition so it is important to have new options to help treat EDS and cataplexy.”

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has designated Xywav as a Schedule III medicine. The DEA defines Schedule III drugs, substances, or chemicals as drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.17

It is also being studied for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adult patients. Xywav is comprised of a unique composition of cations resulting in 92 percent less sodium, or approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night, than sodium oxybate at the recommended dosage range of 6 to 9 grams. Xywav has the same oxybate concentration as sodium oxybate and includes a mix of calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium cations. While the exact mechanism of action of Xywav is unknown, it is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of Xywav on cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness are mediated through GABAB actions during sleep at noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons.1

Important Safety Information

WARNING: Taking XYWAV with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as medicines used to make you or your child fall asleep, including opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic medicines, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or street drugs, may cause serious medical problems, including trouble breathing (respiratory depression), low blood pressure (hypotension), changes in alertness (drowsiness), fainting (syncope), and death.

The active ingredient of XYWAV is a form of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Abuse or misuse of illegal GHB alone or with other drugs that cause changes in alertness (or consciousness) has caused serious side effects. These effects include seizures, trouble breathing (respiratory depression), changes in alertness (drowsiness), coma, and death. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has any of these serious side effects.

Because of these risks, you have to go through the XYWAV and XYREM REMS Program to have your or your child’s prescription for XYWAV filled.

Do not take XYWAV if you take or your child takes other sleep medicines or sedatives (medicines that cause sleepiness), drinks alcohol, or has a rare problem called succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

Keep XYWAV in a safe place to prevent abuse and misuse. Selling or giving away XYWAV may harm others, and is against the law. Tell your doctor if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs.

Anyone who takes XYWAV should not do anything that requires them to be fully awake or is dangerous, including driving a car, using heavy machinery, or flying an airplane, for at least 6 hours after taking XYWAV. Those activities should not be done until you know how XYWAV affects you or your child.

XYWAV can cause serious side effects, including the following:

Breathing problems, including slower breathing, trouble breathing, and/or short periods of not breathing while sleeping (sleep apnea). People who already have breathing or lung problems have a higher chance of having breathing problems when they use XYWAV.
Mental health problems, including confusion, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), unusual or disturbing thoughts (abnormal thinking), feeling anxious or upset, depression, thoughts of killing yourself or trying to kill yourself, increased tiredness, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, or difficulty concentrating. Tell your doctor if you or your child have or had depression or have tried to harm yourself or themselves. Call your doctor right away if you have or your child has symptoms of mental health problems or a change in weight or appetite.
Sleepwalking. Sleepwalking can cause injuries. Call your doctor if you or your child starts sleepwalking. Your doctor should check you or your child.
The most common side effects of XYWAV in adults include headache, nausea, dizziness, decreased appetite, parasomnia (a sleep disorder that can include abnormal dreams, abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, sleep paralysis, sleep talking, sleep terror, sleep-related eating disorder, sleep walking, and other abnormal sleep-related events), diarrhea, excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), anxiety and vomiting.

The most common side effects of XYWAV in children include bedwetting, nausea, headache, vomiting, weight decrease, decreased appetite, and dizziness.

XYWAV can cause physical dependence and craving for the medicine when it is not taken as directed. These are not all the possible side effects of XYWAV.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

About Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by EDS and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.2,15,18 It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the United States, with symptoms typically appearing in childhood or adolescence.19,20,21 Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis.22,23 There are five main symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.24 While all people with narcolepsy experience EDS, not all individuals with narcolepsy experience all five symptoms.15,23 EDS is the primary symptom of narcolepsy and is present in all people with the disorder.21,25 EDS is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in drowsiness and unplanned lapses into sleep.19,21,22 Narcolepsy is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.13,14,26,27

 

About Cataplexy
Cataplexy, the most specific symptom of narcolepsy, is the sudden, generally brief (<2 minutes) loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness. It is usually triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, surprise, or anger.19,21 Although many emotions can potentially trigger cataplexy, those associated with mirth are usually the most potent.21 Cataplexy occurs in about 70 percent of people with narcolepsy.29 Presentation differs widely among people with narcolepsy, ranging from sporadic partial attacks triggered by laughter to frequent complete collapse brought about by a variety of emotions.19,21 Complete collapse is less common.19,21 More commonly, episodes of cataplexy involve only certain muscle groups, such as arms and legs (e.g., knees buckling), the head and neck (e.g., head dropping), or the face and jaw (e.g., sagging, slurred speech, eyelid drooping).19,21,28,29
