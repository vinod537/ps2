<span class=""xn-location"">PHILADELPHIA</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 9, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: LCI) today announced that it has added a new co-development agreement for biosimilar insulin aspart with its strategic alliance partners within the HEC Group of companies (HEC). Insulin aspart, a short-acting (fast-acting) insulin typically taken just before eating, is used to treat adults with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes for the control of high blood sugar. Total U.S. sales for the 12 months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2020</span> of various insulin asparts, including NovoLog<sup>®</sup>, exceeded <span class=""xn-money"">$6.0 billion</span>, according to IQVIA, although actual biosimilar market values are expected to be lower.

Insulin aspart is a distinct product opportunity for Lannett and in addition to the company's previously announced insulin glargine opportunity. Combined, the two insulin products represent a U.S. market of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$16.0 billion</span>, according to IQVIA.

The product is currently in development and Lannett will help manage the remaining clinical and regulatory steps specific for a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market the product. Lannett will fund most of the clinical development requirements, while HEC continues to develop the product and related manufacturing infrastructure. Lannett and HEC will share in the profits of the venture.

""Biosimilar insulin aspart is a significant opportunity for us and adds another large, durable and complementary product to our development portfolio,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Tim Crew</span>, chief executive officer of Lannett. ""The new HEC manufacturing site has the capacity to support double digit market share for both products. Moreover, we believe the clinical program for biosimilar insulin aspart will be quite similar to the clinical program for our biosimilar insulin glargine product, which is around one year further along in development.""

Crew added that only a handful of competitors have the requisite technical expertise and have committed the financial resources, particularly on the manufacturing front, to develop the capacity needed to be successful in biosimilar insulin aspart or biosimilar insulin glargine programs.

NovoLog<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of Novo Nordisk A/S.

LEIDEN, <span class=""xn-location"">Netherlands</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 10, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <b>Vico Therapeutics</b>,<b> </b>a Leiden, <span class=""xn-location"">the Netherlands</span>, based biotech company focusing on the development of RNA modulating therapies for rare neurological disorders, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted orphan drug designation for VO659, Vico's investigational antisense oligonucleotide therapy for the treatment of Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA). The orphan designation was based on a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP). Vico previously received orphan drug designation for VO659 in Huntington Disease.

<i>""</i>Spinocerebellar Ataxias<i> make up a great part of the so called polyglutamine disorders</i>, <i>debilitating and progressive diseases, leading to significant impairment of mobility, speech, and multiple other daily activities of patients suffering from this condition. So far, there is no treatment which can halt the progression of these diseases,"" </i><b>said <span class=""xn-person"">Rupert Sandbrink M.D</span>. Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Vico</b><i>.</i>

<i>""Our investigational RNA modulating therapy is designed to lower the mutant protein levels causing these neurodegenerative diseases. We're pleased to receive orphan drug designation, which recognizes both the unmet medical need for patients living with spinocerebellar ataxias, and the potential of our approach.""</i>

Qualified for orphan drug designation are drugs and biologics intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or conditions that impact fewer than 5 in 10,000 patients in the European Union. Orphan drug designation gives developing companies certain benefits, including clinical protocol assistance, reduced regulatory fees, research grants and 10 years of market exclusivity following regulatory approval.

<b>About SCA</b>

Spinocerebellar ataxia's (SCA) are a group of rare, progressive hereditary genetic disorders that affects the cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord. More than 30 types of SCAs have been identified to date (SCA1–SCA36), and the most common SCAs (types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7) are caused by translated CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions that encode elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in the respective disease proteins. Presence of the elongated polyQ stretch confers pathogenic properties to the resulting protein through a dominant gain-of-function mechanism, resulting in degeneration of specific neuronal subpopulations that differ between the different SCA types. For SCA1 and SCA3 disease manifestation includes ataxia of gait, stance, and limbs, dysarthria, and oculomotor abnormalities. To date, there are no disease-modifying therapies.

<b>About VO659</b>

VICO's lead antisense oligonucleotide product, VO659 is designed to suppress mutant proteins and slow or halt disease progression. A major strength of Vico's approach is the broad applicability to different polyQ diseases and the preferential reduction of mutant relative to normal polyQ proteins.

<b>About Vico Therapeutics</b>

Vico Therapeutics is a Leiden, <span class=""xn-location"">the Netherlands</span>, based biotech company focusing on the development of RNA modulating therapies for rare severe neurological disorders. Vico's antisense oligonucleotide platform (AON) is focusing on different forms of Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) and Huntington Disease (HD). Its early discovery RNA editing platform is directed towards RETT syndrome.

Vico was founded in 2019 by highly experienced entrepreneurs <span class=""xn-person"">Luc Dochez</span> and <span class=""xn-person"">Josh Mandel-Brehm</span> and seasoned scientists Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Judith van Deutekom</span> and Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Gail Mandel</span> with strong academic reputations and vast industry experience. Vico closed a Series A financing of €27 million in <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2020</span> which was led by Life Science Partners (LSP), co-led by Kurma Partners, and supported by Pontifax, Droia Genetic Disease, Polaris Partners and Pureos Bioventures and Idinvest Partners.

<strong>New York, Wednesday 10 February 2021</strong> – Digital therapeutic company, Kaia Health, unveils the next-generation, complete musculoskeletal (MSK) care solution for employers and health plans. Kaia Gateway will include a case review service and clinical triage algorithms, while Kaia Premium Partners will provide native interoperability with select providers – all within Kaia’s existing solution. The new treatment concept is based on what Kaia has already evaluated in the industry’s largest randomized controlled trial (RCT). Kaia’s next generation offering also expands support to chronic, acute, and presurgery care for back, neck, hip, knee, shoulder, hand/wrist, and foot/ankle pain.

Up until today, Kaia Health’s digital MSK program has treated 450,000 patients with evidence-based care, more than any other digital MSK vendor. Kaia Health’s MSK app features patented Motion Coach™ computer vision technology, which tracks the body by measuring thousands of data points every minute during exercising and a functional movement test. It provides ongoing support and real-time, automated PT-grade exercise feedback, creating a more personalized, effective, and engaging experience than sensor straps or monthly tele-PT video calls.
<h2 class=""hdln-d"">Introducing the all-new Kaia Gateway</h2>
Accessed via Kaia Health’s existing digital MSK program, Kaia Gateway will be the new front door for all MSK patients. Each will be screened using a clinical triage algorithm, which analyzes various clinical dimensions to identify patients at risk of needing more invasive or intense treatment. Those with medical issues, or likely to elect into surgery, will be directed to a Kaia Health medical provider for further consultation.

An AI-enabled escalation algorithm will monitor patients longitudinally for clinical and behavioral patterns that might warrant an intervention by a Kaia Health medical professional or health coach. Integrating a case review service will reduce costs, as the likelihood of unnecessary elective surgery varies drastically depending on whom patients speak with first.<sup>1</sup>

“Kaia Gateway creates an unprecedented level of understanding of MSK patients and their progression,” says Justin Yang, Kaia Health’s U.S. Chief Medical Officer. “The algorithms now include Motion Coach™ data in addition to self-reported and adherence data. The Motion Coach™  insights thus now drive our clinical decision making in addition to patient engagement. This richer dataset will offer a more informed user case review and allow Kaia Gateway to make better patient choices in the treatment app or via one of our partners.”
<h2 class=""hdln-d"">Introducing Premium Partners</h2>
Already today, Kaia Health coaches refer out to other medical services in an employer or health plan’s ecosystem using pathways configured during implementation. Premium Partners will take this one stage further and set a new precedent for employee benefits interoperability by offering the most sophisticated integration option available in the MSK market.

Premium Partners will have access to detailed treatment history including insights from Motion Coach™, disease progression, exercise level information, and medical surveys. Kaia has already built out bi-directional referrals and warm transfers, single sign-on capability, incentive program integrations and automated data exchange APIs with its first Premium Partners. Additional Premium Partners offerings include other evaluated general and specialty care solutions, such as digital interventions, disease management programs, PT, telemedicine, care navigation, and expert medical opinion services.

“Kaia Health is the next-generation MSK solution to integrate with the existing care landscape, one that addresses MSK cases across an expanded MSK care spectrum,” says Jonas Duss, Kaia Health’s U.S. CEO. “Our goal is to create a happier, healthier and less-costly workforce together with our Premium Partners.”

Kaia Health has among the industry’s most robust clinical evidence with the largest published randomized control trial [<em><a href=""https://www.dovepress.com/digital-treatment-of-back-pain-versus-standard-of-care-the-cluster-ran-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JPR"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">source</a></em>], and a rigorous claims-based ROI methodology [<em><a href=""https://www.kaiahealth.com/blog/kaia-health-trial-program-significantly-improves-msk-pain-lowers-medical-claims-for-self-insured-employer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">source</a></em>].

In a recent regional health system deployment, Kaia Health’s MSK app use resulted in a 22% medical claims net cost saving and a 50% decrease in MSK pain level. For employers, Kaia Health’s MSK app has demonstrated a more than 20% decrease in medical spend [<em><a href=""https://www.kaiahealth.com/blog/kaia-health-trial-program-significantly-improves-msk-pain-lowers-medical-claims-for-self-insured-employer/"">source</a></em>].

MSK conditions affect 126.6 million Americans<sup>2</sup>, which results in annual costs to U.S. employers of $120 billion.<sup>3</sup>  MSK conditions cost businesses an average of $425 per employee per year<sup>4</sup> in medical bills, affect 25% of their workforce and account for 16% of overall medical spend.

Kaia’s next generation solution will be available starting Q3 2021 with Kaia Gateway (Case Review service, Triage &amp; Escalation algorithms, and expanded joint coverage). Premium Partners will be rolling out on an ongoing basis. The preventative program will conclude the rollout on January 1, 2022.

<p align=""justify""><b>Foster City, CA and Mechelen, Belgium, 10 February 2021, 15.00 CET; regulated information – </b> Galapagos NV (Euronext &amp; NASDAQ: GLPG) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) today announced the decision to halt the ISABELA Phase 3 clinical studies with the investigational autotaxin inhibitor ziritaxestat in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The decision is based on the recommendations of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) which, following a regular review of unblinded data, concluded that ziritaxestat’s benefit-risk profile no longer supported continuing these studies. Detailed data of the ISABELA studies will be presented at future medical meetings.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Investigators are being informed of the decision and they will be contacting their study participants to discontinue the investigational treatment.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The ISABELA Phase 3 program consists of two identically designed trials, ISABELA 1 &amp; 2, aiming to enroll 1,500 IPF patients combined. Patients continued on their standard of care background treatment and were randomized on to either 200mg or 600mg ziritaxestat once daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was the rate of decline of forced vital capacity until week 52.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are very disappointed not to be able to bring a novel medication to patients suffering from such a devastating disease with high unmet need. We would like to thank the patients and the medical professionals who participated in the ISABELA studies and contributed to the advancement of IPF research.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span> and <span class=""xn-location last-child"">BERKELEY, Calif.</span>, Feb. 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Caribou Biosciences, Inc., a leading clinical-stage CRISPR genome editing biotechnology company, announced today that they have entered into a collaboration and license agreement for the research and development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapeutics. Although allogeneic, ""off-the-shelf"" CAR-T cell therapies have shown early promise in some cancer patients, the need for overcoming the rejection of allogeneic CAR-T cells by the host immune system remains a key challenge to their broader development. Employing Caribou's CRISPR genome editing platform to engineer CAR-T cells to withstand host immune attack would enable the development of the next-generation of ""off-the-shelf"" cellular therapies to benefit a broader patient population.

Under the multi-year agreement, AbbVie will utilize Caribou's next-generation Cas12a CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA (chRDNA) genome editing and cell therapy technologies to research and develop two new CAR-T cell therapies directed to targets specified by AbbVie. AbbVie will have exclusive rights to Caribou's next-generation Cas12a chRDNA genome editing and cell therapy technologies for the selected targets. Caribou will conduct certain pre-clinical research, development, and manufacturing activities for the collaboration programs, and AbbVie will reimburse Caribou for all such activities pursuant to the collaboration. AbbVie is responsible for all clinical development, commercialization, and manufacturing efforts. AbbVie has the option to pay a fee to expand the collaboration to include up to an additional two CAR-T cell therapies. Caribou will receive <span class=""xn-money first-child"">$40 million</span> in an upfront cash payment and equity investment, along with up to <span class=""xn-money last-child"">$300 million</span> in future development, regulatory, and launch milestones. Caribou may also receive additional payments for commercial milestones as well as global tiered royalties.

""We are excited to partner with AbbVie on the development of new CAR-T cell therapies. This collaboration validates Caribou's differentiated next-generation CRISPR genome editing technologies that provide best-in-class efficiency and specificity,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Rachel Haurwitz</span>, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Caribou. ""We believe AbbVie is an ideal partner for Caribou as we expand upon the number of targets and diseases addressable by our technologies. Genome-edited CAR-T cell therapies hold tremendous potential for patients, and this partnership accelerates our ability to address significant unmet medical need.""

""CAR-T therapies have shown to be a promising breakthrough in cancer treatment,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Steve Davidsen</span>, Ph.D., Vice President, Oncology Discovery, AbbVie. ""Collaborating with Caribou and their cutting-edge CRISPR platform will help AbbVie advance our efforts to deliver new hope for patients.""

<strong>Basel, February 11, 2021</strong> – Sandoz, a Novartis division, has signed an agreement to acquire GSK’s cephalosporin antibiotics business, reinforcing its leading global position in antibiotics.

The agreement includes the global rights to three established brands (Zinnat<sup>®</sup>, Zinacef<sup>®</sup> and Fortum<sup>®</sup><sup>)</sup>) in more than 100 markets. It excludes the rights in the US, Australia and Germany to certain of those brands, which were previously divested by GSK, and in India, Pakistan, Egypt, Japan (to certain of the brands) and China, which will be retained by GSK.

Sandoz will pay GSK USD 350 million at closing, plus additional milestone payments of up to USD 150 million, subject to the terms of the transaction. Closing of the transaction is expected in the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. In 2020, the three brands had combined sales of approximately USD 140 million in the relevant markets.

In line with its integrated manufacturing strategy, Sandoz intends in the longer term to manufacture Zinnat<sup>®</sup> at sites in its own network, which has global antibiotics production centered on its lead production site in Kundl, Austria. Once the transaction is completed, GSK will supply Zinnat<sup>®</sup> to Sandoz under a manufacturing and supply agreement (MSA), while supporting a transfer of the related manufacturing operations to Sandoz. We expect this process to last for approximately four years from the close of the transaction onwards.

“This important transaction will further position Sandoz as a global leader in antibiotics – truly essential medicines that are the backbone of modern healthcare systems,” said Sandoz CEO Richard Saynor.

“Cephalosporins are the largest antibiotic segment by global sales and acquiring this leading business, including the established global Zinnat<sup>®</sup> brand, will complement our #1 position in generic penicillins, the other key segment. It will also set us up for additional synergies driven by an increased promotional footprint that will support growth of both the acquired brands and the current existing Sandoz portfolio.”

The agreement confirms the Sandoz commitment to further grow its antibiotics business, following the announcement last year of a joint investment with the Austrian government of more than EUR 150 million to strengthen the long-term competitiveness of its Kundl antibiotic manufacturing site and help to ensure long-term supply resilience.

Kundl is the hub and center of the last major integrated production chain for antibiotics in the western world. Its focus is on generic penicillin products, but the plant also produces finished dosage forms of several generic cephalosporin products.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Evkeeza<sup>TM</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb) as an adjunct to other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Evkeeza is the first FDA-approved treatment that binds to and blocks the function of angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), a protein that plays a key role in lipid metabolism.

""The FDA's approval of Evkeeza is a watershed moment for individuals born with HoFH, a severe form of familial hypercholesterolemia,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Katherine A. Wilemon</span>, Founder and CEO of the FH Foundation. ""Those living with HoFH have faced devastatingly high LDL-C levels and an uncertain future. Evkeeza significantly lowered LDL-C levels in clinical trials and this new treatment offers an important new option for people living with HoFH.""

HoFH, also known as homozygous FH, is an ultra-rare inherited condition that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the U.S. HoFH occurs when two copies of the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)-causing genes are inherited, one from each parent, resulting in dangerously high levels (&gt;400 mg/dL) of LDL-C (bad cholesterol). Patients with HoFH are at risk for premature atherosclerotic disease and cardiac events as early as their teenage years.

""Evkeeza is a potentially transformational new treatment for people with HoFH,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Daniel J. Rader</span>, M.D., Professor and Chair of the Department of Genetics in the Perelman School of Medicine of the <span class=""xn-org"">University of Pennsylvania</span>, a leading HoFH expert who was involved with Evkeeza clinical trials. ""Existing therapies for HoFH are insufficient for the majority of patients. Evkeeza, through its unique mechanism of action, was shown to reduce LDL-C levels in patients with all forms of HoFH, even those with nearly no LDL receptor activity, and represents a highly meaningful improvement in our ability to control LDL-C levels in patients with HoFH.""

""Evkeeza is the first FDA-approved ANGPTL3 inhibitor and the latest example of the promise of Regeneron's development approach that harnesses genetic insights and pioneering technology to deliver new treatment options for patients who need them,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span>, M.D., Ph.D., <span class=""xn-location"">President</span> and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""We are proud to bring Evkeeza to patients with HoFH, and Regeneron is grateful to the patients and doctors who participated in our trials to make this a reality.""

The FDA approval is based on results from the Phase 3 ELIPSE HoFH trial, <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3066029-1&amp;h=9852725&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fnew-england-journal-medicine-publishes-positive-phase-3&amp;a=published"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">published</a> in the<i> New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</i> in <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2020</span>. In the trial, 65 patients were randomized to receive either Evkeeza 15 mg/kg intravenously every four weeks (n=43) plus other lipid-lowering therapies, compared to lipid-lowering therapies alone (placebo, n=22). The mean baseline LDL-C level of patients in both groups was 255 mg/dL.

The trial met its primary endpoint, with Evkeeza-treated patients reducing their LDL-C from baseline by 49% on average compared to placebo at week 24 (47% reduction Evkeeza, 2% increase placebo, p&lt;0.0001). At the same time point, compared to baseline, Evkeeza-treated patients also experienced:
<ul>
 	<li>132 mg/dL average reduction in LDL-C compared to placebo (135 mg/dL reduction Evkeeza, 3 mg/dL reduction placebo, p&lt;0.0001).</li>
 	<li>Significant reductions were also observed in other key secondary endpoints including levels of apolipoprotein B (ApoB), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and total cholesterol, compared to placebo (p&lt;0.0001 for all).</li>
 	<li>Similar levels of LDL-C lowering were also observed in the most difficult-to-treat patients who often don't respond to certain other therapies because of limited LDL receptor function, described as ""null/null"" (&lt;15% LDL receptor function by in vitro assays) or ""negative/negative"" (genetic variants likely to result in minimal to no LDL receptor function by mutation analysis) patients.</li>
</ul>
Reductions in LDL-C seen with Evkeeza were observed as early as week 2 and maintained throughout the double-blind treatment period (week 24) and open label trial period (through week 48).

The most common adverse reactions (&gt;3% of patients) reported from the combined safety analysis of placebo-controlled trials after 24 weeks that occurred more frequently in Evkeeza patients (n=81) than placebo (n=54) were nasopharyngitis (16% Evkeeza, 13% placebo), influenza-like illness (7% Evkeeza, 6% placebo), dizziness (6% Evkeeza, 0% placebo), rhinorrhea (5% Evkeeza, 0% placebo), nausea (5% Evkeeza, 2% placebo), pain in extremity (4% Evkeeza, 0% placebo) and asthenia (4% Evkeeza, 0% placebo). In clinical trials, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% of patients treated with Evkeeza, including 1 case of anaphylaxis that resolved with treatment, and 2% of patients who received placebo.

Evkeeza is administered based on weight (15 mg/kg) once a month via intravenous infusion. The average Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) per patient in the U.S. will vary based on weight, and is expected to be approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$450,000</span> per year on average. Regeneron is committed to helping patients who have been prescribed Evkeeza access their medication. Regeneron's myRARE™ patient support program offers financial assistance to eligible patients who need help with the out-of-pocket cost of Evkeeza. Under the program, eligible patients with commercial insurance may pay as little as <span class=""xn-money"">$0</span> in out-of-pocket costs for Evkeeza. In addition, myRARE™ offers resources to help patients and healthcare providers get started with Evkeeza including product information, insurance benefit verification, community resources and appointment reminders.

The FDA evaluated Evkeeza under Priority Review, following the decision in 2017 to grant Evkeeza Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients with HoFH. The FDA reserves its Priority Review for medicines that represent significant improvements in safety or efficacy in treating serious conditions, and its Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and U.S. review of drugs that target serious or life-threatening conditions.

The safety and effectiveness of Evkeeza have not been established in patients with other causes of hypercholesterolemia, including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). The effect of Evkeeza on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

<b>About Evkeeza<sup>TM</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Evkeeza is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the function of ANGPTL3.

Evkeeza was invented using Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> technology that utilizes a proprietary genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human antibodies. <i>VelocImmune</i> technology has also been used to create multiple antibodies including Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab), Libtayo<sup>® </sup>(cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn) and Regeneron's antibody cocktail for COVID-19, which was recently granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S.

Regulatory review for Evkeeza is ongoing in the European Union. In <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2020</span>, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended an accelerated assessment for Evkeeza based on the high unmet medical need and therapeutic innovation demonstrated by the product.

Basel, 12 February 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced detailed results from four phase III studies of its investigational bispecific antibody, faricimab, for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular or “wet” age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The studies consistently showed that faricimab, given at intervals of up to four months, offered non-inferior vision gains compared to aflibercept, given every two months. Approximately half of people eligible for extended dosing with faricimab were able to be treated every four months in the first year in the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies in DME and the TENAYA and LUCERNE studies in nAMD. Faricimab is the first injectable eye medicine to achieve this length of time between treatments in phase III studies for DME and nAMD. Furthermore, approximately three-quarters of people eligible for extended dosing with faricimab were able to be treated every three months or longer in the first year. Faricimab was generally well-tolerated in all four studies, with no new or unexpected safety signals identified.

Results from the studies will be presented at Angiogenesis, Exudation, and Degeneration 2021, a medical symposium presented by Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, on Saturday, 13 February.

“These faricimab data offer the promise of a new treatment for two common causes of blindness, diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration,"" said Jeffrey Heier, M.D., Director of Retinal Research at Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston in Boston, MA. “Faricimab’s potential to extend time between treatments may benefit those patients who struggle to keep up with the regular physician visits and eye injections needed to preserve their vision.”

Whilst anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monotherapy injections have significantly reduced vision loss from DME and nAMD, the treatment burden associated with frequent eye injections and physician visits can lead to under-treatment and, potentially, less than optimal vision outcomes.<sup>1-3</sup> Faricimab is the first investigational bispecific antibody designed for the eye.<sup>4</sup> Unlike current treatments for DME and nAMD that inhibit the VEGF pathway, faricimab targets two distinct pathways – via angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and VEGF-A – that drive a number of retinal conditions.<sup>4</sup> Through this novel mechanism of action, faricimab is designed to stabilise blood vessels and thereby reduce inflammation and leakage more than inhibiting either pathway alone.<sup>1</sup> This may improve vision outcomes for longer than with anti-VEGF monotherapy, and in turn reduce the frequency of eye injections needed.<sup>1,3</sup>

“These positive results show the potential for faricimab as the first new type of medicine in 15 years for people with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and in close to a decade in diabetic macular edema,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “This is an exciting time for our ophthalmology clinical development programme, with multiple phase III successes for two medicines from our late-stage pipeline. We hope to bring these potential treatments to people living with vision-threatening retinal conditions as soon as possible.”

<strong>Study results<sup>5-8</sup></strong>
The YOSEMITE and RHINE studies in DME assessed two dosing regimens of faricimab given every two months or at personalised treatment intervals (PTI) of up to four months, compared to aflibercept given every two months. Patients in the PTI arm could receive treatment every one, two, three or four months, adjusted based on their disease activity. Both studies met their primary endpoint, with faricimab consistently shown to offer non-inferior visual acuity gains to aflibercept. In YOSEMITE, the average vision gains from baseline were +11.6 and +10.7 eye chart letters in the faricimab PTI and two-month arms, respectively, and +10.9 letters in the aflibercept arm. In RHINE, the average vision gains from baseline were +10.8 and +11.8 letters in the faricimab PTI and two-month arms, respectively, and +10.3 letters in the aflibercept arm.

A secondary endpoint in both studies measured the proportion of people in the faricimab PTI arm that achieved dosing schedules of every three or four months at the end of the first year. Importantly, 52.8% (n=151/286) of faricimab PTI patients in YOSEMITE and 51% (n=157/308) in RHINE achieved four-month dosing at one year. An additional 21% (n=60/286) of faricimab PTI patients in YOSEMITE and 20.1% (n=62/308) in RHINE achieved three-month dosing. Combined, more than 70% of faricimab PTI patients were able to go three months or longer between treatments at the end of the first year. In both studies, faricimab given at intervals of up to four months demonstrated greater reductions in central subfield thickness (CST) compared to aflibercept given every two months.

The TENAYA and LUCERNE studies in nAMD assessed faricimab given at fixed intervals of every two, three or four months – selected based on their disease activity at weeks 20 and 24 – compared to aflibercept given every two months. Both studies met their primary endpoint, with faricimab consistently shown to offer non-inferior visual acuity gains to aflibercept. In TENAYA and LUCERNE, the average vision gains from baseline in the faricimab arms were +5.8 and +6.6 letters, respectively, compared to +5.1 and +6.6 letters in the aflibercept arms.

The studies also measured the proportion of people in the faricimab arm that were treated on dosing schedules of every three or four months during the first year. Importantly, 45.7% (n=144/315) of patients in TENAYA and 44.9% (n=142/316) in LUCERNE were able to be treated every four months in the first year. An additional 34% (n=107/315) of patients in TENAYA and 32.9% (n=104/316) in LUCERNE were able to be treated every three months. Combined, nearly 80% of faricimab-treated patients were able to go three months or longer between treatments during the first year. In both studies, faricimab given at intervals of up to four months offered reductions in CST comparable to aflibercept given every two months.

Results from all four studies will be submitted to health authorities around the world, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, for consideration of regulatory approval for the treatment of DME and nAMD.

<strong>About the YOSEMITE and RHINE studies<sup>5,6</sup></strong>
YOSEMITE (NCT03622580) and RHINE (NCT03622593) are two identical, randomised, multicentre, double-masked, global phase III studies, evaluating the efficacy and safety of faricimab compared to aflibercept in 1,891 people with diabetic macular edema (940 in YOSEMITE and 951 in RHINE). The studies each have three treatment arms: faricimab 6.0 mg administered at personalised dosing intervals of up to four months; faricimab 6.0 mg administered at fixed two-month intervals; aflibercept 2.0 mg administered at fixed two-month intervals. In all three arms, sham injections were administered at study visits when treatment injections were not scheduled, to maintain the masking of investigators and participants.

The primary endpoint of the studies is the average change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score (the best distance vision a person can achieve – including with correction such as glasses – when reading letters on an eye chart) from baseline at one year. Secondary endpoints include: safety; the percentage of participants in the personalised dosing arm receiving treatment every one, two, three and four months, at week 52; the percentage of participants achieving a two-step or greater improvement from baseline in diabetic retinopathy severity at week 52; the percentage of participants achieving a gain, and the percentage avoiding a loss, of 15 letters or more in BCVA from baseline over time; and change in central subfield thickness from baseline over time.

<strong>About the TENAYA and LUCERNE studies<sup>7,8</sup></strong>
TENAYA (NCT03823287) and LUCERNE (NCT03823300) are two identical, randomised, multicentre, double-masked, global phase III studies, evaluating the efficacy and safety of faricimab compared to aflibercept in 1,329 people living with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (671 in TENAYA and 658 in LUCERNE). The studies each have two treatment arms: faricimab 6.0 mg administered at fixed intervals of every two, three, or four months, selected based on objective assessment of disease activity at weeks 20 and 24; aflibercept 2.0 mg administered at fixed two-month intervals. In both arms, sham injections were administered at study visits when treatment injections were not scheduled, to maintain the masking of investigators and participants.

The primary endpoint of the studies is the average change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score from baseline through week 48. Secondary endpoints include: safety; the percentage of participants in the faricimab arm receiving treatment every two, three and four months; the percentage of participants achieving a gain, and the percentage avoiding a loss, of 15 letters or more in BCVA from baseline over time; and change in central subfield thickness from baseline over time.

<strong>About diabetic macular edema</strong>
Affecting around 21 million people globally, diabetic macular edema (DME) is a vision-threatening complication of diabetic retinopathy (DR).<sup>9</sup> DR occurs when damage to blood vessels and the formation of new blood vessels causes blood and/or fluid to leak into the retina – a part of the eye that sends information to the brain, enabling sight.<sup>10</sup> This leads to swelling, as well as blockage of blood supply to some areas of the retina.<sup>11</sup> DME occurs when the damaged blood vessels leak into and cause swelling in the macula – the central area of the retina responsible for the sharp vision needed for reading and driving.<sup>10,12</sup> The number of people with DME is expected to grow as the prevalence of diabetes increases.<sup>13</sup> The condition is associated with blindness when left untreated and decreased quality of life.<sup>10,14</sup> There remains a significant unmet need for more effective, longer-lasting therapies for people with DME.<sup>1</sup>

<strong>About neovascular age-related macular degeneration</strong>
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the part of the eye that provides sharp, central vision needed for activities like reading.<sup>15</sup> Neovascular or “wet” AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease that can cause rapid and severe vision loss.<sup>16,17</sup> It develops when new and abnormal blood vessels grow uncontrolled under the macula, causing swelling, bleeding and/or fibrosis.<sup>17</sup> Worldwide, around 20 million people are living with nAMD – the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60 – and the condition will affect even more people around the world as the global population ages.<sup>15,18,19</sup>

<strong>About faricimab</strong>
Faricimab is the first investigational bispecific antibody designed for the eye.<sup>4</sup> It targets two distinct pathways – via angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – that drive a number of retinal conditions.<sup>4 </sup>Ang-2 and VEGF-A contribute to vision loss by destabilising blood vessels, causing new leaky blood vessels to form and increasing inflammation.<sup>1 </sup>By simultaneously blocking both pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A, faricimab is designed to stabilise blood vessels, potentially improving vision outcomes for longer for people living with retinal conditions.<sup>1</sup>

<strong>About Roche in Ophthalmology</strong>

We have the broadest retina pipeline in Ophthalmology, covering early and late stage products, which is led by science and informed by insights from people with eye diseases. Our late stage pipeline includes two potential first-of-a-kind treatments, Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) and faricimab, which are being evaluated in a number of retinal conditions including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. PDS is an investigational, permanent refillable eye implant that continuously delivers a customised formulation of ranibizumab over a period of months, potentially reducing the treatment burden associated with frequent eye injections.<sup>20</sup> Faricimab is the first investigational bispecific antibody designed for the eye.<sup>4</sup> It targets two distinct pathways – via angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – that drive a number of retinal conditions, to stabilise blood vessels, potentially improving vision outcomes for longer.<sup>1,4</sup> Our early stage pipeline includes gene therapies and treatments for geographic atrophy and other vision-threatening diseases, including rare and inherited conditions.

Applying our extensive experience, we have already brought breakthrough ophthalmic treatments to people living with vision loss through Lucentis®?* (ranibizumab injection), the first treatment approved to improve vision in people with certain retinal conditions.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ensoma, a company expanding the curative power of genomic medicine by pioneering a next-generation <i>in vivo</i> approach, today launched with a $70 million Series A financing led by co-founder and seed investor 5AM Ventures, with participation from F-Prime Capital, Takeda Ventures, Viking Global Investors, Cormorant Asset Management, RIT Capital Partners, Symbiosis II, LLC, and Alexandria Venture Investments. In addition to an equity investment of $10 million in the Series A financing, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) and Ensoma have entered into a strategic collaboration with the potential for upfront and preclinical research payments totaling $100 million as part of a strategic collaboration worth up to $1.25 billion, announced in a separate press release this morning.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

The foundation of the company’s platform – its Engenious™ vectors – is based on over two decades of academic and clinical research generated by scientific co-founders and renowned experts, Hans-Peter Kiem, M.D., Ph.D., of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and André Lieber, M.D., Ph.D., of University of Washington School of Medicine. The company will be led by biotechnology industry veterans with demonstrated track records in innovative therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy and editing, across an array of disease areas, including rare disease, hematology and oncology.

Ensoma’s Engenious vectors are designed to deliver a diverse range of genome modification technologies – including those that require a high level of packaging capacity – directly to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or the various cell types that arise from these cells, such as T cells, B cells and myeloid cells. The company’s vectors are optimized to work without the need for stem cell collection or prior myeloablative conditioning (e.g., chemotherapy). As a result, Ensoma’s therapies will be designed to be delivered via single injection in diverse environments, including outpatient and areas where access to sophisticated healthcare systems may be limited.

“With the launch of Ensoma, we aspire to bring innovative new treatments to patients in a way that is accessible for all,” said Paula Soteropoulos, executive chairman of Ensoma. “Because our <i>in vivo</i> therapies do not require prior conditioning or stem cell donors, we hope to deliver them as ‘off-the-shelf’ treatments to address diseases – both rare and common – dramatically simplifying the logistics of scaling production and reducing patient and healthcare-system burden. Every person, no matter where they are in the world, should have access to the innovative technologies that are changing the way we treat disease.”

<b>Engenious</b><b>™</b><b> Vectors</b>

Ensoma’s Engenious vectors are specially engineered adenovirus vectors devoid of any viral genome and minimal pre-existing immunity, thus minimizing the chance of an immune response and freeing up ample storage space – up to 35 kilobases (kb) of DNA packaging capacity – to deliver a diverse range of genome modification technologies. Also known as therapeutic cargo, these technologies may include, separately and in combination, the following:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Genome editing (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9, ZFN, base editing)</li>
 	<li>Targeted and random genomic integration approaches</li>
 	<li>Regulatory elements for cell type-specific gene expression</li>
</ul>
These approaches enable Engenious vectors to engineer various erythroid, lymphoid (e.g., T cells, B cells) and myeloid (e.g., macrophages, microglia) cell types, with great precision and vast therapeutic potential. Addressable indications range from rare monogenic diseases to broader diseases such as oncology, autoimmunity and infectious diseases via precision, “off-the-shelf” engineering of the immune system.

Given the highly specific nature of these technologies, Ensoma’s Engenious vectors enable preferential targeting of HSCs inside the body. Additionally, Ensoma’s founders have developed an <i>in vivo </i>selection system that can increase the population of genetically modified HSCs, if needed. This proprietary approach enables precise titration to lasting therapeutic levels without the need to re-dose patients, bypassing the immunogenic challenges associated with re-dosing for some other gene therapy modalities.

Ensoma’s Engenious platform has been extensively validated in numerous preclinical models with a range of genome editing technologies, demonstrating robust genetic modification of bone marrow HSCs and stable long-term expression of therapeutic proteins in small and large preclinical models.

“There have been tremendous advancements in technologies to precisely target, genetically edit and modify human disease. However, many of these tools pose delivery challenges; some lack the ability to reach the right cells within the body, while others lack the ability to broadly reach significant numbers of patients due to complex procedures and supply chain challenges,” said Kush M. Parmar, M.D., Ph.D., founding chief executive officer of Ensoma. “Ensoma’s scientific approach allows us to do what hasn’t been done before—to make the curative power of genomic medicine and stem cell technology portable so they may be administered in low-resource and outpatient settings for the very first time.”

<b>Leadership &amp; Scientific Founders</b>

Ensoma was founded by and incubated within the 4:59 Initiative, the company creation engine of 5AM Ventures. The company’s scientific co-founders include Dr. Hans-Peter Kiem, an oncologist and world-renowned pioneer in gene-editing technologies, including stem cell and gene therapies, from Fred Hutch, who also serves as vice president of the American Society of Gene &amp; Cell Therapy and chief scientific and clinical advisor for Ensoma; and Dr. André Lieber, an accomplished academic researcher and professor of medicine, Division of Medical Genetics, UW School of Medicine, who has studied the biological and translational aspects of human adenoviruses for more than two decades. Ensoma is based on an exclusively licensed portfolio of technologies developed by the Fred Hutch lab of Dr. Kiem and the University of Washington lab of Dr. Lieber that enable <i>in vivo</i> genome engineering and gene therapy advances of HSCs for therapeutic use in blood diseases.

“Following more than 20 years of academic and clinical research, Ensoma has assembled an exceptional team to boldly forge a new era of genomic medicine <i>in vivo</i>,” said Bihua Chen, founder and portfolio manager at Cormorant Asset Management. “The company is moving swiftly to accelerate and broaden the therapeutic potential of its approach, and I am confident they have the right team and the right technology to potentially bring life-changing, curative therapies within reach for people all over the world.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Visby Medical™ announced today the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Visby’s rapid PCR COVID-19 test for use at the point of care (POC). Building on the FDA’s emergency use authorization granted earlier this year, Visby Medical’s rapid PCR COVID-19 test may now be used by any organization with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate of waiver.

It is imperative that the best tools are available to fight infection, protect the most vulnerable and maintain essential operations. PCR testing has been acknowledged as the gold standard for its high level of accuracy, but has drawbacks including the reliance on centralized labs and long wait times for results.

By shrinking rapid PCR technology to palm-sized dimensions and eliminating the need for an additional instrument or reader, Visby Medical’s test is able to provide fast, accurate, and actionable results at the point of need. What’s more, the Visby device is easy to use, with the potential capability of running pooled tests in the future. Requiring only a power-plug, the Visby test will have a dramatic effect on communities with limited access to testing.

“This latest authorization will have a significant impact on COVID-19 testing, especially in situations when an accurate result is needed quickly,” said Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Chief Medical Officer at Visby Medical and Professor of Medicine at Stanford University specializing in infectious diseases. “Visby’s test can now be used directly at the point of care with our most vulnerable populations, including nursing homes, frontline health workers, to maintain patient care at places like cancer and dialysis treatment centers, and to the many schools and institutions that have undertaken the process to become CLIA-waived environments.”

Founded by leading scientists in infectious diseases and diagnostics, Visby Medical’s top priority is providing health care professionals with rapid test results to enable diagnosis prior to treatment. The Visby Medical diagnostic platform is responding to the current pandemic, and demonstrating that its portable, single-use PCR device offers an ideal solution for the future as well. Even with the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, accurate and rapid testing will remain vital, as it will take time to vaccinate the US population and develop herd immunity.

Adam de la Zerda, PhD, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Visby Medical, is driven to deliver rapid, actionable results to enable doctors to make more informed treatment decisions for patients with infectious diseases.

“Medical professionals and the communities they serve have been forced to abide by the idea that accuracy comes at the cost of speed. Even in the face of an available vaccine, a rapid PCR test is an important tool to create COVID-free zones and establish operational continuity for businesses and critical infrastructure,” said de la Zerda. “Our innovative technology has been tested, reviewed and endorsed by leading academics and health care researchers.”

Visby Medical will continue to work to expand authorized use cases to help provide a sense of security to critical areas of our healthcare system, military, consumer businesses and schools, providing a means for these institutions to reopen and allow people to return to work safely.

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Feb. 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- G1 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GTHX), a commercial-stage oncology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved COSELA™ (trilaciclib) for injection to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). It is the first and only therapy designed to help protect bone marrow (myeloprotection) when administered prior to treatment with chemotherapy. COSELA is expected to be commercially available through G1’s specialty distributor partner network in early March.

“The approval of trilaciclib (COSELA) is an important advance in the treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer receiving chemotherapy,” said Dr. Jeffrey Crawford, Geller Professor for Research in Cancer in the Department of Medicine and Duke Cancer Institute. “The most serious and life-threatening side effect of chemotherapy is myelosuppression, or damage to the bone marrow, resulting in reduced white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression may lead to increased risks of infection, severe anemia, and/or bleeding. These complications impact patients’ quality of life and may also result in chemotherapy dose reductions and delays. To date, approaches have included the use of growth factor agents to accelerate blood cell recovery after the bone marrow injury has occurred, along with antibiotics and transfusions as needed. By contrast, trilaciclib provides the first proactive approach to myelosuppression through a unique mechanism of action that helps protect the bone marrow from damage by chemotherapy. In clinical trials, the addition of trilaciclib to extensive-stage small cell lung cancer chemotherapy treatment regimens reduced myelosuppression and improved clinical outcomes. The good news is that these benefits of trilaciclib will now be available for our patients in clinical practice.”

Chemotherapy is an effective and important weapon against cancer. However, chemotherapy does not differentiate between healthy cells and cancer cells. It kills both, including important hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow that produce white blood cells (immune cells that help fight infection), red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues), and platelets (cells that prevent bleeding from cancer, surgeries, chronic diseases, and injuries). This chemotherapy-induced bone marrow damage, known as myelosuppression, can lead to increased risk of infection, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and other complications. Myeloprotection is a novel approach of protecting HSPCs in the bone marrow from chemotherapy-induced damage. This approach can help reduce some chemotherapy-related toxicity, making chemotherapy safer and more tolerable, while also reducing the need for reactive rescue interventions.

“Chemotherapy is the most effective and widely used approach to treating people diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; however, standard of care chemotherapy regimens are highly myelosuppressive and can lead to costly hospitalizations and rescue interventions,” said Jack Bailey, Chief Executive Officer at G1 Therapeutics. “COSELA will help change the chemotherapy experience for people who are battling ES-SCLC. G1 is proud to deliver COSELA to patients and their families as the first and only therapy to help protect against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.”

COSELA is administered intravenously as a 30-minute infusion within four hours prior to the start of chemotherapy and is the first FDA-approved therapy that helps provide proactive, multilineage protection from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. The approval of COSELA is based on data from three randomized, placebo-controlled trials that showed patients receiving COSELA prior to the start of chemotherapy had clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in the duration and severity of neutropenia. Data also showed a positive impact on red blood cell transfusions and other myeloprotective measures. The trials evaluated COSELA in combination with carboplatin/etoposide (+/- the immunotherapy atezolizumab) and topotecan chemotherapy regimens. Approximately 90% of all patients with ES-SCLC will receive at least one of these regimens during the course of their treatment.

The majority of adverse reactions reported with COSELA were mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse reactions (=10%) were fatigue, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, headache, and pneumonia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving COSELA. Serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;3% of patients who received COSELA included respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. Grade 3/4 hematological adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with COSELA and placebo included neutropenia (32% and 69%), febrile neutropenia (3% and 9%), anemia (16% and 34%), thrombocytopenia (18% and 33%), and leukopenia (4% and 17%), respectively.

“Quite often, people diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer rely on chemotherapy to not only extend their lives, but also to acutely alleviate their symptoms,” said Bonnie J. Addario, lung cancer survivor, co-founder and board chair of the Go2 Foundation for Lung Cancer. “Unfortunately, the vast majority will experience chemotherapy-induced side effects, resulting in dose delays and reductions, and increased utilization of healthcare services. G1 shares our organization’s goal to improve the quality of life of those diagnosed with lung cancer and to transform survivorship among people living with this insidious disease. We are thrilled to see new advancements that can help improve the lives of those living with small cell lung cancer.”

Approximately 30,000 small cell lung cancer patients are treated in the United States annually. G1 is committed to helping patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in the U.S. gain access to treatment with COSELA. For more information on access and affordability programs, patients and providers should call the G1toOne support center at 833-G1toONE (833-418-6663) from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern time.

G1 received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA in 2019 based on positive data in small cell lung cancer patients from three randomized Phase 2 clinical trials. As is common with breakthrough-designated products that receive priority review, G1 will conduct certain post-marketing activities, including in vitro drug-drug interaction and metabolism studies, and a clinical trial to assess impact of trilaciclib on disease progression or survival in patients with ES-SCLC with chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression treated with a platinum/etoposide-containing or topotecan-containing regimen with at least a two year follow up. G1 intends to initiate the post-approval clinical trial in 2022.

<strong>About Small Cell Lung Cancer</strong>

In the United States, approximately 30,000 small cell lung cancer patients are treated annually. SCLC, one of the two main types of lung cancer, accounts for about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. SCLC is an aggressive disease and tends to grow and spread faster than NSCLC. It is usually asymptomatic; once symptoms do appear, it often indicates that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. About 70% of people with SCLC will have cancer that has metastasized at the time they are diagnosed. The severity of symptoms usually increases with increased cancer growth and spread. From the time of diagnosis, the general 5-year survival rate for people with SCLC is 6%. The five-year survival rates for limited-stage (the cancer is confined to one side of the chest) SCLC is 12% to 15%, and for extensive stage (cancer has spread to the other lung and beyond), survival rates are less than 2%. Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for ES-SCLC.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","OSAKA, Japan, February 12, 2021 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today at the 2021 Transplantation & Cellular Therapy (TCT) Meetings Digital Experience announced new, late-breaking Phase 3 data from the TAK-620-303 (SOLSTICE) trial, for the investigational drug TAK-620 (maribavir) which met its primary endpoint of superiority compared to conventional antiviral therapies (investigator assigned treatment, [IAT], one or a combination of ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir) in transplant recipients with refractory, with or without resistance (R/R), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/disease. Overall, more than twice as many (55.7%; n=131/235) transplant recipients with R/R CMV infection/disease treated with maribavir achieved confirmed CMV viremia clearance at Study Week 8 (end of treatment phase), the study’s primary endpoint, as compared to 23.9% (n=28/117) of those on conventional antiviral therapies (95% CI: 32.8%, 22.8–42.7; p<0.001).1*†‡

The study’s key secondary endpoint was met by demonstrating maribavir’s improvement over conventional therapies in clearance of CMV viremia and associated symptom control maintained through Study Week 16.1

Transplant recipients receiving maribavir exhibited lower incidence of treatment-related toxicities common with conventional antiviral therapies. Those receiving maribavir experienced lower rates of treatment-related neutropenia vs. valganciclovir/ganciclovir (1.7% [4/234] vs. 25% [14/56]) and acute kidney injury vs. foscarnet (1.7% [4/234] vs. 19.1% [9/47]). Any treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 97.4% (228/234) for maribavir and 91.4% (106/116) for the conventional therapy group. TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were 13.2% (31/234) in the maribavir group and 31.9% (37/116) in the conventional therapy group. Two treatment-related serious TEAEs led to death (1 patient per treatment group).

“We are pleased that the SOLSTICE trial, which compared maribavir to available antiviral treatments for transplant patients with refractory/resistant cytomegalovirus infections, met its primary endpoint. More than half the patients who received maribavir were able to have their CMV infections treated successfully for 8 weeks and experienced less neutropenia and acute kidney injury compared to currently available treatments valganciclovir/ganciclovir and foscarnet, respectively,” said Francisco M. Marty, MD, Associate Physician, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. “These new findings are a promising advance in the quest for potential new treatments of CMV for transplant recipients.”

Key efficacy findings presented by Dr. Marty, a SOLSTICE trial investigator, included:

Subgroup Analyses of Primary Endpoint (Confirmed CMV Clearance at Week 8 [Randomized Set])1

55.6% of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with R/R CMV infection/disease receiving maribavir achieved confirmed CMV viremia clearance compared to 26.1% of those on conventional therapies.
55.9% of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with R/R CMV infection/disease receiving maribavir achieved confirmed CMV viremia clearance compared to 20.8% of those on conventional therapies.
A greater proportion of transplant recipients with R/R CMV infection/disease receiving maribavir achieved CMV clearance at week 8 regardless of baseline viral load category (62.1% and 43.9% of patients receiving maribavir vs. 24.7% and 21.9% receiving conventional therapies, in low [<9,100 IU/mL] and intermediate/high [=9,100 IU/mL] baseline viral load respectively).
Analyses of Key Secondary Endpoint (CMV Clearance and Symptom Control Followed by Maintenance Through Study Week 16 [Randomized Set])1

18.7% (44/235) of transplant recipients treated with maribavir maintained CMV viremia clearance and symptom control through Study Week 16 compared to 10.3% (12/117) of those treated with conventional therapies (p=0.013).
“We are excited by the results of the SOLSTICE trial, which were shared in greater detail with the scientific community at the 2021 TCT Meetings. This is an important development for transplant patients who are at increased risk of CMV, which if not controlled, can pose grave challenges. Maribavir, if approved, has the potential to redefine treatment for post-transplant refractory, with or without resistance, CMV,” said Obi Umeh, MD, Vice President and Maribavir Global Program Leader, Takeda.

About CMV
CMV is a beta herpesvirus that commonly infects humans; serologic evidence of prior infection can be found in 40%-100% of various adult populations.2 However, serious disease may occur in individuals with compromised immune systems, which includes patients who received immunosuppressants associated with various types of transplants including HCT or SOT.3 CMV typically resides latent and asymptomatic in the body but reactivates during periods of immunosuppression.3,4 Out of the estimated 200,000 adult transplants per year, CMV is one of the most common viral infections experienced by transplant recipients, with an estimated incidence rate between 16-56% in SOT recipients and 30-70% in HCT recipients.4–9

In transplant recipients, reactivation of CMV can lead to serious consequences including loss of the transplanted organ and, in extreme cases, can be fatal.10,11 Existing therapies to treat post-transplant CMV infections may demonstrate toxicities that require dose adjustments, need hospitalization for administration, or may fail to adequately suppress viral replication.12–14

 

About Maribavir
Maribavir, an orally bioavailable anti-CMV compound, is the only antiviral agent presently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of post-transplant patients with CMV in SOT or HCT. Maribavir is an investigational treatment that has not been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) or any other regulatory authorities. Maribavir is the only CMV antiviral drug that targets and inhibits the UL97 protein kinase and its natural substrates.15-18

Maribavir has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European Commission as a treatment of CMV disease in patients with impaired cell mediated immunity and by the FDA for treatment of clinically significant CMV viremia and disease in at-risk patients. Orphan status is granted to certain investigational medicines intended for the treatment or prevention of a rare, life-threatening disease. The FDA has also granted maribavir Breakthrough Therapy Designation as a treatment for CMV infection and disease in transplant patients resistant or refractory to prior therapy. Breakthrough Therapy Designation expedites the development and review of investigational treatments for serious conditions with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. These designations do not guarantee that the EMA or FDA will approve maribavir for the treatment of CMV infections in transplant patients, and the timing of any such approval is uncertain.

 

About Takeda’s SOLSTICE Trial
The TAK-620-303 (SOLSTICE) trial (NCT02931539) is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing eight weeks of treatment with either maribavir or investigator assigned treatment, IAT, (conventional antiviral therapy) in hematopoietic cell transplant and solid organ transplant recipients with CMV infection refractory, with or without resistance, to one or a combination of the conventional antiviral therapies: ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir. Patients underwent a 2-week screening period, followed by randomization 2:1 to maribavir (n=235) (400 mg) or IAT (n=117) for an 8-week treatment period, plus 12 weeks of follow-up.

The trial’s primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved confirmed CMV viremia clearance (plasma CMV DNA <137 IU/mL in two consecutive tests =5 days apart at central laboratory) compared to IAT at the end of Study Week 8. The key secondary endpoint was defined as achievement of CMV viremia clearance and symptom control at end of Study Week 8, maintained through Study Week 16.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for PANZYGA<sup>®</sup> (Immune Globulin Intravenous [Human] – ifas 10% Liquid Preparation) to treat adult patients with a rare neurological disease of the peripheral nerves called chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). PANZYGA is the only intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) with two FDA-approved maintenance dosing options for CIDP, helping to meet the clinical needs of patients. PANZYGA can also be administered at infusion rates up to 12 mg/kg/min.

“Each patient with CIDP has different treatment needs, and we have found that having one approved dosing option is not always optimal,” said Angela Lukin, Global President, Hospital Business Unit, Pfizer Inc. “The approval of this new indication with additional dosing options helps address an unmet patient need by providing healthcare providers with the ability to choose an approved dose that's right for patients.”

CIDP is a rare disorder of the peripheral nerves characterized by gradually increasing symmetrical motor and sensory loss and weakness associated with loss of deep tendon reflexes. It is caused by damage to the covering of the nerves, called myelin. The gradual onset of CIDP can delay diagnosis by several months or even years, resulting in significant nerve damage that may limit and delay the response to therapy. Most individuals will require long term treatment; nearly a third of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence if left untreated. Early recognition and proper treatment are critical in helping patients avoid a significant amount of disability.

The approval for this new indication was based on data from a prospective, double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase 3 study in 142 patients diagnosed with CIDP. This Phase 3 study was the first and only IVIg CIDP treatment study to evaluate more than one maintenance dosing option. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability was observed during seven maintenance infusions at three-week intervals over a six-month period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders in the 1.0 g/kg PANZYGA treatment arm at six months relative to baseline. A responder was defined as a patient with a decrease of at least one point in the adjusted 10-point Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score. The primary endpoint was met with 80% of patients in the study achieving an INCAT response with the 1.0 g/kg dose. Dose-dependent efficacy was shown by several supporting endpoints, including a 92% response in adjusted INCAT score in the 2.0 g/kg dose arm. Dose-dependent responses were also demonstrated in the 1.0 g/kg and 2.0 g/kg dose arms in grip strength, Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS) and Medical Research Council (MRC) sum scores. PANZYGA was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;5%) across all dosing arms were headache (15%), fever (14%), dermatitis (10%), and blood pressure increase (8%). During the study 11 patients (8%) received premedication.

PANZYGA was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2018 for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency (PI) in patients two years of age and older and chronic immune thrombocytopenia (cITP) in adults.

Pfizer Inc. and Octapharma AG are parties to a license agreement pursuant to which Pfizer is granted rights to market and commercialize PANZYGA in the U.S. Octapharma retains exclusive rights to commercialize this product globally outside of the U.S.

<b>PANZYGA<sup>®</sup> Indication and Usage</b>

PANZYGA (Immune Globulin Intravenous [Human] - ifas) is indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) in patients 2 years of age and older; this includes, but is not limited to, congenital agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiencies; chronic immune thrombocytopenia (cITP) in adults to raise platelet counts to control or prevent bleeding; and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in adults to improve neuromuscular disability and impairment.

<b>Contraindications</b>

PANZYGA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, to human immunoglobulin and in IgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and history of hypersensitivity.

<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>

Monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, and urine output in patients at risk of developing acute renal failure.

Hyperproteinemia, increased serum osmolarity, and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving PANZYGA.

Aseptic meningitis syndrome may occur in patients receiving PANZYGA, especially with high doses or rapid infusion.

Hemolysis that is either intravascular or due to enhanced red blood cell sequestration can develop subsequent to PANZYGA treatments. Risk factors for hemolysis include high doses and non-O-blood group. Closely monitor patients for hemolysis and hemolytic anemia.

Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions (transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]).

Monitor blood pressure prior to, during, and following PANZYGA infusion.

Carefully consider the relative risks and benefits before prescribing the high dose regimen (for cITP) in patients at increased risk of volume overload.

PANZYGA is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents, e.g. viruses and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent.

Adverse Reactions

PI – The most common adverse reactions (=5% study subjects) were headache, nausea, fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain.

cITP in adults – The most common adverse reactions (=5% study subjects) were headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and anemia.

CIDP in adults – The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of subjects were: headache, fever, dermatitis, and blood pressure increase.

KENILWORTH, N.J. &amp; WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Eisai today announced the first presentation of new investigational data from the pivotal Phase 3 CLEAR study (KEYNOTE-581/Study 307) in an oral presentation session (Abstract #269) at the virtual 2021 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU) and simultaneously published in the<i> New England Journal of Medicine</i>. The trial evaluated the combinations of KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, plus LENVIMA, the orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, and LENVIMA plus everolimus versus sunitinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS; HR=0.39 [95% CI: 0.32-0.49]; p&lt;0.001), overall survival (OS; HR=0.66 [95% CI: 0.49-0.88]; p=0.005) and objective response rate (ORR; relative risk=1.97 [95% CI: 1.69-2.29]; p&lt;0.001) versus sunitinib. LENVIMA plus everolimus also showed statistically significant improvements in PFS (HR=0.65 [95% CI: 0.53-0.80]; p&lt;0.001) and ORR (relative risk=1.48 [95% CI: 1.26-1.74]; p&lt;0.001) versus sunitinib. In an exploratory analysis, results for PFS and OS were consistent across prespecified Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups (favorable, intermediate and poor). Full MSKCC risk group data can be found in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> article entitled “Lenvatinib Plus Pembrolizumab or Everolimus for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,” published today. The safety profiles of both KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA and LENVIMA plus everolimus were consistent with previously reported studies.

“Continued efforts to improve outcomes in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma are critical, considering that the number of people diagnosed with the disease has more than doubled over the last 50 years, and almost one-third of these patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage,” said Dr. Robert Motzer, Medical Oncologist, Kidney Cancer Section Head, Genitourinary Oncology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA demonstrated a median progression-free survival of nearly two years, and seven in 10 patients experienced an objective response. This combination also significantly improved overall survival compared with sunitinib, with a 34% reduction in risk of death. These results suggest that this combination has the potential to impact clinical practice for this type of devastating cancer.”

In the trial’s primary endpoint of PFS, as assessed by independent review per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 61% (HR=0.39 [95% CI: 0.32-0.49]; p&lt;0.001), with a median PFS of 23.9 months (95% CI: 20.8-27.7) versus 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.0-11.0) for patients who received sunitinib. In the trial’s key secondary endpoints, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA reduced the risk of death by 34% (HR=0.66 [95% CI: 0.49-0.88]; p=0.005) versus patients who received sunitinib. Median OS was not reached in either treatment arm after a median follow-up of 27 months. Treatment with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA resulted in an ORR of 71.0% (95% CI: 66.3-75.7), with a complete response (CR) rate of 16.1% and a partial response (PR) rate of 54.9%, versus an ORR of 36.1% (95% CI: 31.2-41.1), with a CR rate of 4.2% and a PR rate of 31.9%, for patients who received sunitinib (relative risk=1.97 [95% CI: 1.69-2.29]; p&lt;0.001). Median duration of response (DOR) for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA was 25.8 months (95% CI: 22.1-27.9) versus 14.6 months (95% CI: 9.4-16.7) for patients who received sunitinib.

“These promising results are a testament to our company’s commitment to help improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with cancer,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Oncology Clinical Research, Merck Research Laboratories. “In this trial, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA demonstrated superior efficacy benefits compared with sunitinib. If approved, we believe this combination has the potential to be an important new treatment option for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in the first-line setting.”

In the trial’s second experimental treatment arm, LENVIMA plus everolimus reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI: 0.53-0.80]; p&lt;0.001), with a median PFS of 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.1-16.7) versus 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.0-11.0) for patients who received sunitinib. LENVIMA plus everolimus did not demonstrate an improvement in OS compared with sunitinib (HR=1.15 [95% CI: 0.88-1.50]; p=0.3). Median OS was not reached in either treatment arm after a median follow-up of 27 months. The ORR was 53.5% (95% CI: 48.3-58.7), with a CR rate of 9.8% and a PR rate of 43.7%, for patients who received LENVIMA plus everolimus versus 36.1% (95% CI: 31.2-41.1), with a CR rate of 4.2% and a PR rate of 31.9%, for patients who received sunitinib (relative risk=1.48 [95% CI: 1.26-1.74]; p&lt;0.001). Median DOR for patients who received LENVIMA plus everolimus was 16.6 months (95% CI: 14.6-20.6) versus 14.6 months (95% CI: 9.4-16.7) for patients who received sunitinib.

“These investigational data from the CLEAR study (KEYNOTE-581/Study 307) represent a significant milestone in our clinical research efforts in advanced renal cell carcinoma, with encouraging Phase 3 results in this population for the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination and with more than 700 patients having received LENVIMA plus everolimus in the clinical trial setting,” said Dr. Takashi Owa, Vice President, Chief Medicine Creation and Chief Discovery Officer, Oncology Business Group at Eisai. “Our progress thus far also reflects the significant contributions of dedicated patients, healthcare staff and researchers who continued to support this study during the global pandemic, to whom we extend our deepest gratitude.”

In the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 25.0% of patients, of LENVIMA in 18.5% of patients, and of both in 9.7% of patients. In the LENVIMA plus everolimus arm, TRAEs led to discontinuation of LENVIMA in 16.1% of patients, of everolimus in 19.2% of patients, and of both in 13.5% of patients. In the sunitinib arm, TRAEs led to discontinuation of sunitinib 10.0% of patients. Grade 5 TRAEs occurred in 1.1% of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm, in 0.8% of patients in the LENVIMA plus everolimus arm, and in 0.3% of patients in the sunitinib arm. Grade =3 TRAEs occurred in 71.6% of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm, in 73.0% of patients in the LENVIMA plus everolimus arm, and in 58.8% of patients in the sunitinib arm. The most common TRAEs of any grade occurring in at least 20% of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm were diarrhea (54.5%), hypertension (52.3%), hypothyroidism (42.6%), decreased appetite (34.9%), fatigue (32.1%) and stomatitis (32.1%). In the LENVIMA plus everolimus arm, the most common TRAEs of any grade occurring in at least 20% of patients were diarrhea (59.7%), stomatitis (45.6%), hypertension (43.1%), fatigue (36.6%), decreased appetite (34.9%) and proteinuria (31.8%). In the sunitinib arm, the most common TRAEs of any grade occurring in at least 20% of patients were diarrhea (44.4%), hypertension (39.1%), stomatitis (37.4%), hand-foot syndrome (35.9%), fatigue (32.1%) and nausea (27.6%).

<strong>About Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)</strong>

Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 430,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and nearly 180,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated there will be more than 76,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and nearly 14,000 deaths from the disease in 2021. Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men as in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. Approximately 30% of patients with RCC will have metastatic disease at diagnosis, and as many as 40% will develop metastases after primary surgical treatment for localized RCC. Survival is highly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, and with a five-year survival rate of 12% for metastatic disease, the prognosis for these patients is poor<strong>.</strong>

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,300 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% of these patients interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

<span class=""bwuline"">Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</span>

<i>KEYTRUDA</i> <i>as a Single Agent</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

<i>KEYTRUDA with Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen, which was at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT =3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT =3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT =3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span>

<i>Adrenal Insufficiency</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated.

Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.

<i>Thyroid Disorders</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.

Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism.

<i>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis</i>

<span class=""xn-location"">PLEASANTON, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 11, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG;OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <span class=""xn-money"">510K</span> clearance of stabilised urine samples to be used with the <b>cobas®</b> BKV Test on the <b>cobas®</b> 6800/8800 Systems. This test, previously designated as a Breakthrough Device by the FDA and cleared for use with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples to aid in the management of BK virus (BKV) in transplant patients, now also delivers enhanced diagnosis of disease via non-invasive, easily collected, prepared and stored urine samples.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

BKV can cause severe complications in immunocompromised transplant patients. Higher BKV DNA levels can often be present in urine prior to plasma, serving as an early predictor of an impending infection. A urine sample stabilised in <b>cobas®</b> PCR Media allows the integrity of urine results to be maintained, making storage and transportation simpler without the need for sample refrigeration.

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

""Transplant patients face a number of significant challenges, including complications that can arise from viruses like BKV,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Ann Costello</span>, Head Roche Diagnostic Solutions. ""With the FDA clearance of this non-invasive and easily collectable sample type, we now offer choices for clinicians using a standardised, automated solution to routinely monitor and manage infection risks. Together with our viral load tests for Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, we are committed to bringing better care to transplant patients.""

The cobas BKV Test runs on the widely available, high-throughput cobas 6800/8800 Systems. It is also approved for use in CE markets with EDTA plasma and urine stabilised in cobas PCR Media as sample types.

<b>About the cobas BKV Test<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The cobas BKV Test is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with dual-target technology that provides quantitative accuracy and guards against the risk of sequence variations that may be present in the BK virus. The cobas BKV Test has robust coverage with a limit of detection of 21.5 IU/mL and an expanded linear range from 21.5 IU/mL to 1E+08 IU/mL in EDTA plasma. Urine stabilised in cobas PCR Media has a limit of detection of 12.2 IU/mL and a linear range from 200 IU/mL to 1E+08 IU/mL.

The test offers an alternative to lab-developed tests (LDTs) or Analyte Specific Reagent (ASR) combinations, potentially minimising variability and complexity in testing, reducing workload and alleviating risk for laboratories. The test supports the goal of result standardisation across institutions by providing reproducible, high-quality results for clinical decision-making.

The fully automated cobas BKV, <b>cobas®</b> CMV and <b>cobas®</b> EBV Tests can run on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems simultaneously, providing absolute automation with proven performance and flexibility, leading to time savings and increased efficiency.

<b>About BK polyomavirus<br class=""dnr"" /></b>BK polyomavirus (BKV) is a member of the polyomavirus family that can cause transplant-associated complications including nephropathy in kidney transplantation and hemorrhagic cystitis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Infection can occur early in life, often with no symptoms. After primary infection, the virus can remain inactive throughout life, only to possibly reactivate in immunocompromised individuals, such as patients who receive solid-organ transplants. For kidney transplant patients, BKV infection is considered the most common viral complication, causing polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN) in up to 10 percent of kidney transplant recipients, and about 50 percent of PVN-affected patients will experience transplant graft failure.<sup>2</sup>  BKV is also associated with hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.<sup>3</sup>

The data from the S1500 trial (also called “PAPMET”), which was designed and managed by SWOG Cancer Research Network, will be presented on Saturday, February 13<sup>th</sup> during the Oral Abstract Session: Renal Cell Cancer at 10:00 – 11:15 a.m. PT at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology’s Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU), which is being held virtually, February 11-13, 2021. The findings will be simultaneously published in <i>The Lancet</i>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“This is the first randomized trial specific to metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma to show a clinically and statistically significant benefit with a targeted therapy, CABOMETYX, over an existing standard of care,” said Dr. Sumanta Pal, Clinical Professor and Co-Director of the Kidney Cancer Program, City of Hope, and SWOG’s principal investigator for the study. “The progression-free survival benefit seen in this trial is a meaningful improvement for patients with this form of kidney cancer. Based on these findings, there is strong evidence for the use of CABOMETYX in this setting.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The PAPMET trial was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute’s drug development program in the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, which facilitates collaborations between pharmaceutical companies as well as collaborations between companies and academic investigators. In the case of PAPMET, the National Cancer Institute brought Exelixis, AstraZeneca and Pfizer together with oncologists from SWOG to organize this trial to define which of the tested therapies is most effective for patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma,” said Dr. John Wright, Associate Branch Chief, Investigational Drug Branch, CTEP, NCI.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the new findings, CABOMETYX demonstrated significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), the trial’s primary endpoint, and objective response rate (ORR) compared with sunitinib. Median PFS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 6-12) with CABOMETYX (n=44) versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 3-7) with sunitinib (n=46) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 0.97; p=0.019). ORR was 23% for CABOMETYX versus 4% for sunitinib (p=0.010). Median overall survival was 20.0 months for cabozantinib and 16.4 months for sunitinib (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.51; p=0.28), which did not reach statistical significance. Enrollment into additional arms of the study examining the use of crizotinib or savolitinib was halted early based on predefined interim futility analyses comparing these agents with the sunitinib arm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We’re excited to build on the demonstrated history of CABOMETYX’s clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefits for patients with renal cell carcinoma with these data that support its efficacy in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma, who are often not the focus of major clinical trials for kidney cancer,” said Gisela Schwab, M.D., President, Product Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, Exelixis. “The ability of CABOMETYX to inhibit MET, which is frequently altered in this tumor type, encouraged additional research into its potential benefits. It’s gratifying to see these positive results of the PAPMET trial, which may help physicians choose an appropriate therapy for their patients with advanced papillary renal cell carcinoma.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The discontinuation rate of study medications due to treatment-related adverse events was 24% for sunitinib and 23% for CABOMETYX. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events with CABOMETYX were hypertension (32%), hand-foot syndrome (20%) and fatigue (13%). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events with sunitinib were hypertension (17%), anemia (13%) and decrease in white blood cell count (11%). One death, secondary to a thromboembolic event, within 30 days of the last dose of study medication was reported for a patient receiving CABOMETYX.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About the SWOG S1500 Clinical Trial</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SWOG S1500 (NCT02761057), also called PAPMET, was a randomized phase 2 trial comparing cabozantinib, crizotinib and savolitinib to sunitinib, a VEGF-directed multikinase inhibitor and current standard of care for patients with advanced or metastatic PRCC. The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, designed and led by the SWOG Cancer Research Network under the leadership of Dr. Pal, and conducted through the NCI National Clinical Trials Network. The goal of the trial was to determine whether MET-directed therapy improves clinical outcomes relative to conventional VEGF-directed agents. Exelixis provided the cabozantinib for the trial under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Patients with pathologically verified PRCC (type I, II, or not otherwise specified) were randomized 1:1:1:1 to the control arm of sunitinib or one of three investigational arms: CABOMETYX, crizotinib and savolitinib. CABOMETYX was orally administered at 60 mg daily, with dose reductions to 40 mg and 20 mg permitted. Enrolled patients could have received up to one prior therapy. Prior therapy was received by 10 patients (7%), and the most common prior therapy was the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab (4 patients). The primary endpoint was PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the time of radiographic or clinical progression, symptomatic deterioration or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate and overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, and safety evaluation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PRCC accounts for about 15% of all renal cell carcinomas.<sup>2,3</sup> Genomic and molecular characterization of PRCC has implicated MET signaling as a key driver of this cancer.<sup>2,4</sup> Targeting VEGFR and other tyrosine kinases, including MET and AXL, has led to improved outcomes in RCC as compared with sunitinib, and further supported the investigation of MET targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors in PRCC.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The American Cancer Society’s 2021 statistics cite kidney cancer as among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S.<sup>5</sup> If detected in its early stages, the five-year survival rate for RCC is high; for patients with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC, however, the five-year survival rate is only 13%.<sup>4</sup> Approximately 32,000 patients in the U.S. and 71,000 worldwide will require systemic treatment for advanced kidney cancer in 2021.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About CABOMETYX<sup>®</sup> (cabozantinib)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC; for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; and for patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in the European Union and additional countries and regions worldwide. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the United States and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib in the United States.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Hemorrhage</b>: Severe and fatal hemorrhages occurred with CABOMETYX. The incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhagic events was 5% in CABOMETYX patients in RCC and HCC studies. Discontinue CABOMETYX for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage. Do not administer CABOMETYX to patients who have a recent history of hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, hematemesis, or melena.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Perforations and Fistulas</b>: Fistulas, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, including fatal cases, occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of fistulas and perforations, including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who experience a Grade 4 fistula or a GI perforation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Thrombotic Events</b>: CABOMETYX increased the risk of thrombotic events. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 7% (including 4% pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism in 2% of CABOMETYX patients. Fatal thrombotic events occurred in CABOMETYX patients. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or serious arterial or venous thromboembolic events that require medical intervention.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis</b>: CABOMETYX can cause hypertension, including hypertensive crisis. Hypertension was reported in 36% (17% Grade 3 and &lt;1% Grade 4) of CABOMETYX patients. Do not initiate CABOMETYX in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Withhold CABOMETYX for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled, resume at a reduced dose. Discontinue CABOMETYX for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy or for hypertensive crisis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Diarrhea</b>: Diarrhea occurred in 63% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 11% of CABOMETYX patients. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to Grade 1 and resume at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 diarrhea, Grade 3 diarrhea that cannot be managed with standard antidiarrheal treatments, or Grade 4 diarrhea.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE):</b> PPE occurred in 44% of CABOMETYX patients. Grade 3 PPE occurred in 13% of CABOMETYX patients. Withhold CABOMETYX until improvement to Grade 1 and resume at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Hepatotoxicity</b>: CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to CABOMETYX alone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes than when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt CABOMETYX and nivolumab and consider administering corticosteroids.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With the combination of CABOMETYX and nivolumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients. ALT or AST &gt;3 times ULN (Grade =2) was reported in 83 patients, of whom 23 (28%) received systemic corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%). Among the 44 patients with Grade =2 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either CABOMETYX (n=9) or nivolumab (n=11) as a single agent or with both (n=24), recurrence of Grade =2 increased ALT or AST was observed in 2 patients receiving CABOMETYX, 2 patients receiving nivolumab, and 7 patients receiving both CABOMETYX and nivolumab.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Adrenal Insufficiency</b>: CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold CABOMETYX and/or nivolumab depending on severity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 4.7% (15/320) of patients with RCC who received CABOMETYX with nivolumab, including Grade 3 (2.2%), and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 0.9% and withholding of CABOMETYX and nivolumab in 2.8% of patients with RCC.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Approximately 80% (12/15) of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy, including systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 27% (n=4) of the 15 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom CABOMETYX with nivolumab was withheld for adrenal insufficiency, 6 reinstated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, all (n=6) received hormone replacement therapy and 2 had recurrence of adrenal insufficiency.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Proteinuria</b>: Proteinuria was observed in 7% of CABOMETYX patients. Monitor urine protein regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)</b>: ONJ occurred in &lt;1% of CABOMETYX patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration or erosion, persistent jaw pain, or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to CABOMETYX initiation and periodically during treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Withhold CABOMETYX for development of ONJ until complete resolution.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Impaired Wound Healing</b>: Wound complications occurred with CABOMETYX. Withhold CABOMETYX for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CABOMETYX for at least 2 weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing is observed. The safety of resumption of CABOMETYX after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)</b>: RPLS, a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic findings on MRI, can occur with CABOMETYX. Evaluate for RPLS in patients presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion, or altered mental function. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop RPLS.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>: CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CABOMETYX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b></p>

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

INCHEON, South Korea--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Celltrion Healthcare today announced that on February 11th, the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorisation for Yuflyma™ (CT-P17), an adalimumab biosimilar, across all thirteen intended indications for the treatment of multiple chronic inflammatory diseases.

The EC approval of Yuflyma™ follows the recommendation for marketing authorisation issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2020. The marketing authorisation is based on analytical, preclinical and clinical studies, demonstrating that Yuflyma™ is comparable to adalimumab, the reference product, in terms of safety, efficacy, PK/PD and immunogenicity up to 24 weeks<sup>1</sup> and 1 year<sup>2</sup> following treatment. Based on the results of the pivotal study, a high concentration formulation of Yuflyma™ has been approved for use in the European Union (EU), in patients with thirteen chronic inflammatory diseases; rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS (nr-axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis (PsO), paediatric plaque psoriasis (pPsO), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Crohn’s disease (CD), paediatric Crohn’s disease (pCD), ulcerative colitis (UC), uveitis (UV) and paediatric uveitis (pUV).

“In Europe, according to IQVIA data, 60% of the whole adalimumab market has been taken by high concentration formulation and over 90% of the original adalimumab market has already been replaced with a high concentration version. With high concentration, low-volume, and consequently less pain, adalimumab can improve treatment adherence at the very least. Therefore, we focused on development of a high concentration biosimilar to provide a significant alternative to the adalimumab treatment category,” said Dr. HoUng Kim, Ph.D., Head of Medical and Marketing Division at Celltrion Healthcare. “In terms of the administration device, we have looked to ensure improved convenience for patients as well as providers with the inclusion of needle size (29G), latex-free to reduce allergy risk, and a long storage period or shelf life at room temperature for 30 days.”

Professor Rieke Alten, Head of the Department of Internal Medicine, Rheumatology, Clinical Immunology and Osteology at Schlosspark-Klinik, Teaching Hospital of Charité, Berlin, Germany said, “Over the past two decades, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) biologics have revolutionised the management of chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, but some of the features needed improvement for patients to reach their therapeutic goals. As a physician, we welcome these value-added features such as high concentration and low-volume formulations to reduce injection discomfort.”

<b>About CT-P17 (biosimilar adalimumab)</b>

CT-P17 is the first proposed high concentration, low- volume and citrate-free adalimumab biosimilar. CT-P17 is indicated for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS (nr-axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis (Ps), paediatric plaque psoriasis (pPs), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Crohn’s disease (CD), paediatric Crohn’s disease (pCD), ulcerative colitis (UC), uveitis (UV) and paediatric uveitis (pUV). CT-P17 is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that contains the active ingredient adalimumab. Adalimumab is a fully human anti–tumour necrosis factor a (anti-TNFa) monoclonal antibody. CT-P17 provides pain-reducing features as it comes with citrate-free formulation, meaning it causes less pain upon injection.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The authorisation of <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca </i>manufactured by AstraZeneca, and <i>COVISHIELD</i> manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII), enables global access to the vaccine during the pandemic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The EUL allows for two doses of the vaccine to be administered at a four to 12-week interval. This regimen was shown in clinical trials to be safe and effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, with no severe cases and no hospitalisations more than 14 days after the second dose. The WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended a dosing interval of eight to 12 weeks. In addition, they also recommended use of the vaccine in countries where new variants, including the South African B1.351 variant, are prevalent.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">AstraZeneca and SII will now work with the COVAX Facility to begin supplying the vaccine around the world, with the majority going to low and middle-income countries as quickly as possible. In the first half of 2021, it is hoped that more than 300 million doses of the vaccine will be made available to 145 countries through COVAX, pending supply and operational challenges. These doses will be allocated equitably according to the COVAX Allocation Framework.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “Today’s approval endorses that the vaccine can be used to help protect populations across the world, including adults over 65 years and in countries where different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are in circulation. This is a huge step towards ensuring global access to our vaccine and helping us fulfil our public health commitment to broad and equitable access at no profit during the pandemic.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer, Serum Institute of India, said: “We have been waiting for this final milestone. I am happy and relieved that with the WHO's EUL we will be able to start the deliveries to African and other low and middle-income countries immediately. Countries with a large population must be protected as soon as possible.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">AstraZeneca has committed to making its COVID-19 vaccine available to as many countries as possible and at no profit during the pandemic period. In June 2020, the Company <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-takes-next-steps-towards-broad-and-equitable-access-to-oxford-universitys-covid-19-vaccine.html"">announced</a> a sub-licencing agreement with the SII to manufacture and supply up to one billion doses of the vaccine to low and middle-income countries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Company was the first global pharmaceutical company to <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-takes-next-steps-towards-broad-and-equitable-access-to-oxford-universitys-covid-19-vaccine.html"">join COVAX in June 2020</a>. This global mechanism is working to accelerate the development, production and equitable access to new COVID-19 tools across the world for all participating countries, regardless of income level.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (two-eight degrees Celsius/36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i>, formerly AZD1222
</b><i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca</i> was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The WHO approval was based on pooled analysis for efficacy from 11,636  participants aged 18 years and older, accruing 131 symptomatic COVID-19 infections from the UK and Brazil Phase III trials conducted by Oxford University.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Overall safety was based on an interim analysis of pooled data from four clinical trials conducted in the UK, Brazil and South Africa which included 23,745 participants aged 18 years or older. <i>COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca </i>was well tolerated and there were no serious safety events confirmed related to the vaccine. The participants were from diverse ethnic and geographic groups who were healthy or had stable underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition to the programme led by Oxford University, AstraZeneca is conducting a large trial in the US and globally. In total, Oxford University and AstraZeneca expect to enrol up to 60,000 participants globally.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation or emergency use in more than 50 countries, with the WHO EUL now accelerating the pathway to access in up to 145 countries through the COVAX Facility.</p>

<div class=""section post-body"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Global biotech innovator Aker BioMarine enters into a research collaboration with Université de Sherbrooke Department of Medicine, to investigate if LPC-bound EPA/DHA is effective in preventing cognitive decline linked to Alzheimer’s disease. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aker BioMarine will supply the research team its krill-based LPC EPA/DHA product, LYSOVETA™.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While there is strong evidence linking DHA to better cognitive scores and lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease, clinical trials using fish oil as the source for EPA/DHA have not been conclusive. To help fill this gap, a research team from the Université de Sherbrooke in Canada will test if LYSOVETA, Aker BioMarine’s new delivery platform based on LPC-bound EPA/DHA from krill, is more effective in increasing the concentration of DHA in the brain and improving cognition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
“Alzheimer’s is a disease without a cure, which is why we are actively exploring whether LYSOVETA can help improve cognitive abilities among those who are affected by it. Université de Sherbrooke is a leader in this field of study, and we believe that by working with them and ensuring an ample supply of our krill-based products, we can make significant headway in furthering their research and getting more conclusive answers on how EPA/DHA can more effectively improve brain health,” said Matts Johansen, CEO, Aker BioMarine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The study, led by Dr. Mélanie Plourde from Université de Sherbrooke, will use different formulations of EPA/DHA to investigate if LPC is a superior source of these fatty acids in populations that are genetically at-risk for Alzheimer’s disease. More specifically, the team will evaluate the link between genetic variations in lipid metabolism and transport of EPA/DHA across the blood brain barrier using knock in mice for human <em>E4</em> (<em>hAPOE4</em>) or <em>E3</em> (<em>hAPOE3</em>) genetic variants. One group will receive Aker BioMarine’s LYSOVETA, LPC-bound EPA/DHA derived from Antarctic krill, while the other will receive triglyceride-bound EPA/DHA from fish oil. The team will investigate the uptake of these fatty acids and effect on cognitive score to see if LPC bound EPA/DHA can have a positive effect for those at risk-populations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“What if, for cognitive decline, we just have missed the target because the supplement/drug formulations were not appropriately designed to target the brain? Our hypothesis is that by using a new EPA/DHA formulation, such as LYSOVETA, we can direct more DHA into the right areas of the brain to improve cognition,” said Dr. Mélanie Plourde, Professor, Université de Sherbrooke.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are excited about this study and eager to start testing LYSOVETA, as we believe we can make significant progress in our knowledge and understanding about the delivery mechanisms for DHA and its potential impact on people with Alzheimer’s.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since its inception, Aker BioMarine has worked closely with universities worldwide to study the health benefits of its products derived from Antarctic krill. To increase knowledge on the effects of LPC-bound EPA and DHA, Aker BioMarine will continue to expand its collaborations to partners who are eager to explore the benefits of this carrier on human health.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About LYSOVETA™</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In late 2020, Aker BioMarine launched LYSOVETA™, a new delivery platform based on LPC-bound EPA and DHA from krill. It marked a significant breakthrough that promises to open up new opportunities within the brain, eye and other important health areas. It is sustainability sourced from Antarctic krill and processed at Aker BioMarine’s facility in Houston. The company plans for a commercial launch of the product for human health in 2022.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH), a leading precision oncology company, announced the availability of Guardant Reveal™, the first blood-only liquid biopsy test for the detection of residual and recurrent disease from a simple blood draw. The first-of-its-kind commercial test improves the management of early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) patients by detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood after surgery to identify patients with residual disease who may benefit most from adjuvant therapy, and by detecting recurrence months earlier than current standard-of-care methods like carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tests or imaging.<sup>1-6</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Guardant Reveal test achieves industry-leading sensitivity (91 percent)<sup>7</sup> for detecting ctDNA by simultaneously interrogating both genomic alterations and methylation. The test accurately reports genomic alterations down to allele frequencies of 0.01 percent, and effectively filters out biological noise sources such as mutations caused by clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential. The incorporation of biologically relevant epigenomic signatures has been essential to increasing the sensitivity of the test to detect early-stage cancers including CRC. Results are obtained from a simple blood draw and returned in as little as 7 days without the need for a tissue biopsy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“For the more than 1.5 million colorectal cancer survivors today in the U.S.<sup>8</sup>, the risk of recurrence is a serious one. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and an estimated 10-30 percent of early-stage patients recur<sup>8</sup>—so it’s vital that oncologists have better tools to manage these patients by quickly identifying those high-risk patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy after surgery, and by detecting recurrence earlier as part of regular surveillance,” said Helmy Eltoukhy, Guardant Health CEO. “At Guardant Health our goal is to help cancer patients across the care continuum, and with the Guardant Reveal test, we are now able to serve an earlier patient group, early-stage colorectal cancer patients, where an unmet medical need exists given the limitations of current tools.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The use of liquid biopsies in clinical practice represents a new frontier in improving cancer care for patients at all stages of their disease,” said Aparna Parikh, MD, MPH, Gastrointestinal Oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. “It’s exciting to see that Guardant Health’s liquid biopsy tests not only inform targeted therapies for advanced cancer patients, but can now detect signs of cancer in the blood after curative intent surgeries. With this test, clinicians now have an additional tool to evaluate whether a patient with early-stage colorectal cancer is at high risk for recurrence, helping to inform adjuvant treatment after surgery in certain settings, and to detect microscopic recurrence of cancer months earlier than today’s standard of care.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Guardant Reveal test is Guardant Health’s first commercially available liquid biopsy test for clinical use in the management of early-stage cancer. The test will focus first on one indication where the unmet medical need exists, early-stage CRC, with additional cancer types to follow.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Guardant Health</b></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Those living with MDS are often dependent on regular RBC transfusions. While these transfusions help manage symptoms of anemia, transfusion dependency is very burdensome for patients,” said Dr. Rena Buckstein, MD, FRCPC, Haematologist, associate professor and Head of the Hematology Disease Site Group at Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. “Treatment options to remedy transfusion dependence are limited once first line therapy fails, so REBLOZYL<sup>®</sup>, as the only erythroid maturation agent in Canada, provides an important MDS treatment to achieve RBC transfusion independence in a subgroup of patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MDS are a group of cancers which cause limitations in the bone marrow’s ability to produce healthy and mature RBCs,<sup>2</sup> and typically occur among older people, and in men more than in women.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“MDS can significantly impact quality of life; especially for those who are dependent on regular RBC transfusions,” said Cindy Anthony, Executive Director, Aplastic Anemia &amp; Myelodysplasia Association of Canada (AAMAC). “We’re pleased to see an alternative to transfusions available which can help alleviate some of the burden of the disease and support patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">REBLOZYL<sup>®</sup> helps to regulate late-stage RBC maturation in order to potentially reduce the need for RBC transfusions.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Bristol Myers Squibb is thrilled to provide Canadians with an additional option beyond RBC transfusions to treat MDS-associated anemia,” said Al Reba, General Manager, Bristol Myers Squibb Canada. “This first-in-class treatment is an example of Bristol Myers Squibb’s commitment to develop innovative therapies for Canadians living with severe blood disorders.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Working with our partners at Bristol Myers Squibb, we are excited to help address the needs of Canadians living with MDS,” said Habib Dable, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. “By targeting the ineffective erythropoiesis associated with MDS, REBLOZYL<sup>®</sup> represents an important addition for the treatment of patients living with this condition.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Health Canada’s approval of REBLOZYL<sup>®</sup> is based upon findings from the phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled MEDALIST study, which involved patients with very low- to intermediate-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) requiring regular RBC transfusions (<span class=""bwuline"">&gt;</span>2 RBC units per 8 weeks).<sup>1</sup> The patients were randomized 2:1 to REBLOZYL<sup>®</sup> or placebo.<sup>1 </sup>In the trial, results demonstrated significantly greater percentage of patients treated with REBLOZYL<sup>®</sup> achieving transfusion independence for eight weeks or longer during the first 24 weeks of the trial as compared to placebo (38% vs. 13%, P&lt;0.001) at primary endpoint.<sup>1</sup></p>

These data, which will be presented at the sixth annual Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis Forum (ACTRIMS) taking place on February 25-27, 2021, continue to show that Kesimpta has the potential to become a first-choice treatment option, as ease of administration plays an important role in patient satisfaction and treatment adherence.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“As an MS nurse, it’s important for me to know that the people I work with who have MS are going to be successful in administering their treatment themselves,” said Amy Perrin Ross. “The Sensoready autoinjector pen is easy to set up and use, so people living with MS can feel confident that they will be able to administer the treatment themselves independently and comfortably.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“For people living with a chronic disease such as MS, access to highly effective treatments and maintaining flexibility in their lives is paramount,” said Estelle Vester-Blokland, Global Head Neuroscience Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “At Novartis, we are committed to reimagining medicine and solutions that enable patients to maintain that flexibility in their daily lives by having a safe, high efficacy treatment that is easy to use independently from the comfort of their own home.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About the study</strong><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>
The multicenter survey was conducted with 80 MS patients and 50 MS nurses across the US, Germany, France and Italy. The survey included patients with RMS who received a disease-modifying treatment through a subcutaneous/intramuscular injection via an autoinjector for =2 months and MS nurses who had =3 years of practice with experience in training patients on =2-6 MS autoinjector devices. Nurses and patients were asked a set of qualitative open-ended and quantitative closed-ended questions, rating the importance of predefined attributes for the Sensoready autoinjector pen versus other autoinjectors (Rebidose/Rebismart [Rebif], Avonex pen [Avonex], Autoject/YpsoMate [Copaxone], Plegridy pen [Plegridy]). The answers were measured on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all important) to 10 (extremely important). This study will be presented at the ACTRIMS Forum 2021 on February 25-27, 2021.</p>

GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that patient dosing has begun in a Phase III clinical programme investigating the immunogenicity, safety, reactogenicity and persistence of its Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) candidate vaccine for older adults (GSK3844766A), following  the release of positive Phase I/II results on safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity (presented at ID Week Congress in October 2020).

RSV represents a significant health threat for older adults (&gt;60 years of age), with 360,000 hospitalisations and 24,000 deaths associated with RSV infections estimated annually in developed countries<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-starts-phase-iii-rsv-candidate-vaccine-programme-for-older-adults/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Without routine testing for RSV and robust surveillance systems in several countries, global data on the burden of RSV in older adults is either lacking or is likely to largely underestimate its significance. As the global population ages, the morbidity and mortality of respiratory infections including RSV are expected to steadily increase. An RSV vaccine for older adults would help prevent primary infection and also help preserve independence, health and quality of life.

<strong>Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccines R&amp;D for GSK, said</strong>: “RSV is one of the most significant remaining unmet medical needs for older adults, with 1 out of 6 infected with RSV requiring a hospitalisation<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-starts-phase-iii-rsv-candidate-vaccine-programme-for-older-adults/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[2]</sup></a>. With our unique combination of technologies, the pre-fusion F antigen and our proprietary adjuvant system, we were able to induce a strong immune response, of both humoral and cellular components, to levels normally seen in healthy adults”.

The RSV candidate vaccine for older adults contains a recombinant subunit pre-fusion RSV antigen (RSVPreF3) combined with GSK’s proprietary AS01 adjuvant<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-starts-phase-iii-rsv-candidate-vaccine-programme-for-older-adults/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[3]</sup></a>, which is also used in GSK’s shingles vaccine. The candidate vaccine has shown promising safety and immunogenicity in a Phase I/II study in both young and older adults and was well-tolerated (data presented at the ID Week Congress in October 2020). The results  showed that one month post-immunisation, the candidate vaccine had elicited a robust humoral and cellular immunity compared with baseline, with a close to 10 times increase of RSV-A neutralising antibodies and above 12 times increase of RSVPreF3 IgG antibodies induced in the vaccinated group. These results show that the vaccine candidate can stimulate the immune system in older adults to produce a similar level of antibodies as young adults, which is crucial to protect this vulnerable population.  In addition, the candidate vaccine was able to restore the lower levels of pre-existing RSV-specific T-cells observed in older adults before vaccination to similar levels observed in the younger adults following vaccination.

This candidate vaccine is part of a portfolio of RSV vaccines in development by GSK, which includes maternal and paediatric vaccine candidates. To deliver a broad benefit against RSV infections, the three candidate vaccines are based on different novel technologies, tailored to the needs of the different populations most impacted. All three candidate vaccines have received FDA fast-track designation. The Phase III efficacy study for the maternal RSV candidate vaccine started in November 2020, while the Phase I/II study (in RSV sero-naive infants) with the paediatric RSV candidate vaccine is ongoing.

<strong>About the AReSVi Study</strong>

The study named AReSVi 004 is a randomised open-label Phase III study (<a href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04732871?term=212496&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"">NCT04732871</a>) to be conducted in up to 1650 adults and will assess the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and long-term persistence of immune response up to 3 years following vaccination of our RSV candidate vaccine, in adults aged 60 years and above. The study is expected to end in early 2024, with interim results expected to be available in the second half of 2022.

A second study (AReSVi 006) investigating the efficacy of the candidate vaccine to help protect older adults against lower-respiratory tract disease due to RSV is expected to start in the coming months.

In total, it is expected that more than 10,000 participants will be enrolled in the Phase III programme for the RSV candidate vaccine for older adults, as it is standard for late stage clinical trials where correlate of protection has not been established yet.

<strong>About GSK’s RSV candidate vaccine for older adults (</strong><strong>GSK3844766A)</strong>

This candidate vaccine contains a recombinant subunit pre-fusion RSV antigen (RSVPreF3) combined with GSK’s proprietary AS01 adjuvant, which is also used in GSK’s shingles vaccine. Phase I/II interim safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity data of GSK’s RSV candidate vaccine in young adults and in older adults aged 60 to 80 (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03814590"">NCT03814590</a>) presented at ID Week in October 2020, showed that within one-month post-immunisation, the adjuvanted candidate vaccine as well as other vaccine formulations tested were well tolerated and induced a robust humoral and cellular immunity compared with baseline. The selected formulation of the candidate vaccine showed in the 60-80-year-old vaccines, that one-month post vaccination:
<ul>
 	<li>High levels of RSVPreF3 IgG antibodies (geometric mean antibody concentrations were 12.4 fold-higher) and RSV-A neutralising antibodies (geometric mean antibody titers were 9.5 fold-higher) were induced.</li>
 	<li>Before vaccination, deficiency of RSVPreF3-specific T-cells (hypothesised to help promote viral clearance) was observed in older adults compared to younger adults. After vaccination, a robust RSVPreF3 CD4+ T-cells response in older adults had been boosted to reach a similar range than the one observed in younger adults.</li>
</ul>
<strong>About respiratory syncytial virus</strong>

Although RSV infection can occur at any age, it can cause more serious respiratory illness in our infants and older adults. Globally, although data quality varies across different countries, there are an estimated 33 million cases of RSV annually in children less than 5 years of age, with about 3 million hospitalised and approximately 120,000 dying each year from complications associated with the infection. Nearly half of these paediatric hospitalisations and deaths occur in infants less than 6 months of age<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-starts-phase-iii-rsv-candidate-vaccine-programme-for-older-adults/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[1]</sup></a>. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, virtually all children in the US get an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old and one to two out of every 100 children younger than 6 months of age with RSV infection may need to be hospitalised<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-starts-phase-iii-rsv-candidate-vaccine-programme-for-older-adults/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[2]</sup></a>. It also represents a significant health threat for older adults (&gt;60 years of age), with 360,000 hospitalisations and 24,000 deaths associated with RSV infections estimated annually in developed countries<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-starts-phase-iii-rsv-candidate-vaccine-programme-for-older-adults/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Every year, approximatively 1 million people globally over 65 die from respiratory infections<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-starts-phase-iii-rsv-candidate-vaccine-programme-for-older-adults/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[4]</sup></a> and about 1 in 6 older adults infected with RSV will require hospitalisation<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-starts-phase-iii-rsv-candidate-vaccine-programme-for-older-adults/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[5]</sup></a>.

Without robust surveillance systems in several countries, global data on the burden of RSV in older adults is either lacking or likely to underestimate its significance. As the global population ages, the morbidity and mortality of respiratory infections including those related to RSV are expected to steadily increase.

<strong>Basel, February 16, 2021</strong> — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following expanded indication for Entresto<sup>®</sup> (sacubitril/valsartan): <em>to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic heart failure</em><sup><em>1</em></sup><em>. Benefits are most clearly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal</em><sup><em>1</em></sup><em>.</em> The label also states LVEF is a variable measure and clinical judgment should be used in deciding whom to treat<sup>1</sup>.

For the first time, there is a treatment with benefit for patients diagnosed with guideline-defined heart failure that includes both those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and many with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)<sup>1-3</sup>.

“This approval is a significant advancement, providing a treatment to many patients who were not eligible for treatment before because their ejection fraction was above the region we normally considered reduced. Until now, treatment for these patients was largely empiric,” said Scott Solomon, MD, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, and PARAGON-HF Executive Committee Co-Chair. “We can now offer a treatment to a wider range of patients who have an LVEF below normal.”

This label expansion is based on efficacy and safety evidence observed in PARAGON-HF, the largest and only Phase III active-controlled study to date in patients with guideline-defined HFpEF<sup>2,5,6</sup>. The greatest benefit was shown in patients with LVEF below normal<sup>6</sup>.

Approximately 6 million Americans are living with chronic heart failure (CHF)<sup>4</sup>. Approximately 3 million have HFrEF, and of the remaining 3 million, about 2 million have HFpEF with LVEF below normal<sup>2-4</sup>. The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is increasing as the population ages<sup>4</sup>. Patients often face worsening symptoms that result in frequent HF hospitalizations<sup>7</sup>. Each hospitalization event is associated with worsening long-term prognosis<sup>7</sup>. Approximately one in four patients are re-admitted for HF and 10 percent may die within 30 days of discharge<sup>8,9</sup>. Overall CHF death rates remain significantly high, with up to half of patients dying within five years of a HF diagnosis<sup>4</sup>.

“We are proud of our goal to reimagine medicine. This commitment has enabled us to bring Entresto to millions more heart failure patients in the US, many of whom did not have an approved treatment option until now,” said Marie-France Tschudin, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “This achievement would not have been possible without tremendous dedication from investigators, patients in our clinical trials and the advocacy community, to whom we are extremely grateful.”

<strong>About our longstanding commitment to heart failure</strong>
Our goal is to reimagine medicine for heart failure patients. Novartis established the largest global clinical program in the HF disease area across the pharma industry to date. Known as FortiHFy, it is comprised of more than 40 clinical studies designed to generate an array of additional data on efficacy, quality of life, patient-reported outcomes and real-world evidence with Entresto, as well as to extend understanding of heart failure. FortiHFy includes trials across the spectrum of heart failure, such as PARADIGM-HF, PIONEER-HF, TRANSITION, PROVE-HF, PARAGON-HF and PARAMOUNT. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 30,000 patients have participated in the Entresto clinical trials program, and it is estimated that more than 2.8 million patients are on treatment with Entresto today.

<strong>About Entresto</strong>
In Europe, Entresto is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of symptomatic chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction<sup>10</sup>. In the United States, Entresto is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic heart failure<sup>1</sup>. Benefits are most clearly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal<sup>1</sup>. LVEF is a variable measure, so use clinical judgment in deciding whom to treat<sup>1</sup>. Approved indications may vary depending upon the individual country.

Entresto is a twice-a-day medicine that reduces the strain on the failing heart<sup>10</sup>. It does this by enhancing protective neurohormonal systems (i.e., natriuretic peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)<sup>10,11</sup>. Other common HF medicines, called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS. Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan<sup>1,10</sup>.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Tirzepatide led to significant A1C and body weight reductions from baseline in adults with type 2 diabetes in Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) SURPASS-3 and SURPASS-5 phase 3 clinical trials after 52 weeks and 40 weeks, respectively. In topline results, the primary and all key secondary endpoints were met for both estimandsi in SURPASS-3, which compared tirzepatide to titrated insulin degludec, and in SURPASS-5, which compared tirzepatide to placebo, both as an add-on to titrated insulin glargine.

Using the efficacy estimandii, the highest dose of tirzepatide (15 mg) reduced A1C by 2.37 percent and body weight by 12.9 kg (13.9 percent) in SURPASS-3, and reduced A1C by 2.59 percent and body weight by 10.9 kg (11.6 percent) in SURPASS-5. At the highest dose, 62.4 percent of SURPASS-5 participants – who had a mean duration of diabetes of 13.3 years – achieved an A1C of less than 5.7 percent, the level seen in people without diabetes. In both studies, the overall safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to that of the well-established glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most commonly reported adverse events and decreasing with continued dosing.

Tirzepatide is a novel investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

“Tirzepatide delivered impressive A1C and body weight reductions in both studies and continued to achieve consistent efficacy and safety results in people living with type 2 diabetes, regardless of how long they have had the condition,” said Mike Mason, president, Lilly Diabetes. “Significantly lowering A1C levels and weight are high priorities throughout the type 2 diabetes treatment journey, and the results we have seen from three SURPASS studies to date fuel our belief in tirzepatide’s ability to meet those needs.”

SURPASS-3
SURPASS-3 was a 52-week randomized, open-label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) to titrated insulin degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control on stable doses of metformin with or without an SGLT-2 inhibitor. Study participants were insulin-naïve and had a mean duration of diabetes of 8.4 years, a baseline A1C of 8.17 percent and a baseline weight of 94.3 kg.

The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints across both the efficacy and treatment-regimeniii estimands. All three tirzepatide doses (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) led to superior A1C and body weight reductions compared to titrated insulin degludec (mean dose at 52 weeks was 48.8 units per dayiv). Across the three doses, up to 92.6 percent of participants on tirzepatide achieved an A1C of less than 7 percent (the American Diabetes Association’s recommended target for people with diabetes). Further, in an additional secondary endpoint, up to 48.4 percent of participants treated with tirzepatide achieved an A1C of less than 5.7 percent.

In the treatment-regimen estimand, each of the tirzepatide doses led to statistically significant A1C and body weight reductions versus titrated insulin degludec:

A1C reduction: -1.85% (5 mg), -2.01% (10 mg), -2.14% (15 mg), -1.25% (insulin degludec)
Weight change: -7.0 kg (5 mg), -9.6 kg (10 mg), -11.3 kg (15 mg), +1.9 kg (insulin degludec)
Percent of participants achieving A1C <7%: 79.2% (5 mg), 81.5% (10 mg), 83.5% (15 mg), 58.0% (insulin degludec)
Hypoglycemia less than 54 mg/dL (level two) was reported in 1.4 percent (5 mg), 1.1 percent (10 mg) and 2.2 percent (15 mg) of participants in the tirzepatide arms and in 7.3 percent of participants in the insulin degludec arm.

The most commonly reported adverse events in the tirzepatide arms were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, usually occurring during the dose escalation period and decreasing with continued dosing. For study participants treated with tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively), nausea (11.5 percent, 22.5 percent, 23.7 percent), diarrhea (15.4 percent, 16.7 percent, 15.6 percent) and vomiting (5.9 percent, 9.4 percent, 10.0 percent) were more frequently experienced compared to titrated insulin degludec (1.7 percent [nausea], 3.9 percent [diarrhea], 1.1 percent [vomiting]). Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 7.2 percent (tirzepatide 5 mg), 9.7 percent (tirzepatide 10 mg) and 10.9 percent (tirzepatide 15 mg), compared to 1.4 percent (insulin degludec).

“For people with type 2 diabetes who are at the point in their treatment journey where they would progress to an injectable therapy, these positive results emphasize tirzepatide’s potential to deliver a meaningful impact in lowering their A1C and weight,” said Bernhard Ludvik, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine, Landstrasse Clinic, Vienna, and Principal Investigator of SURPASS-3. “Throughout the year-long study, tirzepatide provided sustained A1C reduction and progressive weight loss with low occurrence of level two hypoglycemia, an important consideration for people with diabetes and their clinicians.”

SURPASS-5
SURPASS-5 was a 40-week randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) compared to placebo, both as an add-on to titrated insulin glargine with or without metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes. Study participants had a mean duration of diabetes of 13.3 years, a baseline A1C of 8.31 percent, a baseline weight of 95.2 kg and a baseline insulin glargine dose of 37.6 units per dayv.

The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints across both the efficacy and treatment-regimen estimands. All three doses of tirzepatide demonstrated superior A1C reductions and weight reductions from baseline compared to placebo. Across the three doses, up to 97.4 percent of participants on tirzepatide achieved an A1C of less than 7 percent. Further, 62.4 percent of participants treated with the highest dose of tirzepatide achieved an A1C of less than 5.7 percent. The mean insulin glargine dose at 40 weeks was lower in all of the tirzepatide arms than in placebo and was 37.6 units per day (5 mg), 35.7 units per day (10 mg), 29.4 units per day (15 mg) and 58.8 units per day (placebo).

The most commonly reported adverse events in the tirzepatide arms were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, usually occurring during the dose escalation period and decreasing with continued dosing. For study participants treated with tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively), nausea (12.9 percent, 17.6 percent, 18.3 percent), diarrhea (12.1 percent, 12.6 percent, 20.8 percent), vomiting (6.9 percent, 7.6 percent, 12.5 percent) and constipation (6.0 percent, 6.7 percent, 6.7 percent) were more frequently experienced compared to placebo (2.5 percent [nausea], 10.0 percent [diarrhea], 2.5 percent [vomiting], 1.7 percent [constipation]). Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 6.0 percent (tirzepatide 5 mg), 8.4 percent (tirzepatide 10 mg) and 10.8 percent (tirzepatide 15 mg), compared to 2.5 percent (placebo).

The complete SURPASS-3 and SURPASS-5 data have not yet been evaluated but will be presented at the American Diabetes Association’s® 81st Scientific Sessions® and published in a peer-reviewed publication in 2021.

About Tirzepatide
Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. GIP is a hormone that may complement the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists. In preclinical models, GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions, and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase 3 development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes and for chronic weight management. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

About SURPASS-3, SURPASS-5 and the SURPASS Clinical Trial Program
SURPASS-3 (NCT03882970) is a 52-week, multi-center, randomized, open-label trial evaluating the efficacy of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg compared to titrated insulin degludec on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin with or without an SGLT-2 inhibitor. The trial randomized 1,444 participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg or titrated insulin degludec. The primary endpoint was to evaluate A1C reduction from baseline after 52 weeks for two doses (10 mg and 15 mg). Study participants had an A1C between 7 percent and 10.5 percent and a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. All participants in the tirzepatide treatment arms started the study at a dose of tirzepatide 2.5 mg once-weekly and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 5 mg (via a 2.5 mg step), 10 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg) or 15 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg and 12.5 mg). All participants in the titrated insulin degludec treatment arm started with a baseline dose of 10 units per day and followed a treat-to-target algorithm to reach a fasting blood glucose below 90 mg/dL.

SURPASS-5 (NCT04039503) is a 40-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to placebo in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes already being treated with insulin glargine, with or without metformin. The trial randomized 475 participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg or placebo in addition to insulin glargine with or without metformin. The primary endpoint was to evaluate A1C reduction from baseline after 40 weeks. Study participants had an A1C between 7.0 percent and 10.5 percent and a BMI greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2. Insulin glargine was titrated in all arms following a treat-to-target algorithm with the goal of fasting blood glucose below 100 mg/dL.

The SURPASS phase 3 global clinical development program for tirzepatide has enrolled more than 13,000 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, five of which are global registration studies. The program began in late 2018 with full results from the registration studies anticipated in 2021.

About Diabetes

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Basel, February 17, 2021 — Novartis today announced that it has entered into a grant agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. As part of the agreement, the foundation will provide funding support for the discovery and development of a single-administration, in vivo gene therapy to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). The project brings together Novartis drug discovery and gene therapy expertise with the Gates Foundation’s charitable objectives to expand access to healthcare in low-resource settings in an effort to address this potentially life-threatening genetic disease.

“Existing gene therapy approaches to sickle cell disease are difficult to deliver at scale and there are obstacles to reaching the vast majority of those affected by this debilitating disease,” said Jay Bradner, a hematologist and President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR). “This is a challenge that calls for collective action, and we are thrilled to have the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in addressing this global unmet medical need.”

SCD is a hereditary blood disease—one of the oldest known and most common genetic disorders. The disease affects millions around the world, with over 300,000 born with the condition annually1,2. It disproportionately affects those of African descent, and sub-Saharan Africa bears roughly 80 percent of the disease burden3. It also is common among people with ancestry from South America, Central America, and India, as well as several Mediterranean countries, such as Italy and Turkey.

SCD is a complex genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of hemoglobin, reduces the ability of red blood cells to transport oxygen efficiently and, early on, progresses to a chronic vascular disease1,4,5,6. The disease can lead to acute episodes of pain known as sickle cell pain crises, or vaso-occlusive crises, as well as life-threatening complications7,8,9. The resulting, frequent hospitalizations associated with sickle cell disease combined with an overall lack of specialized care places a significant burden on patients and their families, healthcare systems, and the overall economy. Even with today’s best available care, SCD continues to drive premature deaths and disability.

While the genetic cause of SCD has been known for decades, it’s only recently that the medical world has gained the tools to potentially fix the errant gene that causes the disease. Current clinical-stage gene-based therapies require extracting cells from a patient, altering those cells in a laboratory, and then reintroducing them to the patient through a complex procedure akin to a bone marrow transplant. The lab and manufacturing facilities and hospital infrastructure for such procedures often do not exist in the areas where SCD is most prevalent, excluding the vast majority of those with the disease from these life-changing gene therapies.

“Gene therapies might help end the threat of diseases like sickle cell, but only if we can make them far more affordable and practical for low-resource settings,” said Trevor Mundel, President of Global Health at the Gates Foundation. “What’s exciting about this project is that it brings ambitious science to bear on that challenge. It’s about treating the needs of people in lower-income countries as a driver of scientific and medical progress, not an afterthought. It also holds the promise of applying lessons learned to help develop potentially curative options for other debilitating diseases affecting low-income populations, such as HIV.”

Novartis envisions developing an accessible in vivo gene therapy for SCD that could potentially be administered once, directly to the patient, without the need to modify the cells in a lab. This would have the advantage of mitigating the need for long or repeated hospital stays or specialized lab infrastructure. To facilitate the research, the Gates Foundation has agreed to provide funding support for a research team within NIBR wholly dedicated to developing an approach to delivering this potential treatment. Novartis will provide in-kind support and access to its suite of technologies and resources.

In addition to research funding, the Gates Foundation lends its long history and experience in global health to this collaboration. As part of the early drug design strategy, Novartis will prioritize addressing access and distribution hurdles posed by limited healthcare infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries and the funding agreement includes specific provisions to support global access to any resulting innovations.

“Novartis is proud to lead this effort to find an accessible genetic therapy for sickle cell disease, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,” said Lutz Hegemann, Group Head of Corporate Affairs & Global Health for Novartis. “In keeping with our purpose, we firmly believe we can use science and innovation to reimagine the way SCD is treated for patients around the world.”

The agreement builds on the Novartis commitment to improve the lives of patients with sickle cell disease through the development of new treatments, including crizanlizumab, strategic partnerships with government and non-government organizations, and support for such interventions as newborn screenings and the distribution of existing drugs.

<p align=""justify"">LONDON and SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced they have signed a binding agreement to expand their existing collaboration to include the research and development of new therapies for influenza and other respiratory viruses.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The expanded collaboration, which builds on the agreement signed in 2020 to research and develop therapies for coronaviruses, provides GSK exclusive rights to collaborate with Vir on the development of potential best-in-class monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the prevention or treatment of influenza. These include VIR-2482, an intramuscularly administered investigational mAb designed as a universal prophylactic for influenza A that has completed a Phase 1 trial, as well as next-generation antibodies for the prevention or treatment of influenza during a three-year research period. GSK will have the exclusive option to co-develop VIR-2482 after Vir completes and reports Phase 2 trial outcomes, and will share development costs on the development of all other influenza mAbs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Influenza causes up to 500,000 hospitalizations and 34,000 deaths each year in the United States alone,<sup>1</sup> approximately 75% of which are caused by influenza A.<sup>2</sup> The protection provided by current vaccines varies from season to season, based on the virus strains circulating. People over 65 years of age with at least one comorbidity, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or who are immunocompromised, are at significantly increased risk of flu and flu-related hospitalization and mortality. This is also a population where the currently available vaccines have historically had lower efficacy.</p>
<p align=""justify"">As part of the new collaboration agreement, the companies will also engage in two additional research programs. The first is an expansion of their current functional genomics collaboration to develop potential pan-coronavirus therapeutics to now include other respiratory virus targets. Under the second program, the companies will collaborate to develop up to three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies identified using Vir’s antibody technology platform to target non-influenza pathogens during a three-year research period.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&amp;D, GSK, said</strong>: “We believe, now more than ever, that it is very important to develop new therapies to treat and ideally prevent infectious diseases. I am delighted that we are expanding our collaboration with Vir whose focus on novel antibodies, expertise in functional genomics, unique technology and talented scientists will further strengthen GSK’s position as a world leader in infectious diseases.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO, Vir Biotechnology, said</strong>: “GSK has been a valuable strategic partner and scientific collaborator in the fight against COVID-19. As part of our functional genomics collaboration directed at COVID-19, we have turned up multiple targets that have the potential to treat influenza and other respiratory viruses, and it makes sense to extend the scope of our collaboration to include these new targets. This expanded collaboration supports the rapid advancement of multiple promising investigational compounds in our pipeline, increasing the likelihood that these potential life-saving treatments will reach patients sooner, and will advance our shared goal of developing single drugs that can address multiple ‘bugs.’”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the agreement, GSK will make an upfront payment of $225 million and a further equity investment in Vir of $120 million. Initially, Vir will continue to fund the development of VIR-2482 through completion of Phase 2 trials, after which time, if GSK exercises its option to co-develop VIR-2482, it will pay an option fee of $300 million. Following option exercise for VIR-2482, and for each other program in the expanded collaboration, the companies will share the development costs and related profits associated with this agreement. GSK will also pay Vir up to $200 million based on the successful delivery of pre-defined regulatory milestones. The equity investment and collaboration agreement are conditional upon customary conditions including regulatory review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.</p>
<p align=""justify"">GSK and Vir entered into an initial strategic collaboration in April 2020 to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The focus of the collaboration to date has been the development of specific antibody candidates identified by Vir’s monoclonal antibody platform, VIR-7831 and VIR-7832, that have demonstrated the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells, and to provide a high barrier to resistance. VIR-7831 is currently in two global Phase 3 studies as monotherapy and one Phase 2 study as combination therapy, with initial results from the first of the Phase 3 studies expected in the first quarter of 2021. VIR-7832 has been accepted into the NHS-supported AGILE Phase 1b/2a study with a planned start in February 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Vir’s Antibody Platform</strong>
Vir has a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from, or have recovered from, infectious diseases. The platform is used to identify rare antibodies from survivors that have the potential to treat and prevent rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens via direct pathogen neutralization and immune system stimulation. Vir engineers the fully human antibodies that it discovers to enhance their therapeutic potential. This platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B virus, influenza A, Ebola (mAb114, approved for use in the U.S. as Ebanga<sup>TM</sup> and marketed by Ridgeback Therapeutics LP), malaria and others.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About VIR-2482</strong>
VIR-2482 is an investigational intramuscularly administered influenza A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody. In vitro, it has been shown to cover all major strains of influenza A that have arisen since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. VIR-2482 is designed as a universal prophylactic for influenza A. It has the potential to overcome the limitations of current flu vaccines and lead to meaningfully higher levels of protection due to its broad strain coverage and because it does not rely on an individual to create their own protective antibody response. VIR-2482 has been half-life engineered so that a single dose has the potential to last the entire flu season.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About VIR-7831 /</strong> <strong>GSK4182137</strong>
VIR-7831 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7831 also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About VIR-7832 / </strong><strong>GSK4182136</strong>
VIR-7832 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and an enhanced ability to clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7832 also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life. Importantly, VIR-7832 has also been engineered to potentially enhance virus-specific T cell function, which could help treat and/or prevent COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Vir and GSK Collaboration</strong>
In April 2020, Vir and GSK entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The collaboration uses Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies are leveraging GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They are also applying their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Vir Biotechnology</strong>
Vir Biotechnology is a clinical-stage immunology company focused on combining immunologic insights with cutting-edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases. Vir has assembled four technology platforms that are designed to stimulate and enhance the immune system by exploiting critical observations of natural immune processes.

<div class=""field field--name-field-press-release-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"">

BASEL, Switzerland and NEW YORK, February 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Myovant Sciences (NYSE: MYOV) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced publication in the<i> New England Journal of Medicine</i> of the Phase 3 LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies of investigational once-daily relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women with uterine fibroids. As previously reported, both studies achieved the primary endpoint of response rates in menstrual blood loss in addition to six of the seven key secondary endpoints, while maintaining bone mineral density comparable to placebo as part of a well-tolerated safety profile over 24 weeks.

“Women with uterine fibroids often suffer from symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding and pain, which can significantly impact their quality of life over many years,” said Ayman Al-Hendy, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Chicago, and lead author of the publication. “In the LIBERTY studies, relugolix combination therapy improved the most bothersome symptoms of uterine fibroids and had a well-tolerated safety profile including maintenance of bone mineral density comparable to placebo. The data published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> underscore the potential of relugolix combination therapy to provide an important new treatment option for this common disease.”<a id=""_Hlk48641687"" name=""_Hlk48641687""></a>

LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 each met the primary endpoint, with 73.4% and 71.2% of women in the relugolix combination therapy groups achieving the responder criteria compared with 18.9% and 14.7% of women in the placebo groups at Week 24, respectively (both p &lt; 0.001). A response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of treatment measured using the alkaline hematin method. On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy experienced an 84.3% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline in each study (both p &lt; 0.001 compared to placebo).

“We are pleased that the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> recognized the importance of our Phase 3 LIBERTY program and published the study results, which support the potential of once-daily relugolix combination therapy in women with uterine fibroids,” said Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc. “As we approach our FDA target action date of June 1, we look forward, if approved, to providing a one pill, once-a-day treatment for the millions of women with uterine fibroids who need and deserve new options.”

In LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2, six of seven key secondary endpoints measured at Week 24 achieved statistical significance, including mean reduction in menstrual blood loss, amenorrhea, reduction in pain in women with pain at baseline, improvement on the Bleeding and Pelvic Discomfort scale, reduction in uterine volume (all p &lt; 0.001 compared to placebo), and improvement in anemia in those women with anemia at baseline (both p &lt; 0.05 compared to placebo). In addition, among the approximately 50% of women with moderate-to-severe pain at baseline, a significantly greater proportion of women receiving relugolix combination therapy reported minimal-to-no pain (maximum score of 1 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale) during the last 35 days of treatment compared to placebo (43% vs. 10% and 47% vs. 17%, respectively; both p &lt; 0.001). A seventh key secondary endpoint for reduction in fibroid volume was not achieved in either study.

Data showed changes in bone mineral density were comparable between the relugolix combination and placebo groups at the end of treatment in LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2. The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination and placebo groups were also comparable (62% vs. 66% and 60% vs. 59%, respectively), including hot flashes (11% vs. 8% and 6% vs. 4%, respectively). There were no pregnancies reported in the relugolix combination groups in either study.

“The heavy bleeding and pain that women with uterine fibroids commonly experience can have a significant impact on their everyday lives,” said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine and Hospital, Global Product Development at Pfizer. “These data offer strong evidence that relugolix combination therapy, if approved, could be an important new oral treatment with the potential to help patients living with this debilitating condition.”

Data from LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2, in addition to the 28-week long-term extension study, were included in the New Drug Application (NDA) for relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids, with the FDA decision expected by the June 1, 2021 target action date. Myovant previously announced results from the LIBERTY long-term extension study in February 2020. At one year, 87.7% of women receiving relugolix combination therapy met the responder criteria. In addition, women experienced, on average, an 89.9% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline at one year. Changes in bone mineral density and the incidence of adverse events were consistent with those in LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2.

<b>About Uterine Fibroids</b>

Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in or on the muscular walls of the uterus and are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. In addition to an individual's genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth.

Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they can cause debilitating symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding (frequently resulting in anemia and fatigue), pain (including painful periods, abdominal pain, painful intercourse, backache), increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation, pregnancy loss, and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment.

An estimated five million women in the U.S. suffer from symptoms of uterine fibroids, and an estimated three million women are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BEIJING, China--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines worldwide, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for BRUKINSA<sup>®</sup> (zanubrutinib) for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (WM). The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is October 18, 2021.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“We are pleased that the FDA has accepted the sNDA for BRUKINSA in WM, a rare disease with significant morbidity. BTK inhibitors have transformed the treatment of WM in recent years, but discrepancies in response exist in patients with different subtypes, and toxicity can remain an issue,” said Jane Huang, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Hematology, at BeiGene. “We look forward to continuing our communications with the FDA in the coming months and hope that BRUKINSA will become a new treatment option for patients with WM in the United States.”

The sNDA package, which includes data from 351 patients with WM, was primarily based on safety and efficacy data from the global Phase 3 ASPEN trial of zanubrutinib compared to ibrutinib for the treatment of WM (NCT03053440), with supportive data from the pivotal Phase 2 trial of zanubrutinib in relapsed/refractory WM conducted in China (NCT03332173) and the global Phase 1/2 trial in patients with B-cell malignancies (NCT02343120). In addition, safety data from 779 patients in six clinical trials of BRUKINSA were included in the submission.

In addition to the United States, BRUKINSA is also under regulatory review as a treatment for patients with WM in the European Union, Canada, Australia, China, Taiwan, and South Korea.

In November 2019, BRUKINSA received accelerated approval in the United States as a treatment for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. In June 2020, BRUKINSA received conditional approval in China as a treatment for adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) /small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have received at least one prior therapy, and as a treatment for adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Currently, more than 20 marketing applications for BRUKINSA have been submitted, covering 45 countries and regions globally, including the United States, China, and European Union.

<b>About Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia</b>

Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare indolent B-cell lymphoma that occurs in less than two percent of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). There are about 5,000 new cases of WM diagnosed each year in the United States. The disease usually affects older adults and is primarily found in the bone marrow, although lymph nodes and the spleen may be involved.<sup>i</sup>

<b>About BRUKINSA<sup>® </sup>(zanubrutinib)</b>

BRUKINSA (zanubrutinib) is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), discovered by BeiGene scientists, that is currently being evaluated globally in a broad pivotal clinical program as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various B-cell malignancies.

BRUKINSA was approved in the United States in November 2019 to treat adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. A supplemental new drug application (sNDA) of BRUKINSA in patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) has been accepted for review by the FDA.

BRUKINSA received conditional approval in China in June 2020 for the treatment of MCL in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy and the treatment of CLL/SLL in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Complete approval for these indications may be contingent upon results from ongoing randomized, controlled confirmatory clinical trials. An sNDA of BRUKINSA in patients with relapsed/refractory WM has been accepted by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration and is currently under priority review.

A marketing authorization application (MAA) for BRUKINSA for the treatment of patients with WM who have received at least one prior therapy or as first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition, 20 marketing applications for BRUKINSA have been submitted in 16 countries and regions.

<b>IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION FOR BRUKINSA (ZANUBRUTINIB)</b>

<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>

<b>Hemorrhage</b>

Fatal and serious hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria and hemothorax have been reported in 2% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Bleeding events of any grade, including purpura and petechiae, occurred in 50% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy.

Bleeding events have occurred in patients with and without concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Co-administration of BRUKINSA with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may further increase the risk of hemorrhage.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Discontinue BRUKINSA if intracranial hemorrhage of any grade occurs. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding BRUKINSA for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.

<b>Infections</b>

Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 23% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. The most common Grade 3 or higher infection was pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have occurred.

Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and other infections according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.

<b>Cytopenias</b>

Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (27%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and anemia (8%) based on laboratory measurements, were reported in patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy.

Monitor complete blood counts during treatment and treat using growth factor or transfusions, as needed.

<b>Second Primary Malignancies</b>

Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinoma, have occurred in 9% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of skin), reported in 6% of patients. Advise patients to use sun protection.

<b>Cardiac Arrhythmias</b>

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have occurred in 2% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, and acute infections may be at increased risk. Grade 3 or higher events were reported in 0.6% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Monitor signs and symptoms for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on findings in animals, BRUKINSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including malformations at exposures that were 5 times higher than those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking BRUKINSA and for at least 1 week after the last dose. Advise men to avoid fathering a child during treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

The most common adverse reactions in &gt; 10% of patients who received BRUKINSA were neutrophil count decreased (53%), platelet count decreased (39%), upper respiratory tract infection (38%), white blood cell count decreased (30%), hemoglobin decreased (29%), rash (25%), bruising (23%), diarrhea (20%), cough (20%), musculoskeletal pain (19%), pneumonia (18%), urinary tract infection (13%), hematuria (12%), fatigue (11%), constipation (11%), and hemorrhage (10%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (11%) and hemorrhage (5%).

Of the 118 patients with MCL treated with BRUKINSA, 8 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the trials. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was pneumonia (3.4%). One (0.8%) patient experienced an adverse reaction leading to dose reduction (hepatitis B).

<b>Drug Interactions</b>

<b>CYP3A Inhibitors:</b> When BRUKINSA is co-administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg once daily. For co-administration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg twice daily.

<b>CYP3A Inducers:</b> Avoid co-administration with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers.

<b>Specific Populations</b>

<b>Hepatic Impairment: </b>The recommended dose of BRUKINSA for patients with severe hepatic impairment is 80 mg orally twice daily.

<b>INDICATION</b>

BRUKINSA is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Cabenuva (cabotegravir and rilpivirine, injectable formulation) as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace a current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. This is the first FDA-approved injectable, complete regimen for HIV-infected adults that is administered once a month.

The FDA also approved Vocabria (cabotegravir, tablet formulation), which should be taken in combination with oral rilpivirine (Edurant) for one month prior to starting treatment with Cabenuva to ensure the medications are well-tolerated before switching to the extended-release injectable formulation.

“Currently, the standard of care for patients with HIV includes patients taking daily pills to adequately manage their condition. This approval will allow some patients the option of receiving once-monthly injections in lieu of a daily oral treatment regimen,” said John Farley, M.D., M.P.H., director of the Office of Infectious Diseases in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Having this treatment available for some patients provides an alternative for managing this chronic condition.”

The safety and efficacy of Cabenuva were established through two randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials in 1,182 HIV-infected adults who were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/milliliter) before initiation of treatment with Cabenuva. Patients in both trials continued to show virologic suppression at the conclusion of each study, and no clinically relevant change from baseline in CD4+ cell counts was observed.

The most common adverse reactions with Cabenuva were injection site reactions, fever (pyrexia), fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, sleep disorders, dizziness and rash. Cabenuva should not be used if there is a known previous hypersensitivity reaction to cabotegravir or rilpivirine, or in patients who are not virally suppressed (HIV-1 RNA greater than 50 copies/milliliter).

Cabenuva and Vocabria were granted <a title=""Fast Track"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""d89bc5ad-618e-4474-88d3-bb2a5c28c2d7"">Fast Track</a> and <a title=""Priority Review"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/priority-review"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""473790c8-9758-497f-838f-5940f6b613a8"">Priority Review</a> designation by the FDA.

The FDA granted the approval of Cabenuva and Vocabria to ViiV Healthcare.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

(Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lilly-and-rigel-enter-strategic-collaboration-to-develop-ripk1-inhibitors-for-the-potential-treatment-of-immunological-and-neurodegenerative-diseases-301230502.html#financial-modal"" data-toggle=""modal"">RIGL</a>) today announced a global exclusive license agreement and strategic collaboration to co-develop and commercialize Rigel's R552, a receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) inhibitor, for all indications including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pursuant to the collaboration, Lilly will also lead all clinical development of brain penetrating RIPK1 inhibitors in central nervous system (CNS) diseases.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rigel's lead RIPK1 inhibitor, R552, has completed Phase 1 clinical trials and will begin Phase 2 clinical trials in 2021 as part of the collaboration.  Rigel also has ongoing pre-clinical activities with its lead CNS penetrant RIPK1 inhibitor candidates.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly will pay an upfront cash payment to Rigel of <span class=""xn-money"">$125 million</span>. Rigel may also be eligible to receive up to <span class=""xn-money"">$835 million</span> in potential development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digit to high-teens that will vary depending upon Rigel's clinical development investment. Lilly and Rigel will co-develop R552 at specified contribution levels. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization for R552, and Rigel will have the right to co-commercialize R552 in the U.S. Lilly will be solely responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of brain penetrating RIPK1 inhibitors in CNS indications.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">RIPK1 is a critical signaling protein implicated in a broad range of key inflammatory cellular processes including necroptosis, a type of regulated cell death, and cytokine production. In necroptosis, cells rupture leading to the dispersion of cell contents which can trigger an immune response and enhance inflammation. Inhibiting RIPK1 may be a new approach to treating various autoimmune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disorders. In pre-clinical studies, Rigel's R552 demonstrated prevention of joint and skin inflammation in a RIPK1-mediated murine model of inflammation and tissue damage.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""At Lilly, our immunology strategy is focused on the pursuit of novel targets that have the potential to develop into best-in-class medicines for patients with autoimmune conditions,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Ajay Nirula</span>, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology at Lilly. ""RIPK1 inhibitors are a promising approach, and R552 is an exciting addition to our immunology pipeline. We look forward to working with Rigel to advance its clinical development.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""We are very excited to form this strategic partnership with Lilly. This collaboration will provide significant resources and expertise to support a broad investigation in multiple disease indications with our RIPK1 inhibitors,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Raul Rodriguez</span>, Rigel's president and CEO. ""With Lilly's extensive knowledge in immune and CNS diseases, they are our ideal partner to ensure the clinical and commercial success of our RIPK1 inhibitor program.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. This transaction will be reflected in Lilly's reported results and financial guidance according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). There will be no change to Lilly's 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance as a result of this transaction.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tapinarof is a novel, once-daily therapeutic aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulating agent (TAMA), cosmetically elegant, steroid-free topical cream, being developed for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While the PSOARING 3 long-term safety study remains ongoing, a preplanned interim analysis was conducted once at least 100 subjects had received tapinarof cream, 1% for 52 weeks, and a further 300 subjects had received tapinarof cream, 1% for 26 weeks.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Data from this interim analysis will be included in the company’s prospective New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dermavant expects completion of the PSOARING 3 long-term safety study in 1H 2021, with an NDA submission in mid-2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Efficacy Data</strong></p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>In the PSOARING 3 interim analysis:
<ul>
 	<li>57.3% (298/520) of subjects who entered the study with a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score = 2 achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1, which indicates tapinarof’s increased therapeutic effect beyond the 12-week double blind treatment periods in PSOARING 1 and 2.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>39.2% (299/763) of subjects included in the interim analysis achieved complete disease clearance (PGA score = 0).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>No evidence of tachyphylaxis observed, suggesting treatment durability over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Integrated Analysis: In addition to the PSOARING 3 study results, an integrated analysis of efficacy was performed that included data from PSOARING 1, PSOARING 2 and the PSOARING 3 interim analysis:
<ul>
 	<li>A PGA response of 0 (clear) or almost clear (1), plus at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline, at any time point, was observed in 57% (518/915) of subjects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>PASI75, at any time point, was achieved by 63.5% (581/915) of subjects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>PASI90, at any time point, was achieved by 44.2% (404/915) of subjects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The achievement of a PGA score of 0 or 1 by 57.3% of patients following tapinarof treatment is impressive and will be important to patients and prescribers,” said Bruce Strober, MD, PhD, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Yale University School of Medicine and lead investigator for the PSOARING 3 study. “With nearly 40% of patients achieving complete disease clearance, tapinarof has the potential to be an important new topical treatment option for patients suffering from psoriasis.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Safety Data</strong></p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>Tapinarof cream, 1% was reported to be well-tolerated by both subjects and investigators. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events (AEs) at the time of the interim analysis was 5.8%, generally consistent with the PSOARING 1 (5.6%) and PSOARING 2 (5.8%) pivotal trials. No new safety signals were observed.</li>
 	<li>No increased risk of AEs was observed with longer use of tapinarof cream, 1%. The AE profile of tapinarof cream, 1% reported in the interim analysis of PSOARING 3 was consistent with the AE profile observed in the previous PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 trials, with the majority of AEs localized to site of application, and mild to moderate in nature. The most commonly reported AEs were folliculitis, contact dermatitis and upper respiratory tract infection.</li>
 	<li>As in the previous PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 trials, no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Remittive Effect (Maintenance of Clear/Almost Clear While Off-Therapy)</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the PSOARING 3 interim analysis, for subjects entering PSOARING 3 with a PGA score of 0 (n=78), the median time to disease worsening (defined as a PGA score of =2) following treatment discontinuation was approximately 115 days.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Having deep clinical experience with tapinarof across five studies, its potential remittive effect has always been very intriguing to me, and is a unique aspect of this new chemical entity,” said Robert Bissonnette, MD, FRCPC, Chief Executive Officer and Medical Director at Innovaderm Research. “This interim analysis indicates the potential remittive effects of tapinarof which, if approved, could facilitate disease management for long-suffering psoriasis patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“This interim analysis from PSOARING 3 provides additional support for tapinarof’s previous safety results, exhibited across multiple trials, adding a 52-week observation period to the previous maximum of 12 observed weeks. Importantly, these results appear to be consistent, and we observed no new safety signals in this interim analysis, and no worsening of the underlying safety profile for tapinarof observed in our PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 trials,” said Philip Brown, MD, JD, Chief Medical Officer of Dermavant.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Turning to efficacy,” Dr. Brown continued, “based on the data from our PSOARING 1 and 2 pivotal trials, we believed that further disease improvement was likely from continued use of tapinarof. Our hypothesis was that a potential durable response on-therapy and a remittive response off-therapy could provide patients with disease control. The interim analysis from PSOARING 3 provides evidence for that belief. The data we are sharing today suggest that continued use of tapinarof may result in an increased and durable effect up to 52 weeks. In addition, today’s interim analysis provides support for tapinarof’s ability to achieve a remittive effect – the time from when a patient achieves complete disease clearance (PGA score = 0) and ceases treatment, to when they next experience a psoriatic flare (PGA score = 2). The remittive effect was approximately four months in duration for patients who entered PSOARING 3 with a PGA score of 0. Consequently, we believe these data point to the potential use of tapinarof, if approved, as a novel, topical non-steroidal, to treat patients with mild, moderate, or severe psoriasis without restriction on skin application sites, and with possible increased treatment benefit for up to 52 weeks.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are excited to share the results from our interim analysis of PSOARING 3, which represent yet another milestone for Dermavant as we progress towards a mid-2021 NDA submission for tapinarof in adult patients with psoriasis,” said Todd Zavodnick, Chief Executive Officer of Dermavant. “We are now focused on compiling a comprehensive NDA submission highlighting the treatment effect, durability on-therapy, remittive effect off-therapy, safety, and tolerability of tapinarof. At the same time, we are furthering our commercial readiness in anticipation of tapinarof’s potential approval, and advancing the other assets in our development pipeline.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The data from this interim analysis will be submitted for presentation at upcoming medical congresses and to a peer-reviewed medical journal for publication.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About Dermavant’s Phase 3 Program for Tapinarof in Psoriasis</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dermavant’s pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for tapinarof in adult plaque psoriasis consists of PSOARING 1 (NCT03956355) and PSOARING 2 (NCT03983980), as well as PSOARING 3 (NCT04053387), the ongoing long-term safety study.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2, which collectively enrolled 1,025 patients, were two identically designed, multi-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, parallel group studies conducted in North America that evaluated the safety and efficacy of tapinarof cream, 1% dosed once daily (QD) for 12 weeks versus vehicle QD in adult patients aged 18-75 years diagnosed with plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of both studies was a PGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with a minimum 2-grade improvement from baseline at Week 12.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PSOARING 3 is a long-term, open-label, extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tapinarof cream, 1% for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. Subjects in the study had previously completed treatment with tapinarof or vehicle in either the PSOARING 1 or PSOARING 2 Phase 3 pivotal efficacy and safety studies. PSOARING 3 consists of up to 40 weeks of tapinarof cream, 1%, and a 4-week safety follow-up period. As such, subjects who received drug during PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 completed PSOARING 3, having received treatment with tapinarof cream for up to 52 weeks. Greater than 90% of eligible patients who completed PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 enrolled in PSOARING 3.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About Psoriasis</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by red patches and plaques with silvery scales on the skin. Psoriasis affects approximately 8 million people in the United States and 125 million worldwide.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-49959"" src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Press-Release.png"" alt="""" width=""969"" height=""519"" />Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Patient Specific Talus Spacer 3D-printed talus implant for humanitarian use. The Patient Specific Talus Spacer is the first in the world and first-of-its-kind implant to replace the talus—the bone in the ankle joint that connects the leg and the foot—for the treatment of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the ankle joint, a serious and progressive condition that causes the death of bone tissue stemming from a lack of blood supply to the area. The implant provides a joint-sparing alternative to other surgical interventions commonly used in late-stage AVN that may disable motion of the ankle joint.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>“Avascular necrosis of the ankle, while a rare condition, is a serious and potentially debilitating one that causes pain and can lead to inhibited motion of the ankle joint, and in some cases, removal of part of the leg,” said Capt. Raquel Peat, Ph.D., M.P.H., USPHS, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s Office of Orthopedic Devices. “Today’s action provides patients with a treatment option that could potentially reduce pain, retain range of motion of their joint and improve quality of life.”</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">AVN is often caused by a sudden injury—such as a broken bone or a dislocated joint—or sustained damage to the tissue that develops over time, and it occurs when there is a lack of blood supply to bone tissue, causing it to become necrotic, meaning it dies. When the bones of a joint are affected, such as in the case of the ankle, the cartilage that keeps the bones from rubbing together can deteriorate, causing arthritis and pain. Late-stage AVN of the ankle may result in the talus bone partially or fully collapsing. Current available treatments include fusing the joints in the foot and ankle together—a procedure which helps to alleviate pain caused by AVN but eliminates motion in the joint—or below-the-knee amputation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Patient Specific Talus Spacer is a 3D printed implant that can be used in talus replacement surgery. The talus spacer is made for each patient individually, modeled from computed tomography (CT) imaging, and is fitted to a patient’s specific anatomy. During the replacement surgery, the patient’s talus bone is removed and replaced with the implant, which is made from cobalt chromium alloy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While fusion may become necessary in the future should the condition worsen, talus replacement surgery with the Patient Specific Talus Spacer is intended to be a joint-sparing procedure, as it allows the patient to retain motion in the ankle joint.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA reviewed data for the Patient Specific Talus Spacer through the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) process. A <a title=""Humanitarian Device Exemption"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions/humanitarian-device-exemption"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""3c606d38-a8ac-4892-9f6f-22cd2aac3629"">Humanitarian Use Device</a> (HUD) is a device that is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Data supporting the safety and probable benefit of the Patient Specific Talus Spacer include results from 31 patients and 32 talus replacement surgeries (one patient had operations on both ankles) with the implant. At three years post-operation, the average reported pain decreased from “moderate to severe” prior to surgery to “mild” post-surgery, and average range of motion in the ankle joint also improved. These measures were assessed using standard subjective scoring systems for pain and functionality.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">By the three-year mark, out of 32 cases, there were three reported additional surgeries. The most common reported adverse events were pain and scar tissue at the surgery site.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA granted the HDE approval of the Patient Specific Talus Spacer to Additive Orthopaedics, LLC.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Urothelial Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Urothelial cancer is the most common type of bladder cancer (90 percent of cases) and can also be found in the renal pelvis (where urine collects inside the kidney), ureter (tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder) and urethra.<sup>[3]</sup> Globally, approximately 549,000 new cases of bladder cancer and 200,000 deaths are reported annually.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About PADCEV<sup>®</sup> (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>PADCEV was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2019</span> and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, and a platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery or in a locally advanced or metastatic setting. PADCEV was approved under the FDA's Accelerated Approval Program based on tumor response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.[5]</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PADCEV is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.<sup>5,[6] </sup>Nonclinical data suggest the anticancer activity of PADCEV is due to its binding to Nectin-4 expressing cells followed by the internalization and release of the anti-tumor agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) into the cell, which result in the cell not reproducing (cell cycle arrest) and in programmed cell death (apoptosis).<sup>5</sup> PADCEV is co-developed by Astellas and Seagen.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>PADCEV Important Safety Information</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Warnings and Precautions</b></p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li><b>Hyperglycemia </b>occurred in patients treated with PADCEV, including death and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), in those with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus. The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. In one clinical trial, 8% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C =8% were excluded. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (&gt;250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV.</li>
 	<li><b>Peripheral neuropathy (PN),</b> predominantly sensory, occurred in 49% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials; 2% experienced Grade 3 reactions. In one clinical trial, peripheral neuropathy occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without preexisting peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of Grade =2 was 3.8 months (range: 0.6 to 9.2). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients. At the time of their last evaluation, 19% had complete resolution, and 26% had partial improvement. Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when peripheral neuropathy occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade =3 peripheral neuropathy.</li>
 	<li><b>Ocular disorders</b> occurred in 46% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included keratitis, blurred vision, limbal stem cell deficiency and other events associated with dry eyes. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 36% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 14% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.9 months (range: 0.3 to 6.2). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders.</li>
 	<li><b>Skin reactions</b> occurred in 54% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials. Twenty-six percent (26%) of patients had maculopapular rash and 30% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 10% of patients and included symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), bullous dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. In one clinical trial, the median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.8 months (range: 0.2 to 5.3). Of the patients who experienced rash, 65% had complete resolution and 22% had partial improvement. Monitor patients for skin reactions. Consider appropriate treatment, such as topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for skin reactions, as clinically indicated. For severe (Grade 3) skin reactions, withhold PADCEV until improvement or resolution and administer appropriate medical treatment. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.</li>
 	<li><b>Infusion site extravasation</b> Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 310 patients, 1.3% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. One percent (1%) of patients developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions.</li>
 	<li><b>Embryo-fetal toxicity</b> PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during PADCEV treatment and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Adverse Reactions<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients treated with PADCEV. The most common serious adverse reactions (=3%) were urinary tract infection (6%), cellulitis (5%), febrile neutropenia (4%), diarrhea (4%), sepsis (3%), acute kidney injury (3%), dyspnea (3%), and rash (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, including acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac disorder, and sepsis (each 0.8%).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 16% of patients; the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 64% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were peripheral neuropathy (18%), rash (9%) and fatigue (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 34% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction were peripheral neuropathy (12%), rash (6%) and fatigue (4%).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The most common adverse reactions (=20%) were fatigue (56%), peripheral neuropathy (56%), decreased appetite (52%), rash (52%), alopecia (50%), nausea (45%), dysgeusia (42%), diarrhea (42%), dry eye (40%), pruritus (26%) and dry skin (26%). The most common Grade =3 adverse reactions (=5%) were rash (13%), diarrhea (6%) and fatigue (6%).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Lab Abnormalities<br class=""dnr"" /></b>In one clinical trial, Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities reported in =5% were: lymphocytes decreased (10%), hemoglobin decreased (10%), phosphate decreased (10%), lipase increased (9%), sodium decreased (8%), glucose increased (8%), urate increased (7%), neutrophils decreased (5%).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Drug Interactions</b></p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li><b>Effects of other drugs</b> <b>on PADCEV</b> Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase free MMAE exposure, which may increase the incidence or severity of PADCEV toxicities. Closely monitor patients for signs of toxicity when PADCEV is given concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Specific Populations</b></p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li><b>Lactation</b> Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.</li>
 	<li><b>Hepatic impairment</b> Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Important Safety Information About Movantik</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Movantik<sup>®</sup> (naloxegol) is contraindicated in:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>Patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and patients at risk of recurrent obstruction, due to the potential for GI perforation.</li>
 	<li>Patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, clarithromycin, ketoconazole) because these medications can significantly increase exposure to naloxegol which may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms.</li>
 	<li>Patients with a known serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to Movantik or any of its excipients.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including hyperhidrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, irritability, and yawning, occurred in patients treated with Movantik. Patients receiving methadone as therapy for their pain condition were observed in the clinical trials to have a higher frequency of GI adverse reactions that may have been related to opioid withdrawal than patients receiving other opioids. Patients with disruptions to the blood-brain barrier may be at increased risk for opioid withdrawal or reduced analgesia. These patient (eg, multiple sclerosis, recent brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and uncontrolled epilepsy) were not enrolled in the clinical studies. Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using Movantik in such patients. Monitor for symptoms of opioid withdrawal when using Movantik in such patients.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Severe abdominal pain and/or diarrhea have been reported, generally within a few days of initiation of Movantik. Monitor and discontinue if severe symptoms occur. Consider restarting Movantik at 12.5 mg once daily.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cases of GI perforation have been reported with the use of peripherally acting opioid antagonists, including Movantik. Post marketing cases of GI perforation, including fatal cases, were reported when Movantik was used in patients at risk of GI perforation (eg, infiltrative gastrointestinal tract malignancy, recent gastrointestinal tract surgery, diverticular disease including diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, or concomitantly treated with bevacizumab). Monitor for severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue if this symptom develops.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The most common adverse reactions with Movantik as compared to placebo in clinical trials were: Abdominal pain (21% vs 7%), diarrhea (9% vs 5%), nausea (8% vs 5%), flatulence (6% vs 3%), vomiting (5% vs 4%), headache (4% vs 3%), and hyperhidrosis (3% vs &lt;1%).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Movantik<sup>®</sup> (naloxegol) is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent (e.g. weekly) opioid dosage escalation.</p>

TOKYO, February 19, 2021 -- Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced today that it concluded a license agreement with Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) for the development and marketing in Japan for AT-527, a new oral drug candidate for COVID-19.

AT-527 was created by Atea Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: AVIR) in the U.S. as a direct-acting antiviral drug to inhibit viral RNA polymerase, an enzyme that is essential for the replication of RNA viruses. It is being investigated as a potential oral treatment for COVID-19. Roche and Atea have partnered to jointly develop AT-527. If approved, Atea will distribute AT-527 in the United States and Roche will be responsible for global manufacturing and distribution outside the United States. Under the license agreement between Roche and Chugai, Chugai obtained exclusive development and marketing rights in Japan for AT-527.

Globally, phase II clinical studies are currently ongoing in patients with moderate COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are not hospitalized. A phase III clinical study is expected to start in the first half of 2021 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AT-527 for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 outside of the hospital settings.

“The COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of slowing with the spread of COVID-19 variants, and new therapeutic options are still required. We have a strong sense of mission to develop AT-527 in collaborative efforts with Roche and Atea, to contribute to a wide range of patient care from mild to moderate,” said Chugai’s President and COO, Dr. Osamu Okuda. “We are committed to make efforts for regulatory application in Japan to deliver AT-527 as a convenient oral antiviral drug to patients as soon as possible.”

<p align=""justify"">OXFORDSHIRE, England and CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. and ROCKVILLE, Md., Feb. 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immunocore (Nasdaq: IMCR), a late-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a novel class of T cell receptor (TCR) bispecific immunotherapies designed to treat a broad range of diseases, including cancer, infectious and autoimmune disease, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to tebentafusp (IMCgp100) for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM).</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Bahija Jallal, Chief Executive Officer of Immunocore, said:</strong> <em>“We are delighted that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tebentafusp based on the survival benefit from our Phase 3 clinical trial announced in November 2020. </em><em>There is an urgent need for an approved treatment for this rare and aggressive form of melanoma and we look forward to continuing to work with regulators to bring tebentafusp to patients as quickly as possible.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">In an initial pre-planned interim analysis of a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial (IMCgp100-202) in previously untreated metastatic uveal melanoma, a cancer that has historically proven to be insensitive to other immunotherapies, tebentafusp demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) benefit as a monotherapy. The primary endpoint was achieved when the OS Hazard Ratio (HR) in the intent-to-treat population favored tebentafusp, HR=0.51 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.71); p&lt; 0.0001, over investigator’s choice (82% pembrolizumab; 12% ipilimumab; 6% dacarbazine).</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Tebentafusp has also been granted Fast Track Designation and orphan drug designation from the FDA for uveal melanoma and Promising Innovative Medicine designation under the UK Early Access to Medicines Scheme. Immunocore will be working with the FDA to facilitate submission of a BLA for tebentafusp. If approved, Immunocore believes tebentafusp would be the first new therapy for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma in 40 years.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Immunocore</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Immunocore is a late-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a novel class of TCR bispecific immunotherapies called ImmTAX – Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against X disease – designed to treat a broad range of diseases, including cancer, infectious and autoimmune. Leveraging its proprietary, flexible, off-the-shelf ImmTAX platform, Immunocore is developing a deep pipeline in multiple therapeutic areas, including five clinical stage programs in oncology and infectious disease, advanced pre-clinical programs in autoimmune disease and multiple earlier pre-clinical programs. Immunocore’s most advanced oncology therapeutic candidate, tebentafusp, has demonstrated an overall survival benefit in a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial in metastatic uveal melanoma, a cancer that has historically proven to be insensitive to other immunotherapies.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About ImmTAC<sup>®</sup> Molecules</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Immunocore’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) technology generates a novel class of bispecific biologics called ImmTAC (Immune mobilising monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) molecules that are designed to redirect the immune system to recognise and kill cancerous cells. ImmTAC molecules are soluble TCRs engineered to recognise intracellular cancer antigens with ultra-high affinity and selectively kill these cancer cells via an anti-CD3 immune-activating effector function. Based on the demonstrated mechanism of T cell infiltration into human tumours, the ImmTAC mechanism of action holds the potential to treat hematologic and solid tumours, regardless of mutational burden or immune infiltration, including immune “cold” low mutation rate tumours.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Tebentafusp</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Tebentafusp is a novel bispecific protein comprised of a soluble T cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 immune-effector function. Tebentafusp specifically targets gp100, a lineage antigen expressed in melanocytes and melanoma, and is the first molecule developed using Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology platform designed to redirect and activate T cells to recognise and kill tumour cells. Tebentafusp has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track designation and orphan drug designation by the FDA in the United States and Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation under the UK Early Access to Medicines Scheme for metastatic uveal melanoma.

<p align=""justify""><strong>About Uveal Melanoma</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Uveal melanoma is a rare and aggressive form of melanoma, which affects the eye. Metastatic uveal melanoma typically has a poor prognosis and has no currently accepted optimal management or treatment. Although it is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, the diagnosis is rare, with approximately 8,000 new patients diagnosed globally each year (1,600-2,000 cases per year in the United States). Up to 50% of people with uveal melanoma will eventually develop metastatic disease. When the cancer spreads beyond the eye, only approximately half of patients will survive for one year.</p>

<strong>TOKYO, February 19, 2021</strong> – Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) today announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 pivotal SKYLIGHT 1™ and SKYLIGHT 2™ clinical trials for fezolinetant, an investigational oral, nonhormonal compound being studied for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) – i.e., hot flashes associated with menopause.

Both trials met all four co-primary endpoints showing statistically significant reduction from baseline in the frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS to week 4 and week 12 for women who received fezolinetant 30 and 45 mg once-daily (QD) versus placebo. Serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurred in less than 2 percent of patients and the most common TEAE was headache. SKYLIGHT 1 and SKYLIGHT 2 are ongoing studies, with patients completing a treatment duration for 52 weeks. Detailed results will be submitted for publication and for consideration at upcoming medical meetings following the 52-week analyses.

“We are encouraged by these results for fezolinetant, which mark the first Phase 3 data in a new category of selective neurokinin-3 (NK3)-targeted treatments for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms,” said Salim Mujais, M.D., Senior Vice President and Therapeutic Area Head, Medical Specialties, Astellas. “Vasomotor symptoms can add a significant burden and impact quality of life for women. We are hopeful that with fezolinetant, we will be able to deliver a novel nonhormonal treatment option.”

VMS are the most common symptoms associated with menopause, affecting more than 50 percent of women 40 to 64 years of age.<sup>1,2</sup> VMS can have a considerable effect on a woman's comfort and sleep which can lead to fatigue, mood changes, and effect work and relationships.<sup>1,3</sup>

Fezolinetant is an investigational, selective neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R) antagonist that blocks neurokinin B (NKB) binding on the kisspeptin/neurokinin/dynorphin (KNDy) neuron to moderate neuronal activity in the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus of the brain to treat VMS associated with menopause. If approved by regulatory authorities, fezolinetant would be a first-in-class, nonhormonal treatment option to reduce the frequency and severity of VMS associated with menopause.

SKYLIGHT 1 and SKYLIGHT 2 are double-blinded and placebo-controlled studies evaluating 30 and 45 mg fezolinetant administered once-daily for the first 12 weeks followed by 40-week active treatment extension periods.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the New Drug Application (NDA) for ruxolitinib cream, a selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor designed for topical application, as a treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD), a type of eczema.

“Incyte’s deep understanding of the pathways involved in immune-mediated skin conditions led us to investigate the potential for ruxolitinib cream to address key factors associated with atopic dermatitis, that is, inflammation of the skin and itch,” said Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation &amp; Autoimmunity, Incyte. “We are grateful to the people living with atopic dermatitis whose participation in our clinical trials helped generate the evidence to support this regulatory submission, and we look forward to working with the FDA as we seek to bring forward a new topical treatment for people living with this chronic skin disease.”

The NDA is supported by data from the Phase 3 TRuE-AD clinical trial program, which included more than 1,200 people, age 12 years and older. Primary efficacy and safety results from both TRuE-AD trials were presented at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Virtual Symposium in April 2020. Additional safety and efficacy data from the 44-week, open-label, long-term extension of both TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2 were included in the NDA.

Incyte submitted a priority review voucher (PRV) along with the NDA application for ruxolitinib cream. The use of the PRV shortens the review period by four months. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is June 21, 2021.

<b>About Atopic Dermatitis
</b>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease, affecting more than 21 million people in the United States and is characterized by inflammation and intense itch. Signs and symptoms of AD include irritated and itchy skin that can cause red lesions that may ooze and crust. Patients with AD are also more susceptible to bacterial, viral and fungal infections.

<b>About TRuE-AD
</b>The TRuE-AD clinical trial program consists of two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies, TRuE-AD1 (NCT03745638) and TRuE-AD2 (NCT03745651), evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream compared to vehicle (non-medicated cream) in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Both studies enrolled more than 600 patients (age =12 years) diagnosed with AD for at least two years and who were candidates for topical therapy.

Patients with an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 2 to 3, and with AD on 3% to 20% of their Body Surface Area (excluding scalp) were randomized 2:2:1 into one of three arms for eight weeks: ruxolitinib cream 0.75% applied twice daily (BID); ruxolitinib cream 1.5% applied BID; and vehicle. Participants who successfully completed an assessment at Week 8 were offered participation in the 44-week long-term safety treatment extension period with ruxolitinib cream 0.75% or 1.5% applied BID.

The primary endpoint of the TRuE-AD studies was the proportion of participants achieving an Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS), defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline at Week 8. Key secondary endpoints include: the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) score, the proportion of participants with at least a 4-point improvement in the itch Numerical Rating Scale, and the proportion of participants with at least a 6-point improvement in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Form – Sleep Disturbance (8b) 24-hour recall score. Additional secondary endpoints include mean percentage change from baseline in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score. The studies have also been tracking the frequency, duration and severity of adverse events associated with the use of ruxolitinib cream.

<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca today announced the voluntary withdrawal of the <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) indication in the US for previously treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. This decision was made in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

In May 2017, <i>Imfinzi</i> was granted accelerated approval in the US based on promising tumour response rates and duration of response data from Study 1108, a Phase I/II trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of <i>Imfinzi</i> in advanced solid tumours, including previously treated bladder cancer. Continued approval was contingent on results from the DANUBE Phase III trial in the 1st-line metastatic bladder cancer setting, which did not meet its primary endpoints in 2020. The withdrawal is aligned with FDA guidance for evaluating indications with accelerated approvals that did not meet post-marketing requirements, as part of a broader industry-wide evaluation. This withdrawal does not impact the indication outside the US and does not impact other approved <i>Imfinzi</i> indications within or outside the US.

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “The science of immunotherapy has moved swiftly over the past few years, bringing new options to patients at an unprecedented pace. While the withdrawal in previously treated metastatic bladder cancer is disappointing, we respect the principles FDA set out when the accelerated approval pathway was founded and remain committed to bringing new and innovative options to patients. In the last three years, <i>Imfinzi</i> has become an important standard of care in multiple lung cancer settings, an area of considerable focus for AstraZeneca.”

Healthcare providers are being notified of this update. Patients with metastatic bladder cancer currently being treated with <i>Imfinzi </i>should consult with their healthcare provider regarding their ongoing care.

<b><i>Imfinzi
</i></b><i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.

<i>Imfinzi </i>is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the PACIFIC Phase III trial. <i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved in the EU, US, Japan and many other countries around the world for the treatment of extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) based on the CASPIAN Phase III trial. <i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in several countries.

As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is being tested as a monotherapy and in combinations including with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, oesophageal cancer, gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and other solid tumours.

In bladder cancer, the Company has several Phase III trials testing <i>Imfinzi</i> in various treatment combinations across early- and late-stage settings including the NILE Phase III trial in metastatic disease, the NIAGARA Phase III trial in muscle invasive disease and the POTOMAC Phase III trial in non-muscle invasive disease.

<b>AstraZeneca in immunotherapy
</b>Immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored in immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca is invested in using IO approaches that deliver long-term survival for new groups of patients across tumour types.

The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small, targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.

<b>AstraZeneca in oncology
</b>AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of<b> </b>new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With seven new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline<b> </b>of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers.

By harnessing the power of six scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response, Antibody Drug Conjugates, Epigenetics, and Cell Therapies – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

<b>AstraZeneca
</b>AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas - Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal &amp; Metabolism, and Respiratory &amp; Immunology. Based in Cambridge, UK, AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide.

</ul>
<p align=""justify""><strong>PARIS and LONDON – February 22, 2021 </strong>– Sanofi and GSK announced today the initiation of a new Phase 2 study with 720 volunteers aged 18 and over to select the most appropriate antigen dosage for Phase 3 evaluation of their adjuvanted recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine candidate.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“Over the past few weeks, our teams have worked to refine the antigen formulation of our recombinant-protein vaccine, based on learnings from our initial Phase 1/2 study.” </em>said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Pasteur.<em> “We are confident that our vaccine candidate has strong potential and we are very encouraged by the latest preclinical data. This new Phase 2 study will enable us to identify the final vaccine formulation for adults of all ages. We have demonstrated our commitment to focusing efforts and capabilities towards the global fight against the pandemic, and this new study takes us a step closer to achieving our primary goal of developing a COVID-19 vaccine with a good efficacy and safety profile.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added:<em> “We are pleased to be starting this new Phase 2 study. The world needs multiple vaccines and we are confident that combining our proven pandemic adjuvant system with this improved antigen formulation will have significant potential as the pandemic evolves. We look forward to further progressing this vaccine candidate to Phase 3 in Q2 2021, if this Phase 2 study is successful.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">In parallel to the new Phase 2 study and recognizing the global emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and their potential impact on vaccine efficacy, Sanofi has commenced development work against new variants, which will be used to inform next stages of the Sanofi/GSK development program.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Phase 2 study</strong>
The new Phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center dose finding study conducted in adults aged 18 years of age and older to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two injections given 21 days apart. The trial will include equal numbers of adults 18 to 59 years and those 60 years and above.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Three different antigen doses with a fixed dose of adjuvant will be tested in a total study population of 720 volunteers, in the United States, Honduras and Panama. Results of the Phase 2 trial will inform the Phase 3 protocol.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In December 2020, Phase 1/2 study results <a title="""" href=""https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-12-11-07-00-00"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>showed</u></a> an immune response comparable to patients who had recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a lower immune response in older adults, likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen. If data from the new Phase 2 trial are positive, a global Phase 3 study is planned for Q2 2021. Positive results from the Phase 3 study would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021, with the vaccine expected to be available in Q4 2021, if approved.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The advancement of the trial program is supported by the United States’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response under contract W15QKN-16-9-1002. Sanofi and GSK’s adjuvanted recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate was <a title="""" href=""https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-07-31-13-00-00"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>selected</u></a> in July 2020 by the U.S. government in order to accelerate its development and manufacturing.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the GSK / Sanofi partnership</strong>
In the partnership between the two Companies, Sanofi provides its recombinant antigen and GSK contributes its pandemic adjuvant, both established vaccine platforms that have proven successful against influenza. The recombinant technology combined with GSK’s adjuvant offers the advantages of stability at temperatures used for routine vaccines, the ability to generate high and sustained immune responses, and the potential to prevent virus transmission.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>On the front line in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>
In addition to the recombinant protein-based vaccine in collaboration with GSK, Sanofi is developing a messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with Translate Bio. Encouraging preclinical data showed that two immunizations of the mRNA vaccine induced high neutralizing antibody levels that are comparable to the upper range of those observed in infected humans. Sanofi and Translate Bio are planning to start a phase 1/2 study in Q1 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sanofi earlier announced an agreement with Pfizer-BioNTech under which Sanofi will support the manufacturing and supply of more than 125 million doses their COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-49959"" src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Press-Release.png"" alt="""" width=""969"" height=""519"" />PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – February 22, 2021 </strong>- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score =50%), as determined by an FDA-approved test. Patients must either have metastatic or locally advanced tumors that are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, and the tumors must not have EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><em>“The approval of Libtayo to treat first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer with high PD-L1 expression means physicians and patients have a potent new treatment option against this deadly disease,” </em>said Naiyer Rizvi, M.D., Price Family Professor of Medicine, Director of Thoracic Oncology and Co-director of Cancer Immunotherapy at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, as well as a steering committee member of the trial. <em>“Notably, Libtayo was approved based on a pivotal trial where most chemotherapy patients crossed over to Libtayo following disease progression, and that allowed for frequently underrepresented patients who had pretreated and clinically stable brain metastases, or who had locally advanced disease and were not candidates for definitive chemoradiation. This gives doctors important new data when considering Libtayo for the varied patients and situations they treat in daily clinical practice.”</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is the third approval for Libtayo and follows a Priority Review by the FDA, which is reserved for medicines that represent significant improvements in safety or efficacy in treating serious conditions. Earlier this month, Libtayo was <a title="""" href=""https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2021/2021-02-09-23-15-00"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>approved</u></a> as the first immunotherapy indicated for patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI) or for whom an HHI is not appropriate, with full approval granted for locally advanced disease and accelerated approval granted for metastatic disease. In 2018, Libtayo was the first systemic treatment <a title="""" href=""https://www.sanofigenzyme.com/en/about-us/newsroom/2018/2018-09-28-04-48-00"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>approved</u></a> for adults with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that is locally advanced or metastatic and who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue during or after treatment with Libtayo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>“Libtayo has demonstrated an impressive level of efficacy in advanced NSCLC with at least 50% PD-L1expression in its pivotal trial,” </em>said Ahmet Sezer, M.D., Professor in the Department of Medical Oncology at Baskent University in Adana, Turkey and a trial investigator.<em> “As published in The Lancet, a prespecified analysis in the subset of patients proven to have PD-L1 expression of at least 50%, Libtayo reduced the risk of death by 43% compared to chemotherapy. This was achieved with a greater than 70% crossover rate to Libtayo following disease progression on chemotherapy, as well as the largest population of patients with pretreated and clinically stable brain metastases among advanced NSCLC pivotal trials to date.”</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The data supporting the Libtayo approval are based on an analysis of 710 patients who were randomized to receive treatment in a Phase 3 trial; eligible patients were intended to have PD-L1 expression of =50%. In this patient population, Libtayo reduced the risk of death by 32% compared to chemotherapy, with additional efficacy results as follows:</p>

<em>a Based on Kaplan-Meier method</em>
<em>b Based on stratified proportional hazards model</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Safety was assessed in 355 patients in the Libtayo group (median duration of exposure: 27 weeks; range: 9 days to 115 weeks) and 342 patients in the chemotherapy group (median duration of exposure: 18 weeks; range: 18 days to 87 weeks). Adverse reactions that occurred more commonly in the Libtayo group and in at least 10% of patients were rash (15% Libtayo, 6% chemotherapy) and cough (11% Libtayo, 8% chemotherapy). The most frequent serious adverse reactions in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia (5% Libtayo, 6% chemotherapy) and pneumonitis (2% Libtayo, 0% chemotherapy). Treatment was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 6% of Libtayo patients; adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in at least 2 patients were pneumonitis, pneumonia, ischemic stroke and increased aspartate aminotransferase. No new Libtayo safety signals were observed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><em>“With this third approval for Libtayo, we are proud to deliver on our ambition to bring our PD-1 inhibitor to patients in need with difficult-to-treat cancers, such as advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"" </em>said Peter C. Adamson, M.D., Global Development Head, Oncology and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi.<em> ""As the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, the need for additional therapeutic options in advanced NSCLC is clear. Libtayo allows physicians to further optimize treatment of these patients whose tumors have high expression of PD-L1. We thank all of the trial investigators, patients and their caregivers who helped make this milestone possible.”</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020, an estimated 2.2 million and 225,000 new cases were diagnosed worldwide and in the U.S, respectively. Approximately 84% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, with 75% of these cases diagnosed in advanced stages and an estimated 25% to 30% of cases expected to test positive for PD-L1 in =50% of tumor cells.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><em>“</em><em>We developed Libtayo to deliver clinically meaningful benefits to patients suffering from a diverse range of cancers and to establish a foundation for potential future immunotherapy combinations. Today’s approval continues to support this vision</em><em>,” </em>said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron<em>. </em><em>“Libtayo has already changed the treatment paradigm for certain patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and is poised to do the same for advanced basal cell carcinoma. </em><em>Now, Libtayo has the opportunity to make a meaningful difference for the many U.S. patients battling advanced non-small cell lung cancer. </em><em>Libtayo is being investigated in a variety of settings, and we hope to share updates later this year on our pivotal trials in cervical cancer and in combination with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.”</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About the Phase 3 Trial Supporting Approval</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The open-label, randomized, multi-center Phase 3 trial, called EMPOWER-Lung 1, was designed to investigate the first-line treatment of Libtayo monotherapy compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC who tested positive for PD-L1 in =50% of tumor cells and without EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations. PD-L1 expression was confirmed using the Agilent Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. The primary endpoints were OS and PFS, and secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of response and quality of life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The trial randomized 710 patients with either previously untreated metastatic NSCLC (Stage IV) or locally advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIB/C) who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation or who had progressed after treatment with definitive chemoradiation. Enrolled patients included those with disease characteristics frequently underrepresented in pivotal advanced NSCLC trials. Among them, 12% had pre-treated and clinically stable brain metastases and 16% had locally advanced NSCLC that was not a candidate for definitive chemoradiation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Importantly, patients whose disease progressed in the trial were able to change their therapy: those assigned to chemotherapy were allowed to crossover to Libtayo treatment following disease progression, while those assigned to Libtayo monotherapy were allowed to combine Libtayo treatment with 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy following disease progression. There was a &gt;70% crossover rate to Libtayo following disease progression on chemotherapy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About Libtayo</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Libtayo is a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Across all of its approved indications, the recommended dose of Libtayo is 350 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Libtayo is available as a single-dose 350 mg vial.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the FDA.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 22, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that upadacitinib (45 mg, once daily) met the primary endpoint of clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo Score) and all ranked secondary endpoints in the Phase 3 induction study, U-ACCOMPLISH.<sup>1</sup> In the study, 33 percent of patients receiving upadacitinib achieved clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo Score) at week 8 compared to 4 percent of patients receiving placebo (p&lt;0.001).<sup>1</sup> U-ACCOMPLISH is the second of two Phase 3 induction studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>

""We remain steadfast in our pursuit of transforming the treatment landscape for people living with ulcerative colitis,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Tom Hudson</span>, senior vice president of research and development, AbbVie. ""These positive results confirm the findings of the previous induction study and underscore the potential impact upadacitinib could have on patients struggling to manage their disease.""

In this study, all ranked secondary endpoints were met, including clinical, endoscopic and histologic outcomes.<sup class=""first-child"">1</sup> A greater proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib achieved clinical response compared to placebo, with 74 percent of upadacitinib-treated patients experiencing clinical response (per Adapted Mayo Score) at week 8 versus 25 percent of patients receiving placebo (p&lt;0.001).<sup>1</sup> Additionally, 63 percent of patients treated with upadacitinib achieved clinical response (per partial Adapted Mayo Score) at week 2 versus 26 percent of those receiving placebo (p&lt;0.001).<sup>1</sup> At week 8, 44 percent of patients treated with upadacitinib achieved endoscopic improvement versus 8 percent of patients receiving placebo (p&lt;0.001).<sup>1</sup> And significantly more upadacitinib-treated patients achieved histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement at week 8 compared to patients receiving placebo (37 percent versus 6 percent; p&lt;0.001).<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>

""People living with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis continue to suffer from the significant burden of this disease,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child"">Silvio Danese</span>, M.D., lead study investigator and head of the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Centre at Humanitas Research Hospital, <span class=""xn-location last-child"">Milan, Italy</span>.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease caused by inflammation of the large intestine, which triggers abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, severe urgency for a bowel movement, weight loss and fatigue.<sup class=""first-child"">15-17</sup> The severity of symptoms and uncertainty surrounding flares cause a substantial burden and often disability among those living with the disease.<sup class=""last-child"">18</sup>

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About the U-ACCOMPLISH Study<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1,9</sup></b>

U-ACCOMPLISH is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 45 mg once daily for induction therapy compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. U-ACCOMPLISH is the second of two Phase 3 induction studies.

The primary endpoint is achievement of clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo Score) at week 8. Ranked secondary endpoints included clinical response (decrease from baseline in the Adapted Mayo score =2 points and =30 percent from baseline, plus a decrease in RBS =1 or an absolute RBS =1), endoscopic improvement (endoscopic subscore =1) and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement (endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 and Geboes score =3.1) at week 8.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About Upadacitinib (RINVOQ)</b>

Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is an oral, once daily, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.<sup class=""first-child"">1,7-14</sup> It was engineered to have greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 versus JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2.<sup>3</sup> In <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2019</span>, RINVOQ received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. RINVOQ is also approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more DMARDs and active ankylosing spondylitis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. The approved dose for RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, atopic dermatitis and giant cell arteritis are ongoing.<sup class=""last-child"">8-14</sup> Use of RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis is not approved and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by regulatory authorities.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Important Safety Information about RINVOQ (upadacitinib)<sup class=""first-child last-child"">21</sup></b>

<b class=""first-child"">RINVOQ U.S. Use and Important Safety Information</b><br class=""last-child"" />RINVOQ is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate did not work well or could not be tolerated. It is not known if RINVOQ is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.

<b class=""first-child"">What is the most important information I should know about RINVOQ?</b><br class=""last-child"" />RINVOQ is a medicine that can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. You should not start taking RINVOQ if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider (HCP) tells you it is okay.
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child""><b class=""first-child last-child"">Serious infections have happened in some people taking RINVOQ, including tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections.</b> Your HCP should test you for TB before starting RINVOQ and check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with RINVOQ. You may be at higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster).</li>
 	<li><b class=""first-child last-child"">Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in people taking RINVOQ.</b></li>
 	<li><b class=""first-child last-child"">Blood clots in the veins of the legs or lungs and arteries are possible in some people taking RINVOQ. This may be life-threatening and cause death.</b></li>
 	<li class=""last-child"">Tears in the stomach or intestines and changes in certain laboratory tests can happen. Your HCP should do blood tests before you start taking RINVOQ and while you take it. Your HCP may stop your RINVOQ treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.</li>
</ul>
<b class=""first-child"">What should I tell my HCP BEFORE starting RINVOQ?</b><br class=""last-child"" />Tell your HCP if you:
<ul type=""disc"">

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for ruxolitinib (Jakafi<sup>®</sup>) for treatment of steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

The sNDA submission is based on results from the Phase 3, randomized REACH3 study comparing ruxolitinib with best available therapy (BAT) in patients with steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. In the REACH3 study, which was recently presented at the 62<sup>nd</sup> American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting &amp; Exposition, patients treated with ruxolitinib experienced a significantly greater overall response rate (ORR) compared to BAT at Week 24, the primary endpoint (49.7% vs. 25.6%; p&lt;0.0001). For the key secondary endpoints, ruxolitinib was associated with a longer median failure-free survival (FFS) than BAT at Week 24 (not reached vs. 5.7 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.370; p&lt;0.0001), and greater symptom improvement per the modified Lee Symptom Scale (mLSS) at Week 24 (24.2% vs. 11.0%; odds ratio (OR), 2.62; p=0.0011). The best ORR for patients receiving ruxolitinib was 76.4%. No new safety signals were observed, and adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of ruxolitinib.

“Chronic GVHD is a life-threatening complication following stem cell transplant that burdens a vulnerable patient population, which today has limited treatment options,” said Peter Langmuir, M.D., Group Vice President, Oncology Targeted Therapies, Incyte. “The acceptance of this sNDA represents an important milestone for Incyte as we continue our work towards helping more people living with GVHD, particularly for those who do not respond to steroids. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to bring this innovative therapy to patients and to providing continued support to the GVHD community in the United States.”

GVHD is a condition that can occur after an allogeneic stem cell transplant (the transfer of stem cells from a donor) in which the donated cells initiate an immune response and attack the transplant recipient’s organs, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. There are two major forms of GVHD: acute, which generally occurs within 100 days of transplant, and chronic, which generally occurs after 100 days of transplant<sup>1</sup>. Both forms can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, gastrointestinal (digestive) tract and liver.

The FDA grants Priority Review to medicines that may offer a major advance in treatment where none currently exists. This designation shortens the review period to six months compared to 10 months for Standard Review. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for Jakafi in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD is June 22, 2021.

The sNDA is also being reviewed as part of the Project Orbis program, an initiative of the U.S. FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international regulatory agencies. Participating countries for this application include Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Brazil and the United Kingdom.

In 2019, Jakafi<sup> </sup>was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older<sup>2</sup>.

<b>About REACH3</b>

REACH3 (NCT03112603), a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study sponsored by Novartis and conducted in collaboration with and co-funded by Incyte, is evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib compared with best available therapy in patients with steroid-refractory chronic GVHD.

The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) at Week 24 (i.e., Cycle 7, Day 1), defined as the percentage of participants demonstrating a complete or partial response. Key secondary endpoints include failure-free survival (FFS) and change in the modified Lee Symptom Scale (mLSS) score at Week 24. Other secondary endpoints include best overall response (BOR), duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), and safety.

<b>About REACH</b>

The REACH clinical trial program evaluating ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory GVHD includes the randomized pivotal Phase 3 REACH2 and REACH3 trials, conducted in collaboration with Novartis.

The REACH program was initiated with the Incyte-sponsored REACH1 trial, a prospective, open-label, single-cohort, multicenter, pivotal Phase 2 trial (NCT02953678) evaluating Jakafi in combination with corticosteroids in patients with steroid-refractory grade II-IV acute GVHD.

HOLON, <span class=""xn-location"">Israel</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 22, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Compugen Ltd. (Nasdaq: CGEN), a clinical-stage cancer immunotherapy company and a leader in predictive target discovery, announced today the expansion of its clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb. Under the amended agreement, Bristol Myers Squibb will supply Opdivo® (nivolumab), its PD-1 inhibitor, for Compugen's Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span> cohort expansion study designed to assess COM701, Compugen's first-in-class anti-PVRIG antibody, in combination with Opdivo® in selected cancer indications. Study initiation is expected in the second quarter of 2021.

""We are excited to further expand our clinical program evaluating COM701, our first-in-class anti PVRIG inhibitor,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Anat Cohen-Dayag</span>, Ph.D., President and CEO of Compugen. ""While our triple checkpoint blockade study of COM701 combined with Bristol Myers Squibb's PD-1 and TIGIT inhibitors currently advancing in the clinic offers the ultimate test of our science-driven hypothesis, translational research at Compugen suggests that certain patients may not require a triple therapy combination. With the enrollment in the dose escalation arm of COM701 in combination with Opdivo® completed and preliminary signs of antitumor activity previously disclosed, we are ready to continue our evaluation of this dual combination and move to the cohort expansion phase of the study. Testing COM701 in three settings – as a monotherapy, dual combination, and triple combination therapy – may provide additional insights on the contribution of components as well as the opportunity to broaden COM701 treatment options to address patients' needs. We are proud to be moving quickly to initiate this biomarker and data-informed study in indications we believe are most likely to respond to dual PVRIG and PD-1 blockade, enhancing our leadership position in the DNAM-1 axis space.""

Dr. Cohen-Dayag continued, ""Bristol Myers Squibb continues to be a valued partner for our COM701 clinical program as we advance the immunotherapy treatment landscape of patients with cancer.""

Under the terms of the amendment, Bristol Myers Squibb will continue to supply Opdivo® to the Compugen-sponsored study. The Phase <span class=""xn-money"">1b</span> study, a part of Compugen's COM701 monotherapy and combination therapy dose escalation and expansion program (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03667716"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03667716</a>), will examine fixed doses of COM701 and Opdivo®, as determined by Compugen's Phase 1a combination dose escalation study. Based on Compugen's translational analyses and preliminary antitumor activity in dose escalation, the study will enroll patients with ovarian, breast, endometrial and microsatellite-stable colorectal cancers.

Separately, Compugen and Bristol Myers Squibb are also investigating COM701 in a triple combination study with Opdivo<sup>®</sup> and BMS-986207, Bristol Myers Squibb's investigational anti-TIGIT antibody.

Opdivo® is a registered trademark of Bristol Myers Squibb.

<span class=""xn-location"">THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 22, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) for the treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. The sNDA is based on data from the Phase 3 ADVANCE trial that demonstrated oral Otezla 30 mg twice daily achieved a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of the static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) response at week 16 compared to placebo.

""Despite treatment advances, there remains an unmet need for people with clinically mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis who use existing topical therapies and still have challenges managing their disease, particularly those with disease in hard-to-treat locations. Results from the ADVANCE trial demonstrated the potential of Otezla to provide an oral, non-biologic option for these patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David M. Reese</span>, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""We look forward to working with the FDA to potentially expand access to Otezla and deliver on our commitment to improve outcomes for people living with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis.""

Otezla also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in key secondary endpoints compared to placebo, including achieving at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the percent of affected body surface area (BSA), change in BSA total score from baseline and change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) total score from baseline at week 16. Adverse events observed in the ADVANCE trial were consistent with the known safety profile of Otezla. The most commonly reported adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either treatment group were diarrhea, headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection.

Detailed results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.

In the U.S., Otezla is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and for adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's Disease. Since its initial FDA approval in 2014, Otezla has been prescribed to more than 250,000 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or active psoriatic arthritis in the U.S.<sup>1</sup>

<b>About ADVANCE (PSOR-022)</b><br class=""dnr"" />ADVANCE (PSOR-022) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Otezla in patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis (defined as BSA involvement of 2% to 15%, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 2 to 15, sPGA score of 2 to 3). The study randomized 595 patients 1:1 to receive Otezla (n=297) 30 mg twice daily or placebo (n=298) for the first 16 weeks. All patients then received Otezla during an open-label extension phase through week 32.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with sPGA response [defined as a sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline] at week 16.

<b>About Psoriasis</b><br class=""dnr"" />Psoriasis is a serious, chronic inflammatory disease that causes raised, red, scaly patches to appear on the skin, typically affecting the outside of the elbows, knees or scalp, though it can appear on any location.<sup>2</sup> Approximately 125 million people worldwide have psoriasis, including around 14 million people in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> and more than 7.5 million people in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>.<sup>3,4</sup> About 80% of those patients have plaque psoriasis.<sup>5</sup> <br class=""dnr"" /><br class=""dnr"" /><b>About Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast)</b><br class=""dnr"" />OTEZLA<sup>® </sup>(apremilast) is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which Otezla exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined.

<b>Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) U.S. INDICATIONS</b> <br class=""dnr"" />Otezla<sup>® </sup>(apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.

Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.

Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's Disease.

<b>Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b><u>Contraindications</u></b>
<ul>

</ul>
<b><u>Warnings and Precautions</u></b>
<ul>
 	<li>Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting</li>
 	<li>Depression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts, or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occur
<ul>
 	<li><u>Psoriasis:</u> Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.3% (12/920) of patients reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) on placebo. Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/506). Suicidal behavior was observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients on Otezla, compared to 0.2% (1/506) on placebo. One patient treated with Otezla attempted suicide; one patient on placebo committed suicide</li>
 	<li><u>Psoriatic Arthritis:</u> Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.0% (10/998) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. Suicidal ideation and behavior was observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients on Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients. Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/495). Two patients who received placebo committed suicide compared to none on Otezla</li>
 	<li><u>Behcet's Disease:</u> Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During the phase 3 clinical trial, 1% (1/104) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 1% (1/103) treated with placebo. No instances of suicidal ideation or behavior were reported in patients treated with Otezla or treated with placebo</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Weight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of Otezla
<ul>
 	<li><u>Psoriasis:</u> During clinical trials, body weight loss of 5-10% occurred in 12% (96/784) of patients treated with Otezla and in 5% (19/382) of patients treated with placebo. Body weight loss of =10% occurred in 2% (16/784) of patients treated with Otezla compared to 1% (3/382) of patients treated with placebo</li>
 	<li><u>Psoriatic Arthritis:</u> During clinical trials, body weight loss of 5-10% was reported in 10% (49/497) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.3% (16/495) of patients taking placebo</li>
 	<li><u>Behçet's Disease:</u> During the phase 3 clinical trial, body weight loss of &gt;5% was reported in 4.9% (5/103) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.9% (4/102) of patients taking placebo</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Drug Interactions: Apremilast exposure was decreased when Otezla was co-administered with rifampin, a strong <span class=""xn-money"">CYP450</span> enzyme inducer; loss of Otezla efficacy may occur. Concomitant use of Otezla with <span class=""xn-money"">CYP450</span> enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommended</li>

<b>Forward-Looking Statements</b><br class=""dnr"" />This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19, or the Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) acquisition (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

LA JOLLA, Calif., Feb. 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MatriSys Bioscience, a company harnessing beneficial bacteria to treat inflammatory skin diseases, today announced the publication of clinical research on the company’s lead compound, MSB-0221 (ShA9), for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD). Data were published in the journal <em>Nature Medicine</em> on February 22, 2021 <em>“</em><em>Development of a human skin commensal microbe for bacteriotherapy of atopic dermatitis and use in a phase 1 randomized clinical trial</em><em>”.</em> MSB-0221 is a proprietary formulation containing <em>Staphylococcus hominis</em> (ShA9) that was selected and designed to target factors that cause AD.
<p align=""left"">The first-in-human, Phase 1, double-blinded randomized one-week trial of MSB-0221 or vehicle applied topically on forearm skin of 54 adults with <em>Staphylococcus aureus-</em>positive AD (NCT03151148) met its primary endpoint of safety. In addition, participants receiving topical application of ShA9 experienced fewer adverse events associated with AD, as well as greatly decreased colonization by <em>S. aureus</em> (P&lt;0.001). Expression of mRNA for <em>psm</em>a was inhibited from <em>S. aureus</em> isolated from all participants receiving ShA9 in the trial. A significant correlation was observed within 7 days between improvement in local eczema severity and killing of <em>S. aureus</em> by ShA9 (P&lt;0.008). The trial was conducted at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and the National Jewish Health General Clinical Research Center. The Phase 1 trial was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p align=""left"">“The clinical and mechanistic results from this study are highly encouraging, showing the safety and potential benefits of rationally selected bacteria that specifically treat key steps involved in causing inflammatory skin conditions,” said Richard Gallo, M.D., Ph.D., Distinguished Professor and Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, UC San Diego School of Medicine and co-founder and member of the MatriSys Scientific Advisory Board. “The discovery platform that identified and selected MSB-0221 and its mechanism of action has allowed us to elucidate several additional beneficial bacteria to treat multiple inflammatory skin diseases beyond AD.”</p>
<p align=""left"">MatriSys plans to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial with 150 patients over a 12-week treatment period. The trial will include a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled safety, tolerability, and efficacy study using MSB-0221 to treat Atopic Dermatitis.</p>
<p align=""left"">“We are excited about the potential of beneficial bacteria as a therapeutic modality for multiple skin disorders,” said Philippe Calais, Chief Executive Officer of MatriSys. “MatriSys is incredibly committed to explore this new modality of treatment to meet the needs of the millions of patients suffering from chronic skin diseases such as Atopic Dermatitis.”</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>MSB-0221 (ShA9)</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">MSB-0221 is a proprietary topical bacterial formulation containing a stabilized lyophilized topical preparation of <em>Staphylococcus hominis</em>, universal strain A9 (ShA9). The topical formulation is applied to the skin of patients, and the lyophilized bacteria ShA9 return to an active state and kill <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. This approach is a dramatic improvement over broad-spectrum antibiotics that destroy pathogenic bacteria but also kill beneficial bacteria by “friendly fire”.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Atopic Dermatitis</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Atopic Dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease which affects up to 20% of children and up to 3% of adults worldwide, posing a significant burden on patients' quality of life. AD is frequently characterized by overgrowth of <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(<em>S. aureus</em>), which then triggers proteolytic breakdown of the epidermal barrier and immune dysregulation. Correcting the skin microbial ecosystem with targeted bacteriotherapy by a bacterium selected from healthy human skin could potentially break the <em>S. aureus</em> colonization cycle and thereby improve skin immune and barrier dysfunction characteristic of AD.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>About MatriSys Bioscience</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">MatriSys Bioscience is leading the discovery and clinical development of a novel class of biopharmaceuticals to transform the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. Our groundbreaking technology platform identifies beneficial bacteria derived from healthy human skin to treat the millions of children and adults suffering from difficult to treat chronic skin diseases. With our lead clinical program in patients with Atopic Dermatitis, we are also rapidly advancing therapeutics for Acne and Rosacea. <a title=""www.matrisysbio.com"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=i8qDbcNj1MsHYbQAlzcwkj_7qRwVj6zTmaihbRyXm057S6dKrVdnmd2rgueut51doLbapB7v6tHI1eHHk9oUkuCdrJSjdW7qrAPkJcVCwXU="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.matrisysbio.com</a></p>

AD, the most common form of eczema, is an inflammatory disease classified by dry, itchy skin. In its moderate-to-severe form, it is characterized by rashes that can cover much of the body, and can include intense, persistent itching, skin lesions and skin dryness, cracking, redness or darkness, crusting and oozing.<sup>5 </sup>Inadequately controlled AD can have a physical, emotional and psychosocial impact, causing sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and feelings of isolation.<sup>6</sup>

For children living with AD, studies showed that the impact extends beyond its physical symptoms. A survey conducted by the Eczema Society of <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> among Canadian children from infancy up to the age of 18 (and their caregivers) living with AD found that 70 per cent experienced loss of sleep due to their condition, 20 per cent missed school days and 30 per cent experienced anxiety.<sup>7 </sup>These factors can have a negative psychological impact on children, particularly in regard to their concentration and performance at school along with their willingness to socialize.<sup>8</sup>
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>""Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease that has an indelible impact on all patients, both physically and psychologically, and can be devasting to children during a vulnerable time in their life,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Marissa Poole</span>, Country Lead, Sanofi Canada and General Manager, Sanofi Genzyme Canada. ""With this new indication, DUPIXENT</i><i><sup>®</sup></i><i> now has the potential to help the many Canadians who experience this disease including children, adolescents and adults.""</i></p>
<b>About DUPIXENT<sup>®</sup></b>

Since its initial approval in 2017, DUPIXENT<sup>®</sup> remains the only biologic medicine approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients six years and older with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.<sup>9 </sup>DUPIXENT<sup>®</sup> is also approved in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> for the treatment of adult patients with severe CRSwNP and for the treatment of severe asthma in patients 12 years and older.<sup>10</sup>

DUPIXENT<sup>®</sup> is jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Day One Biopharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on accelerating new, promising targeted therapies for children and adults with cancer, today announced that it has entered into a global licensing agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for an exclusive license to develop and commercialize pimasertib as well as a second compound, MSC2015103B. Pimasertib and MSC2015103B are oral, highly-selective small molecule allosteric inhibitors of MEK 1/2, a key enzyme in the MAPK signaling pathway. Dysregulation of the MAPK pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Pimasertib has been studied in more than 10 Phase 1/2 clinical trials in approximately 900 patients with various tumor types. Day One plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of combining pimasertib with DAY101, the Company’s potential first-in-class, oral, brain-penetrant, highly selective type II pan-RAF kinase inhibitor, in patients =12 years of age with recurrent, progressive, or refractory solid tumors with MAPK pathway aberrations.

“Day One is purpose-built to accelerate innovative targeted therapies designed to help both children and adults with cancer,” said Jeremy Bender, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Day One. “This license agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, exemplifies our core strategy to identify investigational potential treatment options such as pimasertib and leverage our expertise to rapidly advance them in patients who we believe will benefit the most. We are excited that a leading pharmaceutical company like Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany recognizes the importance of our mission and look forward to the advancement of pimasertib in combination with our pan-RAF kinase inhibitor, DAY101.”

“There is strong scientific and clinical rationale for targeting multiple nodes of the MAPK signaling pathway to drive deeper and more durable tumor responses,” said Samuel Blackman, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder and chief medical officer of Day One. “DAY101 demonstrated encouraging single agent anti-tumor activity in pediatric low-grade glioma, and we believe the combination of pimasertib and DAY101 will be well-suited for adult patients with solid tumors given their greater heterogeneity. Further, data have shown DAY101 to selectively inhibit both RAF monomers and dimers which may broaden its potential clinical application in combination with MEK inhibition in solid tumors driven by non-BRAF V600<sup> </sup>mutations and RAF fusions. We look forward to initiating a Phase 1/2 combination study later this year.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Day One will make an upfront payment to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany plus additional regulatory, approval and sales-based milestone payments. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will also receive royalties on potential net sales of pimasertib and MSC2015103B. Specific financial details are not disclosed.

<b>About Pimasertib</b>

Pimasertib is designed as a highly selective, oral, small molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2), of the MAPK signaling pathway. Dysregulation of the MAPK pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers. Pimasertib has been studied in more than 10 Phase 1/2 clinical trials in approximately 900 patients with various tumor types and has demonstrated a safety and efficacy profile comparable to other MEK inhibitors.

<b>About Day One Biopharmaceuticals</b>

Day One Biopharmaceuticals is a differentiated company created to find and develop new therapies that meet the needs of people with cancer of all ages, starting with the biology of childhood cancer. The Company’s name, Day One, was inspired by the “The Day One Talk”<sup>1</sup> that physicians have with patients and their families about an initial cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. Keeping the needs of patients and oncologists in mind, the Day One team focuses their efforts to bring medicines to families receiving this life-altering news. Together, we aim to re-envision cancer drug development and redefine what’s possible for people with cancer – whatever their age – starting from Day One.

Day One partners with leading clinical oncologists, families, and scientists to identify, acquire, and develop important emerging cancer treatments. The Company’s lead product candidate, DAY101, is designed as a first-in-class, oral, highly-selective pan-RAF kinase inhibitor, and the Company has initiated a Phase 2 registration-enabling study (FIREFLY-1) in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients with recurrent or progressive low-grade glioma (pLGG). The Company’s pipeline also includes the investigational agent pimasertib, a clinical-stage, oral, highly selective small molecule inhibitor of MEK. Based in South San Francisco, Day One has raised more than $190 million from leading life sciences investors. Through Day One and its collaborators, cancer drug development comes of age.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for Priority Review the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for TicoVac™, its tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine for active immunization to prevent TBE in individuals 1 year of age and older.<sup>1,2 </sup>If approved, TicoVac would be the first vaccine in the U.S. to help protect adults and children who are visiting or living in TBE endemic areas. In line with Priority Review designation, the FDA will target an action within six months of the application submission date,<sup>3</sup> with the anticipated Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date expected for August 2021.

TBE is a viral infection of the brain and spine,<sup>4</sup> which is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick.<sup>5</sup> To date, ticks infected with the TBE virus have been identified in more than 35 countries across Europe and Asia.<sup>5</sup> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) currently recommends TBE vaccination for people who live in or are traveling to these risk areas.<sup>6</sup>

“For many years, our TBE vaccine has helped protect millions of people in Europe from this potentially serious disease. We are proud that today’s U.S. FDA Priority Review acceptance acknowledges the potential value that our vaccine candidate can bring,” said Nanette Cocero, Ph.D., Global President, Vaccines, Pfizer Inc. “If approved in the U.S., we hope this vaccine will help protect those traveling to or residing temporarily in at-risk locations, potentially including military personnel who are serving overseas.”

The BLA is based on results from more than 40 years of experience and evidence outside the U.S.<sup>7</sup> In clinical trials, the safety and immunogenicity of TicoVac was assessed across two age groups (1-15 years of age and 16-65 years of age).<sup>7</sup> In these studies, pooled seropositivity rates were 99-100% in 1-15 year olds and 94-99% in adults &gt;15 years following three doses.<sup>*8,9</sup> Clinical studies demonstrated that TicoVac was well-tolerated with no unexpected adverse events or vaccine-related serious adverse events observed.<sup>8,9</sup> Subsequent real-world studies have shown that the vaccine is 96-99% effective in people who have received at least two doses of the vaccine,<sup>10,11</sup> and two to three doses of the vaccine were shown to be sufficient to provide a long-lasting immune memory.<sup>1,2,12</sup>

<b>About TicoVac™ (TBE vaccine, whole virus inactivated)</b>

Pfizer’s TBE vaccine, marketed under the brand names TicoVac and FSME-Immun™ in Europe, is an inactivated whole virus vaccine developed using a master ‘seed’ virus that is similar to the TBE virus found in nature.<sup>13</sup> Therefore, it is able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the natural TBE virus, as the sequence and structure of the virus subtype match those found in nature.<sup>14 </sup>The vaccine helps provide protection against all known subtypes of the TBE virus in both children (from one year of age) and adults,<sup>1,2,14</sup> including the European, Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes.<sup>15,16</sup>

More than 40 years of experience with the Pfizer TBE vaccine exist outside the U.S., and more than 160 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed since 1976.<sup>7,17</sup>

<b>About TBE</b>

TBE is a viral infection of the brain and spine,<sup>4</sup> transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick,<sup>5</sup> and less frequently by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products from infected animals.<sup>4</sup> It may initially be mistaken for summer flu,<sup>18,19</sup> but can be a serious condition with possible long-term consequences.<sup>4,19</sup> More than 1 in 3 people can have long-term effects that last months or yearsincluding cognitive changes, muscle weakness or permanent paralysis,<sup>4,19</sup> and in rare cases (0.5-2%; up to 20% in Russia), people may die.<sup>20,21</sup> TBE can affect people of all ages who come into contact with ticks whenever they do outdoor activities in countries where ticks infected with TBE are prevalent.<sup>4,21</sup>

Although TBE is not endemic in the U.S., TBE has been reported in more than 35 countries, ranging from Western Europe to Japan.<sup>5</sup> Currently there is no cure or treatment for TBE, only management of symptoms.<sup>4 </sup>The potential vaccine could help protect people from the U.S. who are traveling to or living in endemic regions.

<div class=""mainBody"">

<strong>Osaka, Japan, February 24, 2021</strong> -- Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) announced today that the first subject was dosed in its Phase 1/2 immunogenicity and safety study of Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate (TAK-019) in Japan. Earlier this month, Takeda completed enrollment in the company’s Phase 1/2 immunogenicity and safety study of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate (TAK-919) in Japan.

“Early in the pandemic, we made the decision to partner with other companies and leverage our substantial vaccine experience and capabilities to make COVID-19 vaccines available in Japan,” said Rajeev Venkayya, M.D., President of the Global Vaccine Business Unit, Takeda. “We have been pleased to see the outstanding Phase 3 efficacy data from the Moderna and Novavax programs and are excited to work with each company and the Government of Japan to help bring the pandemic to an end. ”

Takeda previously announced its commitment to providing rapid and sustained access to COVID-19 vaccines in Japan through partnerships with <a href=""https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2020/novavax-and-takeda-announce-collaboration-for-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-in-japan/"">Novavax</a> and <a href=""https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2020/takeda-expands-covid-19-vaccine-supply-in-japan-through--partnership-with-moderna-and-government-of-japan/"">Moderna</a>. Takeda will receive a manufacturing technology transfer from Novavax and will be responsible for the development and commercialization based on manufacturing capacity of over 250 million doses of TAK-019. The company will also import and distribute 50 million doses of TAK-919 as part of a joint partnership with Moderna and the Government of Japan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (MHLW).

Results from the TAK-919 study are expected in the first half of 2021 and results from the TAK-019 study in the second half of 2021. Once available, the study results will be submitted to the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) as part of the NDA filing process. Pending regulatory approval, Takeda intends to start distributing TAK-919 in the first half of 2021 and aims to start distributing TAK-019 in late 2021.

<strong>TAK-919 clinical trial
</strong>This placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 study in Japan will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two vaccinations of TAK-919 given 28 days apart. Each participant was assigned to receive a placebo or a 0.5 ml dose of TAK-919 at both vaccinations. The trial completed enrollment of 200 participants aged 20 years and older on February 3, 2021. Participants will be followed for 12 months after the second vaccination.

UCB and Microsoft have announced a new multi-year, strategic collaboration to combine Microsoft's computational services, cloud, and artificial intelligence (AI) with UCB's drug discovery and development capabilities. As several drug discovery activities require the analysis of <b>high-dimensional data sets or multi-modal unstructured information</b>, Microsoft's platform can support UCB's scientists, including its data scientists, to discover new medicines in a more efficient and innovative way.

The collaboration builds on the work UCB and Microsoft have already embarked on around COVID-19. As part of the COVID Moonshot project, UCB's medicinal and computational chemists contributed compound designs to this worldwide open-science project to create an orally bioavailable anti-viral for COVID-19 - with the most potent series of compounds coming from UCB designs.

This combination of cutting-edge science, computing power, and AI algorithms aims to significantly accelerate the iteration cycles required to explore a vast chemical space to test many hypotheses and identify more effective molecules. The collaboration plans to extend this model and identify other areas where computing power, AI, and science can accelerate the development of life changing therapies for people living with severe diseases in immunology and neurology. <b>The work will augment UCB's scientists, subject matter experts and research partners across every part of the drug discovery and delivery value chain by harnessing diverse research information and AI models alongside human expertise and creativity.</b>

""We are delighted to be collaborating with Microsoft to uncover new insights to better understand a patient's condition, as well as the science, and to enable an enhanced patient experience,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jean-Christophe Tellier</span>, CEO of UCB. ""By amplifying the power of scientific innovation through digital transformation, we hope to have a better understanding of what makes a patient's journey unique so that we can provide personalized and differentiated medicine in a sustainable way.""

Basel, 25 February 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the New England Journal of Medicine has published Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) data from the dose finding Part 1 of the pivotal FIREFISH study in infants with symptomatic Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The data show that treatment with Evrysdi at 12 months helped 90% (19/21) of these infants survive without permanent ventilation and 33% (7/21) sit without support for at least 5 seconds, which is not normally seen in the natural course of the disease. The study also found that treatment with Evrysdi increased the levels of survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein by a median 1.9-fold from baseline in the high-dose cohort at 12 months.

“Since Evrysdi was FDA approved in August, we have been inspired by the stories and sense of hope that we have heard from people living with SMA and their families about the impact Evrysdi has had in their lives,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “The publication of the data in the New England Journal of Medicine reinforces the value of Evrysdi as an important treatment option for SMA.”

The exploratory efficacy analysis found that after 12 months of treatment, seven (33%; 7/21) infants were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III). All seven infants who achieved this milestone received the high dose (41%; 7/17), which was the dose selected for the confirmatory Part 2 of the study. Nine of the infants in the high-dose cohort (53%; 9/17) had upright head control after 12 months of treatment, and one infant (6%; 1/17) was able to stand (bearing weight), as assessed by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 (HINE-2).

In the low- and high-dose cohorts, no infant lost the ability to swallow over 12 months, and 86% (18/21) were able to feed orally, either exclusively or in combination with a feeding tube at 12 months. In addition, 90% (19/21) of infants were alive without permanent ventilation after 12 months of treatment with Evrysdi. Three infants experienced fatal complications of their disease after approximately one, eight and 13 months of treatment, respectively. An additional infant passed away after the data cut-off with death occurring approximately 3.5 months after receiving the last dose of study drug. None of these have been attributed by the investigator as related to Evrysdi.

The researchers also assessed motor function with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND), a scale used for infants with Type 1 SMA. Results showed that 11 out of the 21 infants (52%) had a CHOP-INTEND total score of 40 points or higher. The CHOP-INTEND scale ranges from 0 to 64, with higher scores indicating better function.

The most common adverse events included fever (pyrexia; 52%), upper respiratory tract infections (43%), diarrhea (29%), cough (24%), vomiting (24%), constipation (19%) and pneumonia (19%). In total, 24 serious adverse events were reported as of the clinical data cut-off, with the most common including pneumonia in three infants and respiratory tract infection, viral respiratory tract infection, acute respiratory failure and respiratory distress in two infants each.

Among the 21 infants enrolled in Part 1 of the FIREFISH study, the median duration of treatment was 14.8 months at the time of analysis. The median age at enrollment was 6.7 months and symptom onset between the ages of 28 days to 3 months.

In September 2020, two-year results from FIREFISH Part 1 were presented and the exploratory efficacy data showed 88% of infants treated with Evrysdi were alive and did not require permanent ventilation at two years, and 59% of infants were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds.

FIREFISH, an open-label, two-part pivotal study, was designed to assess Evrysdi safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in patients aged 1 to 7 months with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 evaluated several doses of Evrysdi and determined the therapeutic dose of 0.2 mg/kg for Part 2.

Evrysdi has been and continues to be studied in more than 450 people as part of a large and robust clinical trial program in SMA.

<strong>About Evrysdi™ (risdiplam)</strong>
Evrysdi is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA by increasing production of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in adults and children 2 months of age and older. Evrysdi was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by FDA and EMA in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Evrysdi has been approved in seven countries and submitted in 57, including the EU 27, Norway and Iceland.

Evrysdi is currently being evaluated in four multicenter trials in people with SMA:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants with the primary objective of assessing the safety profile of Evrysdi in infants and determining the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of Evrysdi in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 2 years, followed by an open-label extension. Enrollment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two-part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. The study has completed recruitment (n=174).</li>
 	<li>RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Evrysdi in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.</li>

<strong>About SMA</strong>
SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement. Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 24, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved HUMIRA<sup>®</sup> (adalimumab) for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older. In clinical trials, HUMIRA induced clinical remission at Week 8 and maintained remission at Week 52 in patients who responded at Week 8.<sup class=""last-child"">1,2</sup>

""Ulcerative colitis can have a profound effect on children and for too long, treatment options for pediatric patients have been limited,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Brandee Pappalardo</span>, vice president and head of U.S. immunology medical affairs, AbbVie. ""This approval provides the first and only subcutaneous biologic for pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis that can be administered at home. This new indication for HUMIRA demonstrates AbbVie's commitment to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and reinforces our goal of reducing the burden of this disease for patients.""

This approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 ENVISION I study, which showed that HUMIRA achieved the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission per Partial Mayo Score (PMS) at Week 8 and, among those who responded at Week 8, clinical remission per Full Mayo Score (FMS) at one year (52 weeks).<sup class=""first-child"">1,2</sup> Clinical remission was defined as a PMS or as a FMS less than or equal to two and no individual sub-score greater than one.<sup class=""last-child"">1,2</sup>

""Ulcerative colitis is unpredictable and affects everyone, especially children, in different ways,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Marla Dubinsky</span>, M.D., chief, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology for the Mount Sinai Health System and co-director of the Susan and Leonard Feinstein IBD Center at Mount Sinai.* ""In the ENVISION I study, HUMIRA provided clinical response as early as Week 8, and many who achieved partial Mayo score response at Week 8 achieved clinical remission at Week 52, per FMS. As a clinician, I am excited to have a new treatment option available and am encouraged by these positive results, which have the potential to help pediatric patients and their caregivers manage their disease.""

Ulcerative colitis is characterized by inflammation of the large intestine with symptoms ranging from mild to severe bowel urgency and bowel incontinence as well as weight loss and fatigue.<sup class=""first-child"">3,4</sup> It remains a lifelong condition that is not adequately controlled in many patients, underscoring the need for more treatment options.<sup>3,4</sup> Significant unmet needs remain in moderate to severe pediatric ulcerative colitis, compared to adults, as pediatric patients tend to have more extensive disease often causing significant morbidity in children.<sup class=""last-child"">4,5</sup>

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About the ENVISION I Phase 3 Study<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1,2,6</sup></b>

The ENVISION I study was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and the pharmacokinetics of HUMIRA in pediatric patients (ages 4-17) with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (defined as a FMS of 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy), administered subcutaneously.

Through Week 8, patients in both dosage groups received 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0, 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2, and 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) at Weeks 4 and 6. The higher dosage group also received an additional dosage of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 1. Between Week 8 and Week 52, patients received double-blind placebo, HUMIRA 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week, or every week. The co-primary endpoints of the study were clinical remission per PMS (defined as PMS = 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1) at Week 8, and clinical remission per the Mayo Score (defined as Mayo Score = 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1) at Week 52 in patients who achieved clinical response per PMS at Week 8.

Study results demonstrated 60 percent [28/47] of patients taking the higher dosage of HUMIRA achieved clinical remission per PMS, at the end of the 8-week induction period and 43 percent [13/30] of patients in the lower dosage group. At Week 52, among Week 8 PMS responders, 45 percent [14/31] of patients receiving the higher dosage of HUMIRA achieved remission per FMS and 29 percent [9/31] of patients taking the lower dosage of HUMIRA and 33 percent [4/12] of those randomized to placebo. There are limitations to the interpretability of the placebo data due to the small sample size.

Approved dosing for HUMIRA will be determined based on the child's weight, as follows<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1</sup>:

<b class=""first-child last-child"">Important Safety Information About HUMIRA<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup> (adalimumab)</b>

<b class=""first-child"">What is the most important information I should know about HUMIRA?</b><br class=""last-child"" />You should discuss the potential benefits and risks of HUMIRA with your doctor. HUMIRA is a TNF blocker medicine that can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. You should not start taking HUMIRA if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay.
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child""><b class=""first-child last-child"">Serious infections have happened in people taking HUMIRA. These serious infections include tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria that have spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. </b>Your doctor should test you for TB before starting HUMIRA, and check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with HUMIRA, even if your TB test was negative. If your doctor feels you are at risk, you may be treated with medicine for TB.</li>
 	<li class=""last-child""><b class=""first-child last-child"">Cancer. </b>For children and adults taking TNF blockers, including HUMIRA, the chance of getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. There have been cases of unusual cancers in children, teenagers, and young adults using TNF blockers. Some people have developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results in death. If using TNF blockers including HUMIRA, your chance of getting two types of skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell) may increase. These types are generally not life-threatening if treated; tell your doctor if you have a bump or open sore that doesn't heal.</li>
</ul>
<b class=""first-child"">What should I tell my doctor BEFORE starting HUMIRA?</b>
<b class=""last-child"">Tell your doctor about all of your health conditions</b>, including if you:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child"">Have an infection, are being treated for infection, or have symptoms of an infection</li>
 	<li>Get a lot of infections or infections that keep coming back</li>
 	<li>Have diabetes</li>
 	<li>Have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB, or were born in, lived in, or traveled where there is more risk for getting TB</li>
 	<li>Live or have lived in an area (such as the <span class=""xn-location first-child last-child"">Ohio</span> and Mississippi River valleys) where there is an increased risk for getting certain kinds of fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis. These infections may happen or become more severe if you use HUMIRA. Ask your doctor if you are unsure if you have lived in these areas</li>
 	<li>Have or have had hepatitis B</li>
 	<li>Are scheduled for major surgery</li>
 	<li>Have or have had cancer</li>
 	<li>Have numbness or tingling or a nervous system disease such as multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barré syndrome</li>
 	<li>Have or had heart failure</li>
 	<li>Have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. HUMIRA patients may receive vaccines, except for live vaccines. Children should be brought up to date on all vaccines before starting HUMIRA</li>
 	<li>Are allergic to rubber, latex, or any HUMIRA ingredients</li>
 	<li>Are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to breastfeed</li>
 	<li class=""last-child"">Have a baby and you were using HUMIRA during your pregnancy. Tell your baby's doctor before your baby receives any vaccines</li>
</ul>
<b class=""first-child"">Also tell your doctor about all the medicines you take. </b>You should not take HUMIRA with ORENCIA<sup>®</sup> (abatacept), KINERET<sup>®</sup> (anakinra), REMICADE<sup>®</sup> (infliximab), ENBREL<sup>®</sup> (etanercept), CIMZIA<sup>®</sup> (certolizumab pegol), or SIMPONI<sup>® </sup>(golimumab). Tell your doctor if you have ever used RITUXAN<sup>® </sup>(rituximab), IMURAN<sup>®</sup> (azathioprine), or PURINETHOL<sup>®</sup> (mercaptopurine, 6-MP).<sup class=""last-child"">®</sup>

<b class=""first-child"">What should I watch for AFTER starting HUMIRA?</b>
<b class=""last-child"">HUMIRA can cause serious side effects</b>, including:
<ul type=""disc"">

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa. and GERMANTOWN, Md. and HILDEN, Germany, Feb. 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) and INOVIO Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: INO) today announced an extension of their partnership with a new master collaboration agreement to develop liquid biopsy-based companion* diagnostic products based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to complement INOVIO’s therapies. (*Complementary when referring to the US regulatory pathway.)

The initial project in this expanded collaboration focuses on the co-development of a diagnostic test that identifies women who are most likely to benefit from clinical use of VGX-3100, INOVIO’s immunotherapy to treat advanced cervical dysplasia associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV). QIAGEN’s bioinformatic expertise will further increase the predictive power of INOVIO’s preliminary biomarker signature – and the assay will now be developed for use on the Illumina NextSeq™ 550Dx platform, the first development based on a partnership QIAGEN and Illumina signed in October 2019.

VGX-3100 is INOVIO’s late-stage DNA immunotherapy candidate. It is currently in two Phase 3 trials (REVEAL 1 and REVEAL 2), with the potential to become the first non-surgical treatment for advanced pre-cancerous cervical lesions associated with the virus (HPV-16 and HPV-18).

“As we advance our DNA medicines platform, we are always looking for ways to drive innovation with our own technology or that of a creative and accomplished partner. QIAGEN is contributing an extensive track record of developing and commercializing novel diagnostic tests,” said Dr. J. Joseph Kim, INOVIO’s President and CEO. “INOVIO is developing VGX-3100 as a non-surgical treatment for cervical pre-cancer and pre-treatment biomarkers we have discovered could be a targeted way to identify patients most likely to respond to treatment. The goal is to increase the absolute efficacy of the immunotherapy.”

QIAGEN and INOVIO in 2019 announced a collaboration to develop a companion diagnostic to guide clinical decision-making for the use of INOVIO’s DNA-based immunotherapy to treat cervical dysplasia caused by HPV. The new master collaboration agreement covers the development of companion diagnostics for INOVIO’s HPV therapies for a range of sample types and technologies such as PCR and NGS. QIAGEN pioneered HPV testing with the gold-standard digene Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA Test, which became a driving force in HPV screening as a standard of care in cervical cancer prevention.

“We are pleased to support INOVIO by developing companion diagnostics to identify patients who would benefit from VGX-3100. Our experience in developing liquid biopsy-based diagnostic solutions for precision medicine in immuno-oncology will help INOVIO address a larger unmet medical need,” said Jean-Pascal Viola, Senior Vice President, Head of the Molecular Diagnostics Business Area and Corporate Business Development at QIAGEN. “We bring to this partnership our proven leadership in PCR companion diagnostics, as well as long-standing experience in developing innovative and custom NGS panels for our customers. Our recognized bioinformatic capabilities will help improve the efficacy of biomarker signatures. Our team is looking forward to applying our expertise for HPV-related cervical pre-cancer identification with INOVIO.”

HPV is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and the fourth most common cancer among women. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported an estimated 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 311,000 deaths in 2018. Almost 300 million women globally are estimated to be infected with HPV, and about 30 million additional cases have progressed to the precancerous stage. At least 70% of cervical cancers are estimated to be the result of the high-risk HPV 16 and HPV 18 – genotypes that VGX-3100 instructs a suitable patient’s immune system to reduce or fully eliminate.

QIAGEN is a pioneer in precision medicine and the global leader in collaborating with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop companion diagnostics that can detect clinically relevant genetic abnormalities to provide insights that guide clinical decision-making about diseases like cancer. The company offers an unmatched depth and breadth of technologies from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to next-generation sequencing (NGS) for companion diagnostic development. The ability to tailor a CDx to partners’ needs, proven IVD development expertise, and a global commercialization track record allow QIAGEN to develop novel and innovative NGS products and other diagnostic solutions.

About VGX-3100

VGX-3100 is INOVIO’s DNA medicine in clinical trials for the treatment of three HPV-16/18 related disease states – anal dysplasia, vulvar dysplasia, and cervical dysplasia. The cervical dysplasia program is in late Phase 3 clinical trials (REVEAL 1 and REVEAL 2). VGX-3100 is designed to utilize the patient’s own immune system to clear HPV-16/18-associated high-grade precancerous lesions with the aim of reducing the risk of cancer.

About INOVIO

INOVIO is a biotechnology company focused on rapidly bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and diseases associated with HPV. INOVIO is the first and only company to have clinically demonstrated that a DNA medicine can be delivered directly into cells in the body via a proprietary smart device to produce a robust and tolerable immune response. Specifically, INOVIO’s lead candidate VGX-3100, currently in Phase 3 trials for precancerous cervical dysplasia, destroyed and cleared high-risk HPV 16 and 18 in a Phase 2b clinical trial. High-risk HPV is responsible for 70% of cervical cancer, 91% of anal cancer, and 69% of vulvar cancer. Also in development are programs targeting HPV-related cancers and a rare HPV-related disease, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP); non-HPV-related cancers glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and prostate cancer; as well as externally funded infectious disease DNA vaccine development programs in Zika, Lassa fever, Ebola, HIV, and coronaviruses associated with MERS and COVID-19 diseases. Partners and collaborators include Advaccine, ApolloBio Corporation, AstraZeneca, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)/Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND)/Department of Defense (DoD), HIV Vaccines Trial Network, International Vaccine Institute (IVI), Kaneka Eurogentec, Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC), National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Ology Bioservices, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Plumbline Life Sciences, Regeneron, Richter-Helm BioLogics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, University of Pennsylvania, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and The Wistar Institute.

NEW YORK, Feb. 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced the expansion of its pipeline with ITI-1284 ODT-SL. ITI-1284 is a deuterated form of lumateperone, a new molecular entity formulated as an oral disintegrating tablet for sublingual administration. Following recent completion of its Phase 1 program, the Company plans to develop ITI-1284 ODT-SL for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia, the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and the treatment of certain depressive disorders in the elderly.

ITI-1284 ODT-SL is formulated as an oral solid dosage form that dissolves almost instantly when placed under the tongue, allowing for ease of use in the elderly and may be particularly beneficial for patients who have difficulty swallowing conventional tablets. ITI-1284 ODT-SL has been developed in collaboration with Catalent using its proprietary Zydis® ODT (orally disintegrating tablet) fast-dissolving formulation.

Our recently completed Phase I program found that ITI-1284 ODT-SL was rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation, was metabolically stable, and resulted in high systemic exposure. Our Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteers and healthy elderly volunteers (&gt; than 65 years of age) evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ITI-1284. In these studies, there were no reported serious adverse events in either age group. In the elderly cohort, reported adverse events were infrequent with the most common adverse event being transient dry mouth (mild).

Based on these studies, the Company plans to initiate Phase 2 studies evaluating ITI-1284 ODT-SL for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia, dementia-related psychosis, and certain depressive disorders in the elderly.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

KENILWORTH, N.J &amp; WATERTOWN, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PAND) today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement, under which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire Pandion, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases, for $60 per share in cash. This represents an approximate total equity value of $1.85 billion.

“This acquisition builds upon Merck’s strategy to identify and secure candidates with differentiated and potentially foundational characteristics,” said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Pandion has applied its TALON technology to develop a robust pipeline of candidates designed to re-balance the immune response with potential applications across a wide array of autoimmune diseases.”

Pandion is advancing a pipeline of precision immune modulators targeting critical immune control nodes. The company’s lead candidate, PT101, is an engineered IL-2 mutein fused to a protein backbone designed to selectively activate and expand regulatory T cells (Tregs) for the potential treatment of ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune diseases. Earlier this year, Pandion announced that PT101 had completed a Phase 1a clinical trial, which achieved its primary objective of safety and tolerability. The company’s pipeline also includes PD-1 agonists in development for numerous autoimmune diseases.

“Pandion grew out of our founders’ personal and scientific mission to change the way patients living with autoimmune diseases are treated. In just a few years, we have taken that mission from idea to clinical proof of mechanism with PT101, our lead IL-2 mutein. We are proud that Merck has recognized our team’s innovation and drive in creating a pipeline of diverse candidates that activate natural immune regulatory mechanisms and thereby have the potential to achieve better clinical responses for patients,” said Dr. Rahul Kakkar, chief executive officer, Pandion Therapeutics. “We believe Merck is well positioned to bring our novel approach to the millions of those living with autoimmune diseases, and we look forward to seeing these molecules progress in the clinic.”

Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Pandion. The closing of the tender offer will be subject to certain conditions, including the tender of shares representing at least a majority of the total number of Pandion’s shares of fully-diluted common stock, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer, Merck’s acquisition subsidiary will be merged into Pandion, and any remaining shares of common stock of Pandion will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the same $60 per share price payable in the tender offer. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021.

Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC acted as financial advisor to Merck and Covington &amp; Burling LLP as its legal advisor. Centerview Partners LLC acted as financial advisor to Pandion and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP as its legal advisor.

<b>About Regulatory T Cells (Tregs)</b>

Tregs act as a control node within the immune system and can inhibit the activity of several different pro-inflammatory immune cell types. Tregs are critical for self-tolerance, or the ability of the immune system to recognize a hosts’ cells and not produce an immune attack against them. Defects in Tregs result in multi-organ inflammation and their dysfunction is associated with many autoimmune diseases. Multiple third-party clinical trials suggest that expansion of Tregs by low-dose IL-2 can benefit patients with autoimmune diseases.

<b>About PT101</b>

PT101 is an engineered IL-2 mutein fused to a protein backbone designed to selectively activate and expand regulatory T cells for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system inappropriately attacks a host’s cells, and targeting Tregs could allow the immune system to regain control and return to homeostasis. PT101 has completed a Phase 1a clinical trial, which achieved its primary objective of safety and tolerability. In the trial, PT101 demonstrated proof of mechanism by selectively expanding Tregs in healthy volunteers.

PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development &amp; Commercialization, Inc. (Otsuka) and Click Therapeutics, Inc. announce the initiation of the Mirai study, a landmark fully remote clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of digital therapeutics in reducing depressive symptoms in adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are on antidepressant monotherapy.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

The pivotal, randomized, controlled trial will enroll up to 540 patients nationwide. Trial participation will be 10 weeks and efficacy will be evaluated as a change from baseline in the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.

“This landmark clinical trial demonstrates Otsuka’s unwavering commitment to the evolution of clinically validated, FDA-cleared digital health solutions that support patients living with mental illnesses, like major depressive disorder,” said Kabir Nath, president and CEO, Otsuka North America Pharmaceutical Business Division, Otsuka America, Inc. “The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for digital treatments and fully remote e-clinical trials that go beyond the pill to empower patients, enhance connectivity between patients and their healthcare team, and ensure more diverse populations can participate in new clinical trials.”

According to the World Health Organization, depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.<sup>2</sup> Click and Otsuka are committed to bridging the gaps between the global deficiency of mental health treatment access and the millions of patients in need of safe, effective, convenient and accessible care.

“While awareness of mental illness has grown steadily over the last decade, clinically validated therapeutic options available to patients and providers have remained essentially the same,” said David Benshoof Klein, CEO of Click Therapeutics. “Now more than ever, there is a need for a scalable digital solution that can dramatically expand access to mental health treatment without sacrificing the rigors of clinical validation or a patient-centered focus on engagement and user experience.”

Otsuka and Click will collaborate with Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet, to execute the trial as a fully remote trial. The collaboration with Verily provides tools and technology to engage patients and clinicians, in order to increase the pace of studies and collect higher quality, more comprehensive data in a more naturalistic setting. The collaboration also enables the trial to proceed efficiently and safely in the face of the unique market challenges presented by COVID-19.

GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced results from the phase 2 proof of concept OSCAR (Otilimab in Severe COVID-19 Related Disease) study with otilimab, an investigational anti-granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (anti-GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody.

The primary endpoint of the OSCAR study was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who were alive and free of respiratory failure 28 days after treatment with a single dose of otilimab in addition to standard of care (including anti-viral treatments and corticosteroids), compared to patients being treated with standard of care alone. Data from patients of all ages showed a treatment difference of 5.3% (95% CI= -0.8%, 11.4%) but this did not reach statistical significance. However, a pre-planned efficacy analysis by age in patients 70 years and older (N=180, 806 in total study) showed that 65.1% of patients were alive and free of respiratory failure 28 days after treatment with otilimab plus standard of care, compared to 45.9% of patients who received the standard of care alone (delta of 19.1%, 95% CI=5.2%, 33.1%) (nominal p-value=0.009). In addition, in a mortality analysis up to day 60, a treatment difference of 14.4% favouring otilimab was seen with rates of 40.4% on standard of care vs. 26% on otilimab plus standard of care (95% CI= 0.9%, 27.9%) (nominal p-value=0.040) in patients 70 years and older.

Given these data suggest a potentially important clinical benefit in a pre-defined sub-group of high-risk patients and the public health need, GSK has decided to amend the OSCAR study to expand this cohort to confirm these potentially significant findings.

<strong>Christopher Corsico, Senior Vice President Development, GSK,</strong> said: “Patients aged 70 and over account for 70% of COVID-related deaths and nearly 40% of hospitalisations. Our scientific understanding of COVID continues to evolve at a rapid pace with recent studies suggesting that GM-CSF is elevated in this group of patients. Given the profound impact this pandemic is having on the elderly and the encouraging data we are sharing today, we are hopeful this finding will be replicated in the additional cohort.”

Approximately 10-15% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 experience severe disease involving respiratory problems that can require hospitalisation and intensive care, with an additional 5% of patients becoming critically ill. Age is widely recognised as a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. Greater disease severity and increased mortality are consistently observed in older patients with severe pulmonary COVID-19. According to the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk of hospitalisation is 5-times greater for patients age 70 to 74, rising to 8-times higher for patients age 75 and older. These patients often need breathing interventions including significant oxygen support or mechanical ventilation. The severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 are caused by the body’s immune system going into overdrive to eliminate the virus and can lead to life-threatening complications or even death.

Recent research suggests the role of the cytokine GM-CSF in the immune response to COVID-19 may be more prominent in patients over the age of 70<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-announces-otilimab-data-for-treatment-of-covid-19/#_OSCAR2BD1"" name=""_OSCAR2ref1""><sup>[1]</sup></a>, putting them at an increased risk for serious complications related to COVID-19. There is an unmet need for additional therapeutics to help mediate the immune response in this patient population.

The additional cohort of the OSCAR study will follow a similar study design and will enrol approximately 350 patients aged 70 years and older.

Currently available therapies have limited clinical benefit in the more severe stages of hospitalised COVID-19 when patients require high-flow oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation. To date, no targeted immunomodulatory therapy has been proven to have sufficient benefit in improving recovery from respiratory failure or reducing mortality in patients aged 70 years and older.

In the OSCAR study, the most common serious adverse event observed was respiratory failure (5% for placebo, 4% for otilimab). Overall, all adverse events and serious adverse events observed were typical for a severe COVID-19 population. In the 70 years and older sub-group, the incidence rates of SAEs and fatal SAEs were lower in the otilimab group compared with the placebo group.
<h3>About the Phase 2 OSCAR study</h3>
This global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, proof-of-concept phase 2a OSCAR study (<u>NCT04376684</u>) assessed the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous infusion of otilimab 90 mg given over an hour or placebo in addition to standard of care in 806 hospitalised adults (ages 18 to 79 years) with severe COVID-19 related pulmonary disease. Standard of care permitted the use of corticosteroids (including dexamethasone), remdesivir, and convalescent plasma according to local hospital/institutional policies. Study participants were enrolled at 130 sites around the world, including in the United States, Europe, Asia, Russia, South Africa and South America. All participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; been hospitalised due to a diagnosis of pneumonia; had new onset of oxygenation impairment requiring high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation <u>&lt;</u>48 hours before dosing; and had increased biological markers of systemic inflammation.

Participants were considered ‘alive and free of respiratory failure’ if they were off significant oxygen support measured using a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) modified version ordinal scale adapted from World Health Organization (WHO) scale 2020.

A full analysis is ongoing and will be made available in an upcoming pre-print publication when available.
<h3>About Otilimab</h3>
Otilimab (previously GSK3196165) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a protein that plays a central role in a broad range of immune-mediated diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. GM-CSF acts on cells, including macrophages (an immune cell type that plays a key role in the inflammatory process), leading to inflammation, joint damage and pain. Otilimab neutralises the biological function of GM-CSF by blocking the interaction of GM-CSF with its cell surface receptor. In 2013 GSK assumed exclusive worldwide responsibility of otilimab from MorphoSys AG for all development and commercialisation activities in all therapeutic fields.
<h3>GSK commitment to tackling COVID-19</h3>
GSK’s response to COVID-19 has been one of the broadest in the industry, with two potential treatments in addition to our vaccine candidates in development.

GSK is collaborating with several organisations on COVID-19 vaccines by providing access to our adjuvant technology. In addition to work with Sanofi, our collaboration with Medicago on an adjuvanted, protein-based vaccine candidate is now in late-stage clinical trials. An earlier stage collaboration with SK Bioscience is also ongoing, with funding from CEPI and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to develop differentiated, affordable COVID-19 vaccines for supply globally through the COVAX facility. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced, contributing to protecting more people.

GSK is also working with mRNA specialist, CureVac, to jointly develop next generation, multi-valent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine. GSK will also support manufacturing of up to 100m doses of CureVac’s first generation COVID-19 vaccine, if approved.

GSK is also exploring potential therapeutic or treatment options for COVID-19 patients. We are collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to develop existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","COLUMBIA, Md. and INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 25, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Welldoc, Inc., and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today a collaboration and licensing agreement to integrate Welldoc’s software into Lilly’s connected insulin solutions, currently in development. Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly and Welldoc will collaborate to create a new version of the BlueStar® insulin management solution that integrates insulin dosing data for several Lilly insulins. Lilly will commercialize the pen platform, which will include the new app and Lilly’s connected insulin pen solutions.

Welldoc’s BlueStar app is a digital health solution cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use by adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The app has both prescription and non-prescription features such as insulin titration support, a bolus calculator and personalized health coaching, and integrates blood glucose monitoring and continuous glucose monitoring for people who use insulin.

The new app will integrate insulin dosing data for several Lilly insulins. In the first version of the pen platform, a data transfer module will attach to the top of a prefilled, disposable insulin pen. When paired with the compatible app, the module will automatically transfer insulin dosing data. Lilly is also developing a fully disposable connected insulin pen to be used in future versions of the platform. The app will aggregate various dimensions of personalized data and connect with healthcare providers to deliver actionable insights and provide new opportunities to optimize diabetes care.

“Insulin dosing data are a critical piece of the diabetes management puzzle for people who use insulin to manage their diabetes, and Lilly has made significant progress in developing connected insulin pen solutions to provide access to those data,” said Kevin McRaith, President and CEO of Welldoc. “Our software will now bring all of the most important diabetes data directly into the hands of people living with the condition, their caregivers and their healthcare providers. Bringing various elements of a patient’s care under one platform is critical for those who are managing multiple comorbidities and providers who are working to effectively manage population health. Welldoc’s platform combines a holistic approach with an evidence-based care model tailored to specific chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension, behavioral health and more.”

Lilly plans to submit to the FDA in 2021 for the data transfer module, and Welldoc plans to submit to the FDA in 2021 for the new app. The prefilled, disposable insulin pen to be used in the first version of the pen platform was approved by the FDA in late 2019. If cleared, Lilly plans to commercialize the initial pen platform in the United States and will evaluate opportunities to launch the platform in other geographies. Welldoc will continue to separately commercialize the BlueStar app.

“Today, less than half of people who use insulins are achieving their target A1C goals. We want to simplify the experience of using insulin by integrating our medicines with the most innovative technology available,” said Marie Schiller, vice president of product development for Connected Care and Insulins at Lilly. “We are excited to collaborate with Welldoc. Together, we will combine their advanced software capabilities and expansive insulin management features with our connected insulin pen solutions with the goal of easing the burden of diabetes care on people living with the condition.”

TOKYO &amp; BASKING RIDGE, N.J. &amp; MUNICH &amp; LYON, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and LYSA-LYSARC-CALYM today announced that they have entered a strategic research collaboration to study valemetostat (DS-3201), Daiichi Sankyo’s potential first-in-class EZH1/2 dual inhibitor, in B-cell malignancies starting with a phase 2 study in patients with five subtypes of relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma.

The collaboration brings together Daiichi Sankyo’s innovative science and the multidisciplinary expertise of the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA), the Lymphoma Academic Research Organization (LYSARC) and the CALYM research consortium to conduct clinical and translational research that will build upon the ongoing phase 1 study of valemetostat in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<sup>1</sup>

Lymphoma is a heterogenous disease with more than 90 different subtypes and while new treatment advances have improved outcomes for some patients, management of relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma remains a major challenge.<sup>2</sup> There are currently no dual EZH1/2 directed therapies approved for cancer treatment.

“We are pleased to join forces with Europe’s largest lymphoma research organization to advance and strengthen the development of valemetostat as a potential novel precision medicine for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma,” said Arnaud Lesegretain, Vice President, Global Oncology Development, Alpha Portfolio, Daiichi Sankyo. “LYSA-LYSARC-CALYM together with Daiichi Sankyo have designed a phase 2 study that will enroll patients based on disease subtype and biomarkers in order to further evaluate safety and efficacy, and we are planning a comprehensive translational research program to answer important scientific questions relating to clinical utility, optimal patient selection and mechanisms of resistance.”

“We are very happy to engage our cooperative group in a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo for this promising development program with valemetostat targeting relevant epigenetic factors EZH2 and EZH1 in B-cell lymphomas,” said Franck Morschhauser, Professor of Hematology in Lille, France and President of LYSA-LYSARC. “We believe that our extensive multidisciplinary and international expertise will help advance the science behind the novel mechanism of action and we look forward to playing a role in bringing this potential new medicine to patients with lymphoma.”

<b>About the Collaboration</b>

Under the agreement, LYSA-LYSARC will execute a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of valemetostat in six cohorts of patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma.

The study will enroll patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (with and without an EZH2 mutation) that has progressed on at least one prior treatment; follicular lymphoma (EZH2 mutant and EZH2 wild-type), mantle cell lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma/other indolent lymphomas that have progressed on two or more prior treatments; and Hodgkin lymphoma that has progressed on three or more prior treatments including checkpoint inhibitors.

The primary endpoint of the study is best overall response rate determined by investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints include complete response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, time to response and safety measures including adverse events. Exploratory endpoints include overall survival and measures of biomarker expression and treatment response. Pharmacokinetic endpoints will also be assessed.

The study will include approximately 140 patients at 22 sites in France and Belgium and is anticipated to initiate in 2021.

<b>About EZH1 and EZH2</b>

EZH1 (enhancer of zeste homolog 1) and EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) enzymes are part of polycomb protein complexes that act through histone methylation to regulate gene expression.<sup>3</sup> EZH1 and EZH2 are recurrently highly expressed or mutated in many hematologic malignancies.<sup>4</sup> Epigenetic dysregulation of the methylation process is associated with suppression of genes that regulate cancer cell growth and proliferation.<sup>4</sup> Research shows that both EZH1 and EZH2 have a role in hematologic cancer progression and that simultaneous inhibition would be effective in targeting the cancers.<sup>5</sup> There are no dual EZH1/2 directed therapies approved for treatment of cancer.

<b>About Valemetostat</b>

Valemetostat (DS-3201) is a potential first-in-class small molecule oral EZH1/2 dual inhibitor currently in clinical development in the Alpha portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo for several hematologic cancers. Valemetostat targets epigenetic regulation by inhibiting both the EZH1 and EZH2 enzymes. Valemetostat has displayed antitumor activity in various hematological malignancies in preclinical models.<sup>5,6</sup>

The development program of valemetostat includes a <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04102150%3Fterm%3Dvalemetostat%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;esheet=52381567&amp;newsitemid=20210223006211&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=pivotal+phase+2+trial&amp;index=1&amp;md5=d2015e6de97d4d63c6770de9848b02f3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">pivotal phase 2 trial</a> in patients with relapsed or refractory adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) in Japan; a <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02732275%3Fterm%3DDS-3201%26cond%3DNHL%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;esheet=52381567&amp;newsitemid=20210223006211&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=phase+1+study&amp;index=2&amp;md5=d66835cef863a942a60abe370c420337"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">phase 1 study</a> in patients with several types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) including B-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in the U.S. and Japan; and a <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03110354&amp;esheet=52381567&amp;newsitemid=20210223006211&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=phase+1+study&amp;index=3&amp;md5=373d102f1f0c4a2e1a31a40dff24af2b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">phase 1 study</a> in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the U.S.

In April 2019, valemetostat received SAKIGAKE Designation for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).

Valemetostat is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

<b>About B-Cell Lymphoma</b>

Lymphoma is the most common type of blood cancer.<sup>7</sup> There were more than 627,000 new cases of lymphoma diagnosed globally and more than 283,000 deaths from the disease in 2020.<sup>8</sup>

There are more than 90 different lymphoma subtypes, which occur in varying frequencies in different geographic regions around the world.<sup>7</sup> Most lymphomas originate in B-cell lymphocytes, with the most common types being diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (about 33 percent), follicular lymphoma (about 20 percent), mantle cell lymphoma (about 5 percent) and marginal zone lymphoma (5 to 10 percent).<sup>9</sup> Treatment recommendations and prognosis vary for different subtypes of B-cell lymphoma.<sup>10</sup> New treatment advances have improved outcomes for some patients with certain types of B-cell lymphoma, but management of relapsed or refractory lymphoma remains a major challenge and new and novel treatments are needed.<sup>2</sup>

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Feb. 25, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <b>REGN</b>) today announced changes to the Phase 3 trial assessing investigational REGEN-COV™ (casirivimab with imdevimab) in non-hospitalized patients (""outpatients"") with COVID-19, following recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The IDMC found clear clinical efficacy on reducing the rate of hospitalization and death with both the 1,200 mg and 2,400 mg doses of REGEN-COV compared to placebo, and recommended stopping enrollment into the placebo group.

Regeneron is following the IDMC recommendation and will immediately stop enrolling patients in the placebo group. The trial will continue to enroll patients into both the 1,200 mg and 2,400 mg REGEN-COV treatment groups. The company has not yet had access to any of the unblinded data, including the relative treatment benefit of the 1,200 mg and 2,400 mg doses, and will share detailed results when available in March 2021.

""We appreciate the time and guidance of the IDMC and are extremely grateful to the thousands of patients and investigators who have participated in this more than 8,000-patient clinical trial,"" said David Weinreich, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development at Regeneron. ""REGEN-COV is now available in the U.S. to indicated high-risk non-hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization, and we hope to submit these results as part of a full Biologics License Application.""

""In addition to the clear-cut efficacy that the IDMC has observed in this trial, it's reassuring that preclinical data from our labs and independent researchers show that REGEN-COV effectively neutralizes emerging strains of the virus, which are becoming increasingly common,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""Our cocktail approach using two functionally-independent antibodies safeguards against variants that may impact potency to a single antibody.""

The development and manufacturing of REGEN-COV have been funded in part with federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

<b>About the REGEN-COV Antibody Cocktail
</b>REGEN-COV (casirivimab with imdevimab) is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987) and was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form the cocktail bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus's spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in <i><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3078530-1&amp;h=4036190149&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3048827-1%26h%3D293747952%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Finvestor.regeneron.com%252Fnews-releases%252Fnews-release-details%252Ftwo-science-publications-highlight-potential-regn-cov2-anti%26a%3DScience&amp;a=Science"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Science</a></i>.

The clinical evidence from Regeneron's outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as casirivimab and imdevimab have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who are seronegative and/or who have high viral load. The criteria for 'high-risk' patients are described in the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3078530-1&amp;h=3117325026&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3048827-1%26h%3D2377029624%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.regeneroneua.com%252F%26a%3DFact%2BSheet%2Bfor%2BHealthcare%2BProviders&amp;a=Fact+Sheet+for+Healthcare+Providers"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers</a>. In the U.S., REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy, or for people currently using chronic oxygen therapy because of an underlying comorbidity who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19.

Regeneron is responsible for development and distribution of the treatment in the U.S., and Roche is primarily responsible for development and distribution outside the U.S. The companies share a commitment to making the antibody cocktail available to COVID-19 patients around the globe and will support access in low- and lower-middle-income countries through drug donations to be made in partnership with public health organizations.

REGEN-COV was invented using Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> technology that utilizes a proprietary genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human antibodies.

If an infusion-related reaction occurs, consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>Clinical Worsening After REGEN-COV Administration</b>: Clinical worsening of COVID-19 after administration of REGEN-COV has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty, arrythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status. Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to REGEN-COV use or were due to progression of COVID-19.</li>
 	<li><b>Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19:</b> Benefit of treatment with REGEN-COV has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as REGEN-COV, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Therefore, REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Adverse Reactions</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 4 (1.6%) patients in REGEN-COV 2,400 mg group, 2 (0.8%) patients in REGEN-COV  8,000 mg group and 6 (2.3%) patients in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were considered to be related to study drug. SAEs that were reported as Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were pneumonia, hyperglycemia, nausea and vomiting (2,400 mg REGEN-COV), intestinal obstruction and dyspnea (8,000 mg REGEN-COV) and COVID-19, pneumonia and hypoxia (placebo). <b>REGEN-COV is</b><b> not authorized at the 8,000 mg dose (4,000 mg casirivimab and 4,000 mg imdevimab).</b></li>
 	<li>One anaphylactic reaction was reported in the clinical program. The event began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and required treatment including epinephrine. The event resolved.  Infusion-related reactions, of Grade 2 or higher severity, were reported in 4 subjects (1.5%) in the 8,000 mg (4,000 mg casirivimab and 4,000 mg imdevimab) arm. These infusion-related reactions events were moderate in severity; and include pyrexia, chills, urticaria, pruritus, abdominal pain, and flushing.  One infusion-related reaction (nausea) was reported in the placebo arm and none were reported in the 2,400 mg (1,200 mg casirivimab and 1,200 mg imdevimab) arm. In two subjects receiving the 8,000 mg dose of REGEN-COV, the infusion-related reactions (urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting) resulted in permanent discontinuation of the infusion. All events resolved.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Patient Monitoring Recommendations</u></b>: Clinically monitor patients during infusion and observe patients for at least 1 hour after infusion is complete.

<b><u>Use in Specific Populations</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Pregnancy:</b> There is currently limited clinical experience in the use of REGEN-COV in COVID-19 patients who are pregnant. REGEN-COV therapy should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.</li>
 	<li><b>Nursing Mothers:</b> There is currently no clinical experience in use of REGEN-COV in COVID-19 patients who are breastfeeding. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for REGEN-COV and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from REGEN-COV or from the underlying maternal condition.</li>

PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio) and affiliate Origin Biosciences, Inc. (Origin) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved NULIBRY™ (fosdenopterin) for Injection as the first therapy to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A. This is the first therapy of its kind. The novel therapy was developed based on BridgeBio’s commitment to developing a treatment for MoCD Type A in collaboration with the experts and families in the MoCD Type A community. The announcement was made on Rare Disease Day, which aims to raise awareness about the impact of rare diseases on patients.

MoCD Type A is an ultra-rare and progressive condition, known to impact less than 150 patients globally with a median survival of four years. MoCD Type A presents shortly after birth, often with severe encephalopathy and intractable seizures. NULIBRY is a first-in-class approved cPMP substrate replacement therapy.

“The FDA’s approval of NULIBRY means that patients with MoCD Type A and their families have an approved therapy for the first time. It also reflects our belief that every life matters and that no disease is too rare to address. As is often true in rare disease drug development, this was a community effort in which we were able to play a part – we’d like to thank the patients, caregivers, physicians, scientists, and advocates who played an essential role in achieving this important milestone,” said BridgeBio founder and CEO Neil Kumar, Ph.D.

The efficacy of NULIBRY for the treatment of patients with MoCD Type A was established based on data from three clinical trials compared to data from a natural history study. In these studies, NULIBRY or recombinant cPMP (rcPMP; same active moiety and biologic activity as NULIBRY) reduced the risk of death by 82% compared to the untreated, genotype-matched, historical control group in the natural history study (HR=0.18, 95% CI 0.04, 0.72). At three years on study, the probability of survival in NULIBRY or rcPMP-treated patients (n=13) was 84% (95% CI 49%,96%) compared to 55% (95% CI 30%,74%) for untreated genotype-matched patients in the historical control group (n=18) at three years (Figure 1). In addition to the survival analysis, treatment with NULIBRY led to a reduction of urine concentrations of S-sulfocysteine (SSC), a toxic substance that leads to neurological damage, in patients with MoCD Type A, and the reduction was sustained with long-term treatment over 48 months.

Animal studies have identified that NULIBRY has phototoxic potential. In the clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions reported in two or more Nulibry-treated patients with MoCD Type A were catheter-related complications (89%), pyrexia (fever; 78%), viral infection (56%), pneumonia (44%), otitis media (ear infection; 44%), vomiting (44%) and cough/sneezing (44%). Adverse reactions for the rcPMP-treated patients were similar to the NULIBRY-treated patients.

“Today’s approval represents new hope for patients and families affected with MoCD Type A,” said Donald Basel, M.D., section chief and associate professor of pediatrics at Children’s Wisconsin. “I am encouraged by the clinical data showing that NULIBRY not only lowers the levels of toxic SSC, but importantly extends the lives of patients who previously had only a three- to four-year median survival.”

NULIBRY was reviewed under Priority Review and received Orphan Drug Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA. With this approval, the FDA also issued a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Origin.

BridgeBio and Origin are committed to patient access and have developed a comprehensive patient support program, ForgingBridges, to help patients access NULIBRY. ForgingBridges also provides tools and resources to help patients and caregivers throughout their treatment journey with NULIBRY.

<strong>About Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) Type A</strong>
MoCD Type A is an autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the molybdenum cofactor synthesis 1 gene (MOCS1) and characterized by a deficiency in molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) production, leading to a lack of molybdenum-dependent enzyme activity<sup>1,2</sup>. The lack of activity leads to decreased sulfite oxidase activity with buildup of sulfite and secondary metabolites (such as S-sulfocysteine (SSC)) in the brain, which causes irreversible neurological damage.<sup>2</sup>

MoCD Type A is an ultra-rare disease. The incidence and prevalence of MoCD Type A in the United States are not known, but the estimated incidence is 1 per 342,000 to 411,000 live births (0.24 and 0.29 per 100,000).<sup>3</sup> Based on these estimates, MoCD Type A is likely to be underdiagnosed, with an estimated 22 to 26 missed diagnoses per year in the United States and European Union.

The most common presenting symptoms of MoCD Type A are seizures, feeding difficulties and encephalopathy. Patients with MoCD Type A who survive beyond infancy typically suffer from progressive brain damage, which presents in characteristic patterns on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This damage leads to severe psychomotor impairment and an inability to make coordinated movements or communicate with their environment.

<strong>About NULIBRY (</strong><strong>fosdenopterin)</strong><strong> for Injection</strong>
NULIBRY (fosdenopterin) for Injection is a substrate replacement therapy that provides an exogenous source of cPMP, which is converted to molybdopterin. Molybdopterin is then converted to molybdenum cofactor, which is needed for the activation of molybdenum-dependent enzymes, including sulfite oxidase, an enzyme that reduces levels of neurotoxic sulfites. It is the first and only FDA-approved therapy indicated to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with MoCD Type A, and clinical trials have demonstrated that patients treated with NULIBRY or rcPMP had an improvement in overall survival compared to the untreated, genotype-matched, historical control group.

<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>

<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>

<strong>Potential for Photosensitivity</strong>
NULIBRY can make the patient oversensitive to sunlight. NULIBRY-treated patients or their caregivers are advised to avoid or minimize patient exposure to sunlight and artificial UV light and adopt precautionary measures when exposed to the sun, including wearing protective clothing and sunglasses, and use broad-spectrum sunscreen with high SPF in patients 6 months of age and older. If photosensitivity occurs, caregivers/patients are advised to seek medical attention immediately and consider a dermatological evaluation.

<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
The most common adverse reactions in NULIBRY-treated patients were infusion catheter–related complications (89%), pyrexia (fever) (78%), viral infection (56%), pneumonia (44%), otitis media (ear infection) (44%), vomiting (44%), and cough/sneezing (44%). Adverse reactions for rcPMP-treated patients were similar to the NULIBRY-treated patients.

<strong>PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION</strong>
Please read the FDA-approved NULIBRY Prescribing Information and Instructions for Use and follow the instructions on how to prepare and administer NULIBRY.

NULIBRY has a potential for photosensitivity; see Warnings and Precautions. Seek medical attention immediately if the patient develops a rash or if they notice symptoms of photosensitivity reactions (redness, burning sensation of the skin, blisters).

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

<strong>Clinical Trials</strong><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>
The efficacy of NULIBRY for the treatment of patients with MoCD Type A was established based on data from three clinical trials compared to data from a natural history study.

Study 1: Study 1 was a prospective, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study in patients with MoCD Type A who were receiving treatment with rcPMP prior to treatment with NULIBRY. Study 1 included eight patients, six of whom previously participated in Study 3. The initial NULIBRY dosage was matched to the patient’s rcPMP dosage upon entering the study. The NULIBRY dosage was then titrated over a period of five months to a maximum dosage of 0.9 mg/kg administered once daily as an intravenous infusion.

Study 2: Study 2 was a prospective, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study in one patient with confirmed MoCD Type A who had not been previously treated with rcPMP. The initial dosage of NULIBRY in Study 2 was based on the gestational age of the patient (i.e., 36 weeks). The initial dosage was then incrementally escalated up to a maximum dosage of 0.98 mg/kg administered once daily as an intravenous infusion (1.1 times the maximum approved recommended dosage).

Study 3: Study 3 was a retrospective, observational study that included 10 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MoCD Type A who received rcPMP. Six of these 10 patients were later enrolled in Study 1 to receive treatment with NULIBRY.

<strong>NULIBRY Efficacy and Safety Data</strong><sup><strong>4</strong></sup>
The efficacy of NULIBRY and rcPMP were assessed in a combined analysis of the 13 patients with genetically confirmed MoCD Type A from Study 1 (n=8), Study 2 (n=1), and Study 3 (n=4), who received substrate replacement therapy with NULIBRY or rcPMP.

Of the 13 treated patients included in the combined analysis, 54% were male, 77% were White and 23% were Asian; the median gestational age was 39 weeks (range 35 to 41 weeks). Of these 13 treated patients, the age at first dose was = 14 days for 10 patients (with five patients initiating treatment at one day of age) and =32 days and &lt;69 days for the remaining three patients.

Efficacy was assessed by comparing overall survival in pediatric patients treated with NULIBRY or rcPMP (n=13) with an untreated natural history cohort of pediatric patients with genetically confirmed MoCD Type A who were genotype-matched to the treated patients (n=18). Patients treated with NULIBRY or rcPMP had an improvement in overall survival compared to the untreated, genotype-matched, historical control group. Results were similar when comparing treated patients with all patients in the untreated natural history cohort with genetically confirmed MoCD Type A (n=37, including the 18 genotype-matched untreated patients as well as 19 additional untreated patients who were not genotype-matched).

Treatment with NULIBRY resulted in a reduction of urine concentrations of SSC in patients with MoCD Type A, and the reduction was sustained with long-term treatment over 48 months. The baseline level of urinary SSC normalized to creatinine was characterized in one patient (Study 2) with a value of 89.8 umol/mmol. Following treatment with NULIBRY in Studies 1 and 2 (n=9), the mean±SD levels of urinary SSC normalized to creatinine ranged from 11 (±8.5) to 7 (±2.4) umol/mmol from month 3 to month 48.

The safety of NULIBRY was assessed in 37 pediatric patients and healthy adults who received at least one intravenous infusion of NULIBRY or rcPMP. Of these 37 patients/healthy adults, 13 were pediatric patients with MoCD Type A in Studies 1, 2 and 3; six were pediatric patients with presumptive MoCD Type A but who were later confirmed to not have MoCD type A; and 18 were healthy adults (without MoCD Type A) in a Phase 1 study.

The most common adverse reactions from NULIBRY-treated patients in Studies 1 and 2 were catheter-related complications, pyrexia (fever), viral infection, pneumonia, otitis media (ear infection), vomiting and cough/sneezing. Adverse reactions for the rcPMP-treated patients from Study 3 were similar to the NULIBRY-treated patients, with the exception of the following additional adverse reactions that were reported in more than one patient: sepsis, oral candidiasis, varicella, fungal skin infection and eczema.

<span class=""xn-location"">NEW YORK</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">BOSTON</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">BASEL, Switzerland</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 26, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Roivant Sciences today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Silicon Therapeutics for <span class=""xn-money"">$450 million</span> in Roivant equity, with additional potential regulatory and commercial milestone payments.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Silicon Therapeutics has built a proprietary industry-leading computational physics platform for the <i>in silico</i> design and optimization of small molecule drugs for challenging disease targets. The platform includes custom methods based on quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics and statistical thermodynamics to overcome critical bottlenecks in drug discovery projects, such as predicting binding energies and conformational behavior of molecules.

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Silicon Therapeutics' computational platform is powered by a proprietary supercomputing cluster and custom hardware enabling <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3080071-1&amp;h=3997759854&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTALWNVReL-4&amp;a=accurate+all-atom+simulations"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">accurate all-atom simulations</a> at biologically meaningful timescales. This computational platform is tightly integrated with experimental laboratories equipped for biophysics, medical chemistry and biology in order to facilitate the rapid progression of drug candidates by augmenting simulations with biophysical data. The company has used these capabilities to discover multiple drug candidates.

The acquisition of Silicon Therapeutics bolsters and complements Roivant's <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3080071-1&amp;h=2644556217&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Froivant.com%2Froivant-unveils-targeted-protein-degradation-platform.html&amp;a=targeted+protein+degradation+platform"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">targeted protein degradation platform</a>. That platform will be powered by VantAI's advanced machine learning models trained on proprietary degrader-specific experimental data and by Silicon Therapeutics' proprietary computational physics capabilities, which help address many of the modality-specific challenges of degrader design and optimization. Integrating Silicon Therapeutics and VantAI will enable Roivant to distinctively capture the power of both computational physics and machine learning-based approaches to drug design; for instance, by incorporating proprietary computational physics simulations as training data for VantAI's degrader-specific deep learning models.

The combination of Silicon Therapeutics and VantAI also gives Roivant distinctive advantages in designing other types of novel small molecule drugs against difficult targets, such as allosteric inhibitors, molecular glues and high-affinity ligands.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Feb. 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and AstraZeneca today announced positive full results from the pivotal NAVIGATOR Phase 3 trial, which showed the potential of tezepelumab to be a first-in-class medicine in severe asthma. When added to standard of care (SoC), tezepelumab demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma, compared to placebo.<sup>1</sup> The results were presented at the American Academy of Asthma Allergy &amp; Immunology Annual Meeting. NAVIGATOR is a pivotal Phase 3 trial that will form the basis of regulatory filing.

Tezepelumab, a potential first-in-class medicine, when added to standard of care (SoC) achieved a 56% reduction (p&lt;0.001) in AAER over 52 weeks in the overall patient population, compared to placebo when added to SoC.<sup>2</sup> Tezepelumab is the only biologic to consistently and significantly reduce AAER in a broad population of severe asthma patients irrespective of the baseline eosinophil counts across Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.<sup>2-10</sup>

""We believe the full results of the NAVIGATOR trial are a breakthrough for the millions of people living with severe asthma,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""The reduction in exacerbation rates tezepelumab demonstrated, regardless of eosinophil or allergic status, is impressive. We are thrilled with these results and what they could mean for patients suffering with severe asthma.""

In a pre-specified analysis of the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microliter, tezepelumab achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 41% reduction (p&lt;0.001) in AAER.<sup>2</sup> Importantly, clinically meaningful reductions in AAER were also observed in two additional subgroups: a 39% reduction in patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 150 cells per microliter and a 70% reduction in patients with greater than or equal to 300 cells per microliter.<sup>2</sup>

Additionally, clinically meaningful reductions in AAER compared to placebo were observed in the tezepelumab-treated patients irrespective of allergy status and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level, biomarkers used by clinicians to inform treatment options.<sup>2</sup>

""These are ground-breaking results for the many patients with severe asthma who continue to face debilitating symptoms despite receiving standard of care inhaled medicines and currently approved biologics,"" said Professor Andrew Menzies-Gow, director of the Lung Division, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK, and principal investigator of the NAVIGATOR Phase 3 trial. ""Tezepelumab has the potential to transform treatment for a broad population of patients with severe asthma regardless of their type of inflammation, including those with and without an eosinophilic phenotype.""

Tezepelumab also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in every key secondary endpoint compared to placebo, including lung function measurements, asthma control, and health-related quality of life.<sup>2</sup>

There were no clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the tezepelumab and placebo groups. The most frequently reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and headache.<sup>2</sup>

Tezepelumab blocks the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cytokine that plays a key role across the spectrum of asthma inflammation.<sup>3,10</sup> NAVIGATOR is the first Phase 3 trial to show benefit in severe asthma by targeting TSLP.<sup>2</sup>

The statistically significant and clinically meaningful exacerbation rate reductions demonstrated with tezepelumab in patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microliter support the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3079709-1&amp;h=3731941004&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrazeneca.com%2Finvestor-relations%2Fstock-exchange-announcements%2F2018%2Ftezepelumab-granted-breakthrough-therapy-designation-by-us-fda-07092018.html%23modal-historic-confirmation&amp;a=U.S.+Food+and+Drug+Administration+Breakthrough+Therapy+Designation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">U.S. Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Therapy Designation</a> granted to tezepelumab in September 2018 for patients with severe asthma, without an eosinophilic phenotype.<sup>2-3 </sup>Tezepelumab is being developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Amgen (see AstraZeneca and Amgen collaboration below).

<b>About Severe Asthma
</b>Asthma is a complex and heterogeneous disease affecting an estimated 339 million people worldwide.<sup>11,12</sup> Approximately 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma.<sup>11,12</sup> Globally, there are approximately 2.5 million severe asthma patients who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible, with approximately 1 million in the U.S. Many severe asthma patients have an inadequate response to currently available biologics and oral corticosteroids and thus fail to achieve asthma control.<sup>11-13</sup> Severe, uncontrolled asthma is debilitating with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations, significant limitations on lung function and a reduced quality of life.<sup>11-13</sup> Patients with severe asthma have twice the risk of asthma-related hospitalizations.<sup>14,15 </sup>There is also a significant socio-economic burden, with these patients accounting for 50% of asthma-related costs.<sup>16</sup>

Multiple inflammatory pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma.<sup>17,18,19</sup> Eosinophilic asthma, and more broadly, T2 inflammation-driven asthma, accounts for about two-thirds of patients with severe asthma.<sup>19 </sup>These patients are typically characterized as having elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, including blood eosinophils, serum IgE and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO).<sup>20,21</sup> However, many patients do not fit the criteria for eosinophilic or allergic asthma, may have unclear or multiple drivers of inflammation, and may not qualify for or respond well to a current biologic medicine.<sup>21</sup>

<b>NAVIGATOR and the PATHFINDER Clinical Trial Program
</b>Building on the positive Phase 2b PATHWAY trial, the Phase 3 PATHFINDER program included two trials, NAVIGATOR and SOURCE.<sup>22-25 </sup>The program includes additional planned mechanistic and long-term safety trials.

NAVIGATOR is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 1,061 adults (18–80 years old) and adolescents (12–17 years old) with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were receiving treatment with medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without OCS. NAVIGATOR met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to SoC demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the AAER over 52 weeks in the overall patient population, compared to placebo added to SoC. The trial also met the primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microliter, with tezepelumab demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in AAER in that patient population. Similar reductions in AAER were observed in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 150 cells per microliter.<sup>25</sup>

SOURCE is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial for 48 weeks in adult patients with severe asthma who require continuous treatment with ICS plus long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), and chronic treatment with maintenance OCS therapy.<sup>23 </sup> In the trial, patients were randomized to receive tezepelumab 210 mg every four weeks or placebo as add-on therapy, with patients maintained on their currently prescribed ICS plus LABA, with or without other asthma controller therapy.<sup>23</sup>

Patients who participated in the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE trials were eligible to continue in DESTINATION, a Phase 3 extension trial assessing long term safety and efficacy.<sup>26</sup>

<b>About Tezepelumab
</b>Tezepelumab is an investigational, potential first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that works on the primary source of inflammation: the airway epithelium, which is the first point of contact for viruses, allergens, pollutants and other environmental insults. Specifically, tezepelumab targets and blocks thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and initiates an overreactive immune response to allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma.<sup>3,9,22</sup>

TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.<sup> 3,9</sup> Expression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.<sup>3,22</sup> Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.<sup> 3,22</sup> By working at the top of the cascade, tezepelumab helps stop inflammation at the source and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients.<sup>3,22</sup>

<b>Amgen and AstraZeneca Collaboration
</b>In 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated the 2012 collaboration agreement for tezepelumab. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement in North America, Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialize tezepelumab. Amgen will record sales in the U.S. and AstraZeneca will record sales in Canada. Outside the U.S., Amgen will record sales as collaboration revenue.

<b>Amgen Inflammation
</b>Amgen brings therapies to millions of people with inflammatory diseases, with a focus on serving unmet patient needs. For those with debilitating moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, asthma, and other chronic conditions, the suffering and needs are severe. Complex diseases of inflammation have defied simple solutions, and the breadth of inflammatory disease and the burden patients bear is not well understood.

For more than two decades, Amgen has been committed to advancing the science and the understanding around inflammation to address the unmet patient needs that exist and expanding our portfolio. We lead with science through discovery research that is disease-agnostic and biology-first, modality-second. In doing so, we have introduced and evolved novel therapies that have changed the lives of patients.

Our commitment to patients is reflected not only in where we have succeeded, but in where we have failed and opened new doors. Throughout, we have remained dedicated to the principle of leading with science, pursuing where pathways and promising discoveries in inflammation take us, and not relenting until innovative solutions for patients are found. It's a commitment that extends beyond introducing novel therapies. We are focused on improving the entire patient journey.

<b>Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
</b>This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19, or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Amgen's business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential  treatment  for  COVID-19, and  other  such  estimates  and  results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.

Amgen's results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen's products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen's research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen's business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen's business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials  for Amgen's manufacturing  activities,  the  distribution  of Amgen's products,  the commercialization of Amgen's product candidates, and Amgen's clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen's product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen's products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen's distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen's products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen's efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen's systems and Amgen's data. Amgen's stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Amgen's business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to Amgen's product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for Amgen's products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Feb. 27, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older.

This decision was based on the totality of scientific evidence, including data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study that demonstrated the vaccine was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied, and showed protection against COVID-19 related hospitalization and death, beginning 28 days after vaccination.

The terms of the EUA allow use of the vaccine while more data are gathered. The Company plans to file for a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA later in 2021.

“This milestone follows a year of incredible work by our dedicated teams and unprecedented collaboration with health leaders around the world – all of whom shared a goal of bringing a single-shot vaccine to the public,” said Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Johnson & Johnson. “We will do everything we can to help bring this pandemic to an end, in the United States and throughout the world.”

“We believe the Johnson & Johnson single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is a critical tool for fighting this global pandemic, particularly as it shows protection across countries with different variants. A vaccine that protects against COVID-19, especially against the most dire outcomes of hospitalization and death, will help ease the burden on people and the strain on health systems worldwide,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “We look forward to our continued efforts around the world as we collectively aim to change the trajectory of this global pandemic.”

Johnson & Johnson is committed to making its COVID-19 vaccine available on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The Company has begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccines to the U.S. government and expects to deliver enough single-shot vaccines by the end of March to enable the full vaccination of more than 20 million people in the U.S. The Company plans to deliver 100 million single-shot vaccines to the U.S. during the first half of 2021. The U.S. government will manage allocation and distribution of the vaccine in the U.S. This will be prioritized according to the populations identified by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines.

Johnson & Johnson also recently announced its submission of a European Conditional Marketing Authorisation Application to the European Medicines Agency as well as its filing for an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) with the World Health Organization for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In addition, rolling submissions for the single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate have been initiated in several countries worldwide.

The EUA follows a unanimous vote by the U.S. FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), on February 26, 2021.

“We are thankful for the efforts of all those who have volunteered to participate in our clinical trials, our scientists, collaborators, clinical trial sites and investigators. Through the combined commitment of everyone involved, we have been able to discover, develop and manufacture a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine to protect people around the world,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain Information
The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 single-dose vaccine is compatible with standard vaccine storage and distribution channels with ease of delivery to remote areas. The vaccine is estimated to remain stable for two years at -4°F (-20°C), and a maximum of three months at routine refrigeration at temperatures of 36-46°F (2 to 8°C). The Company will ship the vaccine using the same cold chain technologies it uses today to transport treatments for cancer, immunological disorders and other medicines. The COVID-19 vaccine should not be re-frozen if distributed at temperatures of 36°F–46°F (2°-8°C).

Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine
The Company’s COVID-19 vaccine leverages the AdVac® vaccine platform, a unique and proprietary technology that was also used to develop and manufacture Janssen’s European Commission-approved Ebola vaccine regimen and construct its investigational Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccines.

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine has not been approved or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but has been authorized by FDA through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for active immunization to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in individuals 18 years of age and older. There is no FDA-approved vaccine to prevent COVID-19.

Phase 3 ENSEMBLE Study Design
The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in individuals 18 years of age and older. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Company’s vaccine candidate in protecting against both moderate and severe COVID-19 disease, with assessment of efficacy as of day 14 and as of day 28 as co-primary endpoints. The study enrolled a total of 43,783 participants.

The trial, conducted in eight countries across three continents, includes a diverse and broad population including 34 percent of participants over age 60.

The study enrolled 44 percent of participants in the United States. Seventy-four percent of participants in the U.S. are White/Caucasian; 15 percent are Hispanic and/or Latinx; 13 percent are Black/African American; 6 percent are Asian and 1 percent are Native American.

Forty-one percent of participants in the study had comorbidities associated with an increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19.

Research and development activities for the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine, including the ENSEMBLE clinical trial and the delivery of doses for the U.S., have been funded in part with federal funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under Contract No. HHSO100201700018C, and in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Johnson & Johnson has worked with BARDA since 2015 on innovative solutions for influenza, chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear threats and emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","EU member states can utilize the positive CHMP opinion when making national decisions about use of the antibody cocktail, prior to a potential future EMA market authorization

Regeneron has collaborated with Roche to develop and manufacture the antibody cocktail; Roche is responsible ex-U.S. and has already begun distribution in the EU

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion for the company’s investigational COVID-19 antibody cocktail (casirivimab with imdevimab). The CHMP recommends that the antibody cocktail, known as REGEN-COVTM in the U.S., can be used to treat confirmed COVID-19 in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.

“Today’s endorsement by the EU’s leading scientific body for medicines helps bring our antibody cocktail one step closer to even more COVID-19 patients who could benefit from it,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “Our collaborator Roche is already in active discussions with a number of European countries following release of our data in non-hospitalized patients that showed the antibody cocktail significantly reduced virus levels within days of treatment, which was associated with significantly fewer medical visits. This is supported by preclinical data that show that our antibody cocktail effectively neutralizes emerging strains of the virus, which are becoming increasingly common in Europe and around the world.”

The CHMP recommendation provides a harmonized, European Union (EU)-level opinion on the efficacy, quality and safety of the antibody cocktail, which can be used by EU member states when making decisions on the possible use of the antibody cocktail at a national level prior to a market authorization. Under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC 726/2004, the CHMP assessed available data in non-hospitalized patients (“outpatients”) with COVID-19 as well as supportive data from other settings.

The CHMP’s review took place in parallel to the EMA’s ongoing rolling review process, which is used to speed up the formal marketing application assessment of a promising medicine during a public health emergency. Once finalized it will be the basis for an EU marketing authorization for the antibody cocktail. Regeneron, together with Roche, continues to work closely with the EMA as it undertakes its rolling review.

Regeneron is collaborating with Roche to increase global supply of the antibody cocktail. Regeneron is responsible for development and distribution of the treatment in the U.S., and Roche is primarily responsible for development and distribution outside the U.S., with the first Roche-manufactured doses already being distributed. The companies share a commitment to making the antibody cocktail available to COVID-19 patients around the globe and will support access in low- and lower-middle-income countries through drug donations to be made in partnership with public health organizations.

The development and manufacturing of REGEN-COV have been funded in part with federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

About the Antibody Cocktail

The antibody cocktail, known as REGEN-COV (casirivimab with imdevimab) in the U.S., consists of two monoclonal antibodies (also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987) and was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form the cocktail bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in Science.

In November 2020, REGEN-COV received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults, as well as in pediatric patients at least 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg, who have received positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. The clinical evidence from Regeneron’s outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as casirivimab and imdevimab have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who are seronegative and/or who have high viral load. The criteria for ‘high-risk’ patients are described in the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers. In the U.S., REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy, or for people currently using chronic oxygen therapy because of an underlying comorbidity who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19.

REGEN-COV continues to be evaluated in clinical trials in multiple settings for COVID-19: in non-hospitalized and certain hospitalized patients, including the open-label RECOVERY trial of hospitalized patients in the UK, and a trial for the prevention of COVID-19 in household contacts of infected individuals. As of February 2021, approximately 23,000 people have participated in clinical trials involving REGEN-COV. Lower doses of REGEN-COV are also being studied with the aim of increasing the number of patients who could potentially be treated if the cocktail is approved.

REGEN-COV was invented using Regeneron’s VelocImmune® technology that utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human antibodies. When Regeneron’s co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune® and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create multiple antibodies including Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza™ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn).

AUTHORIZED USE AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Authorized Emergency Use

REGEN-COV (casirivimab with imdevimab) is an investigational combination therapy and has been authorized by FDA for the emergency use described above. REGEN-COV is not FDA approved for any use and its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established for the treatment of COVID-19.

This authorized use is only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use under section 564 (b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b) (1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

Limitations of Authorized Use

— REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients:

who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR
who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR
who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity.
— Benefit of treatment with REGEN-COV has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as REGEN-COV, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

Definition of High-Risk Patients

High-risk is defined as patients who meet at least one of the following criteria:

— Have a body mass index (BMI) =35

— Have chronic kidney disease

— Have diabetes

— Have immunosuppressive disease

— Are currently receiving immunosuppressive treatment

— Are =65 years of age

— Are =55 years of age AND have

cardiovascular disease, OR
hypertension, OR
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/other chronic respiratory disease.
— Are 12 – 17 years of age AND have

BMI =85th percentile for their age and gender based on CDC growth charts, https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm,OR
sickle cell disease, OR
congenital or acquired heart disease, OR
neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy), OR
a medical-related technological dependence, for example, tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or positive pressure ventilation (not related to COVID-19), OR
asthma, reactive airway or other chronic respiratory disease that requires daily medication for control.
Warnings and Precautions:

— Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis and Infusion-Related Reactions: There is a potential for serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, with administration of REGEN-COV. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy. Infusion-related reactions have been observed with administration of REGEN-COV.

Signs and symptoms of infusion related reactions may include fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen saturation, chills, nausea, arrythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), chest pain or discomfort, weakness, altered mental status, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, dizziness, fatigue and diaphoresis. If an infusion-related reaction occurs, consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care.
— Clinical Worsening After REGEN-COV Administration: Clinical worsening of COVID-19 after administration of REGEN-COV has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty, arrythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status. Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to REGEN-COV use or were due to progression of COVID-19.

— Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19: Benefit of treatment with REGEN-COV has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as REGEN-COV, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Therefore, REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity.

Adverse Reactions:

— Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 4 (1.6%) patients in REGEN-COV 2,400 mg group, 2 (0.8%) patients in REGEN-COV 8,000 mg group and 6 (2.3%) patients in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were considered to be related to study drug. SAEs that were reported as Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were pneumonia, hyperglycemia, nausea and vomiting (2,400 mg REGEN-COV), intestinal obstruction and dyspnea (8,000 mg REGEN-COV) and COVID-19, pneumonia and hypoxia (placebo). REGEN-COV is not authorized at the 8,000 mg dose (4,000 mg casirivimab and 4,000 mg imdevimab).

— One anaphylactic reaction was reported in the clinical program. The event began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and required treatment including epinephrine. The event resolved.  Infusion-related reactions, of Grade 2 or higher severity, were reported in 4 subjects (1.5%) in the 8,000 mg (4,000 mg casirivimab and 4,000 mg imdevimab) arm. These infusion-related reactions events were moderate in severity; and include pyrexia, chills, urticaria, pruritus, abdominal pain, and flushing.  One infusion-related reaction (nausea) was reported in the placebo arm and none were reported in the 2,400 mg (1,200 mg casirivimab and 1,200 mg imdevimab) arm. In two subjects receiving the 8,000 mg dose of REGEN-COV, the infusion-related reactions (urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting) resulted in permanent discontinuation of the infusion. All events resolved.

Patient Monitoring Recommendations: Clinically monitor patients during infusion and observe patients for at least 1 hour after infusion is complete.

Use in Specific Populations:

— Pregnancy: There is currently limited clinical experience in the use of REGEN-COV in COVID-19 patients who are pregnant. REGEN-COV therapy should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.

— Nursing Mothers: There is currently no clinical experience in use of REGEN-COV in COVID-19 patients who are breastfeeding. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for REGEN-COV and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from REGEN-COV or from the underlying maternal condition.

<span class=""bw-dateline-wrapper"">PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- </span>Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approval of <i>Opdivo<sup>®</sup></i> (nivolumab) in combination with <i>Cabometyx<sup>®</sup></i> (cabozantinib) for the first-line treatment of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union (EU), will now review the CHMP recommendation.

“In recent years, we’ve seen a transformation in the renal cell carcinoma treatment landscape, with numerous advances that have helped improve outcomes for patients,” said Dana Walker, M.D., M.S.C.E., vice president, development program lead, genitourinary cancers, Bristol Myers Squibb. “Bristol Myers Squibb introduced the first immunotherapy combination to patients with renal cell carcinoma in the EU with the approval of <i>Opdivo</i> plus <i>Yervoy</i>, which has shown durable, long-term survival in the pivotal CheckMate -214 trial. Now, with the positive recommendation from the CHMP, we are one step closer to bringing another <i>Opdivo</i>-based regimen that has demonstrated superior efficacy to patients who may benefit from an immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor combination.”

The CHMP adopted the positive opinion based on results from the Phase 3 CheckMate -9ER trial, which demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to sunitinib, with consistent efficacy benefits observed across key subgroups of patients. <i>Opdivo </i>combined with <i>Cabometyx </i>was well tolerated and reflected the known safety profiles of the immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) components in first-line advanced RCC. The full data from the CheckMate -9ER trial were presented during a Presidential Symposium at the European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Congress 2020.

The novel combination of <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Cabometyx </i>was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2021. In addition, Bristol Myers Squibb and its partners have shared the CheckMate -9ER data with regulatory authorities around the world.

Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -9ER clinical trial.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -9ER</span></b>

CheckMate -9ER is an open-label, randomized, multi-national Phase 3 trial evaluating patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A total of 651 patients (23% favorable risk, 58% intermediate risk, 20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1=1%) were randomized to receive <i>Opdivo </i>plus <i>Cabometyx</i> (n=323) vs. sunitinib (n=328). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). The primary efficacy analysis is comparing the doublet combination vs. sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co and co-funded by Exelixis, Inc., Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Renal Cell Carcinoma</span></b>

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for more than 431,000 new cases and 179,000 deaths worldwide each year. RCC is approximately twice as common in men as in women, with the highest rates of the disease in North America and Europe. The five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with metastatic, or advanced, kidney cancer is 13%.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received OPDIVO monotherapy or OPDIVO in combination with YERVOY or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: <i>cardiac/vascular:</i> myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; <i>nervous system:</i> meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; <i>ocular:</i> uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; <i>gastrointestinal:</i> pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; <i>musculoskeletal and connective tissue:</i> myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; <i>endocrine:</i> hypoparathyroidism; <i>other (hematologic/immune):</i> hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

In addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in &lt;1% of patients unless otherwise specified: <i>nervous system:</i> autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; <i>cardiovascular:</i> angiopathy, temporal arteritis; <i>ocular</i>: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; <i>gastrointestinal:</i> pancreatitis (1.3%); <i>other (hematologic/immune):</i> conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis.

Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients. In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients.

In separate Phase 3 trials of YERVOY 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg monotherapy, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.9% (28/982) of patients.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>

In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.

<b>Lactation</b>

There are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose.

Xevinapant, a potent oral Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAP) antagonist, is the only medicine in its class in late-stage clinical development and has the potential to be first in class. Xevinapant is currently being investigated in the Phase III TrilynX study for previously untreated high-risk locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA SCCHN), in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and standard fractionation intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

""As a leading science and technology company, we are constantly evolving our three business sectors to ensure we are best-positioned to create sustainable value. This includes the addition of highly promising technologies, such as the in-licensing of xevinapant. This late-stage asset complements our Healthcare pipeline, which will be one of our key growth drivers in the coming years,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Stefan Oschmann</span>, Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>.

""By bringing our expertise and heritage in head and neck cancer to the development of xevinapant, we have the opportunity to explore an important new treatment option in an area of high unmet need where other approaches, including immunotherapy, have seen limited success. The promising long-term efficacy of xevinapant in the Phase II trial suggests that antagonism of IAP has the potential to be a transformative approach in this cancer,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Peter Guenter</span>, Member of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, and CEO Healthcare. ""Looking forward, we will continue to pursue opportunities to augment the in-house innovations in our oncology portfolio with new solutions for patients with cancer.""

Under the terms of the licensing agreement, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, gains exclusive rights to develop and commercialize xevinapant worldwide, including in the U.S. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, will co-fund with Debiopharm the ongoing Phase III registrational TrilynX study, a global double-blind, placebo-controlled, 700-patient randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of xevinapant vs. placebo when added to definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in cisplatin-eligible patients with high-risk LA SCCHN. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, also will initiate a second global Phase III study to evaluate xevinapant in patients with LA SCCHN who are unable to tolerate high-dose cisplatin in combination with radiotherapy. The agreement also includes development rights for preclinical follow-on compounds to xevinapant. Debiopharm will receive €188 million in upfront payments and up to €710 million in regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalty payments. The parties anticipate the closing of the transaction in early Q2 2021.

""The data for xevinapant to date show its potential to enhance the standard of care in this curative setting for head and neck cancer, addressing a significant unmet medical need for patients with this disease,"" said Bertrand Ducrey, Chief Executive Officer of Debiopharm. ""Our partner is exceptionally qualified to advance xevinapant, given their extensive knowledge in head and neck cancer and their commercial oncology capabilities around the world.""

""Locally advanced head and neck cancer is uniquely debilitating, often impairing the ability to swallow, speak and breathe. With the current standard treatments, at least half of patients will relapse, typically within the first two years. Based on the efficacy seen in the Phase II study, in which adding xevinapant to CRT cut the risk of death by half, this investigational medicine has the potential to offer a much-needed new standard of care,"" said Prof. <span class=""xn-person"">Jean Bourhis</span>, Department Head of Radio-Oncology at the University Hospital of Lausanne and lead investigator of the Phase III TrilynX study.

Previously reported results from the randomized, double-blind Phase II study showed the addition of xevinapant to standard-of-care CRT provided a statistically significant 21% point improvement in locoregional control rate at 18 months, the primary endpoint, vs. placebo and CRT in patients with high-risk LA SCCHN (54% [95% CI: 39 to 69] vs. 33% [95% CI: 20 to 48]; odds ratio 2.69 [95% CI: 1.13 to 6.42]; p=0.026). A significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was also observed vs. the control arm after a two-year follow-up period (HR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.76; p=0.0069).<sup>1</sup> At three years of follow-up, xevinapant plus CRT showed a statistically significant 51% reduction in the risk of death versus placebo plus CRT (HR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.92; p=0.0261). About two-thirds of patients in the xevinapant arm were alive at three years, compared with 51% in the control arm. Statistically significant improvements in PFS and duration of response were also sustained at three years.<sup>2</sup> Xevinapant showed a predictable and manageable safety profile without substantial additional toxicity to standard CRT.<sup>1,2</sup> Primary results of the study were published in <i>The Lancet Oncology</i>, and the three-year follow-up data were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020.

In <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2020</span>, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to xevinapant for treatment of patients with previously untreated LA SCCHN, in combination with current standard of care, platinum-based chemotherapy and standard fractionation intensity-modulated radiotherapy, based on the Phase II results.

<b>About Head and Neck Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Worldwide, head and neck cancer accounts for more than 650,000 cases and 330,000 deaths annually, making it the 6th most common cancer type.<sup>3</sup> LA SCCHN is a highly debilitating disease that can lead to impaired breathing, swallowing, and speech as it progresses.<sup>4</sup> Despite standard-of-care CRT, at least 40% to 60% of patients with LA SCCHN develop locoregional or distant relapses, which are usually detected within the first two years of treatment, underscoring the need to identify new therapeutic approaches.<sup>5</sup>

<b>About Xevinapant<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Xevinapant (Debio 1143) is a potentially first-in-class potent oral antagonist of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins). In preclinical studies, xevinapant restores sensitivity to apoptosis in cancer cells, thereby depriving them of one of their major resistance mechanisms. As the most clinically advanced IAP antagonist, xevinapant has established proof of efficacy in combination with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with high-risk locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA SCCHN), with a clinically significant and sustained clinical benefit compared with CRT alone.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for gefapixant, an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory chronic cough (RCC) or unexplained chronic cough (UCC) in adults. This application for gefapixant will be discussed at an upcoming advisory committee meeting. No date has been set yet. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, of Dec. 21, 2021.

“This submission underscores our commitment to help patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough who currently have limited treatment options,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “If approved by the FDA, gefapixant would be the first medicine approved specifically to help these patients, and we look forward to participating in the advisory committee meeting and working with the FDA as they review our application.”

The NDA is based on results from the COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 clinical trials, which are the first companion Phase 3 studies ever conducted in patients with RCC, a cough that persists despite appropriate treatment of underlying conditions, or UCC, a cough where the underlying cause cannot be identified despite a thorough evaluation. Data from COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were presented at the virtual European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2020.

<b>About the COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 Trials</b>

COUGH-1 (NCT03449134) and COUGH-2 (NCT03449147) are Phase 3 multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of gefapixant in reducing cough frequency in adult participants with refractory chronic cough (RCC) or unexplained chronic cough (UCC). A total of 2,044 participants were treated in COUGH-1 (n=730) and COUGH-2 (n=1,314). In both studies, patients were randomly selected to receive one of the following: gefapixant 45 mg twice daily, gefapixant 15 mg twice daily, or placebo. The primary efficacy outcomes measure for COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were 24-hour cough frequency at week 12 and 24-hour cough frequency at week 24, respectively, measured using an ambulatory digital audio recording device. Secondary endpoints in both trials included awake coughs per hour and percentage of participants with a greater than 1.3-point increase from baseline in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) total score. COUGH-1 had a 12-week treatment period and a 40-week extension period, while COUGH-2 had a 24-week treatment period and a 28-week extension period.

<b>About Gefapixant</b>

Gefapixant is an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. P2X3 receptors are one of the receptor types found on sensory nerve fibers, predominantly C fibers, in the airway lining. Chemical stimuli, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), can be released from airway lining cells due to airway inflammation, irritation and mechanical stress/injury. Binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 receptors on C fibers in the airway can be sensed as a signal of potential damage, creating an action potential, which may initiate coughing. The inhibition of binding of extracellular ATP to P2X3 receptors is thought to reduce sensory nerve activation and, subsequently, cough.

<b>About Chronic Cough</b>

The prevalence of chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 8 weeks) is estimated to be approximately 5% of adults in the U.S. In a subset of these cases, patients either do not respond to treatment of underlying conditions (such as asthma or gastroesophageal reflux), known as refractory chronic cough (RCC), or they have no identifiable underlying condition despite a thorough evaluation, known as unexplained chronic cough (UCC). There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of RCC or UCC.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Acquiring Diagenode further strengthens our molecular diagnostics business by expanding our international capabilities, improving our regional time-to-market, and allowing us to offer a broader, more differentiated test menu,” said Jan Verstreken, Hologic’s group president, international. “Diagenode has been a great partner since 2016, helping us develop and manufacture PCR-based assays for Panther Fusion<sup>®</sup>. Now we look forward to accelerating and broadening those efforts to benefit our customers and patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Diagenode offers more than 30 real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests that are CE-marked for the detection of bacteria, parasites and viruses involved in sexually transmitted infections, respiratory diseases, meningitis and gastroenteritis. Diagenode previously collaborated with Hologic to develop Panther Fusion assays for group B Streptococcus and Bordetella. Diagenode is also playing a leading role in epigenetics with a robust portfolio of devices, kits, reagents, antibodies and services to aid in the analysis of DNA and RNA.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are very pleased that the Diagenode team will become part of Hologic’s diagnostic business,” said Didier Allaer, Diagenode’s founder and chief executive officer. “Our businesses are highly complementary, and we are excited that Hologic’s commercial resources and leadership in molecular automation will enable us to offer our assay menu more broadly. Being part of Hologic will help scale our products to their full potential.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are excited to put our strong cash flow to work to acquire Diagenode and further strengthen our diagnostics business, which has had tremendous momentum in the United States and internationally,” said Steve MacMillan, Hologic’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The acquisition is consistent with our tuck-in M&A strategy, leverages our automation capabilities, and provides attractive growth potential. And combined with our recent purchase of Biotheranostics, it enables us to continue strengthening our base diagnostics business to accelerate growth post-COVID.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Diagenode generated more than $30 million of revenue in the last 12 months. The acquisition is expected to be approximately break-even to Hologic’s non-GAAP earnings per share through fiscal 2022, and accretive thereafter.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This press release discusses non-GAAP diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Hologic’s definition of non-GAAP diluted EPS may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Hologic defines its non-GAAP EPS presented in this press release to primarily exclude the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition- and integration-related charges, and income taxes related to such adjustments.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Non-GAAP diluted EPS adjusts for specified items that may be non-cash, or can be highly variable or difficult to predict. In the context of forward-looking statements, the non-GAAP financial measures facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of events that have occurred in the past or may occur in the future and have accounting consequences that can mask underlying operational trends, such as acquisitions, restructurings, debt extinguishment and impairments.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease Hologic’s reported results of operations, management encourages investors to review Hologic’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Future GAAP EPS may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, and may also be affected by non-recurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, which are excluded from the calculation of Hologic’s non-GAAP EPS as described in this press release.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When Hologic provides its expectations for non-GAAP EPS on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable effort because Hologic has not estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction. Nor has Hologic determined the fair value of acquired intangible assets and related annual amortization expense that would be required to provide the corresponding GAAP measure. The variability of the items that have not yet been determined may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on Hologic’s future GAAP results.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","MIAMI, March 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Veru Inc. (NASDAQ: VERU), an oncology biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the FDA agreed in an End of Phase 2 meeting, to advance VERU-111 into a Phase 3 registration clinical study based on the clinically meaningful benefits observed with VERU-111 treatment in the recently completed double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating oral, once-a-day dosing of VERU-111 versus placebo in approximately 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS. The Phase 2 trial demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in relevant endpoints, including respiratory failure, patient mortality, days in the ICU and days on mechanical ventilation. VERU-111 has the potential for two-pronged action against COVID-19 as an antiviral and an anti-inflammatory agent which is supported by positive Phase 2 clinical study results.

“We are very pleased with the outcome of the FDA meeting. FDA was extremely collaborative and thought that the clinical data from the Phase 2 were promising and suggest a potential clinically meaningful benefit for the use of VERU-111 in hospitalized high risk COVID-19 patients. Also, the FDA agreed that VERU-111 warrants further development in a Phase 3 program,” said Mitchell Steiner, M.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Veru. “Due to the urgency of the global pandemic and need for more effective treatment options for patients, we remain duty-bound to pursue this indication, even though it has not been the primary focus of Veru. We have the resources to conduct a Phase 3 trial without impacting our cancer drugs’ clinical development.”

We have met with and will seek funding from The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the US Department of Health and Human Services (BARDA) as well as other agencies to fund the estimated amount of commercial drug to supply the needs of the US population, assuming confirmatory positive Phase 3 clinical results and FDA approval.

Phase 3 Clinical Trial Design:

With a similar trial design to the completed positive Phase 2 study, the Phase 3 clinical registration trial design will evaluate daily oral doses of VERU-111 versus placebo with the primary efficacy endpoint of proportion of patients alive at Day 29. It is expected that the Phase 3 clinical trial will be conducted in approximately 400 hospitalized patients who have SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and are at high risk for ARDS at a 2:1 ratio between the VERU-111 (approximately 267 patients) and placebo (approximately 133 patients) treated groups.

The Company has enough clinical drug supply on hand to complete the Phase 3 clinical study. The Phase 3 clinical trial is expected to commence in April 2021 and clinical results are expected by the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021.

About the Phase 2 COVID-19 Clinical Trial:

Veru conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating oral, once-a-day dosing of VERU-111 18mg versus placebo in approximately 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were at high risk for ARDS. The trial was conducted in five sites across the United States. Patients hospitalized with documented evidence of COVID-19 infection and at high risk for ARDS were enrolled. Subjects received an 18mg dose of VERU-111 or placebo, as well as standard of care for 21 days or until released from hospital. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients alive without respiratory failure at Day 29.

Clinical Efficacy and Safety Results:

For the primary endpoint in a modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population, VERU-111 treatment compared to placebo had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the proportion of patients who are treatment failures (dead or alive with respiratory failure) with a 30% treatment failure rate in the placebo group (n=20) compared to 5.6% in the VERU-111 treated group (n=18) at Day 29. This represents an 81% relative reduction in the VERU-111 treatment failures and showed statistical significance with p=0.05.

For secondary endpoints: in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population, VERU-111 reduced the proportion of patients who died on study from 30% (6/20) in the placebo group to 5.3% (1/19) in the VERU-111 treated group (p=0.044). This is an 82% relative reduction in mortality in the VERU-111 treated group. In an MITT population, VERU-111 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in days in ICU (VERU-111 patients at 3.00 ± 7.16 days versus placebo 9.55 ± 11.54; p=0.04). VERU-111 reduced the days on mechanical ventilation from an average of 5.4 days in the placebo group to 1.6 days in the VERU-111 treated group. VERU-111 was tolerated with a good safety profile.

VERU-111 and Standard of Care

During the study, the standard of care included treatment with remdesivir and/or dexamethasone under an Emergency Use Authorization. The use of remdesivir and dexamethasone did not have a significant effect on patient outcomes in the study. A subgroup analysis of patients that received standard of care was conducted. There were six patients in the entire study that did not receive standard of care of either remdesivir or dexamethasone (four in the VERU-111 treated group and two in the placebo group). In patients that did not receive the standard of care, VERU-111 treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in days in ICU (VERU-111 1.43 ± 3.96 days versus placebo 8.83 ± 13.07 days; p=0.024) and days on mechanical ventilation (VERU-111 zero days versus placebo 6.00 ± 10.57 days; p=0.0427). In the VERU-111 group on standard of care, no patient required mechanical ventilation on study.

Any forward-looking statements in this release are based upon the Company’s current plans and strategies and reflect the Company’s current assessment of the risks and uncertainties related to its business and are made as of the date of this release. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this release because of new information or future events, developments or circumstances. Such forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: risks related to the development of the Company’s product portfolio, including clinical trials, regulatory approvals and time and cost to bring to market; potential delays in the timing of and results from clinical trials and studies, including potential delays in the recruitment of patients and their ability to effectively participate in such trials and studies due to COVID-19, and the risk that such results will not support marketing approval and commercialization; potential delays in the timing of any submission to the FDA and regulatory approval of products under development and the risk that disruptions at the FDA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may delay the review of submissions or approvals for new drugs; the risk of a delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA on the design of a clinical trial or in obtaining authorization to commence a clinical trial; clinical results or early data from clinical trials may not be replicated or continue to occur in additional trials or may not otherwise support further development in the specified product candidate or at all; our pursuit of a COVID-19 treatment candidate is at an early stage and we may be unable to develop a drug that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all; risks related to our commitment of financial resources and personnel to the development of a COVID-19 treatment which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs, despite uncertainties about the longevity and extent of COVID-19 as a global health concern and the possibility that as vaccines become widely distributed the need for new COVID-19 treatment candidates may be reduced or eliminated; government entities may take actions that directly or indirectly have the effect of limiting opportunities for VERU-111 as a COVID-19 treatment, including favoring other treatment alternatives or imposing price controls on COVID-19 treatments; the risk that the Company’s products may not be commercially successful; risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the nature and extent of which is highly uncertain and unpredictable; risks relating to the ability of the Company to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms when needed to fund development and operations, including our ability to secure timely grant or other funding to develop VERU-111 as a potential COVID-19 treatment; product demand and market acceptance; competition in the Company’s markets and therapeutic areas and the risk of new or existing competitors with greater resources and capabilities and new competitive product approvals and/or introductions; the risk that the Company will be affected by regulatory developments, including a reclassification of products; price erosion, both from competing products and increased government pricing pressures; manufacturing and quality control problems; compliance and regulatory matters, including costs and delays resulting from extensive governmental regulation, and effects of healthcare insurance and regulation, including reductions in reimbursement and coverage or reclassification of products; some of the Company’s products are in development and the Company may fail to successfully commercialize such products; risks related to intellectual property, including the uncertainty of obtaining patents, the effectiveness of the patents or other intellectual property protections and ability to enforce them against third parties, the uncertainty regarding patent coverages, the possibility of infringing a third party’s patents or other intellectual property rights, and licensing risks; government contracting risks, including the appropriations process and funding priorities, potential bureaucratic delays in awarding contracts, process errors, politics or other pressures, and the risk that government tenders and contracts may be subject to cancellation, delay, restructuring or substantial delayed payments; the risk that delays in orders or shipments under government tenders or the Company’s U.S. prescription business could cause significant quarter-to-quarter variations in the Company’s operating results and adversely affect its net revenues and gross profit; a governmental tender award indicates acceptance of the bidder’s price rather than an order or guarantee of the purchase of any minimum number of units, and as a result government ministries or other public sector customers may order and purchase fewer units than the full maximum tender amount or award; penalties and/or debarment for failure to satisfy tender awards; the Company’s reliance on its international partners and on the level of spending by country governments, global donors and other public health organizations in the global public sector; risks related to concentration of accounts receivable with our largest customers and the collection of those receivables; the economic and business environment and the impact of government pressures;

<p style=""font-weight: 400""><b><strong>Boucherville, February 16</strong></b>,<b><strong> 2021 </strong></b>– Sandoz Canada Inc. announced today the launch of Hyrimoz<sup>® </sup>(adalimumab injection, reference biologic drug: Humira<sup>®</sup>), which was authorized for sale in Canada by Health Canada on November 4, 2020 as one of the four Sandoz biosimilars to be authorized in Canada in the last 11 months. Hyrimoz<sup>®</sup> is indicated for the treatment of nine (9) of the twelve life-threatening or serious debilitating conditions in adults and children covered by the reference medicine*, including the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, adult Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis and adult uveitis.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">“We are very excited to bring our adalimumab biosimilar Hyrimoz<sup>®</sup> to market by building on the successful launch of Hyrimoz<sup>®</sup> in Europe in 2018 and our worldwide experience with biosimilars,” declared Karine Matteau, Vice President, Bio-Generic Hospital/Physician channel and Head of Biosimilars at Sandoz Canada. “It is an important step as we pursue our ambition to become the leading biosimilars and generics company in Canada.”</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">Hyrimoz<sup>®</sup> is a fully human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker which helps to reduce inflammation. Itis available in 40 mg/0.8 mL and 20 mg/0.4mL in single-use prefilled syringe, and in 40 mg/0.8 mL in SensoReady® Pen autoinjector designed for patients with limited dexterity.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">“Adalimumab is an important biologic therapy used by over 42,000 Canadian patients<sup>1 </sup>whose lives can be critically impacted by their conditions. Hyrimoz<sup>®</sup> will increase access to this high-quality, affordable biologic treatment for Canadian healthcare professionals and their patients,” commented Dr. Mauricio Ede, Vice President Medical and Scientific Officer. “We are also making available to patients a well-established patient support program, providing guidance with reimbursement navigation, financial assistance, administrative support, injection and nurse support services, as well as education and pharmacy support services for patients, throughout their treatment journey.”</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">‘’Biologics have revolutionized the treatment of many disabling and life-threatening conditions including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, they also contribute to the rising costs of healthcare, which limit access to these and other effective therapies. Biosimilars match their reference biologics, in term of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. They also present an opportunity to reduce costs and extend access to more IBD patients,’’ commented Dr. John K. Marshall, Professor of Medicine and Director, Division of Gastroenterology at McMaster University.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">“When treating patients with a chronic disease in dermatology, it is important to have several options available, and adalimumab remains an important choice in dermatologists’ armamentarium” said Dr. Charles Lynde, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto and Medical Director of the Lynde Institute for Dermatology and Lynderm Research. “Phase III trials have demonstrated switching patients from Humira® to Hyrimoz<sup>®</sup> can be performed safely without any loss of efficacy. With the launch of this important biosimilar, we can contribute to freeing up more resources that can be directed to patient care, thereby unlocking value for our provincial and national health systems.”</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">Sandoz Canada has successfully completed the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) negotiations for Hyrimoz<sup>®</sup>, which is the first step in securing public reimbursement. We are actively working on securing reimbursement with both private and public payers.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">“As a division of Novartis, we pride ourselves as being one company delivering both innovation and sustainability to the healthcare system in Canada. Our biosimilars portfolio in Canada currently includes six biologic medicines covering the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology and endocrinology, and we look forward to continuing to expand it as market exclusivity of more original biologics come to an end,” added Michel Robidoux, President and General Manager of Sandoz Canada.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400""><b><strong>About Biosimilars</strong></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">A biosimilar is a biologic medicine that has demonstrated it is highly similar and has no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety compared to an original-brand biologic<sup>2</sup> already authorized for sale. Biosimilars may become commercially available following the expiry of patents and data protection periods of the original-brand biologic medicine. Since 2009, Health Canada has approved 35 biosimilars.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400"">The Patented Medicines Pricing Review Board has estimated that private and public drug plans across Canada could save from CA$294 million to CA$1.136 billion by 2021 for established biosimilars available in Canada for at least two years across a portfolio of products and from CA$222 million to CA$447 million by 2023 for new biosimilars that recently entered the Canadian market<sup>4</sup>. The broader use of biosimilar medicines, including the implementation of biosimilar switching policies, can also help public and private drug plans improve their sustainability by adding new medicine listings and expanding existing medication coverage for patients.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Mitokinin, Inc., a biotechnology company developing PINK1-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, announced today that AbbVie, a leading global biopharmaceutical company, has purchased an exclusive right to acquire Mitokinin following completion of IND enabling studies on Mitokinin's lead PINK1 compound. Based on technology discovered at UCSF by Mitokinin co-founders <span class=""xn-person"">Nicholas Hertz</span> and <span class=""xn-person"">Kevan Shokat</span>, Mitokinin moved into MBC BioLabs San Francisco in <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2017</span> with Series A funding from a syndicate led by Mission BioCapital.

<strong>Biocon Biologics</strong> Ltd. (a subsidiary of Biocon Ltd.)   announced today that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the marketing authorization of their biosimilar Bevacizumab,  co-developed with Viatris, to be marketed as Abevmy<sup>®</sup> (injection bevacizumab 100mg and 400mg).  Abevmy<sup>®</sup> is a  biosimilar to Roche’s Avastin<sup>®</sup>, prescribed for all indications including metastatic colorectal carcinoma, metastatic breast cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, cervical and renal cancer as part of a specific regimen.

The decision of the European Commission (EC) is expected in May 2021, which, when approved, will grant marketing authorization in the 27 European Union (EU) member countries and European Economic Area (EEA) member states of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. For the U.K., the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency’s “reliance procedure” will be followed, and the U.K. marketing authorization can be expected shortly after the EC decision.

<strong>Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Executive Chairperson, Biocon Biologics</strong>, said: <em>“CHMP’s decision to recommend approval of our biosimilar Bevacizumab brings us a step closer to enable affordable access to this biologic therapy for cancer patients in the EU along with our partner Viatris. It is an outcome of our commitment to expand access for patients leveraging our science and global scale manufacturing for a range of biosimilars. Through bTrastuzumab and bPegfilgrastim we are already making a difference to the lives of cancer patients in several EU countries. We look forward to a final decision from the European Commission approving biosimilar Bevacizumab, which will add to our efforts in cancer care.”</em>

Abevmy, bBevacizumab, is a recombinant “humanized” monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neutralizes its biologic activity. Bevacizumab inhibits the formation of tumor vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumor growth.

Tanvex BioPharma, Inc. (TWSE: 6541) today announced results from a Phase III study
evaluating efficacy and safety of its trastuzumab biosimilar candidate, TX05, compared
with trastuzumab in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive
(HER2-positive) early breast cancer. The primary endpoint was an assessment of
pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant therapy and definitive
surgery in the per protocol population. Based on the study design, TX05 was
considered equivalent for pCR if the 95% CI of the risk ratio TX05: Herceptin was within
0.755 to 1.325.
Based on independent central review, in the per-protocol population, 48.8% of patients
achieved pCR in the TX05 arm versus 45.3% in the Herceptin group. The pCR risk ratio
was 1.0783 (95% CI, 0.9185 to 1.2659), which was entirely within the predefined
equivalence margins, demonstrating therapeutic equivalence.

The trial will be conducted in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) in 13 countries by the second half of 2022 to compare the biosimilar and its original product in terms of efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.

Eylea is a global blockbuster indicated for the treatment of patients with age-related macular degeneration and DME, and its 2019 worldwide sales amounted to 8.5 trillion won ($7.58 billion).

Celltrion started research of CT-P42, considering the original drug will go off patent in the U.S. in Nov. 2023.

Celltrion expects CT-P42 to significantly fatten its bottom line as a new growth driver alongside other investigational biosimilars including CT-P17 (Humira biosimilar), CT-P16 (Avastin), CT-P39 (Xolaire), CT-P41 (Prolia), CT-P43 (Stelara) in the pipeline.

The company aims to receive regulatory approval for at least one product every year until 2030.

Celltrion shares closed 1.61 percent down at 336,000 won ($300.11), nearly unmoved by the news on Monday.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Website-Size-2021-03-03T132909.624.jpg,Biosimilars,Celltrion,CT-P42|Aflibercept,Biosimilars|Initiates|P-III|study,publish,08-02-2021,2

<p align=""left"">RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. and RIDGEFIELD, Conn., March 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- G1 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GTHX) and Boehringer Ingelheim today announced that COSELA™ (trilaciclib) for injection is now available in the U.S. On February 12, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved COSELA to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). It is the first and only therapy designed to help protect bone marrow (myeloprotection) when administered prior to treatment with chemotherapy.</p>
“This is an exciting time for the combined G1 and Boehringer Ingelheim team as we are now able to provide COSELA, the first proactive multilineage myeloprotection therapy, to patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer,” said Soma Gupta, Chief Commercial Officer at G1 Therapeutics. “Our commitment includes ensuring excellence in support and access to COSELA; to that end, we are excited to launch the G1 to One Patient Support Program which is designed to provide access and affordability solutions to eligible patients.”

“We are proud to help bring COSELA to the physicians and their patients who are in need of options when it comes to managing ES-SCLC treatment,” said Dan Asch, Head of Commercial Oncology at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “G1’s experienced and passionate commercial and medical teams along with Boehringer Ingelheim’s seasoned oncology team are eager to engage with the community to communicate the clinical benefits of this innovative therapy.”

“Because ES-SCLC cannot be cured, the goals of treatment are increased life expectancy and improved quality of life; most patients prioritize quality of life, but clinicians have very few tools to do this,” said Jared Weiss, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC. “Chemotherapy can result in potentially debilitating side effects, many of which are hematologically driven, such as severe low white blood cell counts (neutropenia) and anemia, which can cause fatigue. Doctors accept these side effects because we lack tools to help prevent them. COSELA (trilaciclib) provides the first proactive approach to help protect against myelosuppression through a unique mechanism of action that helps proactively protect the bone marrow from damage when given prior to chemotherapy.”

Chemotherapy is an effective and important weapon against cancer. However, chemotherapy does not differentiate between healthy cells and cancer cells. It kills both, including important hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow that produce white blood cells (immune cells that help fight infection), red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues), and platelets (cells that prevent bleeding from cancer, surgeries, chronic diseases, and injuries). Chemotherapy-induced bone marrow damage, known as myelosuppression, can lead to increased risk of infection, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and other complications. Myeloprotection is a novel approach to protect HSPCs in the bone marrow from chemotherapy-induced damage. This approach can help reduce some chemotherapy-related toxicities, which helps make chemotherapy safer and more tolerable, while also reducing the need for reactive rescue interventions.

COSELA is available through the following specialty distributors: Amerisource Specialty Distribution, Oncology Supply, McKesson Plasma and Biologics, McKesson Specialty and Cardinal Specialty. COSELA is expected to be widely covered by insurance plans.

The G1 to One™ Patient Support Program offers a suite of solutions to address common access and reimbursement challenges, such as benefits verification for patient coverage and out-of-pocket costs. The program provides payor-specific guidance for prior authorizations and appeals to address patient needs; offering solutions for insurance-related delays and connecting patients, regardless of insurance type, to appropriate resources that can address high deductibles, co-pays/co-insurance, or lack of coverage when certain eligibility requirements are met. For more information, patients and providers can call G1 to One at 833-G1toONE (833-418-6663) from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM Eastern time.

<strong>About Small Cell Lung Cancer</strong>

In the U.S., approximately 30,000 small cell lung cancer patients are treated annually. SCLC, one of the two main types of lung cancer, accounts for about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. SCLC is an aggressive disease and tends to grow and spread faster than NSCLC. It is usually asymptomatic; once symptoms do appear, it often indicates that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. About 70% of people with SCLC will have cancer that has metastasized at the time they are diagnosed. The severity of symptoms usually increases with increased cancer growth and spread. From the time of diagnosis, the general five-year survival rate for people with SCLC is 6%. The five-year survival rates for limited-stage (the cancer is confined to one side of the chest) SCLC is 12% to 15%; and for extensive stage (ES; cancer has spread to the other lung and beyond), survival rates are less than 2%. Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for ES-SCLC.

<span class=""xn-location"">HAMILTON</span>, ON and <span class=""xn-location"">BOSTON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: FUSN), a clinical-stage oncology company focused on developing next-generation radiopharmaceuticals as precision medicines, today announced it has entered into an asset purchase agreement (APA) to acquire Ipsen's (Euronext: IPN; ADR; IPSEY) intellectual property and assets related to IPN-1087. IPN-1087 is a small molecule targeting neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), a protein expressed on multiple solid tumor types.  Fusion intends to use IPN-1087 to create an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical, FPI-2059, targeting solid tumors expressing NTSR1.

""The acquisition of IPN-1087 augments and further diversifies our pipeline of potent alpha-emitting radiopharmaceuticals and leverages our expertise to create targeted alpha therapies (TATs) using different classes of targeting molecules,"" said Chief Executive Officer <span class=""xn-person"">John Valliant</span>, Ph.D. ""In clinical imaging studies, IPN-1087, which targets an established tumor target, has shown uptake in multiple tumor types. Combining IPN-1087 with the power of actinium-225, an alpha-emitter, we believe FPI-2059 will precisely target and kill tumor cells, leading to a significant opportunity to advance the treatment of high unmet need diseases, such as colorectal cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).""

Under the terms of the APA, Fusion will issue to Ipsen 400,000 shares of its common stock upon closing and an additional 200,000 shares upon the achievement of a patent-related milestone. Such shares will be issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Fusion will also be obligated to pay Ipsen up to an additional €67.5 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones; low single-digit royalties on potential future net sales; and up to €350.0 million in net sales milestones, in each case, relating to products covered by the APA. Fusion will be responsible for paying to a third-party licensor up to €70.0 million in development milestone payments and mid-single to low-double-digit royalties on potential future net sales of products covered by the license agreement.

Covington &amp; Burling and <span class=""xn-person"">Goodwin Proctor</span> represented Fusion as legal advisors in the transaction. Barclays represented Ipsen as exclusive financial advisor and Hogan Lovells acted as Ipsen's legal advisor.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines worldwide, today announced that BRUKINSA<sup>®</sup> (zanubrutinib) has been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM).
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“BRUKINSA is a highly selective BTK inhibitor designed to provide deep and durable response for patients with hematologic malignancies while reducing the frequency of certain side effects. With today’s approval, we are looking forward to bringing this potentially best-in-class BTK inhibitor to Canadians affected by WM,” said Josh Neiman, Chief Commercial Officer for North America and Europe at BeiGene. “We are committed to working to ensure access for patients in Canada and to making BRUKINSA available to patients in more markets worldwide.”

“WM is a rare disease with significant morbidity. BTK inhibitors have brought advancements in the treatment of WM, yet not all patients respond and intolerability due to side effects remains an issue, particularly for the elderly patient population,” said Christine Chen, M.D., Med, FRCPC, Associate Professor at University of Toronto and Clinical Investigator at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. “The ASPEN trial results underscore the potential that zanubrutinib has to provide clinical benefit with advantages in safety, offering new hope for WM patients.”

“The Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation of Canada (WMFC) is delighted with Health Canada’s approval of BRUKINSA (zanubrutinib) as a WM treatment. This marks an important step forward in providing a variety of quality options for Canadian patients. As the study results from ASPEN demonstrated, BRUKINSA presents the possibility of improved outcomes for Canadian patients,"" commented Paul Kitchen, Chair of Board at WMFC.

Following the previously granted priority review in September 2020, the Health Canada approval for BRUKINSA is based on efficacy results from the ASPEN clinical trial, a Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (NCT03053440) that evaluated BRUKINSA compared to ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) or treatment-naïve (TN) WM who harbor a MYD88 mutation (<i>MYD88<sup>MUT</sup></i>). In the ASPEN trial, BRUKINSA demonstrated numerically higher very good partial response (VGPR) rate and a favorable safety profile over ibrutinib, although the primary endpoint of statistical superiority related to deep response (VGPR or better) was not met.

As assessed by independent review committee (IRC) per adaptation of the response criteria updated at the Sixth International Workshop on Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (IWWM), the combined complete response (CR) + VGPR rate in the overall intention-to-treat (ITT) population was 28.4% with BRUKINSA (95% CI: 20, 38), compared to 19.2% with ibrutinib (95% CI: 12, 28).<sup>1</sup>

In the ASPEN trial, of the 101 patients with WM randomized and treated with BRUKINSA, four percent of patients discontinued due to adverse events, including cardiomegaly, neutropenia, plasma cell myeloma, and subdural hemorrhage. Adverse events leading to dose reduction occurred in 14% of patients, with the most common being neutropenia (3.0%) and diarrhea (2.0%).<sup>1</sup>

The overall safety profile of BRUKINSA is based on pooled data from 779 patients with B-cell malignancies treated with BRUKINSA in clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions (=10%) with BRUKINSA were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, anemia, rash, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, cough, contusion, pneumonia (grouped terms), urinary tract infection, hemorrhage (grouped terms), and hematuria. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (=2%) were pneumonia (10.0%) and hemorrhage (2.1%).<sup>1</sup>

The recommended total daily dose of BRUKINSA is 320mg. BRUKINSA is expected to be available in Canada in the coming weeks.

<b>About Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia</b>

Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia<b> </b>(WM) is a rare indolent B-cell lymphoma that occurs in less than two percent of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The disease usually affects older adults and is primarily found in the bone marrow, although lymph nodes and the spleen may be involved.<sup>2</sup> In Canada and the United States, the incidence rate of WM is about five cases per million people per year.<sup>3</sup>

<b>About the ASPEN trial</b>

The Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter ASPEN clinical trial (NCT03053440) evaluated zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in people with relapsed/refractory (R/R) or treatment-naïve (TN) Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. The primary objective was to establish superiority of zanubrutinib compared to ibrutinib as demonstrated by the proportion of people achieving complete response (CR) or very good partial response (VGPR). Secondary endpoints included major response rate, duration of response and progression-free survival, and safety, measured by incidence, timing and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. The pre-specified analysis populations for the trial included the overall population (n=201) and R/R patients (n=164). Exploratory endpoints included quality of life measures.

The study includes two cohorts, a randomized cohort (cohort 1) consisting of 201 patients with a MYD88 mutation and a non-randomized cohort (cohort 2) in which 28 patients with MYD88 wild-type (MYD88<sup>WT</sup>) received zanubrutinib because they have historically responded poorly to ibrutinib therapy.

The randomized cohort 1 enrolled 102 patients (including 83 relapsed or refractory (R/R) patients and 19 treatment-naïve (TN) patients) in the zanubrutinib arm and 99 patients (including 81 R/R patients and 18 TN patients) in the ibrutinib arm. Patients in the zanubrutinib arm were assigned to receive zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily (BID) and patients in the ibrutinib arm received 420 mg of ibrutinib once daily (QD).

Results of cohort 2 were previously presented at the 24th Congress of European Hematology Association (EHA) and showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 80.8%, a major response rate (MRR; partial response or better) of 53.8% and a VGPR rate of 23.1%.

<b>IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION FOR BRUKINSA (ZANUBRUTINIB)</b>

<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>

<b>Hemorrhage</b>

Fatal and serious hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria and hemothorax have been reported in 2% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Bleeding events of any grade, including purpura and petechiae, occurred in 50% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy.

Bleeding events have occurred in patients with and without concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Co-administration of BRUKINSA with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may further increase the risk of hemorrhage.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Discontinue BRUKINSA if intracranial hemorrhage of any grade occurs. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding BRUKINSA for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.

<b>Infections</b>

Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 23% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. The most common Grade 3 or higher infection was pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have occurred.

Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and other infections according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.

<b>Cytopenias</b>

Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (27%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and anemia (8%) based on laboratory measurements, were reported in patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy.

Monitor complete blood counts during treatment and treat using growth factor or transfusions, as needed.

<b>Second Primary Malignancies</b>

Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinoma, have occurred in 9% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of skin), reported in 6% of patients. Advise patients to use sun protection.

<b>Cardiac Arrhythmias</b>

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have occurred in 2% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, and acute infections may be at increased risk. Grade 3 or higher events were reported in 0.6% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Monitor signs and symptoms for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on findings in animals, BRUKINSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including malformations at exposures that were 5 times higher than those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking BRUKINSA and for at least 1 week after the last dose. Advise men to avoid fathering a child during treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

The most common adverse reactions in &gt; 10% of patients who received BRUKINSA were neutrophil count decreased (53%), platelet count decreased (39%), upper respiratory tract infection (38%), white blood cell count decreased (30%), hemoglobin decreased (29%), rash (25%), bruising (23%), diarrhea (20%), cough (20%), musculoskeletal pain (19%), pneumonia (18%), urinary tract infection (13%), hematuria (12%), fatigue (11%), constipation (11%), and hemorrhage (10%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (11%) and hemorrhage (5%).

Of the 118 patients with MCL treated with BRUKINSA, 8 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the trials. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was pneumonia (3.4%). One (0.8%) patient experienced an adverse reaction leading to dose reduction (hepatitis B).

<b>Drug Interactions</b>

<b>CYP3A Inhibitors:</b> When BRUKINSA is co-administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg once daily. For co-administration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg twice daily.

<b>CYP3A Inducers:</b> Avoid co-administration with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers.

<b>Specific Populations</b>

<b>Hepatic Impairment:</b> The recommended dose of BRUKINSA for patients with severe hepatic impairment is 80 mg orally twice daily.

<b>U.S. INDICATION</b>

BRUKINSA is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

<span class=""xn-location"">THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that data from a multicenter, randomized Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BLINCYTO<b><sup>® </sup></b>(blinatumomab) compared with consolidation chemotherapy before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in pediatric patients with high-risk first-relapse B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) were published in <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</i>.<sup>1</sup>

BLINCYTO demonstrated significantly prolonged event-free survival (events were defined by relapse, death, second malignancy, or failure to achieve complete remission) compared with chemotherapy. After a median of 22.4 months follow-up, 69% of patients treated with BLINCYTO were alive and event-free compared with 43% of patients treated with chemotherapy. Additionally, following treatment with BLINCYTO, 93% of patients with MRD at baseline achieved MRD negative remission compared with 24% of patients treated with chemotherapy. The 36-month overall survival (OS) estimate in the BLINCYTO group was 81.1% versus 55.8% in the chemotherapy group, and the median OS has not been met.

""Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children. Unfortunately, approximately 15% of children with high-risk B-ALL relapse after frontline chemotherapy,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David M. Reese</span>, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""There remains an urgent need for novel treatment options for these patients, and the study results support BLINCYTO as a new standard of care consolidation therapy for patients with this aggressive disease.""

In the BLINCYTO group versus the chemotherapy group, the incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was 24.1% vs. 43.1%, respectively, and the incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 57.4% vs. 82.4% respectively. No fatal adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events (AEs) in the BLINCYTO treatment arm were pyrexia (81.5%), nausea (40.7%), headache (35.2%), stomatitis (35.2%) and vomiting (29.6%).

""I am thrilled the study results demonstrated that BLINCYTO was more effective and associated with fewer and less severe toxicities compared to intensive chemotherapy,"" said study investigator, <span class=""xn-person"">Franco Locatelli</span>, M.D., PhD, Sapienza, University of <span class=""xn-location"">Rome</span>, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, <span class=""xn-location"">Rome</span>. ""Chemotherapy has been used as primary consolidation treatment for ALL patients before receiving a stem cell transplant, despite this approach being only partially effective and associated with relevant toxicity. BLINCYTO has now been shown to be a more effective and safer consolidation therapy option for children with high-risk first-relapse B-ALL.""

Results from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Phase 3 study (AALL1331) evaluating BLINCYTO in children, adolescents, and young adults with first-relapse B-ALL have also been published today in <i>JAMA</i>.<sup>2</sup> In both studies, treatment with BLINCYTO resulted in less severe toxicities and higher rates of MRD remission.

BLINCYTO, a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T cell BiTE<sup>®</sup> (bispecific T cell engager) molecule, is the first approved molecule from Amgen's BiTE immuno-oncology platform, and the first and only therapy to receive regulatory approval globally for the treatment of MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL.

<b>About the 20120215 Study<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Study 20120215 is a Phase 3 open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial evaluating event-free survival after treatment with BLINCYTO compared with standard of care consolidation chemotherapy in pediatric patients with high-risk first-relapse B-cell ALL. Study enrollment was terminated early in <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2019</span> due to encouraging efficacy in the BLINCYTO arm and was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) in accordance with a prespecified stopping rule.

<b>About BiTE<sup>®</sup> Technology<br class=""dnr"" /></b>BiTE<sup>®</sup> (bispecific T cell engager) technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform that is designed to engage patient's own T cells to any tumor-specific antigen, activating the cytotoxic potential of T cells to eliminate detectable cancer. The BiTE immuno-oncology platform has the potential to treat different tumor types through tumor-specific antigens. The BiTE platform has a goal of leading to off-the-shelf solutions, which have the potential to make innovative T cell treatment available to all providers when their patients need it. Amgen is advancing more than a dozen BiTE molecules across a broad range of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, further investigating BiTE technology with the goal of enhancing patient experience and therapeutic potential.

<b>About BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (Blinatumomab)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>BLINCYTO is a BiTE<sup>®</sup> (bispecific T-cell engager) immuno-oncology therapy that targets CD19 surface antigens on B cells.<b> </b>BiTE molecules fight cancer by helping the body's immune system detect and target malignant cells by engaging T cells (a type of white blood cell capable of killing other cells perceived as threats) to cancer cells. By bringing T cells near cancer cells, the T cells can inject toxins and trigger cancer cell death (apoptosis). BiTE immuno-oncology therapies are currently being investigated for their potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.

BLINCYTO was granted breakthrough therapy and priority review designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of:
<ul>
 	<li>relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children.</li>
 	<li>B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and children.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD response rate and hematological relapse-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.</li>
</ul>
In the European Union (EU), BLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of:
<ul>
 	<li>adults with <span class=""xn-location"">Philadelphia</span> chromosome negative CD19 positive relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).</li>
 	<li>adults with <span class=""xn-location"">Philadelphia</span> chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%.</li>
 	<li>paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</li>
</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME and NEUROLOGICAL TOXICITIES</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> and treat with corticosteroids as recommended.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Neurological toxicities, which may be severe, life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> as recommended.</b></li>
</ul>
Contraindications

BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to blinatumomab or to any component of the product formulation.

Warnings and Precautions
<ul>
 	<li>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in 15% of patients with R/R ALL and in 7% of patients with MRD-positive ALL. The median time to onset of CRS is 2 days after the start of infusion and the median time to resolution of CRS was 5 days among cases that resolved. Closely monitor and advise patients to contact their healthcare professional for signs and symptoms of serious adverse events such as fever, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased total bilirubin (TBILI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The manifestations of CRS after treatment with BLINCYTO<b><sup>®</sup></b> overlap with those of infusion reactions, capillary leak syndrome, and hemophagocytic histiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. If severe CRS occurs, interrupt BLINCYTO<b><sup>®</sup></b> until CRS resolves. Discontinue BLINCYTO<b><sup>®</sup></b> permanently if life-threatening CRS occurs. Administer corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CRS.</li>
 	<li>Neurological Toxicities: Approximately 65% of patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> in clinical trials experienced neurological toxicities. The median time to the first event was within the first 2 weeks of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment and the majority of events resolved. The most common (= 10%) manifestations of neurological toxicity were headache and tremor. Severe, life–threatening, or fatal neurological toxicities occurred in approximately 13% of patients, including encephalopathy, convulsions, speech disorders, disturbances in consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. Manifestations of neurological toxicity included cranial nerve disorders. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> as outlined in the PI.</li>
 	<li>Infections: Approximately 25% of patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> in clinical trials experienced serious infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, and catheter-site infections, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. Administer prophylactic antibiotics and employ surveillance testing as appropriate during treatment. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of infection and treat appropriately, including interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> as needed.</li>
 	<li>Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed. Preventive measures, including pretreatment nontoxic cytoreduction and on-treatment hydration, should be used during BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of TLS and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> as needed to manage these events.</li>
 	<li>Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed. Monitor appropriate laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count) during BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> infusion and interrupt BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> if prolonged neutropenia occurs.</li>
 	<li>Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Due to the possibility of neurological events, including seizures, patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> are at risk for loss of consciousness, and should be advised against driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> is being administered.</li>
 	<li>Elevated Liver Enzymes: Transient elevations in liver enzymes have been associated with BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment with a median time to onset of 3 days. In patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>, although the majority of these events were observed in the setting of CRS, some cases of elevated liver enzymes were observed outside the setting of CRS, with a median time to onset of 19 days. Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes occurred in approximately 7% of patients outside the setting of CRS and resulted in treatment discontinuation in less than 1% of patients. Monitor ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and TBILI prior to the start of and during BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment. BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment should be interrupted if transaminases rise to &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if TBILI rises to &gt; 3 times ULN.</li>
 	<li>Pancreatitis: Fatal pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> in combination with dexamethasone in clinical trials and the post-marketing setting. Evaluate patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> and dexamethasone as needed.</li>
 	<li>Leukoencephalopathy: Although the clinical significance is unknown, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>, especially in patients previously treated with cranial irradiation and antileukemic chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li>Preparation and administration errors have occurred with BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment. Follow instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration in the PI strictly to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose).</li>
 	<li>Immunization: Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment, during treatment, and until immune recovery following last cycle of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative: Serious and fatal adverse reactions including ""gasping syndrome,"" which is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations, can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs including BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (with preservative). When prescribing BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (with preservative) for pediatric patients, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (with preservative) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. Due to the addition of bacteriostatic saline, 7-day bags of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> solution for infusion with preservative contain benzyl alcohol and are not recommended for use in any patients weighing &lt; 22 kg.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Adverse Reactions</u></b>
<ul>
 	<li>The most common adverse reactions (= 20%) in clinical trial experience of patients with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL (BLAST Study) treated with BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> were pyrexia (91%), infusion-related reactions (77%), headache (39%), infections (pathogen unspecified 39%), tremor (31%), and chills (28%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 61% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (= 2%) included pyrexia, tremor, encephalopathy, aphasia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, overdose, device related infection, seizure, and staphylococcal infection.</li>
 	<li>The most common adverse reactions (= 20%) in clinical trial experience of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL (TOWER Study) treated with BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> were infections (bacterial and pathogen unspecified), pyrexia, headache, infusion-related reactions, anemia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 62% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (= 2%) included febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, sepsis, pneumonia, overdose, septic shock, CRS, bacterial sepsis, device related infection, and bacteremia.</li>
 	<li>Adverse reactions that were observed more frequently (= 10%) in the pediatric population compared to the adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL were pyrexia (80% vs. 61%), hypertension (26% vs. 8%), anemia (41% vs. 24%), infusion-related reaction (49% vs. 34%), thrombocytopenia (34% vs. 21%), leukopenia (24% vs. 11%), and weight increased (17% vs. 6%).</li>
 	<li>In pediatric patients less than 2 years old (infants), the incidence of neurologic toxicities was not significantly different than for the other age groups, but its manifestations were different; the only event terms reported were agitation, headache, insomnia, somnolence, and irritability. Infants also had an increased incidence of hypokalemia (50%) compared to other pediatric age cohorts (15-20%) or adults (17%).</li>
</ul>
Dosage and Administration Guidelines
<ul>
 	<li>BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at a constant flow rate using an infusion pump which should be programmable, lockable, non-elastomeric, and have an alarm.</li>
 	<li>It is very important that the instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration provided in the full Prescribing Information are strictly followed to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose).</li>

<b>Forward-Looking Statements<br class=""dnr"" /></b>This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19, or the Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) acquisition (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

<span class=""xn-location"">MARLBOROUGH, Mass.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 3, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Boston Scientific (NYSE: BSX) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA) to acquire the global surgical business of Lumenis LTD., a privately-held company that develops and commercializes energy-based medical solutions, for an upfront cash payment of $1.07 billion, subject to closing adjustments. BPEA will retain ownership of the Lumenis global aesthetics and ophthalmology businesses. With 2021 net sales anticipated to be approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$200 million</span>, the Lumenis surgical business includes premier laser systems, fibers and accessories used for urology and otolaryngology procedures. Foundational to its urology portfolio is the proprietary MOSES™ technology, which has demonstrated differentiated clinical outcomes and efficiency in the management of patients with kidney stones.

Worldwide, more than one in 10 adults develop kidney stones each year with up to 50 percent of patients having a repeat stone within five years of the first occurrence.<sup>[1],[2],[3],[4]  </sup>While some kidney stones may pass through the urinary tract naturally, complex or larger stones require intervention to remove them from the urinary tract. This can be done through surgery or less invasive procedures such as lithotripsy, which uses a small telescope-like device, a ureteroscope, to locate the stone and a laser to break it apart. Laser lithotripsy is a leading modality for minimally-invasive surgery of kidney and urinary stones, whether through flexible ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

""The MOSES laser technology, paired with our LithoVue™ Single-Use Digital Flexible Ureteroscope and comprehensive kidney stone management portfolio, will enable execution of our strategy for our stone franchise,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Meghan Scanlon</span>, senior vice president and president, Urology and Pelvic Health, Boston Scientific. ""With double-digit compound annual growth from 2015 to 2019, we look forward to adding the innovative Lumenis laser portfolio, talented employees and surgical laser center of excellence to our organization. The acquisition will expand our global footprint throughout <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span> and accelerate the delivery of our robust stone management offerings to more urologists – ultimately serving more patients worldwide – while also improving our top-line growth and margins.""

Boston Scientific has had a relationship with Lumenis for more than 20 years and currently sells the Lumenis urology laser portfolio in the U.S. and <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> through a distribution arrangement. Upon completion of the acquisition, Boston Scientific will sell these lasers and fibers – as well as the otolaryngology laser portfolio – to all geographies including high-growth regions like China.

""We take great pride in our heritage of innovation in surgical laser solutions which are helping millions of patients worldwide,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Tzipi Ozer-Armon</span>, chief executive officer, Lumenis. ""Notably the proprietary, patent-protected MOSES technology has revolutionized urology laser procedures by improving the clinical efficacy and efficiency for kidney stones. We are confident that Boston Scientific, as a global leader in urology, and our long-time commercial partner, is the best organization to carry this legacy forward.""

The company expects to complete the transaction in the second half 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. The impact to adjusted earnings per share is expected to be immaterial in 2021, approximately <span class=""xn-money"">two cents</span> accretive in 2022 and increasingly accretive thereafter. On a GAAP basis, the transaction is expected to be dilutive in 2021 and less dilutive or increasingly accretive thereafter, as the case may be, due to amortization expense and acquisition-related net charges.

<strong>Osaka, Japan, and New York</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> March 3</strong><strong>, 2021 – </strong>Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) and Ovid Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: OVID) (“Ovid”), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines that transform the lives of people with rare neurological diseases, today announced that Takeda has entered into an exclusive agreement under which Takeda will secure global rights at closing from Ovid to develop and commercialize the investigational medicine soticlestat (TAK-935/OV935) for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, including Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).

Discovered at Takeda’s Shonan, Japan research center, soticlestat is a potent, highly selective, first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H). Under the new exclusive agreement, all global rights to soticlestat have been secured by Takeda from Ovid. Takeda will assume sole responsibility for further worldwide development and commercialization, and Ovid will no longer have any financial obligation to Takeda under the original collaboration agreement, including for milestone payments or any future development and commercialization costs. Ovid will receive an upfront payment of $196 million at closing and is eligible to receive up to an additional $660 million upon achieving development, regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, Ovid will receive tiered royalties beginning in the low double-digits and up to 20 percent on sales of soticlestat, if approved and commercialized. The new agreement is expected to close by end of March 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

“I would like to thank Ovid for their thoughtful and productive collaboration. Together we generated positive Phase 2 ELEKTRA study data, and as a result, soticlestat is poised to enter two pivotal trials,” said Andy Plump, M.D., Ph.D., President of Research and Development at Takeda. “Our work together demonstrates the strength of Takeda’s partnership model and our commitment to delivering transformative medicines to patients with neurological diseases.”

Under the 2017 collaboration agreement, Takeda received equity in Ovid and was eligible to receive up to $85 million in payments for regulatory milestones, including the initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials. Ovid led global development of soticlestat through the successful demonstration of proof-of-concept in multiple rare epilepsies.

“This new agreement is a positive outcome for patients, for Ovid and for Takeda. Jointly, we have set the stage, optimized the program and enabled it to accelerate,” said Jeremy Levin, DPhil, MB, BChir, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ovid Therapeutics. “Ovid may benefit significantly, but without the obligation to commit the substantial capital needed over the coming years as soticlestat completes pivotal trials and, if successful, enters the global market. Importantly, with the resources this agreement delivers, Ovid is strategically and financially positioned well into the future. We will advance and enrich our pipeline while continuing to build a leading company in rare diseases of the brain. We would like to thank Takeda, who has been a superb partner, and we look forward to further successes for this program in the future.”

“Soticlestat has emerged as an important late-stage molecule in our portfolio, which focuses predominantly on rare neurological and neuromuscular diseases with great unmet need,” said Sarah Sheikh, M.D., M.Sc., MRCP, Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. “We are working diligently and expediently to initiate and execute upon the Phase 3 studies in children and young adults with DS and LGS. Our goal is to one day bring new treatment options that provide greater seizure control, tolerability and function to DS and LGS patients around the world.”
<h4>Advancing New Treatment Options for DS and LGS Patients</h4>
Takeda and Ovid reported results from the <a href=""https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2020/phase-2-elektra-study-of-soticlestat-tak-935ov935-meets-primary-endpoint-reducing-seizure-frequency-in-children-with-dravet-syndrome-or-lennox-gastaut-syndrome/"">Phase 2 ELEKTRA study</a> in August 2020, in which soticlestat met its primary endpoint of reducing seizure frequency in pediatric patients with DS or LGS. Takeda intends to initiate Phase 3 studies of soticlestat in children and young adults with DS and LGS in calendar year Q2 2021.
<h4>About Soticlestat (TAK-935/OV935)</h4>
Soticlestat is a potent, highly selective, first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), with the potential to reduce seizure susceptibility and improve seizure control. CH24H is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it converts cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC) to adjust the homeostatic balance of brain cholesterol. 24HC is a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor and modulates glutamatergic signaling associated with epilepsy. Glutamate is one of the main neurotransmitters in the brain and has been shown to play a role in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. Recent literature indicates that CH24H is involved in over-activation of the glutamatergic pathway through modulation of the NMDA channel and that increased expression of CH24H can disrupt the reuptake of glutamate by astrocytes, resulting in epileptogenesis and neurotoxicity. Inhibition of CH24H by soticlestat reduces the neuronal levels of 24HC and may improve distorted excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain.
<h4>About Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome</h4>
Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are types of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), a heterogeneous group of rare epilepsy syndromes. Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome typically become apparent during infancy or early childhood and are highly refractory to many antiseizure medications.

Dravet syndrome is most commonly caused by a genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene and affects approximately 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 21,000 people in the United States. Dravet syndrome is characterized by prolonged focal seizures that can evolve to convulsive tonic-clonic seizures. Children with Dravet syndrome experience developmental disabilities as seizures increase. Other common symptoms include changes in appetite, difficulty balancing and a crouched gait when walking.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 11,000 people in the United States. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a heterogeneous condition and characterized by several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic (drop), tonic and atypical absence seizures. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, but in some cases no cause can be identified.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pfizer Inc.’s (NYSE: PFE) supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for LORBRENA<sup>®</sup> (lorlatinib), expanding the indication to include first-line treatment of people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LORBRENA is now indicated for adults with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ALK-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test. The FDA action also converts the 2018 accelerated approval to full approval. The application was approved under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“For more than a decade, Pfizer has been a pioneer in delivering biomarker-driven therapies and addressing the diverse and evolving needs of people with non-small cell lung cancer,” said Andy Schmeltz, Global President, Pfizer Oncology. “LORBRENA has been a transformative medicine for people with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, and this FDA approval in the first-line setting means that we can now extend hope to even more people.”

LORBRENA is a third-generation ALK inhibitor specifically designed to inhibit the most common tumor mutations that drive resistance to current medications and to address metastases in the brain, a frequent site for disease progression in ALK-positive NSCLC. Up to 40% of people with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC present with brain metastases at initial diagnosis.<sup>1,2,3</sup>

The expanded approval of LORBRENA is based on the results from the pivotal Phase 3 CROWN trial, which showed a 72% reduction in risk of progression or death vs. XALKORI<sup>®</sup> (crizotinib) in a previously untreated patient population (HR 0.28: 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.41; p&lt;0.0001) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement was assessed in all patients. There were 17 patients in the LORBRENA arm and 13 in the XALKORI arm with measurable brain metastases based on baseline brain imaging. A prespecified exploratory analysis showed that among these patients, the intracranial objective response rate (IC-ORR), as assessed by BICR, was 82% (95% CI, 57 to 96) in the LORBRENA arm and 23% (95% CI, 5 to 54) in the XALKORI arm. The intracranial duration of response (IC-DOR) was 12 months or longer in 79% (n=11) and 0% of patients in the LORBRENA and XALKORI arms, respectively.

The most common adverse events (AEs) of any Grade and Grade 3-4 worsening laboratory abnormalities occurring in =20% of people treated with LORBRENA were edema (56%), weight gain (38%), peripheral neuropathy (35%), cognitive effects (21%), diarrhea (21%), dyspnea (20%), and hypertriglyceridemia (22%). Serious AEs occurred in 34% of people treated with LORBRENA; the most frequently reported serious AEs were pneumonia (4.7%), dyspnea (2.7%), respiratory failure (2.7%), cognitive effects (2.0%), and pyrexia (2.0%). Fatal AEs occurred in 3.4% of people treated with LORBRENA and included pneumonia (0.7%), respiratory failure (0.7%), cardiac failure acute (0.7%), pulmonary embolism (0.7%), and sudden death (0.7%). Permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA due to AEs occurred in 6.7% of people. AEs leading to dose interruptions and dose reductions occurred in 49% and 21% of people treated with LORBRENA, respectively. Detailed results from the CROWN study were published in the November 2020 issue of the <span class=""bwuline""><i><a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2027187%3Fquery%3Dfeatured_home&amp;esheet=52390493&amp;newsitemid=20210303006042&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&amp;index=1&amp;md5=d1459afa75922df6b5102e656b881333"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">New England Journal of Medicine</a></i></span>.

“The CROWN data have shown LORBRENA can significantly improve outcomes in the first-line treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer, including those that present with brain metastases,” said Benjamin Solomon, M.D., Department of Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. “This approval is meaningful for my patients because we now have a highly effective treatment option that can delay the progression of a typically aggressive disease.”

In 2018, the FDA approved LORBRENA for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed on crizotinib and at least one other ALK inhibitor for metastatic disease; or whose disease has progressed on alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK inhibitor therapy for metastatic disease. This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Based on the CROWN data, the FDA has also converted the accelerated approval to full approval.

This sNDA was also reviewed by the FDA under Project ORBIS, an initiative introduced in 2019, which provides a framework for potential concurrent submissions and collaborative review with health authorities in Canada, Singapore, Switzerland, Australia, Brazil and the United Kingdom. Under Project ORBIS, collaboration among international regulators may allow people with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries. The European Medicines Agency is also reviewing a Type II variation application for LORBRENA in the first line indication.

<b>About the CROWN Trial</b>

CROWN is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel 2-arm trial in which 296 people with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to receive LORBRENA monotherapy (n=149) or XALKORI monotherapy (n=147). Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and ALK-positive NSCLC as identified by the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx assay. The primary endpoint of the CROWN trial is PFS based on BICR. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and tumor assessment related data by BICR, including ORR, and DOR. In patients with measurable CNS metastases at baseline, additional outcome measures were IC-ORR and IC-DOR by BICR.

<b>About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</b>

Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related death around the world.<sup>4</sup> NSCLC accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers,<sup>5</sup> with ALK-positive tumors occurring in about 3-5% of NSCLC cases.<sup>6</sup> In 2020, an estimated 228,820 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in the U.S.<sup>7</sup>

<b>About LORBRENA<sup>® </sup>(lorlatinib)</b>

LORBRENA is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has been shown to be highly active in preclinical lung cancer models harboring chromosomal rearrangements of ALK. LORBRENA was specifically developed to inhibit tumor mutations that drive resistance to other ALK inhibitors and to penetrate the blood brain barrier.

LORBRENA is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ALK-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test.

<b>IMPORTANT LORBRENA<sup>® </sup>(lorlatinib) SAFETY INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION</b>

<b>Contraindications: </b>LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers, due to the potential for serious hepatotoxicity.

<b>Risk of Serious Hepatotoxicity with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inducers: </b>Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in 10 of 12 healthy subjects receiving a single dose of LORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. Grade 4 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 50% of subjects, Grade 3 in 33% of subjects, and Grade 2 in 8% of subjects. ALT or AST elevations occurred within 3 days and returned to within normal limits after a median of 15 days (7 to 34 days); median time to recovery in subjects with Grade 3 or 4 or Grade 2 ALT or AST elevations was 18 days and 7 days, respectively. LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers. Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA.

<b>Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: </b>A broad spectrum of CNS effects can occur; overall, CNS effects occurred in 52% of the 476 patients receiving LORBRENA. These included seizures (1.9%, sometimes in conjunction with other neurologic findings), psychotic effects (7%; 0.6% severe [Grade 3 or 4]), and changes in cognitive function (28%; 2.9% severe), mood (including suicidal ideation) (21%; 1.7% severe), speech (11%; 0.6% severe), mental status (1.3%; 1.1% severe), and sleep (12%). Median time to first onset of any CNS effect was 1.4 months (1 day to 3.4 years). Overall, 2.1% and 10% of patients required permanent or temporary discontinuation of LORBRENA, respectively, for a CNS effect; 8% required dose reduction. Withhold and resume at same or reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity.

<b>Hyperlipidemia: </b>Increases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides can occur. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in total cholesterol occurred in 18% and Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides occurred in 19% of the 476 patients who received LORBRENA. Median time to onset was 15 days for both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Approximately 4% and 7% of patients required temporary discontinuation and 1% and 3% of patients required dose reduction of LORBRENA for elevations in cholesterol and in triglycerides in Study B7461001 and Study B7461006, respectively. Eighty-three percent of patients required initiation of lipid-lowering medications, with a median time to onset of start of such medications of 17 days. Initiate or increase the dose of lipid lowering agents in patients with hyperlipidemia. Monitor serum cholesterol and triglycerides before initiating LORBRENA, 1 and 2 months after initiating LORBRENA, and periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at same dose for the first occurrence; resume at same or reduced dose of LORBRENA for recurrence based on severity.

<b>Atrioventricular (AV) Block: </b>PR interval prolongation and AV block can occur. In 476 patients who received LORBRENA at a dose of 100 mg orally once daily and who had a baseline electrocardiography (ECG), 1.9% experienced AV block and 0.2% experienced Grade 3 AV block and underwent pacemaker placement. Monitor ECG prior to initiating LORBRENA and periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at reduced or same dose in patients who undergo pacemaker placement. Permanently discontinue for recurrence in patients without a pacemaker.

<b>Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: </b>Severe or life-threatening pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with ILD/pneumonitis can occur. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.9% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients. Four patients (0.8%) discontinued LORBRENA for ILD/pneumonitis. Promptly investigate for ILD/pneumonitis in any patient who presents with worsening of respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever). Immediately withhold LORBRENA in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue LORBRENA for treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis of any severity.

<b>Hypertension:</b> Hypertension can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA. Hypertension occurred in 13% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 in 6% of patients. Median time to onset of hypertension was 6.4 months (1 day to 2.8 years). 2.3% of patients temporarily discontinued LORBRENA for hypertension. Control blood pressure prior to initiating LORBRENA. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter. Withhold and resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity.

<b>Hyperglycemia:</b> Hyperglycemia can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA. Hyperglycemia occurred in 9% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 in 3.2% of patients. Median time to onset of hyperglycemia was 4.8 months (1 day to 2.9 years). 0.8% of patients temporarily discontinued LORBRENA for hyperglycemia. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiating LORBRENA and monitor periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity.

<b>Embryo-fetal Toxicity: </b>LORBRENA can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception, since LORBRENA can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment with LORBRENA and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for 3 months after the final dose.

<b>Adverse Reactions: </b>In the pooled safety population of 476 patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily, the most frequent (= 20%) adverse reactions were edema (56%), peripheral neuropathy (44%), weight gain (31%), cognitive effects (28%), fatigue (27%), dyspnea (27%), arthralgia (24%), diarrhea (23%), mood effects (21%), and cough (21%). The most frequent (= 20%) laboratory abnormalities in patients receiving LORBRENA were hypercholesterolemia (21%) and hypertriglyceridemia (21%).

In previously untreated patients, serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of the 149 patients treated with LORBRENA; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.7%), dyspnea (2.7%), respiratory failure (2.7%), cognitive effects (2.0%), and pyrexia (2.0%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.4% of patients and included pneumonia (0.7%), respiratory failure (0.7%), cardiac failure acute (0.7%), pulmonary embolism (0.7%), and sudden death (0.7%). In previously treated patients, serious adverse reactions occurred in 32% of the 295 patients; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (3.4%), dyspnea (2.7%), pyrexia (2%), mental status changes (1.4%), and respiratory failure (1.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.7% of patients and included pneumonia (0.7%), myocardial infarction (0.7%), acute pulmonary edema (0.3%), embolism (0.3%), peripheral artery occlusion (0.3%), and respiratory distress (0.3%).

<b>Drug Interactions: </b>LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers. Avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inducers, strong CYP3A inhibitors, and fluconazole. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, increase the LORBRENA dose as recommended. If concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor or fluconazole cannot be avoided, reduce the LORBRENA dose as recommended. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with CYP3A substrates and P-gp substrates, which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates.

<b>Lactation: </b>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, instruct women not to breastfeed during treatment with LORBRENA and for 7 days after the final dose.

<b>Hepatic Impairment: </b>No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. The recommended dose of LORBRENA has not been established for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

<b>Renal Impairment: </b>Reduce the dose of LORBRENA for patients with severe renal impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent<sup>®</sup> (dupilumab) as an add-on treatment for children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Dupixent is currently approved as an add-on treatment for patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma aged 12 and older with elevated eosinophils or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 21, 2021 and the European Union (EU) regulatory submission for children aged 6 to 11 years with asthma is planned for Q1 2021.

In the U.S., there are approximately 75,000 children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma, which can carry a significant burden for children and their families. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, these children can still experience coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. They are also at risk for life-threatening severe asthma attacks that can lead to hospitalization and emergency room visits, and may require the use of systemic corticosteroids which carry significant risks when used long term. Uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma can impair lung function, and can interfere with day-to-day activities, like sleeping, attending school and playing sports.

In the trial, Dupixent significantly reduced severe asthma attacks and rapidly improved lung function within two weeks in children aged 6 to 11 years. Safety results were generally consistent with the well-established safety profile of Dupixent in the approved indication for patients aged 12 and older with moderate-to-severe asthma. Adverse events in the Phase 3 trial that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included injection site reactions, viral upper respiratory tract infections and eosinophilia. Detailed results from this Phase 3 trial will be published later this year.

Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. It was invented using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> technology. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esophagitis.

<b>About Dupixent</b><b>
</b>Dupixent is approved in the U.S. to treat patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies; for use with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in patients aged 12 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of CRSwNP in adults whose disease is not controlled.

Outside of the U.S., Dupixent is approved for specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma in a number of other countries around the world, including those in the EU and Japan. Dupixent is also approved in the EU and Japan to treat certain adults with severe CRSwNP. Across all approved indications globally, more than 200,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent.

Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age, Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver.

<b>About Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> Technology
</b>Dupixent was invented using Regeneron's <i>VelocImmune </i>technology that utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3086376-1&amp;h=3433339106&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&amp;a=envision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">envision</a> making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing <i>VelocImmune</i> and related <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used <i>VelocImmune</i> technology to create multiple antibodies including Libtayo<sup>®</sup> (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent<sup>®</sup> (alirocumab), Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab), Evkeeza<sup>™</sup> (evinacumab-dgnb), Inmazeb<sup>™ </sup>(atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn).

<b>Dupilumab Development Program
</b>To date, dupilumab has been studied in more than 10,000 patients across 50 clinical trials in various chronic diseases driven by type 2 inflammation.

In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including pediatric asthma (6 to 11 years of age, Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3) and food allergies (Phase 2). These potential uses are under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

<b>U.S. I</b><b>NDICATIONS</b>

DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>to treat people aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age.</li>
 	<li>with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in people aged 12 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 12 years of age.</li>

<p align=""justify"">SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 03, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tempest Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical-stage oncology company developing first-in-class therapeutics that combine both precision and immune-mediated mechanisms, today announced a clinical collaboration agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. The collaboration will evaluate TPST-1120, Tempest’s small molecule PPAR? antagonist, in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) and bevacizumab (Avastin®) in previously untreated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are thrilled to work with Roche to accelerate the TPST-1120 program by evaluating this molecule in a targeted front-line clinical setting,” said Stephen Brady, president and chief operating officer of Tempest. “TPST-1120’s mechanism of action makes it specifically well-suited to combine with both PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors and anti-angiogenesis agents. This strong scientific rationale, coupled with the observed clinical safety profile and early signals of clinical benefit in treated patients, makes us hopeful that this triplet approach will offer HCC patients meaningful benefit.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">TPST-1120 will be evaluated in a global randomized phase 1b/2 clinical study in combination with the standard-of-care first-line regimen of atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic HCC not previously treated with systemic therapy. Up to 60 patients will receive the TPST-1120 combination and will be compared to the standard-of-care atezolizumab and bevacizumab regimen with primary objectives of anti-tumor activity and safety. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Roche will manage the study operations for this global multicenter trial. Tempest will retain global development and commercialization rights to TPST-1120.</p>
<strong>About TPST-1120</strong>
<p align=""justify"">TPST-1120 is a first-in-class selective PPAR? antagonist with a two-pronged mechanism designed to target both tumor cells directly and suppressive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Both types of targeted cells are dependent on fatty acid metabolism, which is regulated by the PPAR? transcription factor. In extensive non-clinical studies, TPST-1120 as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs resulted in significant reductions in tumor growth and stimulation of durable anti-tumor immunity. In an ongoing phase 1 clinical trial, TPST-1120 has been well-tolerated by patients with advanced cancers as monotherapy and in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and has demonstrated early signs of tumor reduction and control, as well as biomarker modulation.</p>
<strong>About Hepatocellular Carcinoma</strong>
<p align=""justify"">HCC is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Every year, more than 815,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HCC, with the majority of cases in Asia and almost half of all cases in China. In the US, the number of liver cancer cases have more than tripled since 1980 and HCC represents the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related death, while in Europe, liver cancer is also on the rise. HCC develops predominantly in people with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis (B or C) or alcohol consumption, and typically presents at an advanced stage. The prognosis for unresectable HCC remains poor, with few systemic therapeutic options and a 1-year survival rate of less than 50% following diagnosis.</p>
<strong>About Tempest Therapeutics</strong>
<p align=""justify"">Tempest Therapeutics is a clinical-stage oncology company advancing small molecules that combine both precision and immune-mediated mechanisms with the potential to target a wide range of tumors. The company’s two novel clinical programs are TPST-1495 and TPST-1120, antagonists of EP2/EP4 and PPARa, respectively. Both TPST-1495 and TPST-1120 are advancing through Phase 1 studies designed to study both agents as monotherapies and in combination with other approved agents. Tempest is also developing an inhibitor of TREX-1, an exonuclease with enhanced expression in tumors that suppresses activation of the cGAS/STING pathway by degrading cytosolic DNA. Oral delivery of a TREX-1 small molecule inhibitor is intended to selectively activate STING in tumors, leading to anti-tumor immunity.

<p align=""justify"">SAN FRANCISCO and LONDON, March 03, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today provided an update on the VIR-7831 (GSK4182136) arm of the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) Program Phase 3 clinical trial. The companies were informed that while VIR-7831 met initial pre-specified criteria to continue to the next phase of the ACTIV-3 trial and there were no reported safety signals, sensitivity analyses of the available data raised concerns about the magnitude of potential benefit. The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has recommended that the VIR-7831 arm of the trial be closed to enrollment while the data mature. The companies will continue discussions with the NIH about appropriate ways to further assess the potential of VIR-7831 in the hospitalized population as all parties gain a fuller understanding of the still-emerging data.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The DSMB recommendation was based on a routine, pre-planned safety and efficacy data review of the first 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 enrolled in ACTIV-3.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>George Scangos, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Vir</strong>, <strong>said:</strong> “While we are disappointed with the recommendation of the DSMB, we are encouraged by the safety profile of VIR-7831 and by the possibility of a benefit on top of remdesivir and corticosteroids in this advanced cohort of patients. We want to thank NIH for their work to assess the benefits of VIR-7831 and other agents, and look forward to working with them to further understand the potential of VIR-7831 to provide a benefit in this population. In addition, we are eagerly anticipating the upcoming data from the Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial in newly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients at high risk of hospitalization.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Christopher Corsico, Senior Vice President Development, GSK, said:</strong> “We want to thank the patients who participated in this study and the NIH for investing in the ACTIV trial to evaluate the four monoclonal antibodies, as it recognizes the need for differentiated treatments, especially as new variants emerge globally. These and other anticipated data will provide valuable insights about how VIR-7831 can contribute to the fight against this pandemic.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">VIR-7831 is an investigational, dual-action monoclonal antibody that has been shown in preclinical trials to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells, which may protect patients from disease progression.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The antibody has also shown the ability to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 live virus by binding to a highly conserved epitope of the spike protein, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. So far, the variants of concern, including the UK, South African and Brazilian variants, do not overlap with the VIR-7831 targeted epitope of the virus, and, therefore, VIR and GSK believe that it should maintain full activity against these strains.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In addition to the ACTIV-3 trial, VIR-7831 is also being evaluated in the outpatient setting in the following clinical trials:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>COMET-ICE </strong>(COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial – Intent to Care Early): A Phase 3 trial to evaluate VIR-7831 for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalization or death.</li>
 	<li><strong>BLAZE-4 </strong>(sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company): A Phase 2 trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Eli Lilly’s bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) alone and bamlanivimab with other neutralizing antibodies, including VIR-7831, versus placebo in low-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">Additionally, VIR-7831, along with VIR-7832, will be evaluated in the Phase 1b/2a National Health Service-supported AGILE trial in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. VIR-7832 is the second monoclonal antibody from the Vir-GSK collaboration to be investigated as a potential COVID-19 treatment.</p>
<p align=""justify"">VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 are investigational compounds, not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other regulatory authority.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About VIR-7831 / GSK4182136
</strong>VIR-7831 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7831, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ technology, also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About VIR-7832 / </strong><strong>GSK4182137
</strong>VIR-7832 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and an enhanced ability to clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7832, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend and other Fc technologies, has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life. Importantly, VIR-7832 also has been engineered to potentially enhance virus-specific T cell function, which could help treat and/or prevent COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Vir and GSK Collaboration
</strong>In April 2020, Vir and GSK entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The collaboration uses Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<strong>GSK commitment to tackling COVID-19
</strong>GSK’s response to COVID-19 has been one of the broadest in the industry, with two potential treatments in addition to our vaccine candidates in development.
<p align=""justify"">GSK is collaborating with several organizations on COVID-19 vaccines by providing access to our adjuvant technology. In addition to work with Sanofi, our collaboration with Medicago on an adjuvanted, protein-based vaccine candidate is now in late-stage clinical trials. An earlier stage collaboration with SK Bioscience is also ongoing, with funding from CEPI and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to develop differentiated, affordable COVID-19 vaccines for supply globally through the COVAX facility. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced, contributing to protecting more people.</p>
<p align=""justify"">GSK is also working with mRNA specialist, CureVac, to jointly develop next generation, multi-valent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine. GSK will also support manufacturing of up to 100m doses of CureVac’s first generation COVID-19 vaccine, if approved.</p>
<p align=""justify"">GSK is also exploring potential therapeutic or treatment options for COVID-19 patients. We are collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to develop existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 4, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Five Prime Therapeutics (NASDAQ: FPRX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing immuno-oncology and targeted cancer therapies, today announced an agreement under which Amgen will acquire Five Prime Therapeutics for <span class=""xn-money"">$38.00</span> per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$1.9 billion</span>. This acquisition adds Five Prime's innovative pipeline to Amgen's leading oncology portfolio.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">
<ul>
 	<li>Five Prime's lead asset, bemarituzumab, is a first-in-class, Phase 3 ready anti-FGFR2b antibody with positive data from a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in frontline advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. Bemarituzumab targets FGFR2b, which has been found to be overexpressed in approximately 30% of patients with non-HER2 positive gastric cancer, as well as other solid tumors.</li>
 	<li>The bemarituzumab Phase 2 FIGHT trial demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) in the frontline treatment of patients with advanced gastric or GEJ cancer. Additional analysis showed a positive correlation between efficacy and expression of FGFR2b on tumor cells, confirming both the importance of the FGFR2b target and the activity of bemarituzumab against this target.</li>
 	<li>This correlation suggests that FGFR2b could play a role in other epithelial cancers, including lung, breast, ovarian and other cancers.</li>
 	<li>The acquisition of Five Prime also supports Amgen's international expansion strategy. Gastric cancer is one of the world's most common forms of cancer and is particularly prevalent in the <span class=""xn-location"">Asia-Pacific</span> region, where Amgen expects to generate significant volume growth in the coming years. Amgen plans to leverage its presence in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> and other <span class=""xn-location"">Asia-Pacific</span> markets to maximize bemarituzumab's potential. In addition, as part of this transaction, Amgen will receive a royalty percentage on future net sales in <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span> ranging from the high teens to the low twenties from a pre-existing co-development and commercialization agreement between Five Prime and <span class=""xn-person"">Zai Lab</span> (<span class=""xn-location"">Shanghai</span>) Co., Ltd.</li>
 	<li>Five Prime's additional innovative pipeline programs complement Amgen's efforts to bring meaningful therapies to oncology patients.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

<b>About FGFR2b<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway is implicated in the development and growth of cancer cells. FGFR2b is a splice variant of FGFR2 which can be found in tumors of epithelial origin. Data from the FIGHT trial suggests that approximately 30 percent of patients with non-HER2 positive gastroesophageal cancers overexpress FGFR2b.<sup>1</sup> FGFR2b has also been shown to be overexpressed in numerous other cancers, including lung, breast, ovarian and other cancers.

<b>About Bemarituzumab<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Bemarituzumab (anti-FGFR2b) is a first-in-class targeted antibody that blocks fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) from binding and activating FGFR2b, inhibiting several downstream pro-tumor signaling pathways and potentially slowing cancer progression. Five Prime Therapeutics granted an exclusive license to Zai Lab Limited to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab in <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>, and <span class=""xn-person"">Zai Lab</span> collaborated with Five Prime Therapeutics on the Phase 2 FIGHT trial in <span class=""xn-location"">Greater China</span>.

<b>About the FIGHT Trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The FIGHT study was a randomized, placebo controlled trial that evaluated bemarituzumab plus chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6) versus placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with fibroblast growth factor receptor <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span>-positive (FGFR2b+), non HER2 positive frontline advanced gastric or GEJ cancer. The trial enrolled 155 patients in 15 countries across Asia, the European Union, and the United States, with 77 patients randomized to the bemarituzumab arm and 78 patients to the placebo arm.

<b>About Gastric Cancer and GEJ Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide and, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with over 1,000,000 new cases diagnosed each year.<sup>2</sup> For HER2 negative patients, frontline therapy available today is the same systemic chemotherapy available since the 1990s.<sup>3,4</sup>

INDIANAPOLIS, March 4, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Tirzepatide led to superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline across all three doses compared to injectable semaglutide 1 mg in adults with type 2 diabetes in Eli Lilly and Company's (NYSE: LLY) 40-week SURPASS-2 clinical trial. In topline results from the largest SURPASS trial to date, using the efficacy estimand<sup>i</sup>, the highest dose of tirzepatide (15 mg) reduced A1C by 2.46 percent and body weight by 12.4 kg (27.3 lb., 13.1 percent). The lowest dose of tirzepatide (5 mg) reduced A1C by 2.09 percent and body weight by 7.8 kg (17.2 lb., 8.5 percent) compared to semaglutide at 1.86 percent and 6.2 kg (13.7 lb., 6.7 percent).

Additionally, 51 percent of those taking tirzepatide 15 mg achieved an A1C of less than 5.7 percent – the level seen in people without diabetes – compared to 20 percent of those taking semaglutide. The overall safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to previously reported SURPASS trials and the well-established glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class. Across all treatment arms, the most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related.

Tirzepatide is a novel investigational once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single molecule, representing a new class of medicines being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

""Head-to-head studies are the gold standard for clinicians assessing the efficacy of investigational treatments, and these results show that all three doses of tirzepatide delivered superior A1C and weight reductions compared to the highest approved dose of semaglutide to treat type 2 diabetes,"" said Juan Pablo Frías, M.D., Medical Director, National Research Institute and Principal Investigator of SURPASS-2. ""Newer treatment options may help people with type 2 diabetes achieve their A1C and weight loss goals. In SURPASS-2, tirzepatide delivered clinically meaningful efficacy, beyond what has been seen with an existing medicine in the established GLP-1 receptor agonist class.""

SURPASS-2 was a 40-week, randomized, open-label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to semaglutide as an add-on to metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes. The study randomized 1,879 participants, who had a mean duration of diabetes of 8.6 years, a baseline A1C of 8.28 percent and a baseline weight of 93.7 kg.

Across both estimands<sup>ii</sup>, all three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) delivered superior A1C and body weight reductions compared to semaglutide. Of the participants receiving tirzepatide 15 mg, 92 percent achieved an A1C of less than 7 percent, the American Diabetes Association's recommended target for people with diabetes, compared to 81 percent of those taking semaglutide. Specifically, results showed:

In the treatment-regimen estimand<sup>iii</sup>, all three doses of tirzepatide delivered superior A1C and body weight reductions compared to semaglutide. Greater percentages of participants achieved an A1C of less than 7 percent across all three doses compared to semaglutide, with statistical significance met for 10 mg and 15 mg but not for 5 mg. Specifically, results showed:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>A1C reduction: -2.01% (5 mg), -2.24% (10 mg), -2.30% (15 mg), -1.86% (semaglutide)</li>
 	<li>Weight reduction: -7.6 kg (5 mg), -9.3 kg (10 mg), -11.2 kg (15 mg), -5.7 kg (semaglutide)</li>

</ul>
Hypoglycemia less than 54 mg/dL was reported in 0.6 percent (5 mg), 0.2 percent (10 mg) and 1.7 percent (15 mg) of participants in the tirzepatide arms and in 0.4 percent of participants in the semaglutide arm.

The most commonly reported adverse events across all treatment arms were gastrointestinal-related, including nausea (17.4 percent [5 mg], 19.2 percent [10 mg], 22.1 percent [15 mg], 17.9 percent [semaglutide]), diarrhea (13.2 percent [5 mg], 16.4 percent [10 mg], 13.8 percent [15 mg], 11.5 percent [semaglutide]) and vomiting (5.7 percent [5 mg], 8.5 percent [10 mg], 9.8 percent [15 mg], 8.3 percent [semaglutide]). Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 5.1 percent (5 mg), 7.7 percent (10 mg), 7.9 percent (15 mg) and 3.8 percent (semaglutide).

""Nearly nine in 10 people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. are overweight or have obesity, and we are committed to providing solutions that not only lead to meaningful A1C reductions but also significant weight loss to help meet their needs,"" said Mike Mason, president, Lilly Diabetes. ""These striking head-to-head results surpassed our expectations, supporting our belief in the value of all three doses of tirzepatide as potential new treatment options for people living with type 2 diabetes.

""Lilly is extremely grateful to the patients and investigators who participated in SURPASS-2, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Mason added. ""Their commitment to the diabetes community is immeasurable.""

The complete SURPASS-2 study data have not yet been evaluated but will be presented at the American Diabetes Association's<sup>®</sup> 81<sup>st</sup> Scientific Sessions<sup>®</sup> and published in a peer-reviewed publication in 2021.

<b>About tirzepatide
</b>Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that integrates the actions of both incretins into a single novel molecule. GIP is a hormone that may complement the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists. In preclinical models, GIP has been shown to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure therefore resulting in weight reductions, and when combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, may result in greater effects on glucose and body weight. Tirzepatide is in phase 3 development for blood glucose management in adults with type 2 diabetes and for chronic weight management. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

<b>About SURPASS-2 and the SURPASS clinical trial program
</b>SURPASS-2 (NCT03987919) is a 40-week, multi-center, randomized, parallel, open-label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg to semaglutide in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with =1500 mg/day metformin alone. The trial randomized 1,879 study participants across the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Mexico and the UK in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg or semaglutide 1 mg. The primary objective of SURPASS-2 was to demonstrate that the two higher doses of tirzepatide (10 mg and/or 15 mg) led to non-inferior A1C reductions from baseline compared to semaglutide after 40 weeks in people with type 2 diabetes. Key secondary objectives included non-inferior A1C reductions from baseline for tirzepatide 5 mg; superior A1C and body weight reductions from baseline and greater percentages of participants achieving an A1C less than 7 percent across all three tirzepatide doses; and greater percentages of participants achieving an A1C less than 5.7 percent for tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg compared to semaglutide. Additional secondary endpoints not controlled for type 1 error included percentage of participants achieving an A1C less than 5.7 percent for tirzepatide 5 mg compared to semaglutide. Study participants had a mean A1C between 7 percent and 10.5 percent and a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. All participants in the tirzepatide treatment arms started the study at a dose of tirzepatide 2.5 mg once weekly and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 5 mg (via a 2.5 mg step), 10 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg) or 15 mg (via steps at 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg and 12.5 mg). Participants in the semaglutide treatment arm started the study at a dose of semaglutide 0.25 mg once weekly for four weeks, then increased the dose to 0.5 mg for four weeks and then reached the final dose of 1 mg.

The SURPASS phase 3 global clinical development program for tirzepatide has enrolled more than 13,000 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, five of which are global registration studies. The program began in late 2018 with full results from the registration studies anticipated in 2021.

</ul>
Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A), today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Resolution Bioscience Inc., a leader in the development and commercialization of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based precision oncology solutions. The acquisition complements and expands Agilent’s capabilities in NGS-based cancer diagnostics and provides the company with innovative technology to further serve the needs of the fast-growing precision medicine market. Under the terms of the agreement, Agilent will pay $550 million in cash at closing and up to an additional $145 million based on achieving future performance milestones.

Resolution Bioscience’s noninvasive liquid biopsy assay platform supports both the biopharma services market and the clinical oncology diagnostic testing market and is enabled by its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified lab. The platform has been designed for both a centralized CLIA test service and a distributable kit format. In addition, the Resolution Bioscience homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) assay has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The assay is performed on a standard blood sample and detects actionable mutations in genes for identifying cancer. Last year, Resolution Bioscience announced a commercial partnership with LabCorp to enable broad access to the Resolution ctDx Lung™ test that detects actionable mutations in genes associated with non-small cell lung cancer.

“We are extremely pleased to add Resolution Bioscience’s outstanding team and powerful technology to Agilent’s growing business in precision oncology solutions,” said Mike McMullen, Agilent president and CEO. “By adding Resolution Bioscience’s liquid biopsy-based diagnostic technologies to our portfolio, we are strengthening Agilent’s offering to our biopharma customers and boosting the growth of our diagnostics and genomics business. This also accelerates our strategy to broaden access to precision oncology testing for patients worldwide through distributed NGS-based diagnostic kits. We look forward to Resolution Bioscience joining with us to expand our work in the fight against cancer.”

“Agilent’s broad expertise, global regulatory and commercial infrastructure, extensive partnerships with biopharma companies, and decades-long leadership in precision medicine will enhance and accelerate our groundbreaking work,” said Mark Li, Resolution Bioscience president and CEO. “We are excited to further expand the use of NGS in precision oncology for clinical diagnostics as part of the Agilent team.”

Resolution Bioscience is based in Kirkland, Washington. The company had revenues of approximately $35 million in calendar year 2020 and is expected to generate $50 million to $55 million in revenue this year. The acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to Agilent’s non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2021 and 2022, and improving in the following years.

The transaction is expected to close in April, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

Basel, 05 March 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Actemra<sup>®</sup>/RoActemra<sup>®</sup> (tocilizumab) subcutaneous injection for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adult patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), a debilitating condition with limited treatment options. Actemra/RoActemra is the first biologic therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of the disease.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is an often devastating autoimmune disease that worsens over time and has no cure. It occurs when the immune system malfunctions causing tissues of the skin and lungs to thicken and harden.<sup>1-3</sup> SSc affects about 2.5 million people worldwide.<sup>4</sup> Interstitial lung disease (ILD), which may occur in approximately 80% of SSc patients, causes inflammation and scarring of the lungs and can be life-threatening.<sup>5</sup>

“We are honored to offer the very first FDA-approved biologic treatment option to people living with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche's Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We worked closely with the FDA to evaluate Actemra/RoActemra’s impact on lung function in this setting. This milestone approval provides a much-needed new treatment option for people living with this rare, debilitating disease.”

The FDA approval is based on data from the focuSSced trial, a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 212 adults with systemic sclerosis. Supportive information was also used from the faSScinate trial, a Phase II/III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with SSc. The focuSSced trial did not meet its primary endpoint of change from baseline to week 48 in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), which is a standard outcome measure for skin fibrosis (the scarring or hardening of the skin) in SSc. There also was not a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint of mRSS in the faSScinate trial.

However, in the overall population of the focuSSced study, patients treated with Actemra/RoActemra, as compared to placebo-treated patients, were observed to have less decline from baseline to week 48 in observed forced vital capacity (FVC), a common measure of lung function that assesses how much air can be exhaled, and percent predicted forced vital capacity (ppFVC), which compares the observed FVC to that expected for a healthy person of the same age, gender, race and height. FVC results were similar in the faSScinate study.


Of the 212 patients who were randomised into the focuSSced study, 68 patients (65%) in the Actemra/RoActemra arm and 68 patients (64%) in the placebo arm had SSc-ILD at baseline, as confirmed by a visual read of high resolution computed tomograph (HRCT) by blinded thoracic radiologists. Post-hoc exploratory analyses were performed to evaluate the results within the subgroups of patients with and without SSc-ILD. The ppFVC and FVC results in the overall population were primarily driven by results in the SSc-ILD subgroup. In that subgroup, patients in the Actemra/RoActemra group had a smaller decline in mean ppFVC than patients on placebo (0.07% vs. -6.4%, mean difference 6.47%), and a smaller decline in FVC compared to placebo (mean change -14 mL vs. -255 mL, mean difference 241 mL). The mean change from baseline to week 48 in mRSS in patients receiving Actemra/RoActemra compared to placebo was -5.88 vs. -3.77, mean difference -2.11.

The safety profile for Actemra/RoActemra through week 48 in the focuSSced study was comparable for SSc-ILD and SSc patients overall, and in both the focuSSced and faSScinate studies was consistent with the known safety profile of Actemra/RoActemra. The most common adverse events in patients treated with Actemra were infections.

Actemra was previously granted Priority Review for this condition by the FDA. This designation is given to medicines that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease. This is the sixth FDA approved indication for Actemra/RoActemra since the medicine was launched in the United States in 2010.

<strong>About the focuSSced Trial</strong>
The focuSSced (NCT02453256) study was a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Actemra/RoActemra versus placebo in people living with systemic sclerosis. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of 162 mg of Actemra/RoActemra or placebo during the 48-week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled period, followed by open-label Actemra/RoActemra 162 mg administered subcutaneously every week for another 48 weeks. Rescue treatment was allowed during the treatment period after 16 weeks for &gt;10% ppFVC decline or after 24 weeks for worsening skin fibrosis.

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline at week 48 in mRSS. Change from baseline in FVC at week 48 was a key secondary endpoint. Of the 212 patients who were randomised, 68 patients (65%) in the Actemra/RoActemra arm and 68 patients (64%) in the placebo arm had SSc-ILD at baseline, as confirmed by a visual read of high resolution computed tomograph (HRCT) by blinded thoracic radiologists. The mean ppFVC at baseline for patients with SSc-ILD identified by HRCT was 79.6% (median 80.5%). Post-hoc analyses were performed to evaluate results within the subgroups of patients with and without SSc-ILD. The results of the key FVC secondary endpoints support the effectiveness of Actemra/RoActemra in reducing the rate of progressive loss of lung function in SSc-ILD patients. However, as the trial did not provide evidence of an effect on the primary endpoint of mRSS, the estimated magnitude of effect on the FVC endpoints should be interpreted with caution and comparisons to results of other products and studies may be misleading.

<strong>About Actemra/RoActemra</strong>
Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved anti-IL-6 receptor biologic, and is available in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Actemra/RoActemra can be used alone or with methotrexate (MTX) in adult RA patients who are intolerant to, or have failed to respond to, other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In Europe, RoActemra IV and SC are also approved for use in adult patients with severe, active and progressive RA who previously have not been treated with MTX. Actemra/RoActemra IV and SC are also approved globally for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in children two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra SC is approved globally for giant cell arteritis (GCA), and Actemra/RoActemra IV is approved for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in people two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved treatment for sJIA, GCA and CRS. Actemra SC is now approved in the U.S. for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adult patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). In addition to the above-mentioned indications, in Japan Actemra IV is also approved for the treatment of Castleman’s disease and adult Still's disease, and the Actemra SC formulation is approved for Takayasu arteritis. Actemra/RoActemra is part of a co-development agreement with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and has been approved in Japan since April 2005. Actemra/RoActemra is approved in more than 110 countries worldwide.

INDIANAPOLIS, March 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) announced today top-line results from BRAVE-AA2, a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of once-daily baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg in adults with severe alopecia areata (AA). Both doses of baricitinib met the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 36, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in scalp hair regrowth compared to those randomized to placebo. AA is an autoimmune disease that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face and sometimes on other areas of the body that can progress. Baricitinib has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AA. This classification aims to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over already available therapies on a clinically significant endpoint(s). There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for AA.

""These positive results are very promising and suggest that baricitinib has the potential to address the urgent needs of people living with alopecia areata,"" said Brett King, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of Dermatology at Yale School of Medicine. ""This level of high-quality research is needed to advance our understanding and the treatment of this frequently devastating disease.""

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 546 adults with a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score = 50 (i.e., who had =50% scalp hair loss) and a current episode of severe AA lasting at least six months but no more than eight years. The study included a diverse patient population from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.S.

Safety outcomes of baricitinib in BRAVE-AA2 were consistent with its established safety profile in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and atopic dermatitis (AD). No deaths, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were reported in the study.

BRAVE-AA2 is the first Phase 3 study with positive results in patients with AA. Data from an additional Phase 3 study of baricitinib in AA will be available in the first half of this year. Detailed results from the BRAVE program will be presented at an upcoming medical conference and published in a peer-reviewed journal later this year. AA is the second potential treatment indication in dermatology for baricitinib after AD.

""For patients who suffer from alopecia areata, it is not a cosmetic condition, it is a devastating autoimmune disease that can have significant psychological effects. They lose much more than just hair,"" said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. ""We are looking forward to sharing the totality of data from the overall clinical development program for baricitinib as a potential first-in-disease treatment for alopecia areata.""

""Significant unmet need exists in the treatment of alopecia areata,"" said Abby Ellison, research director at the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF). ""We appreciate Lilly's important work in this area and are excited that these data could bring us closer to a potential new treatment option for patients.""

Baricitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly. It is approved and commercially available as OLUMIANT in the U.S. and more than 70 countries as a treatment for adults with moderate to severe active RA and in the European Union and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. Baricitinib is also being investigated in systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and COVID-19.

<b>Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients</b>

OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup> (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS </b>

<b>WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS</b>

<b><i>SERIOUS INFECTIONS:</i></b><b> Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive, start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.</b>

<b>Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.</b>

<b><i>MALIGNANCIES:</i></b><b> Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.</b>

<b><i>THROMBOSIS:</i></b><b> Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.</b>

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>with chronic or recurrent infection</li>
 	<li>who have been exposed to TB</li>
 	<li>with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection</li>
 	<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or</li>
 	<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>
</ul>
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

<b>Tuberculosis – </b>Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

<b>Viral Reactivation – </b>Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

<b>MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: </b>Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

<b>THROMBOSIS:  </b>Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

<b>GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: </b>Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

<b>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:</b>

<b><i>Neutropenia</i></b><b> – </b>Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Lymphopenia</i></b><b> – </b>Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Anemia</i></b><b> – </b>Decreases in hemoglobin levels to &lt;8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

<b><i>Liver Enzyme Elevations</i></b><b> – </b>Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT =5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST =10x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

<b><i>Lipid Elevations</i></b><b> – </b>Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

<b>VACCINATIONS: </b>Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

<b>HYPERSENSITIVITY: </b>Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug sensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>
Most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg and placebo, respectively.

<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</b>

<b>PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: </b>No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.

<b>HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: </b>Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”), with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today presented positive long-term data from its global phase IIIb ATLAS-2M study of the first complete, long-acting regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine for the treatment of HIV. Week 96 findings reinforce the primary (proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA =50 c/mL at Week 48 (Snapshot, ITT-E)), and secondary endpoints (proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA =50 or &lt;50 c/mL at Week 96 (Snapshot, ITT-E)), initially assessed at Week 48, and now showing efficacy of both monthly dosing and every 2-month dosing over the long-term in virologically supressed adults with HIV-1.  These data were presented at the virtual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2021). The every 2-month dosing regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine is under investigation and not approved in the US or Canada.

<strong>Hans Jäeger, MD, former Medical Director of MVZ Karlsplatz, HIV Research and Clinical Care Centre, Munich, and investigator for the ATLAS-2M study, said,</strong> “The ATLAS-2M 96-week data reinforces the therapeutic potential of this long-acting regimen for the treatment of HIV. It provides an option that could change the treatment experience for some people living with HIV by removing the need for daily pills for the treatment of HIV. Taking a pill every day can come as an unwelcome daily reminder of their HIV status or it may add to their fears that their HIV status might be disclosed by someone seeing their HIV medication. This regimen can enable people living with HIV to reduce the days they receive treatment from 365 to 12 or 6 per year, representing a paradigm shift in their experience of HIV treatment.”

<strong>Kimberly Smith, M.D., Head of Research &amp; Development at ViiV Healthcare, said,</strong> “At ViiV Healthcare, our research and development is underpinned by a commitment to innovation and a desire to make a difference to the lives of people living with HIV. Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine is a first-of-its-kind regimen that removes the need for daily therapies after the initiation phase. These long-term data confirm that every 2-month dosing is non-inferior to monthly dosing, which means people living with HIV who are virologically supressed can reduce the number of days they take treatment to 6 times per year, allowing more time between doses with this regimen.”

ATLAS-2M met its primary endpoint at Week 48, demonstrating that the efficacy of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2-months (every eight weeks) was non-inferior to monthly dosing (every four weeks). Week 48 primary endpoint (proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA =50 c/mL) results  showed every 2-month dosing (9/522 [1.7%]) and monthly dosing (5/523 [1.0%]) were similarly effective (adjusted difference: 0.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.6, 2.2)<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/viiv-healthcare-presents-data-for-long-acting-cabotegravir-and-rilpivirine-for-the-treatment-of-hiv-showing-continued-virologic-suppression-to-96-weeks/#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"">[2].</a>  Week 96 findings reinforced the primary endpoint: the efficacy of every 2-month dosing was non-inferior to monthly dosing of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine, with 2.1% (11/522) and 1.1% (6/523) of participants, respectively, having HIV-1 RNA =50 c/mL (adjusted difference: 1.0%, 95% CI: -0.6-2.5)<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/viiv-healthcare-presents-data-for-long-acting-cabotegravir-and-rilpivirine-for-the-treatment-of-hiv-showing-continued-virologic-suppression-to-96-weeks/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"">[1].</a> The 96-week ATLAS-2M study secondary endpoint, showed that rates of virologic suppression were similar between the two arms, with 91.0% (475/522) of participants in the every 2-month dosing arm and 90.2% (472/523) in the monthly dosing arm achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL (adjusted difference: 0.8%, 95% CI: -2.8-4.3)<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/viiv-healthcare-presents-data-for-long-acting-cabotegravir-and-rilpivirine-for-the-treatment-of-hiv-showing-continued-virologic-suppression-to-96-weeks/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"">[1].</a>

<strong>Notes to editor</strong>

<strong>About cabotegravir</strong>

Cabotegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) developed by ViiV Healthcare for the treatment of HIV-1 in virologically suppressed adults. It is being evaluated in combination with injectable rilpivirine as a long-acting formulation.

INSTIs inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection.

<strong>About rilpivirine</strong>
The oral formulation of rilpivirine is also authorised for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents in antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 35 kg with a viral load = 100,000 HIV RNA copies/mL.

Rilpivirine long-acting is a prolonged-release suspension for IM injection being developed by Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transciptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that works by interfering with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which in turn stops the virus from multiplying.

<strong>Administration and dosing of cabotegravir and rilpivirine</strong>

Cabotegravir injection used in combination with rilpivirine injection will be the first complete long-acting regimen dosed monthly or every 2-months, for virologically suppressed people living with HIV-1. Cabotegravir and rilpivirine injections are administered as two gluteal intramuscular (IM) injections by a healthcare professional at the same appointment.  Prior to the initiation of the injections, cabotegravir and rilpivirine oral tablets are taken for approximately one month (at least 28 days) to assess tolerability to the medicines.

<strong>Important Safety Information for Cabenuva (cabotegravir 200mg/mL; rilpivirine 300 mg/mL) extended-release injectable suspensions</strong>

Cabenuva is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.

<strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Do not use Cabenuva in patients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to cabotegravir or rilpivirine.</li>
 	<li>Do not use Cabenuva in patients receiving carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, systemic dexamethasone (&gt;1 dose), and St John’s wort.</li>
</ul>
<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>

<strong>Hypersensitivity Reactions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), have been reported during postmarketing experience with rilpivirine-containing regimens. While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunctions, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries.</li>
 	<li>Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with other integrase inhibitors and could occur with</li>
 	<li>Discontinue Cabenuva immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop. Clinical status, including liver transaminases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Prescribe the oral lead-in prior to administration of Cabenuva to help identify patients who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Post-Injection Reactions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Serious post-injection reactions (reported in less than 1% of subjects) were reported within minutes after the injection of rilpivirine, including dyspnea, agitation, abdominal cramping, flushing, sweating, oral numbness, and changes in blood pressure. These events may have been associated with inadvertent (partial) intravenous administration and began to resolve within a few minutes after the injection.</li>
 	<li>Carefully follow the Instructions for Use when preparing and administering Cabenuva to avoid accidental intravenous administration. Observe patients briefly (approximately 10 minutes) after the injection. If a post-injection reaction occurs, monitor and treat as clinically indicated.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Hepatotoxicity:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving cabotegravir or rilpivirine with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease or identifiable risk factors.</li>
 	<li>Patients with underlying liver disease or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations.</li>
 	<li>Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended and treatment with Cabenuva should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity is suspected.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Depressive Disorders:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Depressive disorders (including depressed mood, depression, major depression, mood altered, mood swings, dysphoria, negative thoughts, suicidal ideation or attempt) have been reported with Cabenuva or the individual products.</li>
 	<li>Promptly evaluate patients with depressive symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The concomitant use of Cabenuva and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions (see Contraindications and Drug Interactions).</li>
 	<li>Rilpivirine doses 3 and 12 times higher than the recommended oral dosage can prolong the QTc interval. Cabenuva should be used with caution in combination with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Long-Acting Properties and Potential Associated Risks with Cabenuva:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Residual concentrations of cabotegravir and rilpivirine may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods (up to 12 months or longer). Select appropriate patients who agree to the required monthly injection dosing schedule because non-adherence to monthly injections or missed doses could lead to loss of virologic response and development of resistance.</li>
 	<li>To minimize the potential risk of developing viral resistance, it is essential to initiate an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than 1 month after the final injection doses of Cabenuva. If virologic failure is suspected, switch the patient to an alternative regimen as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>

The most common adverse reactions (incidence =2%, all grades) with Cabenuva were injection site reactions, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, sleep disorders, dizziness, and rash.

<strong>DRUG INTERACTIONS</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Refer to the applicable full Prescribing Information for important drug interactions with Cabenuva, Vocabria, or rilpivirine.</li>
 	<li>Because Cabenuva is a complete regimen, coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended.</li>
 	<li>Drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or 1A9 are expected to decrease the plasma concentrations of cabotegravir. Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine.</li>
 	<li>Cabenuva should be used with caution in combination with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.</li>
</ul>
<strong>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pregnancy: </strong>There are insufficient human data on the use of Cabenuva during pregnancy to adequately assess a drug-associated risk for birth defects and miscarriage. Discuss the benefit-risk of using Cabenuva during pregnancy and conception and consider that cabotegravir and rilpivirine are detected in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after discontinuing injections of An Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lactation</strong><strong>: </strong>The CDC recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Breastfeeding is also not recommended due to the potential for developing viral resistance in HIV-positive infants, adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, and detectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine concentrations in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after discontinuing injections of</li>

<strong>European Important Safety Information (ISI)</strong>

<strong>Vocabria ISI</strong>

The following Important Safety Information is based on the Summary of Product Characteristics for Vocabria. Please consult the full Summary of Product Characteristics for all the safety information.

Vocabria (cabotegravir) injection is indicated, in combination with rilpivirine injection, for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class

Vocabria injection is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 in combination with rilpivirine injection, therefore, the prescribing information for rilpivirine injection should be consulted for recommended dosing.

Vocabria tablets are indicated in combination with rilpivirine tablets for the short-term treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class for:
<ul>
 	<li>oral lead in to assess tolerability of Vocabria and rilpivirine prior to administration of long acting Vocabria injection plus long acting rilpivirine injection.</li>
 	<li>oral therapy for adults who will miss planned dosing with Vocabria injection plus rilpivirine injection.</li>
</ul>
Vocabria tablets are only indicated for treatment of HIV-1 in combination with rilpivirine tablets, therefore, the prescribing information for Edurant tablets should also be consulted for recommended dosing.

<u>Prior to starting Vocabria injection</u>, healthcare professionals should have carefully selected patients who agree to the required injection schedule and counsel patients about the importance of adherence to scheduled dosing visits to help maintain viral suppression and reduce the risk of viral rebound and potential development of resistance with missed doses.

<u>Following discontinuation of Vocabria and rilpivirine injection</u>, it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the final injection of Vocabria when dosed monthly and no later than two months after the final injection of Vocabria when dosed every 2 months.

Elderly (=65 years of age): No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. There are limited data available on the use of cabotegravir in patients aged 65 years and over.

Paediatrics (&lt;18 years of age): The safety and efficacy of Vocabria in children and adolescents aged under 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

<strong>Contraindications</strong>

Hypersensitivity to cabotegravir or rilpivirine or to any of the excipients.

Concomitant use with: rifampicin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital.

</div>
<u>Vocabria injection</u>

Residual concentrations of cabotegravir may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods (up to 12 months or longer), therefore, physicians should take the prolonged release characteristics of Vocabria injection into consideration when the medicinal product is discontinued.

If virologic failure is suspected, an alternative regimen should be adopted as soon as possible.

<u>Baseline factors associated with virological failure</u>

Before starting the regimen, it should be taken into account that multivariable analyses indicate that a combination of at least 2 of the following baseline factors may be associated with an increased risk of virological failure: archived rilpivirine resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI =30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In patients with an incomplete or uncertain treatment history without pre-treatment resistance analyses, caution is warranted in the presence of either BMI =30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or HIV-1 A6/A1 subtype.

<u>Hypersensitivity reactions</u>

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with other integrase inhibitors. These reactions were characterised by rash, constitutional findings and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. While no such reactions have been observed to date in association with Vocabria, physicians should remain vigilant and should discontinue Vocabria and other suspected medicinal products immediately, should signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash, or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia or angioedema). Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Administration of oral lead-in is recommended to help identify patients who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction.

<em> </em>

<u>Hepatoxicity</u>

Hepatotoxicity has been reported in a limited number of patients receiving Vocabria with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease.

Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended and treatment with Vocabria should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity is suspected.

<u>HBV/HCV co-infection</u>

Patients with hepatitis B co-infection were excluded from studies with Vocabria. It is not recommended to initiate Vocabria in patients with hepatitis B co-infection. Physicians should refer to current treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus.

Limited data is available in patients with hepatitis C co-infection.  Monitoring of liver function is recommended in patients with hepatitis C co-infection.

<u>Interactions with medicinal products</u>

Caution should be given to prescribing Vocabria injection and tablets with medicinal products that may reduce its exposure.

Concomitant use of Vocabria injection with rifabutin is not recommended.

Polyvalent cation containing antacids are recommended to be taken at least 2 hours before and 4 hours after taking Vocabria tablets.

<u>Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir</u>

Cabotegravir is primarily metabolised by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1 and to a lesser extent by UGT1A9. Medicinal products which are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or UGT1A9 are expected to decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations leading to lack of efficacy.

<strong>Undesirable effects</strong>

<u>Summary of the safety profile</u>

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (ARs) from monthly dosing studies were injection site reactions (up to 84%), headache (up to 12%) and pyrexia<sup>*</sup> (10%).

The most frequently reported ARs from ATLAS-2M every 2-month dosing were injection site reactions (76%), headache (7%) and pyrexia<sup>*</sup> (7%).

<sup>*</sup>Pyrexia includes the following: feeling hot, body temperature increased.

<u>Description of selected adverse reactions</u>

<em>Local injection site reactions (ISRs)</em>

Up to 1% of subjects discontinued treatment with Vocabria plus rilpivirine because of ISRs. When dosing monthly, up to 84% of subjects reported injection site reactions; out of 30393 injections, 6815 ISRs were reported. When dosing every 2 months, 76% of patients reported injection site reactions; out of 8470 injections, 2507 ISRs were reported.

The severity of reactions was generally mild (Grade 1, 70%-75% of subjects) or moderate (Grade 2, 27%-36% of subjects). 3-4% of subjects experienced severe (Grade 3) ISRs. The median duration of overall ISR events was 3 days. The percentage of subjects reporting ISRs decreased over time.

<em>Weight increased</em>

At the Week 48 time point, subjects in studies FLAIR and ATLAS, who received Vocabria plus rilpivirine gained a median of 1.5 kg in weight subjects continuing on their current antiretroviral therapy (CAR) gained a median of 1.0 kg (pooled analysis). In the individual studies FLAIR and ATLAS, the median weight gains in the Vocabria plus rilpivirine arms were 1.3 kg and 1.8 kg respectively, compared to 1.5 kg and 0.3 kg in the CAR arms.

At the 48 week timepoint, in ATLAS-2M the median weight gain in both the monthly and 2-monthly CAB+RPV dosing arms was 1.0 kg.

<u>Pregnancy</u>

There are a limited amount of data from the use of cabotegravir in pregnant women. The effect of Vocabria on human pregnancy is unknown.

Cabotegravir was not teratogenic when studied in pregnant rats and rabbits but, exposures higher than the therapeutic dose showed reproductive toxicity in animals. The relevance to human pregnancy is unknown.

Vocabria injection is not recommended during pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.

Cabotegravir has been detected in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after an injection

<u>Breast-feeding</u>

It is expected that cabotegravir will be secreted into human milk based on animal data, although this has not been confirmed in humans. Cabotegravir may be present in human milk for up to 12 months or longer after the last cabotegravir injection.

It is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

<strong>Rekambys (rilpivirine injection) ISI</strong>

The following Important Safety Information is based on the Summary of Product Characteristics for Rekambys (rilpivirine injection). Please consult the full Summary of Product Characteristics for all the safety information.

Rekambys is indicated, in combination with cabotegravir injection, for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with, agents of the NNRTI and INI class

Rekambys should always be co-administered with a cabotegravir injection. The prescribing information for cabotegravir injection should be consulted for recommended dosing.

Prior to the initiation of Rekambys, rilpivirine oral tablets, together with cabotegravir oral tablets, should be taken for approximately 1 month (at least 28 days) to assess tolerability to rilpivirine and cabotegravir. One rilpivirine 25-mg tablet should be taken with a meal with one cabotegravir 30-mg tablet once daily.

<u>Prior to starting Rekambys</u>, the healthcare professional should carefully select patients who agree to the required injection schedule and counsel patients about the importance of adherence to scheduled dosing visits to help maintain viral suppression and reduce the risk of viral rebound and potential development of resistance associated with missed doses.

<u>Following discontinuation of Rekambys in combination with cabotegravir injection</u>, it is essential to adopt an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than one month after the last every 1 month injection of Rekambys or two months after the last every 2 months injection of Rekambys.

<em>Elderly: </em>There is limited information regarding the use of Rekambys in patients &gt; 65 years of age. No dose adjustment of Rekambys is required in older patients.

<em>Paediatric Patients: </em>The safety and efficacy of Rekambys in children and adolescents aged &lt; 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

<strong>Contraindications</strong>

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

Rekambys must not be co-administered with the following medicinal products, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect of Rekambys:
<ul>
 	<li>the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin</li>
 	<li>the antimycobacterials rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine</li>
 	<li>the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, except as a single dose treatment</li>
 	<li>St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).</li>
</ul>

<u>Long-acting properties of rilpivirine injection</u>

Residual concentrations of rilpivirine may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods (up to 4 years in some patients) and should be considered upon discontinuation of Rekambys.

<u>Baseline factors associated with virological failure</u>

Before starting the regimen, it should be taken into account that multivariable analyses indicate that a combination of at least 2 of the following baseline factors may be associated with an increased risk of virological failure: archived rilpivirine resistance mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, or BMI =30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In patients with an incomplete or uncertain treatment history without pre-treatment resistance analyses, caution is warranted in the presence of BMI =30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and/or HIV-1 subtype A6/A1.

<u>Post-injection reactions</u>

Partial intravenous administration may result in AEs due to temporarily high plasma concentrations. In clinical studies, serious post-injection reactions were reported within minutes after the injection of rilpivirine, including dyspnoea, agitation, abdominal cramping, flushing, sweating, oral numbness, and changes in blood pressure. These events were very rare and began to resolve within a few minutes after the injection.

Carefully follow the Instructions for Use when preparing and administering Rekambys to avoid accidental intravenous administration. Observe patients briefly (approximately 10 minutes) after the injection.

<p align=""justify"">SAN DIEGO, March 07, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- China Oncology Focus Limited (COF), an affiliate of Lee's Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited (Lee's Pharm, HKEX: 950) announced that its anti-PD-L1 antibody, Socazolimab, licensed from Sorrento to COF for the greater China territory, has been cleared to begin a multicenter, randomized, double blinded, parallel-group clinical trial of Socazolimab (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, formerly known as ZKAB001) combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. The clearance is based on the results from an earlier Phase Ib trial in which Socazolimab combined with carboplatin and etoposide showed a promising efficacy and safety profile in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. The Principal Investigator for the clinical trial will be Professor Shun Lu from the Shanghai Chest Hospital and the site is expected to initiate patient recruitment in the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Socazolimab is an in-licensed product from Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) for the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Three Phase I clinical trials of Socazolimab monotherapy have been completed: (1) recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer; (2) advanced urothelial carcinoma; and (3) high-grade osteosarcoma after adjuvant chemotherapy for maintenance purposes. For recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, a pivotal study has been completed and breakthrough therapy designation was granted by the NMPA in February 2021. Lee’s Pharm expects to file the New Drug Application for Socazolimab in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in the second quarter of 2021. Apart from monotherapies, several studies of Socazolimab combining with chemotherapy are being conducted in advanced urothelial carcinoma (Phase Ib), extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (Phase III), and neoadjuvant treatment in esophageal carcinoma (Phase Ib+II).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Dr. Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics, stated, “We at Sorrento are pleased with the collaboration with our colleagues at Lee’s Pharm and with the further advances of our first therapeutic antibody partnership in Socazolimab.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Basel, 8 March 2021 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the company is voluntarily withdrawing the US indication for Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in prior-platinum treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC, bladder cancer). This decision was made in consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of an industry-wide review of accelerated approvals with confirmatory trials that have not met their primary endpoint(s) and have yet to gain regular approvals. Roche will work with the FDA over the coming weeks to complete the withdrawal process. This decision does not affect other approved indications for Tecentriq. Roche is notifying healthcare professionals about this withdrawal. Patients being treated with Tecentriq for prior-platinum treated mUC should discuss their care with their healthcare provider.
 
 “The Accelerated Approval Program allows people with difficult-to-treat cancers to receive certain new therapies earlier,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “While the withdrawal of Tecentriq for prior-platinum treated bladder cancer is disappointing, Tecentriq continues to demonstrate benefits across multiple cancer types and therefore remains a meaningful treatment option for many patients.”
 
 The FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program allows conditional approval of a medicine that fills an unmet medical need for a serious condition, with specific post marketing requirements (PMRs) to confirm the clinical benefit and convert to regular approval.
 
 Tecentriq was granted accelerated approval in 2016 for the treatment of prior-platinum treated mUC based on the results from the IMvigor210 study (Cohort 2). Continued approval for this indication was contingent upon the results of IMvigor211, the original PMR for the prior-platinum treated mUC indication. This study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival in the PD-L1 high patient population. Subsequently, the FDA designated the IMvigor130 study as the PMR which will still continue until the final analysis. However, as the treatment landscape in prior-platinum (second-line) mUC has rapidly evolved with the emergence of new treatment options, Roche is voluntarily withdrawing this indication in recognition of the principles of the Accelerated Approval Program.
 
 About Tecentriq
 Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.
 
 Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, certain types of mUC, in PD-L1-positive mTNBC and for hepatocellular carcinoma. In the US, Tecentriq is also approved in combination with Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of people with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.
 
 About Roche in cancer immunotherapy
 Roche’s rigorous pursuit of groundbreaking science has contributed to major therapeutic and diagnostic advances in oncology over the last 50 years, and today, realising the full potential of cancer immunotherapy is a major area of focus. With over 20 molecules in development, Roche is investigating the potential benefits of immunotherapy alone, and in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapies or other immunotherapies with the goal of providing each person with a treatment tailored to harness their own unique immune system to attack their cancer. Our scientific expertise, coupled with innovative pipeline and extensive partnerships, gives us the confidence to continue pursuing the vision of finding a cure for cancer by ensuring the right treatment for the right patient at the right time.
 
 In addition to Roche’s approved PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), Roche’s broad cancer immunotherapy pipeline includes other checkpoint inhibitors, such as tiragolumab, a novel cancer immunotherapy designed to bind to TIGIT, individualised neoantigen therapies and T-cell bispecific antibodies.

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced new, long-term data from open-label extensions (OLE) of two Phase 3 studies (Study 1489 and Study 1490) of Biktarvy<sup>®</sup> (bictegravir 50 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets, B/F/TAF), demonstrating the sustained efficacy and safety profile and no treatment-emergent resistance with Biktarvy for the treatment of HIV-1 in treatment-naïve adults. The data were presented at the 28th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (<i>virtual</i> CROI 2021).

In both studies, &gt;98% of participants who initiated treatment with Biktarvy and remained in the study achieved and maintained an undetectable viral load (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL) through four years of follow-up (n=235/237 for study 1489, n=241/243 for study 1490). The high efficacy and durable viral suppression were also observed in participants who switched to Biktarvy from a dolutegravir-containing triple therapy for the 48-week OLE periods (n=212 for study 1489, n=225 for study 1490). No treatment-emergent resistance to any components of Biktarvy occurred in participants treated with Biktarvy.

“Gilead is committed to developing innovative HIV treatments, like Biktarvy, that help to address the unmet needs of people living with HIV today, including achieving and maintaining an undetectable viral load over the long-term,” said Diana Brainard, MD, Senior Vice President, Virology Therapeutic Area, Gilead Sciences. “These data reinforce that Biktarvy provides durable viral suppression, strong efficacy and a high barrier to resistance in both adults that are new to HIV therapy and those replacing their existing treatment.”

Gilead presented additional Biktarvy data at <i>virtual</i> CROI 2021, including findings from a 144-week analysis of the same Phase 3 studies (Study 1489 and Study 1490), which demonstrated that people living with HIV who received initial therapy with Biktarvy reached and maintained an undetectable viral load with no treatment-emergent resistance through 144 weeks (n=634). In a subgroup analysis of participants with transmitted-drug resistance (TDR, n=248) based on retrospective sequencing of baseline samples, Biktarvy achieved comparably high levels of durable viral suppression through 144 weeks among participants with and without TDR (98% vs. 97%; as treated analysis).

“As a clinician, my goal is to initiate treatment immediately after diagnosis with a therapy that achieves and maintains virologic control over the long-term,” said Kimberly Workowski, MD, Professor of Medicine, Emory University. “The data presented at CROI highlight that Biktarvy can achieve long-term viral suppression at four years among a range of people living with HIV and supports further study for patients with certain transmitted drug-resistant HIV.”

The use of Biktarvy in individuals with known resistance to the components of Biktarvy is investigational; this use is not approved by the U.S. FDA, and the safety and efficacy of Biktarvy for this use has not been established. Please see below for the U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information for Biktarvy.

Biktarvy does not cure HIV or AIDS.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Studies 1489 and 1490</span></b>

Study 1489 and Study 1490 are Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies. For 144 weeks, treatment-naïve participants were blinded to receive either Biktarvy (n=634) or a dolutegravir-containing triple therapy (n=640). Treatment outcomes were assessed at week 144 and showed participants in both groups achieved an undetectable viral load, with no treatment-emergent resistance. Beyond week 144, participants were able to receive Biktarvy in an active OLE phase for up to 96 weeks. Study 1489 and Study 1490 are ongoing.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">U.S. Important Safety Information for Biktarvy</span></b>

<b>BOXED WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and may occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY.</b> <b>Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue BIKTARVY. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Contraindications</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Coadministration: </b>Do not use BIKTARVY with dofetilide or rifampin.</li>
</ul>
<b>Warnings and precautions</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Drug interactions:</b> See Contraindications and Drug Interactions sections. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during BIKTARVY therapy and monitor for adverse reactions.</li>
 	<li><b>Immune reconstitution syndrome,</b> including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, has been reported.</li>
 	<li><b>New onset or worsening renal impairment: </b>Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with TAF-containing products; while most of these cases were characterized by potential confounders that may have contributed to the reported renal events, it is also possible these factors may have predisposed patients to tenofovir-related adverse events. Do not initiate BIKTARVY in patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min except in virologically-suppressed adults &lt;15mL/min who are receiving chronic hemodialysis. Patients with impaired renal function and/or taking nephrotoxic agents (including NSAIDs) are at increased risk of renal-related adverse reactions. Discontinue BIKTARVY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.
<i>Renal monitoring:</i> Prior to or when initiating BIKTARVY and during therapy, assess serum creatinine, CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients as clinically appropriate. In patients with chronic kidney disease, assess serum phosphorus.</li>
 	<li><b>Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis:</b> Fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC and TDF. Discontinue BIKTARVY if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity develop, including hepatomegaly and steatosis in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.</li>
</ul>
<b>Adverse reactions</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Most common adverse reactions </b>(incidence =5%; all grades) in clinical studies through Week 144 were diarrhea (6%), nausea (6%), and headache (5%).</li>
</ul>
<b>Drug interactions</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Prescribing information: </b>Consult the full prescribing information for BIKTARVY for more information on Contraindications, Warnings, and potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments.</li>
 	<li><b>Enzymes/transporters: </b>Drugs that induce P-gp or induce both CYP3A and UGT1A1 can substantially decrease the concentration of components of BIKTARVY. Drugs that inhibit P-gp, BCRP, or inhibit both CYP3A and UGT1A1 may significantly increase the concentrations of components of BIKTARVY. BIKTARVY can increase the concentration of drugs that are substrates of OCT2 or MATE1.</li>
 	<li><b>Drugs affecting renal function: </b>Coadministration of BIKTARVY with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC and tenofovir and the risk of adverse reactions.</li>
</ul>
<b>Dosage and administration</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Dosage:</b> Patients weighing =25 kg: 1 tablet taken once daily with or without food.</li>
 	<li><b>Renal impairment: </b>Not recommended in patients with CrCl &lt;30 mL/min.</li>
 	<li><b>Hepatic impairment:</b> Not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</li>
 	<li><b>Prior to or when initiating:</b> Test patients for HBV infection.</li>
 	<li><b>Prior to or when initiating, and during treatment: </b>As clinically appropriate, assess serum creatinine, CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, assess serum phosphorus.</li>
</ul>
<b>Pregnancy and lactation</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Pregnancy:</b> There is insufficient human data on the use of BIKTARVY during pregnancy. Dolutegravir, another integrase inhibitor, has been associated with neural tube defects. Discuss the benefit-risk of using BIKTARVY during pregnancy and conception. An Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has been established. Available data from the APR for FTC shows no difference in the rates of birth defects compared with a US reference population.</li>
 	<li><b>Lactation:</b> Women infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed, due to the potential for HIV-1 transmission.</li>
</ul>
<b><span class=""bwuline"">U.S. Indication for Biktarvy</span></b>

Biktarvy is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 25 kg who have no antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies /mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known resistance to any component of Biktarvy.

SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kite, a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to Yescarta<b><sup>®</sup></b> (axicabtagene ciloleucel) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The approval makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approved for patients with indolent follicular lymphoma, follows FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and a priority review, and marks the third approved indication for a Kite cell therapy.

The approval is based on results from ZUMA-5, a single-arm, open-label study in which 91 percent of patients with relapsed or refractory FL (n=81) responded to Yescarta, including an estimated 74 percent of patients in a continued remission at 18 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate). Among all FL patients, median duration of response was not reached at a median follow-up of 14.5 months. In the safety analysis set (n=146), Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities occurred in 8 percent and 21 percent of patients, respectively.

“Once a follicular lymphoma patient’s disease relapses, the duration of response to care shortens with each round of therapy,” said Caron A. Jacobson, MD, MMSc, Medical Director, Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Assistant Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. “Additionally, for follicular patients in the third line of therapy, the five-year survival rate is only 20 percent, highlighting the urgent need for treatments that offer a real chance for durable remission. Impressively, 91 percent of follicular lymphoma patients in the ZUMA-5 study responded to a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, including an estimated 74 percent of patients in a continued remission at 18 months, giving these patients much-needed hope and oncologists an important addition to the treatment armamentarium.”

“As we look to bring the hope of survival to more patients in need, today’s FDA decision represents a real step forward in our commitment in hematologic malignancies,” said Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite. “Advancing CAR T therapies for patients across lymphomas remains a cornerstone of our cell therapy development program, and we are excited about the potential of Yescarta for patients with indolent follicular lymphoma.”

Patients whose healthcare professionals have prescribed Yescarta therapy can work with Kite Konnect<sup>®</sup>, an integrated technology platform that provides information and assistance throughout the therapy process for Kite’s commercialized CAR T therapies, including courier tracking for shipments and manufacturing status updates. More information is available at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kitekonnect.com&amp;esheet=52390587&amp;newsitemid=20210305005624&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.kitekonnect.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=424de758266cbeb383854bb2d9e7fb42"" rel=""nofollow"">www.kitekonnect.com</a>.

“This is an important new treatment option for people with third-line relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma,” said Lee Greenberger, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS). “LLS has supported CAR T development from the beginning, and on behalf of blood cancer patients, we thank Kite and Gilead for their work in bringing this remarkably innovative treatment to more patients.”

The Yescarta U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicities, and Yescarta is approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) due to these risks; see below for Important Safety Information.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Indolent Follicular Lymphoma</span></b>

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a form of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) in which malignant tumors slowly grow but can become more aggressive over time. FL is the most common form of indolent lymphoma and the second most common type of lymphoma globally. It accounts for approximately 22 percent of all lymphomas diagnosed worldwide. Currently, there are limited options for the treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent FL after two or more lines of therapy.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">ZUMA-5 Trial Results</span></b>

ZUMA-5 is an ongoing, single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating 146 patients (=18 years old) with relapsed or refractory iNHL, who received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including the combination of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an alkylating agent. Efficacy was established on the basis of objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by an independent review committee per the 2014 Lugano Classification.

In the study, 91 percent of all FL patients (n=81 evaluable for efficacy analysis) responded to a single infusion of Yescarta, including 60 percent of patients who achieved a complete remission. Thirteen of the 25 patients who achieved a partial remission met imaging criteria for a complete remission without confirmation by negative bone marrow biopsy after treatment. Median DoR has not yet been reached.

Among the 146 patients evaluable for safety, Grade 3 or higher CRS and neurologic toxicities were observed in 8 percent and 21 percent of patients, respectively. The median time to onset of CRS and neurologic toxicities were four days (range: 1 to 20 days) and six days (range 1 to 79 days), respectively. The most common (=10 percent) Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions included febrile neutropenia, encephalopathy, and infections with pathogen unspecified.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Yescarta</span></b>

 	<li><b>Yescarta is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME</b> (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred. CRS occurred in 88% (224/254) of all patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including Grade =3 in 10%. CRS occurred in 94% (101/108) of patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), including Grade =3 in 13%. Among patients with LBCL who died after receiving Yescarta, 4 had ongoing CRS events at the time of death. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 days (range: 1-12 days) and the median duration was 7 days (range: 2-58 days) for patients with LBCL. CRS occurred in 84% (123/146) of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), including Grade =3 in 8% (11/146). Among patients with iNHL who died after receiving Yescarta, 1 patient had ongoing CRS events at the time of death. The median time to onset of CRS was 4 days (range: 1-20 days) and median duration was 6 days (range: 1-27 days) for patients with iNHL. Key manifestations of CRS (=10%) in all patients combined included fever (80%), hypotension (38%), tachycardia (29%), hypoxia (21%), chills (21%), and headache (13%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, renal insufficiency, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, multi-organ failure, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome<i>.</i> Ensure that 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to Yescarta infusion. Following infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

<b>NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES</b> that were fatal or life-threatening occurred. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 81% (206/254) of all patients with NHL receiving Yescarta, including Grade =3 in 26%. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 87% (94/108) of patients with LBCL, including Grade =3 in 31%. The median time to onset was 4 days (range: 1-43 days) and the median duration was 17 days for patients with LBCL. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 77% (112/146) of patients with iNHL, including Grade =3 in 21%. The median time to onset was 6 days (range: 1-79 days) and the median duration was 16 days for patients with iNHL. 98% of all neurologic toxicities in patients with LBCL and 99% of all neurologic toxicities in patients with iNHL occurred within the first 8 weeks of Yescarta infusion. Neurologic toxicities occurred within the first 7 days of infusion for 89% of patients with LBCL and 74% of patients with iNHL. The most common neurologic toxicities (=10%) in all patients combined included encephalopathy (53%), headache (45%), tremor (31%), dizziness (20%), delirium (16%), aphasia (15%), and insomnia (11%). Prolonged encephalopathy lasting up to 173 days was noted. Serious events, including leukoencephalopathy and seizures, as well as fatal and serious cases of cerebral edema, have occurred. Following Yescarta infusion, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility, and for 4 weeks thereafter, and treat promptly.

<b>REMS: </b>Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Yescarta must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements and must have on-site, immediate access to a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after Yescarta infusion, if needed for treatment of CRS. Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe, dispense, or administer Yescarta are trained about the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities.

<b>HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: </b>Allergic reactions, including serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis, may occur with the infusion of Yescarta.

<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>Severe or life-threatening infections occurred. Infections (all grades) occurred in 47% (119/254) of all patients with NHL. Grade =3 infections occurred in 19% of patients, Grade =3 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 15%, bacterial infections in 5%, viral infections in 2%, and fungal infections in 1%. Yescarta should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic anti-microbials according to local guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 40% of all patients with NHL and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. In immunosuppressed patients, including those who have received Yescarta, life-threatening and fatal opportunistic infections including disseminated fungal infections (e.g., candida sepsis and aspergillus infections) and viral reactivation (e.g., human herpes virus-6 [HHV-6] encephalitis and JC virus progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]) have been reported. The possibility of HHV-6 encephalitis and PML should be considered in immunosuppressed patients with neurologic events and appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be performed. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

<b>PROLONGED CYTOPENIAS:</b> Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Yescarta infusion. Grade =3 cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Yescarta infusion occurred in 30% of all patients with NHL and included neutropenia (22%), thrombocytopenia (13%), and anemia (5%). Monitor blood counts after infusion.

<b>HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA</b> and B-cell aplasia can occur. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 17% of all patients with NHL. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment and manage using infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Yescarta treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Yescarta treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment.

<b>SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES</b> may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that one occurs, contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

<b>EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES:</b> Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Yescarta infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.

<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</b> The most common adverse reactions (incidence =20%) in patients with LBCL included CRS, fever, hypotension, encephalopathy, tachycardia, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, chills, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, infections with pathogen unspecified, nausea, hypoxia, tremor, cough, vomiting, dizziness, constipation, and cardiac arrhythmias. The most common non-laboratory adverse reactions (incidence =20%) in patients with iNHL included fever, CRS, hypotension, encephalopathy, fatigue, headache, infections with pathogen unspecified, tachycardia, febrile neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, tremor, chills, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, cough, vomiting, hypoxia, arrhythmia, and dizziness.

BOSTON, March 06, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVIR) (“Atea”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today presented results from the Phase 1 study of AT-527 in healthy volunteers at the 28th Annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in a Science Spotlight presentation. AT-527 is an orally administered, direct-acting antiviral developmental agent derived from Atea’s purine nucleotide prodrug platform and is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of COVID-19. AT-527 targets SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase (nsp12), a highly conserved gene which is responsible for both viral RNA replication and transcription. Given this preferential conserved target site, it is anticipated that the antiviral activity of AT-527 will continue even in the presence of naturally-evolving variants which are now emerging.

“We were delighted to present these encouraging results at CROI. Since the respiratory tract is the initiation site of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, these data demonstrate the potential for AT-527, our oral antiviral, to have meaningful clinical uptake in the lungs. Specifically, the data demonstrating rapid attainment of steady state with a fast build-up of trough levels enables us to predict that there should be exposure of drug in the lung above levels that are needed to inhibit viral replication,” said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Atea Pharmaceuticals. “In addition, these results show that AT-527 was well tolerated with a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile and are supportive of the dosing regimen for the upcoming Phase 3 program.”

In the Phase 1 study, 20 healthy volunteers were randomized 1:1 to receive oral AT-527 550 mg twice daily (BID) or matching placebo for 5 days. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AT-527 in healthy volunteers and to predict human lung exposure of intracellular AT-9010, the active triphosphate (TP) metabolite of AT-527. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and standard safety laboratory tests. Intensive PK sampling, performed after the first and last two doses, provided information on plasma exposures of AT-511, the free base of AT-527, a hemisulfate salt, and its metabolites including AT-273, the guanosine nucleoside metabolite, a measurable surrogate for intracellular AT-9010.

The study results showed AT-527 was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. There were no discontinuations, serious AEs, clinically significant changes in vital signs, or ECGs observed. The data also demonstrated that AT-511 was rapidly absorbed, followed by fast and extensive stepwise metabolic activation ultimately to the intracellular TP metabolite AT-9010, reflected by plasma AT-273. AT-527 550 mg BID led to fast attainment of steady-state levels of AT-273 within two days of dosing. Plasma levels of AT-273 were further used to predict lung concentrations of AT-9010 using a scaling factor of 1.2X which was previously determined from <em>in vivo</em> tissue distribution of the triphosphate metabolite in cynomolgus monkeys. Beginning as early as three hours after the first dose, and maintained thereafter throughout the five days of dosing, predicted lung AT-9010 levels were consistently above the EC<sub>90</sub> level of 0.5 µM for <em>in vitro</em> inhibition by the drug of SARS-CoV-2 replication. These results indicate the potential of AT-527 for the treatment of COVID-19 and are supportive of the dosing regimen of 550 mg BID.

<strong>About AT-527</strong>

AT-527 is an orally administered, direct-acting developmental antiviral agent derived from Atea’s nucleotide prodrug platform. AT-527 is currently under evaluation as a treatment for patients with COVID-19. In collaboration with Roche, AT-527 is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 2 study for hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 and a Phase 2 virology study in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. A pivotal Phase 3 trial is planned in the outpatient setting.
<p align=""left"">A direct-acting antiviral aims to prevent disease progression by minimizing or eliminating viral replication and thereby reducing the severity of the disease, preventing or shortening hospitalization, and also potentially preventing transmission of the virus to others. This makes it well suited for potential use in both pre- and post-exposure prophylactic settings and complementary to vaccines.</p>

DAEJEON, South Korea--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alteogen Inc. (KOSDAQ:196170) announced that it has completed Phase 1 clinical trial of Eylea® Biosimilar (ALT-L9). The clinical trial was conducted at 4 major hospitals in Korea: Asan Hospital, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Samsung Seoul Hospital, and Severance Hospital. Alteogen has strengthened competitiveness through formulation patent registered in US, EU and Japan and filing of a process patent for PCT application.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Eylea® original product and Alteogen's Eylea biosimilar (ALT-L9) were randomly assigned 1:1 to 28 patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration; the study design was double blinded, active control, and parallel. No adverse drug-related reactions were observed in both groups and showed similar improvement effects in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CST). In this phase 1 clinical trial, Alteogen confirmed the safety and efficacy of ALT-L9 were similar to that of Eylea®. Alteogen intends to prove the similarity of ALT-L9 with Eylea® through a registrational phase 3 clinical trial. The results from the phase 1 trial in Korea will support the design of the phase 3 trial and potentially provide a path to a shorter phase 3 trial.

Eylea® is a drug for the treatment of wet macular degeneration, one of the major senile blindness diseases, along with cataracts and glaucoma. Based on public reporting by Regeneron, the market size was about USD 4.947 Billion in 2020 in the United States alone, making this a blockbuster drug.

“Alteogen is uniquely positioned based on our patent position to launch a Eylea biosimilar upon substance patent expiration,” said Dr. Soon Jae Park, Chief Executive Officer of Alteogen. “Our patent position will give us potentially commercial first mover advantage.”

Altos Biologics Inc., a fully owned subsidiary of Alteogen will be responsible for all future clinical and commercial development.

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">March 8, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced the U.S. launch of NeuroSphere™ Virtual Clinic, a first-of-its-kind technology that allows patients to communicate with physicians, ensure proper settings and functionality, and receive new treatment settings remotely as needed. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic has the potential to increase access to optimal treatment for patients suffering from chronic pain or movement disorders who don't live close to a care provider, have difficulty accessing care, or are unable to go to the doctor because of circumstances like COVID-19.

Abbott's NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic gives patients the flexibility and comfort of receiving care anywhere* by connecting with their doctor via secure in-app video chat and an integrated remote programming feature, now available within the proprietary Abbott patient controller app. NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic enables clinicians to prescribe new treatment settings remotely to the patient's neurostimulation device using the clinician programmer app and a new, simple and secure remote care connection. This advancement gives patients confidence in their care and the convenience to manage their therapy in a way that fits their lifestyle.

""With NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, physicians can communicate and digitally prescribe new stimulation settings remotely, allowing them to extend care beyond their clinic walls and optimize therapy management,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Timothy Deer</span>, M.D., DABPM, president and chief executive officer of The Spine and Nerve Center of the Virginias in <span class=""xn-location"">Charleston, W.Va.</span> ""This is a significant advancement for chronic pain patients.""

""NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic solves considerable issues patients with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or essential tremor, can have in obtaining the care they need,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Drew Falconer</span>, M.D., neurologist and director, <span class=""xn-person"">Inova Parkinson's</span> and Movement Disorders Center in <span class=""xn-location"">Fairfax, Va.</span> ""Often, patients must be off their medication overnight, so that their treatments can be adjusted properly, which can make it difficult for a patient to travel to their specialist. With NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, patients can receive stimulation settings from their physicians in real time and remotely via cloud and Bluetooth-based technology, which is something we have never been able to do before. This opens up a world in which patients can receive the care they need anytime, anywhere.""*

The NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic can also be helpful for people who live in areas — both rural and urban — with inadequate access to medical services. On average people living with movement disorders will travel over 150 miles to access specialists offering deep brain stimulation (DBS).<sup>1</sup> Without alternative solutions, such as digital and/or telehealth options, these patients are more likely to delay or forego much-needed care.<sup>2</sup> NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic brings the convenience and flexibility of telemedicine to neurostimulation therapy, further benefitting chronic pain and movement disorder patients with Abbott devices. Medicare will cover remote programming services as a telehealth benefit through the duration of the public health emergency.

""A decade ago, we started evaluating the hurdles that patients had to overcome to receive neuromodulation treatment, and we have been working ever since to find a better way to connect providers and patients – with the goal of empowering patients to decide how to access the care they need,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Keith Boettiger</span>, vice president, Neuromodulation, Abbott. ""We are continuing to make these kinds of investments and working with regulatory authorities to make these telehealth changes permanent, as we believe that patients should be able to receive the care they need, regardless of whether they can make it physically to the doctor's office.""

The NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic is compatible with Abbott's suite of neuromodulation technologies, including Infinity™ DBS System for patients with Parkinson's disease and tremors of the upper extremities in adults with essential tremors; Proclaim™ XR SCS System for patients living with chronic pain of the trunk and/or limbs; and Proclaim™ DRG Neurostimulation System for patients with chronic pain in the lower limbs caused by complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia. This integration across all Abbott neuromodulation technologies highlights Abbott's relentless pursuit of patient-centered research and development methodologies that use neuroscience combined with cutting-edge technology to go beyond physical symptom relief to improve the lives of people with neurological disorders.

*Anywhere with a cellular or Wi-Fi connection and sufficiently charged patient controller.

<p align=""justify"">NEW YORK, June 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AXSM), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for AXS-05 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) agitation. AXS-05 is a novel, oral, investigational NMDA receptor antagonist with multimodal activity. This is the second Breakthrough Therapy designation granted to Axsome for AXS-05. There is currently no approved treatment for AD agitation.</p>
<p align=""justify"">A Breakthrough Therapy designation is granted to potentially expedite development and review timelines for a promising investigational medicine when preliminary clinical evidence indicates it may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapies for a serious or life-threatening condition. The Breakthrough Therapy designation for AXS-05 in AD agitation was supported by the recent positive results from the pivotal Phase 2/3 ADVANCE-1 study, a randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter U.S. trial in which 366 Alzheimer’s disease patients were treated with AXS-05, bupropion, or placebo. In this trial, treatment with AXS-05 resulted in a rapid, substantial, and statistically significant improvement in agitation as compared to placebo. On the primary endpoint, AXS-05 demonstrated a statistically significant mean reduction from baseline in the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) total score compared to placebo at Week 5, with mean reductions of 15.4 points for AXS-05 and 11.5 points for placebo (p=0.010). AXS-05 was also superior to bupropion on the CMAI total score (p&lt;0.001), establishing component contribution. AXS-05 was well tolerated and not associated with cognitive impairment or sedation. The most commonly reported adverse events in the AXS-05 arm were somnolence (8.2% for AXS-05 versus 4.1% for bupropion and 3.2% for placebo), dizziness (6.3%, 10.2%, 3.2%, respectively), and diarrhea (4.4%, 6.1%, 4.4%, respectively).</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is an important milestone in the development of AXS-05 for Alzheimer’s disease agitation, a serious, prevalent, and debilitating condition for which there is currently no approved therapy,” said Herriot Tabuteau, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Axsome. “This marks the second Breakthrough Therapy designation received by Axsome for AXS-05, the first being for the treatment of major depressive disorder, and highlights the potential of AXS-05 to address unmet medical needs in multiple difficult-to-treat CNS disorders. We look forward to working with the FDA over the coming months as we advance the development of AXS-05 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease agitation.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Breakthrough Therapy designation is granted by the FDA in order to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. In order to receive Breakthrough Therapy designation, a drug must demonstrate preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides an organizational commitment involving senior managers from the FDA, more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, and greater access to and more frequent communication with the FDA throughout the entire drug development and review process. It also provides the opportunity to submit sections of a New Drug Application (NDA) on a rolling basis, where the FDA may review portions of the NDA as they are received instead of waiting for the entire NDA submission. In addition, Breakthrough Therapy designated products are eligible for Priority Review, where the FDA has a goal to take action on an application within six months, as opposed to ten months under standard review. Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for approval.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Agitation</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, and behavioral and psychological symptoms including agitation. AD is the most common form of dementia and afflicts an estimated 6 million individuals in the United States, a number that is anticipated to increase to approximately 14 million by 2050 [1]. Agitation is reported in up to 70% of patients with AD and is characterized by emotional distress, aggressive behaviors, disruptive irritability, and disinhibition [2]. Agitation in patients with AD has been associated with increased caregiver burden, decreased functioning, accelerated cognitive decline, earlier nursing home placement, and increased mortality [2-4]. There are currently no therapies approved by the FDA for the treatment of agitation in patients with AD.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About AXS-05</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">AXS-05 is a novel, oral, patent-protected, investigational NMDA receptor antagonist with multimodal activity under development for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease agitation, major depressive disorder, and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. AXS-05 consists of a proprietary formulation and dose of dextromethorphan and bupropion and utilizes Axsome’s metabolic inhibition technology. The dextromethorphan component of AXS-05 is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, also known as a glutamate receptor modulator, a sigma-1 receptor agonist, an inhibitor of the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, and an inhibitor of microglial activation. The bupropion component of AXS-05 serves to increase the bioavailability of dextromethorphan, and is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. AXS-05 is covered by more than 42 issued U.S. and international patents which provide protection out to 2034. AXS-05 has been granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Therapy designation for major depressive disorder, Fast Track designation for treatment resistant depression, and Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations for Alzheimer’s disease agitation. AXS-05 is not approved by the FDA.</p>

<p align=""left"">SHANGHAI, China, Sept. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Junshi Biosciences (HKEX: 1877; SSE: 688180), a leading innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) to Toripalimab for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Toripalimab is the first anti-PD-1 antibody from China to receive the Breakthrough Therapy designation, which is another important regulatory milestone for Toripalimab after FDA granted orphan drug designation for this indication in May 2020.</p>
“The Breakthrough Therapy designation granted by FDA recognizes the significant clinical benefits Toripalimab has shown for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma,” commented Dr. Ning Li, Chief Executive Officer of Junshi Biosciences. “Junshi prioritizes cancer types with high prevalence in China such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung and liver cancer, but we found that great unmet medical needs also exist in other countries where patients are endangered by this deadly disease. The BTD will allow us to work with the FDA closely to bring the therapy to patients worldwide expeditiously.”

The Breakthrough Therapy designation is derived from the provisions of the US Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) and aims to expedite the development and review process of drugs intended to treat a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may result in substantial improvement over available therapies on a clinically significant endpoint. BTD is another important new drug review channel for the FDA following the fast track, accelerated approval, and priority review. According to regulations, the drug development process that has obtained breakthrough drug therapy certification will receive closer guidance and various forms of support, including from senior FDA officials, to ensure that patients are provided with new treatment options in the shortest time. The FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for Toripalimab for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma can significantly support and accelerate the commercial development plan of Toripalimab in the United States.

<strong>About NPC
</strong>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that occurs in the mucosal epithelium of the nasopharynx, mostly in the parietal and lateral walls of the nasopharynx, especially in the pharyngeal recess. There were 129,000 new cases worldwide in 2018. NPC is one of the most common malignant tumors in China. The incidence of NPC in Chinese population is significantly higher than the world average. It is particularly higher in certain geographical areas. For example, the annual incidence of NPC in Guangdong is 20 to 40 per 100,000. Early nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients have a good therapeutic effect with 90% can be cured or be tumor-free for a long time. However, early nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients lack specific clinical symptoms. About 80% of them have entered the middle and advanced stage when clinically diagnosed, with lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis. After development of distant metastasis, the 5-year survival rate is less than 50%.
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Toripalimab
</strong>Toripalimab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed by Junshi Biosciences.</p>
Toripalimab received its first approval for 2nd line treatment of metastatic melanoma on December 17, 2018 in China and was commercially launched in February 2019. So far, more than 30 clinical studies covering more than ten indications have been carried out in China, the United States and other countries.

In April 2020, the supplemental New Drug Application (“NDA”) of Toripalimab Injection for the treatment of new indications of recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma after failure of second-line and above systemic treatment has been accepted by the NMPA. The supplemental NDA is the world’s first NDA of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In addition, JUPITER-02 study (NCT03581786), a Phase III clinical study of Toripalimab Injection combined with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma has completed the enrollment. In May 2020, the supplemental NDA of Toripalimab Injection for the treatment of new indications of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma after systemic treatment has been accepted by the NMPA.

In March 2020, Toripalimab in combination with axitinib in the treatment of mucosal melanoma was granted the orphan-drug designation by the FDA. In May 2020, Toripalimab was granted the orphan-drug designation by the FDA in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

<strong>Basel, December 16, 2020</strong> — Novartis today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted iptacopan (LNP023) Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) Designation in C3 glomerulopathy (C3G).

The breakthrough designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines for serious conditions to address unmet medical need, where early clinical evidence indicates a drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on clinically significant endpoints. The FDA granted BTD to iptacopan for the treatment of PNH based on positive interim results from two ongoing Phase II studies, where iptacopan showed substantial benefits both in patients who remained anemic and dependent on transfusions despite standard of care anti-complement treatment<sup>8</sup>, as well as monotherapy in anti-C5 naïve PNH patients.

PNH is a rare and life threatening blood disorder characterized by complement-driven hemolysis, thrombosis and impaired bone marrow function<sup>9,10</sup>, resulting in anemia, fatigue and other debilitating symptoms that can impact patients’ quality of life<sup>1<em>–</em>3</sup>. Despite current standard of care – anti-C5 therapy eculizumab or ravulizumab – a large proportion of PNH patients remain anemic and dependent on transfusions<sup>1,2,9,11,12</sup>.

FDA grants the rare pediatric designation for serious or life-threatening diseases primarily affecting individuals aged 18 years or younger and impacting fewer than 200,000 people. C3G, an ultra-rare and severe form of primary glomerulonephritis<sup>4,13</sup>, is characterized by complement dysregulation. It has a poor prognosis; about 50% of patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years, and 50–70% experience disease recurrence post kidney transplant<sup>14</sup>. It has a worldwide annual incidence of 1-2 per million<sup>15</sup>.

<strong>About iptacopan</strong>
Iptacopan (LNP023) is a first-in-class, orally administered, potent and highly selective factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway<sup>6,7</sup>. It is currently in clinical development for PNH, as well as C3G and a number of other renal conditions with complement system involvement where significant unmet needs exist, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and membranous nephropathy (MN).

Positive Phase II data from one study in PNH were presented at the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) congress in August<sup>8</sup>, and Phase II interim analysis results in C3G were presented at the virtual 2020 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) in October. Novartis is planning to initiate Phase III studies in several indications.

Iptacopan has the potential to become the first complement pathway inhibitor to slow disease progression in a number of complement-driven diseases. Based on disease prevalence and the positive interim data from Phase II studies, iptacopan has also received orphan drug designations from the FDA and EMA in C3G and PNH<sup>16</sup>, as well as EMA PRIME designation for C3G<sup>17</sup>, and EMA orphan drug designation in IgAN<sup>18</sup>.

(NYSE: ZYME), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing multifunctional biotherapeutics, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for zanidatamab in patients with previously-treated HER2 gene-amplified biliary tract cancer (BTC).</p>

<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“This milestone supports our strategy for accelerated approval and will help make zanidatamab available for patients as quickly as possible.”</p>

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201130005339/en/Zymeworks-Receives-FDA-Breakthrough-Therapy-Designation-for-HER2-Targeted-Bispecific-Antibody-Zanidatamab-in-Patients-with-Biliary-Tract-Cancer#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA grants Breakthrough Therapy designation to new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and where clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. Zanidatamab will now be eligible for Accelerated Approval, Priority Review and Rolling Review, as well as intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“This Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA, based on data generated in BTC patients treated in the initial Phase 1 trial, is recognition of the potential of zanidatamab to provide a new approach to cancer treatment,” said Diana Hausman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Zymeworks. “This milestone supports our strategy for accelerated approval and will help make zanidatamab available for patients as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“BTC is a rare and aggressive cancer,” said James Priour, Senior Vice President, Commercial, at Zymeworks. “Receiving this designation from the FDA is testament to the potential of zanidatamab to be the first HER2-targeting therapy approved for metastatic BTC patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Earlier this year, Zymeworks initiated a global Phase 2b registration-enabling study of single agent zanidatamab in patients with previously treated HER2 gene-amplified BTC. This study, which is currently enrolling patients, is designed to support accelerated approval based on a primary endpoint of objective response rate, and secondary endpoints of duration of response and safety and may enable submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as early as 2022.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This Breakthrough Therapy designation was based on an ongoing clinical trial of zanidatamab in patients with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic HER2-expressing tumors including BTC. Updated clinical data for single agent zanidatamab patients with BTC has been accepted for presentation at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology’s Virtual Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (ASCO GI) January 15-17, 2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Zanidatamab</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Zanidatamab is a bispecific antibody, based on Zymeworks’ Azymetric™ platform, that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2, known as biparatopic binding. This unique design results in multiple mechanisms of action including dual HER2 signal blockade, increased binding, and removal of HER2 protein from the cell surface, and potent effector function leading to encouraging antitumor activity in patients. Zymeworks is developing zanidatamab in multiple Phase 1, Phase 2, and registration-enabling clinical trials globally as a targeted treatment option for patients with solid tumors that express HER2. In addition to Breakthrough Therapy designation for zanidatamab in BTC, the U.S. FDA has granted two Fast Track designations to zanidatamab, one as a single agent for refractory BTC and one in combination with standard of care chemotherapy, for first-line gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA). Zanidatamab has also received Orphan Drug designations for the treatment of biliary tract, gastric and ovarian cancers from the U.S. FDA, as well as Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of gastric cancer from the European Medicines Agency.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Biliary Tract Cancer</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Biliary tract cancer (BTC), including gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), accounts for approximately 3% of all adult cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. Globally, more than 210,000 people are diagnosed with BTC every year. Most patients (&gt; 65%) with BTC are diagnosed with tumors that cannot be removed surgically, and even those patients who undergo potentially curative surgery have a high recurrence rate. Treatment options are limited for patients with advanced BTC who experience disease progression after front-line chemotherapy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a well-described target for anti-cancer therapy. Tumor cells that produce a higher than normal level of HER2 tend to grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body. About 5% to 19% of patients with BTC have tumors that express HER2, suggesting that these patients may potentially benefit from HER2-targeted therapy.<i> </i>Currently no HER2-targeted therapy has been approved for the treatment of BTC.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">IO102 and IO103 are IO Biotech's lead immuno-oncology candidates. Both compounds are based on IO Biotech's proprietary T-win® technology platform which enables the identification of compounds with a dual mechanism of action targeting and directly killing immunosuppressive cells and tumor cells while indirectly activating other T-effectors, leading to strong anti-tumor responses without adding additional safety concern. Specifically, IO102 and IO103 are first-in-class, immune modulatory vaccines designed to engage and activate IDO and PD-L1 specific human T-cells.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy was based on data from the MM1636 Phase 1/2 clinical trial with 30 patients with metastatic melanoma receiving IO102, IO103 and anti-PD-1. According to the data recently presented in a late-breaking abstract at t<b>he European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020</b>, the combination of IO102 and IO103 vaccines and nivolumab was shown to be safe with encouraging early efficacy data; an overall response rate (ORR) of 79 percent was reached and 45 percent of patients achieved a complete response (CR), or complete disappearance of their tumors. Vaccine specific T-cells were located in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and at the tumor site. <b> </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""A breakthrough designation is an expedited program in which FDA will work closely with IO Biotech to provide guidance on subsequent development of ""<i>Synthetic Peptide Vaccines (IO103) Encoding Human PD-L1 (9-27) and (IO102), targeted to IDO, Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and anti-PD-1"" for treatment of unresectable/metastatic melanoma, including providing advice on generating evidence needed to support approval of the drug in an efficient and potentially expedited manner</i>"","" said Mai-Britt Zocca, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and founder of IO Biotech. ""This is an important achievement for IO Biotech's clinical program and we are committed to bring this forward to patients as soon as possible.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About MM1636 trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The MM1636 trial is an investigator-initiated trial at the <span class=""xn-org"">Copenhagen University</span> Hospital, Herlev which entered 30 patients with metastatic melanoma. In this Phase 2 clinical trial, patients were treated with IO Biotech's multi antigen vaccine, IO102-IO103 in combination with anti PD-1 antibody, as first line treatment. IO102-IO103 are administered every second week until 12 weeks and thereafter every fourth week up to one year. The trial objectives are to assess safety, immune responses in blood and biopsies as well as efficacy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Melanoma<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Globally, about 290,000 new cases of cutaneous melanoma, the most aggressive type of skin cancer, are diagnosed and annually more than 60,000 will die (<span class=""xn-location"">Bray</span> et al. 2018). The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is increasing (Forman et al. 2014) and advanced melanoma (unresectable or metastatic) will have a fatal outcome if left untreated. The median overall survival (OS) in patients with stage IV melanoma (untreated or treated with BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor) is between 22-25 months and a 3-5-year OS is around 40% (Ascierto et al. 2016; Long et al. 2017).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Therefore, there is a clear unmet need for improved combination therapies enhancing anti-PD-1 efficacy without a significant increase in toxicity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About IO Biotech<br class=""dnr"" /></b>IO Biotech is a clinical stage biotech company developing disruptive immune therapies for the treatment of cancer. The pipeline of first-in-class immune modulating anti-cancer therapies is developed by a unique technology platform, T-win®, enabling the activation of T cells that are specific for immune-suppressive molecules. IO Biotech has a proven track record of progressing preclinical and clinical compounds. The two lead compounds targeting IDO and PD-L1 are in clinical development and several pipeline compounds are in pre-clinical phase.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation is an FDA process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition so patients may have access to therapies through FDA approval as soon as possible. This designation is granted based on preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the field of anti-infective drugs is rather rare, and further supports the urgency to develop new innovative therapies to prevent SSIs,” said Amir Weisberg, PolyPid’s CEO. “It also reflects on the promising clinical data of D-PLEX<sub>100</sub> in the prevention of SSIs in complex surgical settings, such as colorectal abdominal surgeries. We are looking forward to working closely with the FDA to make D-PLEX<sub>100</sub> available to surgeons and patients as quickly as possible. Our ongoing Phase 3 pivotal studies in abdominal surgery - SHIELD I and SHIELD II - are on track.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Breakthrough Therapy Designation for D-PLEX<sub>100</sub> is based on conclusive positive results from a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating D-PLEX<sub>100</sub> for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs) in abdominal colorectal surgery. The Phase 2 clinical trial was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled two arm study in 201 patients and demonstrated that the local administration of D-PLEX<sub>100</sub> resulted in a statistically significant decrease in SSIs of 59 percent in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population (p=0.0086), and a decrease of 69 percent in the Per Protocol population (n=179; p=0.0024), as compared to the standard of care alone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">D-PLEX<sub>100</sub> previously received two Fast Track Designations from the FDA for the prevention of post-abdominal surgery incisional infections and for the prevention of sternal wound infections post-cardiac surgery, as well as two Qualified Infectious Disease Product designations (QIDP's) in the same indications.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About D-PLEX</strong><sub><strong>100</strong></sub></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PolyPid’s lead product candidate, D-PLEX<sub>100</sub>, is a novel drug product candidate designed to provide local prolonged and controlled anti-bacterial activity directly at the surgical site to prevent SSIs. Following the administration of D-PLEX<sub>100</sub> into the surgical site, the PLEX technology enables a prolonged and constant release of the broad-spectrum antibiotic doxycycline, resulting in high local concentration of the drug for a period of four weeks for the prevention of SSIs, with additional potential to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria at the surgical site. D-PLEX<sub>100</sub> has received two Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designations as well as two Fast Track designations from the FDA for the prevention of post-abdominal surgery incisional infection and for the prevention of sternal wound infection post-cardiac surgery.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","WALTHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Oct. 5, 2020– ImmunoGen, Inc., (Nasdaq: IMGN) a leader in the expanding field of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of cancer, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for IMGN632 for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).

“We are pleased FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for IMGN632, our novel CD123-targeted ADC, as it underscores the urgent need for effective and well-tolerated treatments for patients with this rare and aggressive cancer,” said Mark Enyedy, ImmunoGen’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We look forward to continuing to work with FDA to further define the development path for IMGN632 in BPDCN, in addition to pursuing our ongoing evaluation of IMGN632 in AML and other hematological malignancies.”

According to FDA guidelines, Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and have generated preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted for IMGN632 based on the findings from the BPDCN cohort of the first-in-human study of IMGN632, for which initial data were presented in an oral session at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in 2019. Updated data from the IMGN632 monotherapy BPDCN dose expansion cohort will be presented at ASH this December.

ABOUT IMGN632
IMGN632 is a CD123-targeting ADC in clinical development for hematological malignancies, including blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). IMGN632 is currently being evaluated in multiple cohorts, including monotherapy for patients with BPDCN and minimal residual disease positive (MRD+) AML following frontline induction therapy and in combinations with Vidaza® (azacitidine) and Venclexta® (venetoclax) for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. IMGN632 uses one of ImmunoGen’s novel indolino-benzodiazepine (IGN) payloads, which alkylate DNA without crosslinking. IGNs have been designed to have high potency against AML blasts, while demonstrating less toxicity to normal marrow progenitors than other DNA-targeting payloads.

ABOUT BLASTIC PLASMACYTOID DENDRITIC CELL NEOPLASM
BPDCN is a rare form of blood cancer that has features of both leukemia and lymphoma, with characteristic skin lesions, lymph node involvement, and frequent spread to the bone marrow. This aggressive cancer requires intense treatment often followed by stem cell transplant. Despite the recent approval of a CD123-targeting therapy, the unmet need remains high for patients, particularly in the relapsed/refractory setting.

ABOUT IMMUNOGEN
ImmunoGen is developing the next generation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to improve outcomes for cancer patients. By generating targeted therapies with enhanced anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability profiles, we aim to disrupt the progression of cancer and offer our patients more good days. We call this our commitment to “target a better now.”

<strong>Osaka, Japan, and Brisbane, Calif. March 9, 2021 – </strong>Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced the exercise of its option to acquire Maverick Therapeutics, Inc. a private biopharmaceutical company pioneering conditionally active bispecific T-cell targeted immunotherapies. Under the agreement, Takeda will obtain Maverick’s T-cell engager COBRA™ platform and a broad development portfolio, including Maverick’s lead development candidate TAK-186 (MVC-101) currently in a Phase 1/2 study for the treatment of EGFR-expressing solid tumors, and TAK-280 (MVC-280), which is anticipated to enter the clinic in the second half of Takeda’s fiscal year 2021 for the treatment of patients with B7H3-expressing solid tumors. After closing of the transaction, Maverick employees, including its team of talented scientists, will join Takeda’s Research &amp; Development organization.

“Collaboration is paramount to our R&amp;D strategy and our pursuit of novel approaches to treat cancer,” said Chris Arendt, Ph.D., head of the Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit of Takeda. “By supporting pioneers like Maverick working in emerging areas of science, we can share expertise, resources and risk to bring transformational new therapies to patients faster. Maverick’s cutting-edge COBRA platform is an exciting addition to our oncology portfolio that provides a novel conditional bioengineering approach to advance redirected immunotherapies against solid tumors.”

Maverick’s COBRA platform is designed to safely target a broad range of solid tumors with highly specific and potent activity while limiting toxicities in normal tissues. Unlike standard T-cell engaging immunotherapies that are systemically active when administered, COBRA-engineered, protein-based therapies are engineered to exploit the tumor microenvironment, triggering T-cell-mediated killing only at the site of the tumor while sparing damage to patients’ healthy tissues. The COBRA platform complements Takeda’s approach to redirecting immune cells to target cancer with the potential to unlock efficacy in solid tumors.

The acquisition follows a <a href=""https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2017/Maverick-Therapeutics-and-Takeda-Announce-Five-year-Collaboration-to-Advance/"">multi-year collaboration between Takeda and Maverick signed in 2017</a> to develop conditionally active T-cell engager therapies, in which Takeda received an equity stake and an exclusive right to purchase Maverick after five years. Based on the success of the lead programs and the promise of the COBRA platform, Takeda exercised its option to acquire Maverick for a pre-negotiated upfront payment as well as potential development and regulatory milestones totaling up to $525 million, subject to certain adjustments, including for Takeda’s current equity stake and Maverick debt. The deal is expected to be finalized in Q1 of Takeda’s fiscal year 2021. Closing of the transaction is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S.

“Takeda’s exercise of their purchase option is a tribute to the Maverick team’s singular focus on improving outcomes for patients with solid tumor cancers,” said James Scibetta, CEO of Maverick Therapeutics. “Through the acquisition, patients will benefit from the expansion of resources and experience Takeda brings to accelerate development of our COBRA-derived therapies. Takeda has been an excellent partner since Maverick’s inception, venerating our independence through a period marked by rapid innovation, providing actionable consultation, and providing direct cell line development and manufacturing support through the COVID-19 pandemic to keep us on our aggressive schedule”

<strong>Basel, March 9, 2021</strong> — Novartis announced today the Phase III CANOPY-2 study evaluating canakinumab (ACZ885), an inhibitor of interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß), in combination with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel, did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS)<sup>1</sup>. The trial was conducted among 237 adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed while on or after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitor immunotherapy<sup>4</sup><strong><em>. </em></strong>Two Phase III CANOPY trials continue, evaluating canakinumab in first-line and adjuvant settings<sup>2,3</sup>. Novartis and CANOPY-2 investigators will analyze the study data and are expected to submit its findings for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.

“While results from the CANOPY-2 trial are not what we hoped for in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have been treated with other lines of therapy, these data give us valuable insights into IL-1ß inhibition,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “Ongoing Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer continue, evaluating canakinumab in earlier treatment settings. We sincerely thank the patients and clinical investigators involved in the CANOPY-2 study for their partnership.”

CANOPY-1, a Phase III study evaluating canakinumab in combination with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, is expected to report final results before the end of the year<sup>2</sup>. CANOPY-A, another Phase III study, is investigating canakinumab as an adjuvant therapy and has enrolled more than 950 patients to date and is expected to enroll a total of 1,500 patients<sup>3</sup>.

<strong>About canakinumab (ACZ885)</strong>
Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and selectivity to human interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)<sup>6</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>7</sup> and neutralizes IL-1ß activity by blocking its interaction with its receptors<sup>8</sup>. By neutralizing IL-1ß, preliminary evidence suggests that canakinumab inhibits pro-tumor inflammation (PTI) to 1) enhance anti-tumor immune response; 2) reduce tumor cell proliferation, survival and invasiveness; and 3) impair angiogenesis<sup>8</sup>. Pro-tumor inflammation enables tumor development by driving cancer-causing processes and by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses<sup>9,10</sup>. Canakinumab is a first-in-class interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß) inhibitor of PTI in non-small cell lung cancer<sup>10</sup>.

<strong>About the CANOPY program</strong>
Novartis launched the CANOPY study program after observing significantly lower than expected rates of lung cancer mortality among patients in the Phase III cardiovascular CANTOS trial. The CANTOS trial evaluated canakinumab as a secondary prevention measure for cardiovascular events in patients following a heart attack (CRP=2 mg/L)<sup>8,9</sup>. Patients in the CANTOS trial were also at high risk for inflammatory cancers, like lung cancer, due to advanced age, smoking history and other clinical risk factors<sup>8,9</sup>. Based on these findings, Novartis launched three, large-scale, randomized, Phase III clinical trials and a Phase II clinical trial to investigate canakinumab as a potential treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
<ul>
 	<li><strong>CANOPY-1 (NCT03631199)</strong> is a Phase III trial evaluating canakinumab as a first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy<sup>2</sup></li>
 	<li><strong>CANOPY-2 (NCT03626545</strong>) is a Phase III trial investigating the role of canakinumab in combination with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel in second- or third-line therapy versus docetaxel alone in NSCLC. Part 1 of the CANOPY-2 trial – a safety run-in study to determine the appropriate dosage, was previously presented at ASCO 2019. Part 2 of the trial, reported today, evaluated overall survival (OS)<sup>4</sup></li>
 	<li><strong>CANOPY-A (NCT03447769)</strong> is a Phase III trial studying canakinumab in the adjuvant setting, following surgical resection and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The adjuvant study is designed to determine if treatment with canakinumab can prevent cancer relapse<sup>3</sup></li>
 	<li><strong>CANOPY-N (NCT03968419)</strong> is a non-registrational Phase II neoadjuvant trial evaluating canakinumab in combination with pembrolizumab among patients with resectable NSCLC prior to their planned surgery<sup>5</sup></li>
</ul>
<strong>Novartis and Lung Cancer  </strong>
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for more than 2 million new cases diagnosed each year<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>. There are two main types of lung cancer – small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>. NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer diagnoses, resulting in nearly 1.7 million new cases each year<sup>11</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>1</sup><sup>3</sup>. Currently, the five-year survival rate for lung cancer is less than 20%<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>, decreasing further when the disease is diagnosed at later stages<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>. The majority of people with NSCLC are diagnosed with advanced or Stage III or IV disease<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>, and treatment options are limited for people with lung cancer who experience cancer growth or progression while on standard of care treatments<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>19</sup>. More people die of lung cancer every year than any other cancer type<sup>11</sup>. Novartis is committed to developing best-in-class treatments for lung cancer patients around the world. With a focus on both targeted, personalized medicine and the role of newer, immuno-oncology therapies, the lung cancer drug development program at Novartis is among the most robust in the industry. With research activities informed by long-term relationships with leading lung cancer thought leaders and patient advocates, Novartis is focused on reimagining the treatment of lung cancer.

<b>London, 9 March 2021 –</b> ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, presented positive data from its phase IIa proof-of-concept study of the investigational maturation inhibitor GSK3640254 (GSK’254). The study showed the antiviral activity of GSK’254, establishing a relationship between dose and antiviral response, with the 140 mg and 200 mg doses showing the greatest reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA. These findings were presented today at the (virtual) 2021 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI).

Maturation inhibitors are a class of antiretroviral medicines that target the late stage of the HIV viral life cycle. They can prevent the HIV replication process by blocking key enzyme activity at this stage, which results in the formation of immature virus particles. Because maturation inhibitors use a unique mechanism of action that targets HIV differently than other antiretrovirals currently available, they have the potential to offer new treatment options for individuals who may have experienced resistance to other classes of HIV treatment.

<b>Kimberly Smith, M.D., MPH, Head of Research &amp; Development at ViiV Healthcare, said:</b> “It isn’t uncommon for individuals to experience a treatment failure over the course of their lifetime with HIV, making medicines that use new mechanisms of action to treat HIV essential in our efforts to end this epidemic. Because there are no treatments available that target this specific stage of the HIV life cycle, maturation inhibitors may help meet a critical need, particularly for individuals who are treatment experienced. These positive proof-of-concept findings show the potential of GSK’254 and underscore our commitment to researching and developing a broad range of innovative approaches to treating HIV.”

The phase IIa study was adaptive in design and divided into two parts to evaluate the antiviral activity, safety, and tolerability of once-daily GSK’254 among 34 treatment-naïve adults living with HIV. In part one, participants received GSK’254 10 mg, 200 mg, or placebo for 10 days. A planned interim analysis showed treatment emergent resistance associated mutations in the 200 mg arm after dosing was complete. As a result, in part two, participants received GSK’254 40 mg, 80 mg, 140 mg, or placebo for a shortened period of seven days. The primary endpoint was the maximum change in plasma HIV-1 RNA during parts one and two while secondary endpoints measured safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters.

At the conclusion of the study, the largest mean changes in viral load were -1.5 log<sub>10</sub> and -2.0 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml in the 140 mg and 200 mg groups, respectively.

Treatment with GSK’254 was generally well-tolerated throughout the study. There were no adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation and no deaths reported. AEs were reported by 22 (65%) participants, with the most common being headache (n=4).

<b>Christoph Spinner, M.D., Department of Internal Medicine II at Technical University of Munich, Hospital Rechts der Isar, said: </b>“Because of HIV’s tendency to develop resistance to treatment over time, there is a need to improve the number of treatment options available for people living with HIV. The antiviral, safety, and tolerability findings observed in this proof-of-concept study show the potential of this maturation inhibitor and warrant its continued study as an effective new treatment option for people living with HIV.”

ViiV Healthcare has begun the phase IIb study of GSK’254, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this maturation inhibitor as part of a combination therapy for treatment naïve adults living with HIV.

Pegloprastide is designed to deliver a fluorescent marker to cancer cells to aid surgeons in identifying positive margins in real time during surgery. Positive margins can be a sign that cancer may be left behind, requiring a second surgery.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We now have clarity on the development path to make fluorescence image-guided surgery the new standard of care for breast cancer lumpectomies,” said Jay Lichter, Ph.D., Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Avelas. “Pegloprastide has the potential to greatly reduce the number of repeat surgeries, potentially improving outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women and saving thousands of lives.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The presence of positive margins is a significant challenge in breast-conserving surgery. Positive surgical margins occur when post-operative pathology indicates cancer cells are present at or very close to the edge of removed tissue, indicating that there may be residual cancer left behind after an operation. It is estimated that each year in the United States more than 260,000 women undergo a lumpectomy, of which one-third (more than 80,000) are repeat surgeries with the goal of achieving negative margins.<sup>1</sup> Beyond that, of the estimated 90,000 women who choose a mastectomy, many choose it for fear of incomplete initial lumpectomy or due to an initial attempt at a lumpectomy that resulted in positive margins.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is under investigation to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A Breakthrough Therapy designation provides more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.</p>

The data showed use of pegloprastide during surgery correctly identified cancer in up to 75% of patients who would have otherwise been candidates for a repeat (re-excision) surgery<i>. </i>Observed re-excision rate in the study was 6% in patients whose surgeries included pegloprastide. Current re-excision rates are estimated at 20-40% among all patients receiving an initial lumpectomy.<sup> 2-7</sup></p>

This is the second Breakthrough Therapy Designation for olorofim; a designation was granted previously on <a href=""https://www.f2g.com/news"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><span class=""xn-chron"">11 November 2019</span></a> for '<i>Treatment of invasive mold infections in patients with limited or no treatment options, including aspergillosis refractory orintolerant tocurrently available therapy, and infections due to Lomentospora prolificans, Scedosporium, and Scopulariopsis species'</i>. Olorofim (formerly F901318) is the first antifungal agent to be granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Olorofim has orphan drug designation in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> for coccidioidomycosis, an endemic fungal infection with a geographic distribution focused mainly in the desert Southwest of <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> but also including <span class=""xn-location"">Mexico</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Central America</span>, and <span class=""xn-location"">South America</span>. Infection begins by inhalation and can spread to any part of the body, even in otherwise healthy individuals. Spread to the brain is particularly feared as it produces a devastating illness that cannot always be controlled with any currently available agent.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Patients with coccidioidomycosis are being studied in an ongoing open-label single-arm Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span> study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03583164) in patients with proven invasive fungal disease (IFD) or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) and either refractory disease, resistance, or intolerance to available agents. Olorofim has been well tolerated across more than 30 years of cumulative patient dosing days with a median therapy duration of 12 weeks. Preliminary data from this study were provided to the FDA as part of the Breakthrough Therapy Designation submission.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation is an FDA process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and is granted based on preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation conveys all the features of fast track designation, more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organisational commitment by FDA to involve senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Commenting on the news, <span class=""xn-person"">Ian Nicholson</span>, CEO of F2G Ltd, said:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""The granting of a second FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation will further support our goal of rapidly developing this novel treatment for patients suffering from serious and life-threatening fungal infections. Olorofim acts via a novel and differentiated mechanism to traditional antifungals, and preliminary data have indicated that it is efficacious in tackling life-threatening invasive fungal infections that cannot be managed with currently approved agents.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""Our Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span> programme is on track with over 85 patients recruited in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span>, and the US. We look forward to working closely with the US FDA to accelerate development of this therapy for patients having limited or no approved treatment options for an invasive mold infection.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Professor <span class=""xn-person"">George Thompson</span>, UC Davis and Investigator for the Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span> study said:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""This news is very exciting for clinicians caring for patients with Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis) as spread to the brain is the most-feared complication of infection with this fungus. Unfortunately, available drugs are not curative, must be administered as life-long therapy, and are associated with substantial toxicity. The news that olorofim has encouraging preliminary clinical data that support Breakthrough Therapy Designation brings realistic hope that we can change the paradigm for managing this devastating infection.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Olorofim / Clinical trial</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span> study for olorofim (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03583164) is a global open-label study in patients who have limited treatment options for difficult-to-treat invasive fungal mold infections such as azole-resistant aspergillosis, scedosporiosis, lomentosporiosis, and other rare mold infections. More than 40 centres are currently open in nine countries (AU, BE, DE, ES, IS, NL, TH, UK, <span class=""xn-location"">USA</span>) and a further 10 will open in 2020/2021. Olorofim is being developed both as IV and oral formulations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About F2G</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">F2G is a world-leading UK- and <span class=""xn-location"">Austria</span>-based biotech company (F2G Ltd and F2G Biotech GmbH) focused on the discovery and development of novel therapies to treat life-threatening invasive fungal infections. F2G has discovered and developed a completely new class of antifungal agents called the orotomides. The orotomides selectively target fungal dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. This is a completely different mechanism from that of the currently marketed antifungal agents and gives the orotomides fungicidal activity against a broad range of rare and resistant fungal mold infections. Olorofim (formerly, F901318) is F2G's leading candidate from this class and is in a Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span> open-label study focussing on rare and resistant invasive fungal infections such as aspergillosis (including azole-resistant strains), scedosporiosis (including lomentosporiosis). Olorofim has received orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive scedosporiosis. Olorofim has received orphan drug status from the US FDA for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis, lomentosporiosis/scedosporiosis, and invasive aspergillosis. Olorofim has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation Invasive for aspergillosis, invasive scedosporiosis, invasive lomentosporiosis, coccidioidomycosis, invasive disease due to Scopulariopsis species, and invasive fusariosis. Olorofim is being developed both as IV and oral formulations. <a href=""http://www.f2g.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.f2g.com</a></p>

st July 2020. Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, ‘Telix’, the ‘Company’) today announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy (BT) designation for Telix’s renal cancer imaging product TLX250-CDx ( 89Zrgirentuximab). Under BT status, the FDA will work closely with Telix to provide guidance to the Company on the development of TLX250-CDx for the diagnosis of “indeterminate renal masses” that have been identified on CT or MRI imaging. TLX250-CDx is being developed for the purpose of determining whether such “indeterminate renal masses” are either clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) or non-ccRCC, using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.
BT designation offers a number of significant benefits to Telix, including eligibility for Fast Track designation, more frequent and intensive interactions with the FDA, and the opportunity to submit a “rolling” Biological Licence Application (BLA) for TLX250-CDx, where the application can be submitted in separate modules to streamline the FDA review process for approval. The criteria for BT designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the product may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available care.
Telix CEO Dr Christian Behrenbruch said, “The granting of Breakthrough designation by the FDA for our kidney cancer imaging product provides Telix with the opportunity to interact closely with the FDA to expedite the registration process of TLX250-CDx, a particularly important consideration given the current Phase III development status of the asset. There is a significant unmet medical need to improve diagnosis and staging of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which is the most common and aggressive form of kidney cancer. It’s encouraging that the Agency recognizes this.”
About Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited Telix is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of diagnostic and therapeutic products using Molecularly Targeted Radiation (MTR). Telix is headquartered in Melbourne with international operations in Belgium, Japan and the United States. Telix is developing a portfolio of clinical-stage oncology products that address significant unmet medical needs in prostate, kidney and brain cancer.

SAN DIEGO, March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) today announced major progress in the development of COVISHIELD through the license of intellectual property developed by the scientific team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (“Mount Sinai”). Sorrento and Mount Sinai have entered into an Exclusive License Agreement for a collection of antibodies having SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing properties that were developed by Mount Sinai.

The license also contemplates Sorrento and Mount Sinai pursuing future collaborations in developing humanized monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic applications.

COVISHIELD, which is under development, will be a combination of two monoclonal antibodies designed to protect against disease caused by existing and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. Using the early pandemic variants as well as the emerging variants of concern (“VOCs”) that have increased in prevalence globally through the course of the pandemic, Sorrento identified candidate monoclonal antibody combinations, or “cocktails”, with potent activity against the breadth of these VOCs, including the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and Japan/Brazil (B.1.128) variants. Positive results from these laboratory studies are expected to support the future research path and FDA evaluation of COVISHIELD.

COVISHIELD represents a coordination of the discovery and development resources of Sorrento, incorporating intellectual property developed by Mount Sinai, in order to provide a rapid and dynamic means of responding to changes in the public health burden posed by coronaviruses and similar pandemic threat pathogens. Sorrento is developing capabilities and solutions with a goal of contributing to pandemic readiness.

Sorrento Chairman and CEO, Dr. Henry Ji, commented, “We are pleased with the excellent COVISHIELD antibody candidates identified thus far, and we at Sorrento are committed to rapidly developing the COVISHIELD cocktail against known and emerging COVID-19 variants of concern. Sorrento looks forward to future collaborations with the respected research capabilities of Mount Sinai centered on the development of innovative anti-viral and anti-cancer therapeutic candidates.”

There are currently no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, resulting in patchy or complete hair loss.</p>

<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“Our goal is to bring this potential new therapy to patients as quickly as possible. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to expedite the development of CTP-543.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines aimed at treating a serious or life-threatening disease where there is preliminary clinical evidence that the investigational therapy may offer substantial improvement over existing therapies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“We are pleased that the FDA has recognized the therapeutic potential of CTP-543 as a new treatment in development for alopecia areata,” said Roger Tung, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Concert Pharmaceuticals. “Our goal is to bring this potential new therapy to patients as quickly as possible. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to expedite the development of CTP-543.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for CTP-543 is supported by positive data from a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe alopecia areata. In September 2019, Concert reported that patients treated with either 8 mg twice-daily or 12 mg twice-daily of CTP-543 met the primary efficacy endpoint with statistically significant differences (p &lt;0.001) relative to placebo in the percentage of patients achieving a = 50% relative change from baseline at 24 weeks as measured by Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT). The 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily groups were also significantly different from placebo in the number of patients achieving a SALT score of 20 or less at 24 weeks, which is the primary efficacy endpoint that Concert intends to utilize in its pivotal registration studies. Treatment with CTP-543 was generally well tolerated, with one serious adverse event reported in the 12 mg dose group where the patient was able to complete the trial after a brief dose interruption.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As the next step in the CTP-543 clinical program, Concert intends to initiate its Phase 3 clinical program in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CTP-543 has also received Fast Track designation in the U.S. for the treatment of alopecia areata.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Additional information about the CTP-543 Phase 2 results is available in the <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.concertpharma.com%2Fplatform%2Fscientific-presentations%2F&amp;esheet=52246584&amp;newsitemid=20200708005133&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Scientific+Presentations&amp;index=2&amp;md5=c146a09f4ec0b6d0639ce01a1e26e5fe"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" shape=""rect"">Scientific Presentations</a> section of the Company’s website.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About the Phase 2 Trial Design of CTP-543 in Alopecia Areata</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Phase 2 trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential dose trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTP-543 in adult patients with moderate-to-severe alopecia areata. A total of 149 patients were randomized to receive one of three doses of CTP-543 (4 mg, 8 mg or 12 mg) or placebo, administered twice-daily. The primary outcome measure utilized the SALT score after 24 weeks of dosing. The average baseline SALT score across all patients was approximately 88%, where 0% is no scalp hair loss and 100% represents total scalp hair loss.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About CTP-543 and Alopecia Areata</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CTP-543 is an oral selective inhibitor of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for CTP-543 for the treatment of alopecia areata. The Company intends to advance CTP-543 into Phase 3 evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, resulting in partial or complete loss of hair on the scalp and body. Alopecia areata may affect approximately 700,000 Americans at any given time<sup>1</sup>. The scalp is the most commonly affected area, but any hair-bearing site can be affected alone or together with the scalp. Onset of the disease can occur throughout life and affects both women and men. Alopecia areata can be associated with serious psychological consequences, including anxiety and depression. There are currently no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of alopecia areata.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA selected alopecia areata as one of eight new disease areas that it focused on under its Patient-Focused Drug Development Initiative (PFDDI) in 2016-2017. The goal of the PFDDI is to bring patient perspectives into an earlier stage of product development. Following the FDA’s Patient-Focused Drug Development meeting held in September 2017 on alopecia areata, the FDA summarized the input shared by patients and patient representatives in a <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fdownloads%2FForIndustry%2FUserFees%2FPrescriptionDrugUserFee%2FUCM602955.pdf&amp;esheet=52246584&amp;newsitemid=20200708005133&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Voice+of+the+Patient&amp;index=3&amp;md5=608fdc962695cc625d46464dfbdb7537"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" shape=""rect"">Voice of the Patient</a> report.

<b>About Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)</b>

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications. It is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately 1 in 11,000 babies. SMA leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual's physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

SMA is caused by mutations or deletions in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that results in reduced levels of SMN protein. SMN protein is produced throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests SMA is a multi-system disorder and the loss of SMN protein may affect many tissues and cells, which can stop the body from functioning.

<b>About the SMA Foundation</b>

The Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Foundation is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to develop treatments for SMA, the leading genetic cause of death in young children. Since its inception, the Foundation has funded over <span class=""xn-money"">$150 million</span> in research and therapeutics development. The Foundation collaborates with leading academic medical centers, the federal government (DoD, NIH, CDC, FDA), and nearly every pharmaceutical company in the world. When the SMA Foundation was established in 2003, there were no treatments for SMA. Due to the Foundation's investments and drug discovery efforts, today there are three FDA-approved drugs.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About WILLOW</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">WILLOW was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, multi-national, Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of brensocatib administered once daily for 24 weeks in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE). WILLOW was conducted at 116 sites and enrolled 256 adult patients diagnosed with NCFBE who had at least two documented pulmonary exacerbations in the 12 months prior to screening. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 10 mg or 25 mg of brensocatib or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to first pulmonary exacerbation over the 24-week treatment period in the brensocatib arms compared to the placebo arm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Brensocatib (Formerly INS1007)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) is a severe, chronic pulmonary disorder in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to a cycle of infection, inflammation, and lung tissue damage. The condition is marked by frequent pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy and/or hospitalizations. Symptoms include chronic cough, excessive sputum production, shortness of breath, and repeated respiratory infections, which can worsen the underlying condition. NCFBE affects approximately 340,000 to 520,000 patients in the U.S. Today, there are no approved therapies specifically targeting NCFBE in the U.S., Europe, or Japan for the treatment of patients with NCFBE.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>About Insmed</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Insmed Incorporated is a global biopharmaceutical company on a mission to transform the lives of patients with serious and rare diseases.

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today presented additional results from the Phase 2/3 CAPELLA trial evaluating the company’s investigational, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, in heavily treatment-experienced people with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection. The data build on the positive primary endpoint results announced previously. The new interim efficacy results demonstrate that lenacapavir administered subcutaneously every six months maintained high rates of virologic suppression through 26 weeks in a difficult-to-treat patient population with limited therapy options and high unmet medical need. In this analysis of the ongoing maintenance period of CAPELLA, which evaluated lenacapavir in combination with an optimized background regimen, 73% (n=19/26) of participants who reached Week 26 since the first dose of subcutaneous lenacapavir achieved undetectable viral load (&lt;50 copies/mL). The data were presented at the 28th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (<i>virtual</i> CROI 2021).

“Some heavily treatment-experienced people with multi-drug resistant HIV are unable to maintain viral suppression with currently available treatment regimens. The CAPELLA trial enrolled people who were failing their regimens with a detectable viral load and had very few remaining options due to multi-drug resistance, which presents a formidable barrier to treatment,” noted Diana Brainard, MD, Senior Vice President, Virology Therapeutic Area, Gilead Sciences. “When treated with lenacapavir plus an optimized background regimen in this study, the majority of participants achieved virologic suppression at 26 weeks of treatment. These interim results from the CAPELLA trial demonstrate lenacapavir’s potential to be a foundational, long-acting agent of future HIV treatment regimens.”

Lenacapavir is being developed as the foundation of a long-acting regimen in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Lenacapavir is a potential first-in-class capsid inhibitor that is designed to inhibit HIV replication as it interferes with the disassembly of the HIV capsid core, inhibits the role of capsid proteins during viral RNA/DNA translocation to the nucleus, and disrupts assembly of the capsid core. If approved, lenacapavir would be the first HIV capsid inhibitor available for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In May 2019, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the development of lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced patients with multi-drug resistance in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.

“Significant advances in antiretroviral therapy have enabled many people living with HIV to achieve viral suppression if adherent to their medications. However, in my practice I still see some people struggle with adherence to a complex regimen, which may lead to difficulty maintaining viral suppression and eventual drug resistance,” said Sorana Segal-Maurer, MD, Director of the Dr. James J. Rahal Jr. Division of Infectious Diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian Queens and the Site Principal Investigator for the CAPELLA study. “These challenges highlight a true unmet need and underscore the importance of new treatment options for heavily treatment-experienced people living with multi-drug resistant HIV, for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen. The CAPELLA results show lenacapavir’s potential value as a long-acting option that can be administered subcutaneously every six months, and as part of a complete treatment regimen to provide viral suppression and overcome resistance for many patients in this important population.”

In addition to the new interim findings from the CAPELLA trial, Gilead also presented the results of a preclinical non-human primate study with GS-CA1, a close lenacapavir analog, for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In the study, one injection of low (150 mg/kg) or high dose (300 mg/kg) GS-CA1 or placebo (n=8 each) was given, followed by weekly escalating titer of rectal SHIV challenges for up to 15 weeks and then monitored to Week 24. Overall, 8/8 animals became infected in the placebo group, whereas 2/8 and 5/8 animals remained protected in the low and high dose GS-CA1 groups, resulting in an 86% (p=0.0061) and 96% (p=0.0002) infection risk reduction, respectively. Notably, treatment group infections occurred only after marked drug washout. These preclinical data demonstrate the potential utility of a long-acting capsid inhibitor to prevent HIV infection and may help advance clinical research evaluating lenacapavir as a potential future monotherapy option for HIV prevention.

An additional lenacapavir for PrEP study in cisgender men, persons of trans experience and gender non-binary individuals who have sex with men is planned. Both trials have projected initiation dates in 2021.

Additional lenacapavir data presented at <i>virtual</i> CROI 2021 provide insight into the investigational agent’s drug interaction potential, dosing response among people living with HIV with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, and resistance profile. Additional data from the CAPELLA study will be presented at a future scientific conference.

Lenacapavir is an investigational compound and is not approved by any regulatory authority for any use and its safety and efficacy are not known. There is no cure for HIV or AIDS.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CAPELLA (NCT04150068)</span></b>

CAPELLA is a Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled global multicenter study designed to evaluate the antiviral activity of Gilead’s investigational, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, in heavily treatment-experienced people with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection. CAPELLA includes men and women living with HIV and is being conducted at research centers in North America, Europe and Asia.

In CAPELLA, 36 participants with multi-class HIV drug resistance and a detectable viral load while on a failing regimen were randomized 2:1 in a blinded fashion to receive oral lenacapavir or placebo for 14 days (randomized cohort), in addition to continuing their failing regimen (functional monotherapy). An additional 36 participants were enrolled to a non-randomized cohort. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants in the randomized cohort achieving = 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL reduction from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at the end of the functional monotherapy period.

The study achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating that a significantly higher proportion of participants in the randomized cohort receiving lenacapavir achieved a clinically meaningful viral load reduction of at least 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL from baseline compared with those receiving placebo during the 14-day functional monotherapy period (88% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.0001). Specifically, those who received lenacapavir (n=24) achieved statistically significantly greater mean decrease in viral load than those who received placebo (n=12) during the functional monotherapy period (-1.93 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL vs. -0.29 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL, p&lt;0.0001).

Following the 14-day functional monotherapy period, participants in the randomized cohort started open-label lenacapavir and an optimized background regimen, while those in the non-randomized cohort received open-label lenacapavir and an optimized background regimen on Day 1. This ongoing maintenance period of the study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous lenacapavir administered every six months in combination with an optimized background regimen.

Lenacapavir was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) observed to date in this study were injection site swelling (22%) and erythema (18%) and nodules (18%). Importantly, there were no serious AEs related to study drug and no AEs leading to discontinuation. Two participants experienced treatment-emergent capsid mutations and later re-suppressed while continuing lenacapavir.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Lenacapavir</span></b>

Lenacapavir is an investigational, long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor in development for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. Lenacapavir's multi-stage mechanism of action profile is distinguishable from currently approved classes of antiviral agents and is designed to provide a new avenue for the development of long-acting regimens for people living with or at risk for HIV. While most antivirals act on just one stage of viral replication, lenacapavir is developed to inhibit HIV at multiple stages of its lifecycle and has no known cross resistance to other existing drug classes.

The safety, efficacy and dosing of lenacapavir are being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical studies.

(Nasdaq: MYOK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to mavacamten, a novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin, for the treatment of symptomatic, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned for use to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">“Receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA acknowledges both the significant unmet need among patients with obstructive HCM, for whom there are currently no targeted therapies, and the highly encouraging clinical results generated by mavacamten.  We look forward to working closely with the FDA in pursuit of regulatory approval so that we may bring mavacamten to people with HCM and remain appreciative of the collaborative approach and valued input the agency has provided throughout mavacamten’s development,” said Tassos Gianakakos, CEO of MyoKardia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">In May, MyoKardia announced <a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9wkOPlyyHWKUd45klHg4B2UjiZExCJpIR2qO6XoH6JBG5JiE04mTaXkL022OSMgc8ZO22QBPj3N7raIpBypvQVL4TgNak6joyvBath9uSUxZQH5Gl7l_CsXzolUHlFsCQBLYmBjYF-3WU_xfYtumdGQBfIqvzxD0gcoA58dXatMNTj-PKKjcqdHyxfemfSjzbTswrljkPcxTvNlFdh5LACrUlMB0IZ4Yux02Jsl_RS4="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>topline results</u></a> from the company’s pivotal Phase 3 EXPLORER clinical trial of mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic patients with obstructive HCM.  Mavacamten was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to placebo, and demonstrated a robust treatment effect, with patients experiencing clinically meaningful responses to treatment, including reductions in symptoms, improvements in cardiac function and reduction or elimination of the obstruction of the left ventricle.  MyoKardia is currently preparing a New Drug Application (NDA) for mavacamten, with plans to submit to the FDA in the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About HCM</strong>
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a chronic, progressive disease in which excessive contraction of the heart muscle and reduced ability of the left ventricle to fill can lead to the development of debilitating symptoms and cardiac dysfunction.  HCM is estimated to affect one in every 500 people. The most frequent cause of HCM is mutations in the heart muscle proteins of the sarcomere. In approximately two-thirds of HCM patients, the path followed by blood exiting the heart, known as the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), becomes obstructed by the enlarged and diseased muscle, restricting the flow of blood from the heart to the rest of the body (obstructive HCM).  In other patients, the thickened heart muscle does not block the LVOT, and their disease is driven by diastolic impairment due to the enlarged and stiffened heart muscle (non-obstructive HCM).  In either obstructive or non-obstructive HCM patients, exertion can result in fatigue or shortness of breath, interfering with a patient’s ability to participate in activities of daily living.  HCM has also been associated with increased risks of atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure and sudden cardiac death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About Mavacamten (MYK-461)</strong>
An investigational, novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin, mavacamten reduces cardiac muscle contractility by inhibiting excessive myosin-actin cross-bridge formation that results in hypercontractility, left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced compliance. In clinical and preclinical studies, mavacamten has consistently reduced biomarkers of cardiac wall stress, lessened excessive cardiac contractility and increased diastolic compliance.  MyoKardia is developing mavacamten for the treatment of conditions in which excessive cardiac contractility and impaired diastolic filling of the heart are the underlying cause.  Mavacamten is initially being developed for the treatment of symptomatic, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Based on its mechanism of action and evidence of therapeutic activity, mavacamten is also being studied in the clinic for the treatment of symptomatic non-obstructive HCM and among a targeted population of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About MyoKardia</strong>
MyoKardia is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing targeted therapies for the treatment of serious cardiovascular diseases. The company is pioneering a precision medicine approach to its discovery and development efforts by 1) understanding the biomechanical underpinnings of disease; 2) targeting the proteins that modulate a given condition; 3) identifying patient populations with shared disease characteristics; and 4) applying learnings from research and clinical studies to inform and guide pipeline growth and product advancement. MyoKardia’s initial focus is on small molecule therapeutics aimed at the proteins of the heart that modulate cardiac muscle contraction to address diseases driven by excessive contraction, impaired relaxation, or insufficient contraction. Among its discoveries are three clinical-stage therapeutics: mavacamten (formerly MYK-461); danicamtiv (formerly MYK-491) and MYK-224.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">MyoKardia’s mission is to change the world for people with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.</p>

Ongoing clinical investigations have been developed to evaluate the benefit of increasing tumor cell sensitivity to CRT, making the addition of Debio 1143 a highly promising strategy for radio-oncologists to improve treatment outcomes for high-risk LA-SCCHN.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on the clinically compelling phase II study results (NCT02022098) presented at the ESMO Congress 2019 in Barcelona, Spain. They revealed a very significant improvement of the primary endpoint locoregional control rate at 18 months after CRT (21% improvement vs. control arm) and a marked Progression-Free Survival (PFS) benefit vs. the CRT+placebo arm after a 2-year follow-up period (HR=0.37, p=0.007). In addition, the compound showed a predictable and manageable safety profile, that did not compromise the full delivery of standard CRT.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>“Despite today’s current standard of care, high-risk locally-advanced head and neck cancer remains an area of unmet medical need.  This Breakthrough Therapy Designation will allow us to maximize the potential of Debio 1143 to become an innovative radio-chemo enhancing treatment for LA-SCCHN patients.”</em>
<strong>– Angela Zubel, Chief Development Officer, Debiopharm.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>“This FDA assessment is a strong encouragement to expand investigations into other cancer types where the radio-sensitization effect of Debio 1143 could also provide further benefits over the current standard of care.”</em>
<strong>– Sergio Szyldergemajn, Medical Director of Oncology at  Debiopharm.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the clinical development and review of medicines showing substantial improvements in serious or life-threatening conditions so that patients can access innovative therapies as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">About Head and Neck Cancer</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is the 6th most common cancer type worldwide, with more than half of patients diagnosed with locally-advanced (LA) disease.<sup>1-2</sup> High-risk LA-SCCHN patients, including HPV negative  oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) patients and heavy smokers, face a poor prognosis even with current standard of care (SOC) as more than half of them will relapse.<sup>3-6</sup> The consequences of LA-SCCHN have a heavy impact on quality of life and social interactions, affecting how patients look, talk, eat and breathe.<sup>7-9</sup> Additional therapies are needed to ensure better outcomes for patients facing this devastating condition.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">About Debio 1143</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""https://www.debiopharm.com/drug-development/pipeline/debio-1143-4/"">Debio 1143</a> is a potential first-in-class oral antagonist of IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins), that sensitizes tumor cells to radio-chemo therapy by promoting programmed cell death and fostering anti-tumor immunity.  The clinical benefit observed in LA-SCCHN patients suggests that the integration of Debio 1143 into widely used CRT regimens is a promising investigational approach over a broad range of cancer types. Currently poised to enter into a Phase III, pivotal trial later this year in combination with CRT in Head &amp; Neck cancer, the compound is also being investigated along with immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1) in various solid tumors. Over 200 patients have been treated so far with Debio 1143 in various indications and lines of treatment, showing an adequate and consistent safety profile across studies.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Debiopharm’s commitment to cancer patients</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Debiopharm aims to develop innovative therapies that target high unmet medical needs in oncology. Bridging the gap between disruptive discovery products and real-world patient reach, we identify high-potential compounds for in-licensing, clinically demonstrate their safety and efficacy and then select large pharmaceutical commercialization partners to maximize patient access globally.</p>

Vixarelimab is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that targets oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRß).</p>
Kiniksa’s Breakthrough Therapy application was based on data from the Phase 2a clinical trial of vixarelimab in prurigo nodularis. The Phase 2a trial met its primary efficacy endpoint: there was a statistically significant reduction in weekly-average Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) from baseline at Week 8 in vixarelimab recipients compared to placebo recipients. Additionally, the majority of vixarelimab recipients showed a clinically meaningful greater-than-or-equal-to 4-point weekly-average WI-NRS reduction at Week 8, and a statistically significant percentage of vixarelimab recipients achieved a prurigo nodularis-investigator’s global assessment (PN-IGA) score of 0/1 at Week 8 compared to placebo recipients.

“The FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy designation to vixarelimab for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis is an important step forward for patients,” said Sanj K. Patel, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Kiniksa. “The Phase 2a study of vixarelimab in prurigo nodularis demonstrated encouraging results in both pruritus and nodule response. We believe vixarelimab has the potential to positively impact the lives of those suffering from prurigo nodularis, a devastating disease for which there are no FDA-approved therapies.”

Kiniksa expects to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial of vixarelimab in prurigo nodularis, evaluating a range of once-monthly dose regimens, by the end of the year.

<strong>About </strong><strong>Breakthrough Therapy</strong><strong> Designation</strong>
The FDA defines Breakthrough Therapy designation as a process designed to expedite the development and review of drug candidates that are intended to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on a clinically significant endpoint.

<strong>About</strong> <strong>Vixarelimab</strong><strong> Phase 2a Trial in Prurigo </strong><strong>Nodularis</strong>
The Phase 2a trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of vixarelimab in reducing pruritus in subjects with prurigo nodularis. The trial enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis experiencing moderate-to-severe pruritus (WI-NRS = 7 at the screening visit and a mean weekly WI-NRS of = 5 for each of the two consecutive weeks immediately prior to randomization). Patients were required to stop antihistamines and topical treatments, including corticosteroids, for at least two weeks prior to dosing. Prurigo nodularis treatments, other than study drug, were not allowed except for rescue.

<strong>About </strong><strong>Vixarelimab</strong>
Vixarelimab is an investigational fully-human monoclonal antibody that targets OSMRß, which mediates signaling of interleukin-31 (IL-31) and oncostatin M (OSM), two key cytokines implicated in pruritus, inflammation and fibrosis. Kiniksa believes vixarelimab to be the only monoclonal antibody in development that targets both pathways simultaneously. Kiniksa’s lead indication for vixarelimab is prurigo nodularis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by severely pruritic skin nodules. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to vixarelimab for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis in 2020.

SAN DIEGO, Dec. 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TPTX), a precision oncology company developing next-generation therapies that target genetic drivers of cancer, today announced its lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, has been granted breakthrough therapy designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not been treated with a ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI-naïve).

“Breakthrough therapy designation is another milestone in our development of repotrectinib and one more step towards our goal to get this potentially important drug candidate to patients as quickly as possible,” said Athena Countouriotis, M.D., president and chief executive officer. “I am incredibly proud of our Turning Point team with the achievement of our fourth regulatory designation from the FDA for repotrectinib, and pleased with how our enrollment specifically in the ROS1 TKI-naive population of the TRIDENT-1 study has progressed since we reported initial early Phase 2 data. We look forward to sharing more information on our overall study timelines early next year, and providing updated data from the TRIDENT-1 study next month.”

Turning Point plans to present updated TRIDENT-1 Phase 2 study data from patients with TKI-naive ROS1-positive NSCLC during a mini-oral presentation at the World Conference on Lung Cancer on Jan. 31, 2021.

The breakthrough therapy designation for repotrectinib was supported by the initial data from TKI-naïve ROS1-positive NSCLC patients enrolled in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the TRIDENT-1 study, which is currently evaluating patients in multiple potentially registrational cohorts.

Breakthrough therapy designation is granted by the FDA to expedite the development and regulatory review of an investigational medicine that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition. The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. Repotrectinib was previously granted three Fast Track designations by the FDA, in ROS1-positive NSCLC patients who are TKI naïve, ROS1-positive NSCLC patients who have been previously treated with one prior platinum chemotherapy and one prior ROS1 TKI, and NTRK-positive patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed following treatment with at least one prior line of chemotherapy and one or two prior TRK TKIs.

<strong>About Turning Point Therapeutics Inc.</strong>
Turning Point Therapeutics is a clinical-stage precision oncology company with a pipeline of internally discovered investigational drugs designed to address key limitations of existing cancer therapies. The company’s lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, is a next-generation kinase inhibitor targeting the ROS1 and TRK oncogenic drivers of non-small cell lung cancer and advanced solid tumors. Repotrectinib, which is being studied in a registrational Phase 2 study called TRIDENT-1 in adults and a Phase 1/2 study in pediatric patients, has shown antitumor activity and durable responses among kinase inhibitor treatment-naïve and pre-treated patients. The company’s pipeline of drug candidates also includes TPX-0022, targeting MET, CSF1R and SRC, which is in a Phase 1 study called SHIELD-1 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in <em>MET</em>; RET-inhibitor TPX-0046, which is in a Phase 1/2 study of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in <em>RET</em>; and ALK-inhibitor TPX-0131, which is in IND-enabling studies. Turning Point’s next-generation kinase inhibitors are designed to bind to their targets with greater precision and affinity than existing therapies, with a novel, compact structure that has demonstrated an ability to potentially overcome treatment resistance common with other kinase inhibitors. The company is driven to develop therapies that mark a turning point for patients in their cancer treatment.

Lanifibranor is believed to be the first drug candidate to be granted this status for the treatment of NASH since January 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA is intended to expedite the development and review of drug candidates for serious or life-threatening conditions. To qualify for this designation, drug candidates must show preliminary clinical evidence that they may demonstrate a substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies or over placebo if there are no approved therapies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The designation of lanifibranor as a Breakthrough Therapy for the treatment of NASH follows the publication in June 2020 of positive topline results from Inventiva’s NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial with lanifibranor in NASH patients. In this 24-week clinical trial, lanifibranor met the primary endpoint with a statistically significant reduction of the Steatosis Activity Fibrosis score (SAF), which combines assessments of hepatocellular inflammation and ballooning with no worsening of fibrosis in the Intention To Treat (ITT<sup>1</sup>) and Per Protocol populations (PP<sup>2</sup>). In addition, lanifibranor met key secondary endpoints, including NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis<sup>3</sup> and improvement of liver fibrosis with no worsening of NASH<sup>4</sup> in both ITT and PP populations. With regards to the secondary endpoints, lanifibranor is the first drug candidate to achieve statistically significant results on the FDA and European Medicine Agency (EMA) primary endpoints which are relevant for seeking accelerated approval during Phase III clinical development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Inventiva is expected to hold the end of NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial meeting with the FDA and to receive regulatory feedback from the EMA during the fourth quarter of 2020 with the initiation of the Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH planned for the first half of 2021.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>Frédéric Cren, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and cofounder of Inventiva, commented</strong>: “<em>Ahead of our end of Phase IIb meeting with the FDA later this year,</em> <em>the Breakthrough Therapy designation for lanifibranor is a fantastic achievement and a regulatory recognition of the significant clinical benefits lanifibranor could provide to NASH patients as shown in our recent NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial.

About lanifibranor</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Lanifibranor, Inventiva’s lead product candidate, is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms, which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner, with a well-balanced activation of PPARa and PPARd, and a partial activation of PPAR?. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation, lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>
About the NATIVE Phase IIb trial</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The NATIVE (NAsh Trial to Validate IVA337 Efficacy) clinical trial was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of patients with NASH. The main purpose of the trial was to assess the efficacy of lanifibranor in improving liver inflammation and ballooning, the two histological markers included in the definition of the regulatory endpoint of NASH resolution. To be considered for inclusion, patients were required to have: a diagnosis of NASH confirmed by liver biopsy; a cumulative score of inflammation and ballooning (as measured using the SAF scoring system) of three or four out of four, indicating the presence of moderate to severe inflammation and ballooning; a steatosis score greater than or equal to one, indicating the presence of moderate to severe steatosis; and a fibrosis score less than four, indicating the absence of cirrhosis. The primary endpoint of the trial was a reduction in the combined inflammation and ballooning score of two points compared to baseline, with no worsening fibrosis, as measured by the SAF score. Secondary endpoints included NASH resolution, improvements in each of the steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis scores from baseline as measured using the SAF score, improvements in various other fibrosis measures, improvements in several metabolic markers, improvements in steatosis, inflammation and ballooning as measured using the NAS score (NAFLD activity score), and safety.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The trial randomized 247 patients with NASH in 71 sites in Australia, Canada, Europe, Mauritius and the United States.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, March 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced new data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled BLAZE-1 Phase 3 study, demonstrating bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700 mg and etesevimab (LY-CoV016) 1400 mg together significantly reduced COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths (“events”) in high-risk patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. These results provide additional efficacy and safety data that support the use of the dose recently granted both Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a positive scientific opinion by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

This new Phase 3 cohort of BLAZE-1 included 769 high-risk patients, aged 12 and older with mild to moderate COVID-19 (therapy: n=511; placebo: n=258). There were four events in patients taking bamlanivimab with etesevimab and 15 events in patients taking placebo, representing an 87 percent risk reduction (p<0.0001). Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together also demonstrated statistically significant improvements on key secondary endpoints. These results are consistent with those seen in other data sets from BLAZE-1: in the previous Phase 3 cohort, bamlanivimab 2800 mg with etesevimab 2800 mg reduced the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by 70 percent and in the Phase 2 cohort, bamlanivimab alone reduced the risk of hospitalizations and ER visits by approximately 70 percent. The viral load reductions were also consistent with what was observed in the previous Phase 3 cohort of the study.

In this new Phase 3 cohort, there were four deaths total, all of which were deemed related to COVID-19 and all of which occurred in patients taking placebo; no deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. Across the two Phase 3 cohorts of the study that have been analyzed to date, there have been no deaths in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, and 14 deaths in patients receiving placebo, 13 of which were deemed COVID-19 related. In this data set, the safety profile of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together was consistent with observations from other Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials evaluating these antibodies.

“These positive results reinforce our previous findings and support the authorized dose of bamlanivimab 700 mg with etesevimab 1400 mg. These compelling data – in addition to the recent EUA from FDA, the CHMP decision from EMA and the recommendation for the therapy in the National Institutes of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines – give healthcare providers additional information regarding the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together as a potentially life-saving treatment to help those most at risk for severe complications of COVID-19,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “The consistent results observed in multiple cohorts of this trial over several months, even as new strains of COVID-19 have emerged, indicate bamlanivimab with etesevimab maintains its effects against a range of variants, particularly those circulating in the U.S.”

Lilly continues to engage with global regulators to make bamlanivimab alone and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together available around the world. Bamlanivimab alone and bamlanivimab with etesevimab together are authorized under special/emergency pathways, in the context of the pandemic, in the U.S. and the European Union. In addition, bamlanivimab alone is authorized for emergency use in Canada, Panama, Kuwait, the UAE, Israel, Rwanda, Morocco and numerous other countries. Through Lilly’s work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Lilly is providing doses of bamlanivimab free of charge in Rwanda and Morocco.

Adverse Events
Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together
Based on Phase 2 data from BLAZE-1, nausea was the most commonly reported adverse event, reported by 4% of subjects in both bamlanivimab and etesevimab together and placebo groups. Pruritus and pyrexia were more frequently reported from subjects treated with both bamlanivimab and etesevimab (2% and 1%) compared to placebo (1% and 0%, respectively).

Based on Phase 3 data from BLAZE-1, the most common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, and rash. These events each occurred in 1% of subjects treated with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together and in 1% of placebo subjects.

Bamlanivimab alone
Adverse events reported in at least 1% of BLAZE-1 clinical trial participants on bamlanivimab 700 mg alone or placebo were nausea (3% vs 4%), diarrhea (1% vs 5%), dizziness (3% vs 2%), headache (3% vs 2%), pruritus (2% vs 1%) and vomiting (1% vs 3%).

Use in Specific Populations
Pregnancy
There are insufficient data on the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together and bamlanivimab alone during pregnancy. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together and bamlanivimab alone should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.

Breastfeeding
There are no available data on the presence of bamlanivimab or etesevimab in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

About bamlanivimab
Bamlanivimab is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially treating COVID-19. Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628). A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab alone or bamlanivimab and etesevimab together in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, NCT04497987) is also ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

About etesevimab
Etesevimab (LY-CoV016, also known as JS016) is a recombinant fully human monoclonal neutralizing antibody, which specifically binds to the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein receptor binding domain with high affinity and can block the binding of the virus to the ACE2 host cell surface receptor. Point mutations were introduced into the native human IgG1 antibody to mitigate effector function. Lilly licensed etesevimab from Junshi Biosciences after it was jointly developed by Junshi Biosciences and the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science (IMCAS). Junshi Biosciences leads development in Greater China, while Lilly leads development in the rest of the world.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study (NCT04441931) of etesevimab in healthy U.S. volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, NCT04427501) is ongoing. Junshi Biosciences has completed a similar Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in China and has initiated Phase 1b/2 trials in COVID-19 patients globally.

About BLAZE-1
BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or bamlanivimab and etesevimab together for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. To be eligible, patients were required to have mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 as well as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test based on a sample collected no more than three days prior to drug infusion.

In the Phase 2 portion of BLAZE-1, cohorts of mild to moderate recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients, were randomized to one of three doses of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2800 mg, and 7000 mg), bamlanivimab 2800 mg plus etesevimab 2800 mg, or placebo. Results from the Phase 2 cohorts of BLAZE-1 were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and The Journal of the American Medical Association.

In the Phase 3 portion of BLAZE-1, the combination therapy arms enrolled mild to moderate, recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization, studying bamlanivimab 2800 mg plus etesevimab 2800 mg versus placebo, and bamlanivimab 700 mg plus etesevimab 1400 mg versus placebo. The primary outcome measure for the Phase 3 portion of the BLAZE-1 trial was the percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalizations or death from any cause by day 29. The key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to day 7 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, persistently high SARS-CoV-2 viral load on day 7, time to sustained symptom resolution, and COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from any cause from baseline by day 29. Additional endpoints include change from baseline in viral load at other time points, symptom improvement, symptom resolution, as well as safety.

The study is ongoing with additional treatment arms.

<span class=""xn-location"">BARCELONA, Spain</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 9, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Grifols (MCE: GRF, MCE: GRF.P;NASDAQ: GRFS), a global healthcare company with a proven track record of more than 100 years dedicated to improving the health and well-being of people worldwide, today announced the closing of its agreement with GigaGen Inc. to acquire its remaining 56% share capital for <span class=""xn-money"">USD 80 million</span>.

GigaGen is a U.S. biotechnology company specialized in the early discovery and development of recombinant biotherapeutic medicines. GigaGen's research focuses on discovering new biological treatments based on antibodies derived from millions of immune system cells obtained from donors.

GigaGen currently spearheads several in-house research projects, including the development of the world's first recombinant immunoglobulin and a portfolio of immuno-oncological therapies.

Grifols continues to prioritize its innovation strategy as a core pillar of its long-term sustainable growth plan. For Víctor Grífols Deu, co-CEO of Grifols, <i>""We are further strengthening our innovation strategy by investing in solid projects, such as Alkahest and now GigaGen, with the aim of helping patients live longer and better lives. Projects like these support our long-term vision and have high potential to bolster our corporate growth and business fundamentals.""</i>

The agreement is in alignment with Grifols' R+D+i strategy, grounded in an integrated approach that encompasses both in-house projects and investee-led initiatives whose research complements its core operations.

GigaGen brings a diversified pipeline of recombinant polyclonal antibodies, including GIGA-2050, a recombinant hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of COVID-19, which is expected to be evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in the U.S. in spring 2021 after the recent approval of its Investigational New Drug (IND) application by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The trial, which will be the first-in-human study evaluating recombinant hyperimmune immunoglobulins, will assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of GIGA-2050 in up to 18 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19.

GIGA-2050 comprises more than 12,000 antibodies, encompassing a diverse set of anti-coronavirus antibodies captured from the convalescent blood of 16 exceptional responders to COVID-19. GIGA-2050 has strong binding activity against natural SARS CoV-2 variants, including the variants that recently emerged in several regions globally.

The information obtained from the trial will also be used to demonstrate the safety of the proprietary platform technology for manufacturing specific recombinant polyclonal immunoglobulins specific to infectious diseases that can be quickly developed for treatment of emerging pathogens where neutralizing antibodies are formed.

For José Terencio, Grifols Vice-President of Innovation, ""<i>The progress that GigaGen is making to boost the next generation of antibody drugs, including the world's first recombinant immunoglobulin, will enhance Grifols' innovation efforts, aiming disease management beyond plasma-derived therapies.""</i>

Following the closing of the transaction, Grifols will now control 100% of GigaGen. Grifols acquired a 44% stake in GigaGen in <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2017</span> for <span class=""xn-money"">USD 35 million</span> through Grifols Innovation and New Technology (GIANT), which channels the group's investments in R+D+i companies and other related projects.

Grifols will finance the operation with its own funds, with no need to issue debt. Half of the consideration will have been paid at closing of the transaction and the remaining amount will be paid one year after closing.

Grifols retained the legal services of Osborne Clarke and Proskauer for this transaction.

(Nasdaq: FBIO) (“Fortress”), an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing or monetizing promising biopharmaceutical products and product candidates cost-effectively, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Cyprium Therapeutics (“Cyprium”) for CUTX-101, a potential treatment for Menkes disease. Often lethal if untreated, Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in ATP7A, an evolutionarily conserved copper-transporting ATPase. The FDA previously granted Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations to CUTX-101 for the treatment of Menkes disease. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency previously granted Orphan Drug Designation to CUTX-101.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">“We are very pleased that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to CUTX-101, a devastating pediatric disease with no FDA-approved treatment options currently available. The positive topline clinical efficacy data reported earlier this year highlight the potential of CUTX-101 to be a safe and effective therapy and fulfill a significant unmet medical need for patients with Menkes disease. We look forward to beginning our rolling submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA for CUTX-101 in the first quarter of next year. Our goal is to bring this treatment to patients as soon as possible,” said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Cyprium.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy Designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation conveys all of the fast-track program features, more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving senior managers and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About Menkes Disease and Related Copper Metabolism Disorders</strong>
Menkes disease is a rare X-linked recessive pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of copper transporter ATP7A. The minimum birth prevalence for Menkes disease is believed to be 1 in 34,810 males, and potentially as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births, based on recent genome-based ascertainment (Kaler SG, Ferreira CR, Yam LS. Estimated birth prevalence of Menkes disease and ATP7A-related disorders based on the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Mol Genet Metab Rep. 2020 Jun 5;24:100602). Biochemically, patients with Menkes disease have low levels of copper in their blood and brain, as well as abnormal levels of certain neurochemicals. Definitive diagnosis is made by sequencing the ATP7A gene. The condition is characterized by distinctive clinical features, including sparse and depigmented hair (“kinky hair”), connective tissue problems, and severe neurological symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, failure to thrive, and neurodevelopmental delays. Mortality is high in untreated Menkes disease, with many patients dying before the age of three years. Milder versions of ATP7A mutations are associated with other conditions, including Occipital Horn Syndrome and ATP7A-related Distal Motor Neuropathy. Currently, there is no FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease and its variants.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate)</strong>
CUTX-101 is in clinical development to treat patients with Menkes disease by replenishing Copper Histidinate, restoring copper homeostasis and maintaining serum copper levels in the normal age appropriate range. CUTX-101 is a subcutaneous injectable formulation of Copper Histidinate manufactured under current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) and physiological pH that bypasses the defect in absorption of orally administered copper in patients with Menkes disease. In a Phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted by Stephen G. Kaler, M.D., M.P.H., at the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), early treatment of patients with Menkes disease with CUTX-101 led to an improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes and survival. A Phase 3 trial of CUTX-101 in patients with Menkes disease also led by Dr. Kaler has completed enrollment. In August 2020, Cyprium reported positive topline clinical efficacy results for CUTX-101, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death. A Cyprium-sponsored expanded access protocol for patients with Menkes disease is ongoing at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (<a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HqUPfv5Js1pvT3WeSCwmjT1U6d02UNwdEB731n98JumLy-_n16isKXpeRLTLBdQ3edsU2pkMzO2I8W8OCwL09VVvrGXKyFHCGsOkrspUVJssUeCN8RoPEzwkibvZqjGQv2av8BvjNWpFBFij8E7fQEfdqpLtH4568qshtp9ZjvUSYgRnoYZmiRhvYOUyFSWwKLp1t_JJElRHNbPltYek_Q=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/specialties/menkes-disease-clinic</a>) and other US medical centers.</p>

Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”) is focused on the development of novel therapies for the treatment of Menkes disease and related copper metabolism disorders. In March 2017, Cyprium entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“NICHD”), part of the NIH, to advance the clinical development of CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate injection) for the treatment of Menkes disease. In addition, Cyprium and NICHD entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement to develop and commercialize adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy, called AAV-ATP7A, to deliver working copies of the copper transporter that is defective in patients with Menkes disease, and to be used in combination with CUTX-101. CUTX-101 was granted FDA Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations, and both CUTX-101 and AAV-ATP7A have received FDA Orphan Drug Designation previously.

Basel, 11 March 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the global phase III randomised, double-blind, multicentre REMDACTA study of Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) plus Veklury® (remdesivir), versus placebo plus Veklury, did not meet its primary endpoint. This was measured by improved time to hospital discharge up to day 28 in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard of care. No new safety signals were identified for Actemra/RoActemra in the REMDACTA trial. The study was conducted in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Roche will continue to evaluate data from the REMDACTA, COVACTA and EMPACTA studies as well as other studies of Actemra/RoActemra in COVID-19 pneumonia. The EMPACTA study met its primary endpoint, while COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint. Both were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“Given the global impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on patients, we are disappointed that the REMDACTA study did not meet its endpoints,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We continue to believe that the totality of data suggests a potential role for Actemra in treating certain patients with COVID-19, and will discuss the results with health authorities. We thank our partners at Gilead, and all the patients, investigators and healthcare professionals for their participation.”

REMDACTA did not meet key secondary endpoints, which included likelihood of death, likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death, and clinical status. The full results of the trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal later this year.

Actemra/RoActemra is not approved for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.

The antiviral medication Veklury was invented and developed by Gilead Sciences and is approved or authorized for temporary use for the treatment of COVID-19 in approximately 50 countries worldwide.

<strong>About the REMDACTA Trial</strong>
REMDACTA is a two-armed global phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study (REMDACTA, NCT04409262) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Actemra/RoActemra plus Veklury, versus placebo plus Veklury in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard of care. Veklury is an antiviral medicine that works to stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The REMDACTA trial is being conducted in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. The primary endpoint of the study is improvement in time to hospital discharge by Day 28. Key secondary endpoints include likelihood of death, likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death, and clinical status. Clinical status is measured by the 7-category ordinal scale, which tracks patients’ clinical status based on the need for intensive care and/or ventilator use, as well as supplemental oxygen requirements. Patients will be followed for 60 days post-randomisation.

<strong>About the COVACTA Trial</strong>
COVACTA is a global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (COVACTA, NCT04320615) which evaluated the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra/RoActemra added to standard of care in adult patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. The primary and secondary endpoints included clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) variables. Patients were followed for 60 days post-randomisation.

<strong>About the EMPACTA Trial</strong>
EMPACTA (Evaluating Minority Patients with Actemra) is a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study (EMPACTA, NCT04372186) which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Actemra/RoActemra in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 pneumonia among patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials.

The primary endpoint was the cumulative proportion of participants dying or requiring mechanical ventilation by Day 28. Secondary endpoints included: time to clinical failure, defined as the time to death, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, or withdrawal (whichever occurs first); mortality rate by Day 28; and time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge.”

<strong>About Actemra/RoActemra</strong>
Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved anti-IL-6 receptor biologic, and is available in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Actemra/RoActemra can be used alone or with methotrexate (MTX) in adult RA patients who are intolerant to, or have failed to respond to, other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In Europe, RoActemra IV and SC are also approved for use in adult patients with severe, active and progressive RA who previously have not been treated with MTX. Actemra/RoActemra IV and SC are also approved globally for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in children two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra SC is approved globally for giant cell arteritis (GCA), and Actemra/RoActemra IV is approved for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in people two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved treatment for sJIA, GCA and CRS. Actemra SC is now approved in the U.S. for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adult patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). In addition to the above-mentioned indications, in Japan Actemra IV is also approved for the treatment of Castleman’s disease and adult Still's disease, and the Actemra SC formulation is approved for Takayasu arteritis. Actemra/RoActemra is part of a co-development agreement with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and has been approved in Japan since April 2005. Actemra/RoActemra is approved in more than 110 countries worldwide.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MDS represents a spectrum of hematopoietic stem cell malignancies in which bone marrow fails to produce sufficient numbers of healthy blood cells. Approximately 30-40% of MDS patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is thought to directly contribute to disease progression and a poor overall prognosis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Breakthrough Therapy Designation further supports our development program for APR-246 in combination with azacitidine in MDS patients with a <em>TP53</em> mutation,” said Christian S. Schade, Chief Executive Officer of Aprea. “Outcomes for MDS patients with a <em>TP53</em> mutation are poor and there are no current therapeutic options specifically for these patients. We look forward to continued interaction with FDA regarding our ongoing Phase 3 clinical study and our clinical development program to advance APR-246.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About p53 and APR-246</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, occurring in approximately 50% of all human tumors.  These mutations are often associated with resistance to anti-cancer drugs and poor overall survival, representing a major unmet medical need in the treatment of cancer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">APR-246 is a small molecule that has demonstrated reactivation of mutant and inactivated p53 protein – by restoring wild-type p53 conformation and function – and thereby induce programmed cell death in human cancer cells.  Pre-clinical anti-tumor activity has been observed with APR-246 in a wide variety of solid and hematological cancers, including MDS, AML, and ovarian cancer, among others.  Additionally, strong synergy has been seen with both traditional anti-cancer agents, such as chemotherapy, as well as newer mechanism-based anti-cancer drugs and immuno-oncology checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to pre-clinical testing, a Phase 1/2 clinical program with APR-246 has been completed, demonstrating a favorable safety profile and both biological and confirmed clinical responses in hematological malignancies and solid tumors with mutations in the <em>TP53</em> gene.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of APR-246 and azacitidine for frontline treatment of <em>TP53</em> mutant MDS is ongoing. APR-246 has received Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for MDS, and Orphan Drug designation from the EMA for MDS, AML and ovarian cancer.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Breakthrough Therapy designation is a program designed by the FDA to expedite the development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases with preliminary clinical evidence that the investigational therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">“Since 1958, when vancomycin was first approved, only one additional agent has gained FDA approval for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia, based on non-inferiority to vancomycin. Despite this new agent, clinical failure and mortality rates for this neglected infectious disease have not improved in over 60 years.” said Roger J. Pomerantz, MD, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of ContraFect. “The decision by the FDA to grant Breakthrough Therapy designation to exebacase recognizes the urgent need for new therapies that can impact the lives of patients with these MRSA infections. Based on the Phase 2 data, we believe exebacase could be the first anti-infective agent to demonstrate superior outcomes for these patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The Breakthrough Therapy designation was based on final data from a Phase 2 superiority trial of exebacase in patients with <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> bacteremia, including endocarditis. This Phase 2 trial evaluated whether the addition of exebacase to SOC antibiotic therapy improved clinical response rates compared to treatment with SOC antibitotics alone. In a pre-specified analysis of the subgroup with MRSA infections, the clinical responder rate at Day 14 among exebacase-treated patients was 42.8 percentage points higher than the responder rate among patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone (74.1% vs 31.3%, respectively, p=0.010). Treatment with exebacase was also associated with a 21-percentage point reduction in the 30-day all-cause mortality (p=0.056), a four day reduction in length of hospital stay, and meaningful reductions in 30-day hospital readmission rates in MRSA-infected patients.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">“I’m thrilled that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for exebacase for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia, a difficult to treat infection with consistently poor outcomes   despite conventional antibiotics. In our Phase 2 study, the addition of exebacase to standard-of-care antibiotics to treat MRSA bacteremia was associated with higher clinical success rates and a reduction in mortality,” said Cara Cassino, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President of Research and Development at ContraFect. “We designed the pivotal Phase 3 DISRUPT study of exebacase for the treatment of <em>Staph aureus</em> bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis, to enable definitive confirmation of these findings. Based on our interactions with the FDA regarding streamlined development of exebacase, this single Phase 3 study, in addition to the full package of data generated to date, may serve as the basis of a Biologics License Application for FDA review and potential approval of exebacase. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA to expedite the development of this promising product candidate.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>About DISRUPT:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">DISRUPT is an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 clinical study of exebacase for the treatment of <em>Staph aureus</em> bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis, caused by MRSA or methicillin-senstitive <em>Staph aureus</em>. This study compares the efficacy, safety and tolerability of exebacase used in addition to SOC antibiotics to SOC antibiotics alone. The Company expects to enroll approximately 350 patients randomized 2:1 to receive either a single dose of exebacase administered as a 2-hour IV infusion in addition to SOC antibiotics or placebo plus SOC antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint will be clinical response at Day 14 in patients with MRSA bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis. Secondary endpoints will include clinical response at Day 14 in All Staph aureus patients (MRSA and MSSA), 30-day all-cause mortality in MRSA patients, and clinical response at Day 30 and Day 60 in both MRSA and All Staph aureus patients. The principal investigator is Dr. Vance Fowler, Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Duke University.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About Exebacase (CF-301):</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Exebacase is a recombinantly-produced lysin (cell wall hydrolase enzyme) with potent bactericidal activity against <em>Staph aureus</em>, a major cause of bloodstream infections (BSIs) also known as bacteremia. Exebacase has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for <em>Staph aureus</em> bacteremia.  It has a novel, rapid, and specific mechanism of action that targets the peptidoglycan cell wall that is vital to <em>Staph aureus</em> bacteria. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that exebacase is highly active against biofilms which complicate <em>Staph aureus</em> infections. Exebacase was licensed from The Rockefeller University and is being developed at ContraFect.</p>

NEW YORK, Sept. 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BeyondSpring Inc. (the “Company” or “BeyondSpring”) (NASDAQ: BYSI), a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative immuno-oncology cancer therapies to transform the lives of patients with unmet medical needs, today announced that its lead asset, first-in-class agent Plinabulin, has received the Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for the chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) indication from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and China’s Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA).

The FDA's BTD is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition in which clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The CDE in China established its BTD program in July 2020 to facilitate the research and development of innovative drugs that treat severe life-threatening or quality-of-life impairing diseases with no existing therapy or with proven evidence to demonstrate clear clinical benefits compared to existing therapies. Products with BTD from the CDE may be considered for conditional approval and priority review when submitting New Drug Applications (NDAs).

""Receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA acknowledges both the significant unmet need among patients with CIN and the highly encouraging clinical results generated by Plinabulin,” said Douglas Blayney, M.D., global Principal Investigator for Plinabulin’s CIN studies and Professor of Medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine. “This should expedite Plinabulin’s move into the clinic, which is beneficial for patients. The currently approved CIN prevention agents are all G-CSF-based and not available to all patients. Even with the use of G-CSFs, over 80 percent of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may still experience Grade 4 neutropenia, which could lead to severe infection, hospitalization and even death. Thus, CIN still represents an unmet medical need.”

""The clinical profile Plinabulin has shown truly represents a breakthrough in the CIN space since G-CSFs,"" added Ramon Mohanlal, M.D., Ph.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President, Research and Development, at BeyondSpring. “We look forward to continuing to work with the FDA as we advance the development of Plinabulin to address this urgent medical need.”

The Breakthrough Therapy application is based on the strength of the totality of the clinical data generated so far:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Positive interim analysis results from the PROTECTIVE-2 Phase 3 study – The clinically meaningful primary endpoint was the prevention of severe neutropenia, an “industry first,” building on the previous standard for approval, the Duration of Severe Neutropenia (DSN). In the protocol-specified interim analysis, Plinabulin, in combination with Neulasta, was significantly better than Neulasta alone in achieving the primary endpoint with p&lt;0.01, along with a well-tolerated safety profile and fewer Grade 4 adverse events, compared to Neulasta alone.</li>
 	<li>These results were further strengthened by the Company’s other CIN studies that have confirmed Plinabulin’s early onset action in Week 1 with protecting neutrophils in various cancer types and various chemotherapies, which is complementary to Week 2 neutrophil protection with G-CSFs.</li>
</ul>
The Company expects to report the full PROTECTIVE-2 Phase 3 topline data in Q4 2020 and file an NDA with the FDA by the end of 2020. The Company has submitted an NDA for Plinabulin for the CIN indication to the NMPA on a rolling basis in Q1 2020.

<strong>About Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia (CIN)</strong>
CIN is a common side effect in cancer patients undergoing treatment that involves the destruction of a type of white blood cell, the neutrophil, which is a patient’s first line of defense against infections. Patients with Grade 4 (severe) neutropenia have an abnormally low concentration of neutrophils, which may lead to infections, hospitalization and death.

G-CSFs are the current standard of care for CIN prevention. However, G-CSFs have limitations in reducing Grade 4 neutropenia with high-risk chemotherapy. Neutropenia, if severe enough, may cause doctors to lower target doses of chemotherapy, end therapy early and / or delay chemotherapy cycles, each of which has a negative effect on long-term outcomes of cancer care.

Despite these limitations annual global use of G-CSFs is more than 4.3 million cycles per year (CPY). The U.S. (1.3 million CPY) and China (1.6 million CPY) account for more than two-thirds of the global CIN market. Plinabulin’s demonstrated clinical profile in combination with G-CSFs has the potential to build on this existing base and improve the standard of care for patients and practitioners.
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Plinabulin</strong>
Plinabulin, BeyondSpring’s lead asset, is a differentiated immune and stem cell modulator. Plinabulin is currently in late-stage clinical development to increase overall survival in cancer patients, as well as to alleviate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN). The durable anticancer benefits of Plinabulin have been associated with its effect as a potent antigen-presenting cell (APC) inducer (through dendritic cell maturation) and T-cell activation (Chem and Cell Reports, 2019). Plinabulin’s CIN data highlights the ability to boost the number of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells (HSPCs), or lineage-/cKit+/Sca1+ (LSK) cells in mice. Effects on HSPCs could explain the ability of Plinabulin to not only treat CIN but also to reduce chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and increase circulating CD34+ cells in patients.</p>
<strong>About Plinabulin in CIN Study</strong>
The PROTECTIVE-1 (Study 105) and PROTECTIVE-2 (Study 106) trials are both multicenter, double-blind, active controlled Phase 3 trials to support Plinabulin’s broad application in preventing CIN: Plinabulin for concurrent administration with myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens in patients with non-myeloid malignancies for the presentation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN).
<p align=""justify""><strong>PROTECTIVE-1 (Study 105)
</strong>This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer and prostate cancer patients with risk factors, treated with docetaxel (Day 1 dose) in a 21-day cycle with a single dose of Plinabulin (40mg, Day 1 dose) versus a single dose of Neulasta (6mg, Day 2). Docetaxel is one example of an intermediate-risk chemotherapy. This is a non-inferiority study in CIN efficacy comparing Plinabulin and Neulasta in high-risk patients (intermediate chemotherapy, plus one or more additional risk factor). Study 105 Phase 3 interim data had achieved statistical significance based on the primary endpoint of the Duration of Severe Neutropenia (DSN) in the first cycle.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>PROTECTIVE-2 (Study 106)
</strong>This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in breast cancer, treated with docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC, Day 1 dose) in a 21-day cycle with Plinabulin (40 mg, Day 1 dose) in combination with Neulasta (6 mg, Day 2 dose) versus a single dose of Neulasta (6 mg, Day 2 dose) alone. TAC is an example of high-risk chemotherapy. Plinabulin and G-CSFs have complementary mechanisms in preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN). This is a superiority study in CIN efficacy in the rate of Grade 4 neutropenia prevention (primary endpoint), comparing the combination head-to-head against Neulasta, and is currently enrolling. Literature shows that the Grade 4 neutropenia rate for TAC and Neulasta at 6 mg is 83 to 93 percent, which presents severe unmet medical needs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Covance is the clinical contract research organization (CRO) for patient recruitment and monitoring of global sites for this study. The CIN studies are conducted in over 60 clinical centers in the U.S., China and Europe. In addition, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) data, which is used to calculate these endpoints, was obtained through central laboratory assessments by Covance Bioanalytical Methods using standardized and validated analytical tests.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About BeyondSpring</strong>
Headquartered in New York, BeyondSpring is a global, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative immuno-oncology cancer therapies to improve clinical outcomes for patients with high unmet medical needs. BeyondSpring’s first-in-class lead immune asset, Plinabulin, is a potent antigen-presenting cell (APC) inducer. It is currently in two Phase 3 clinical trials for two severely unmet medical needs indications: one is for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN), the most frequent cause for a chemotherapy regimen dose’s decrease, delay, downgrade or discontinuation, which can lead to suboptimal clinical outcomes. The other is for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment in EGFR wild-type patients. As a “pipeline drug,” Plinabulin is in various I/O combination studies to boost PD-1 / PD-L1 antibody anti-cancer effects. In addition to Plinabulin, BeyondSpring’s extensive pipeline includes three pre-clinical immuno-oncology assets and a drug discovery platform dubbed “molecular glue” that uses the protein degradation pathway.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">PHILADELPHIA</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 10, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: LCI) today announced that it recently received feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding biosimilar insulin glargine, a product the company is co-developing with its strategic alliance partners within the HEC Group of companies (HEC). Lannett sought and received comments from the FDA related to the pivotal trial protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the development program.

At a Biosimilar Biological Product Development (BPD) Type 2 meeting in <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2020</span>, representatives from Lannett spoke with and received guidance from the FDA on the clinical advancement program of its biosimilar insulin glargine partnered product candidate. At that meeting, FDA requested Lannett submit a protocol for the pivotal trial for review before Lannett submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (IND). In <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2020</span>, the company responded to that request and provided the proposed protocol and SAP. The FDA recently provided its feedback and comments to the company's proposal and the company has now incorporated the feedback into the design of the pivotal trial, including the type and size of the trial, as well as primary and secondary endpoints, to meet the FDA's requirements.

The company said it was comfortable with the feedback, which is aligned with ongoing development work. Testing related to the production of a commercially scaled batch is underway, so the company believes it remains on track to submit an IND to the FDA later this calendar year. Subsequent to filing an acceptable IND, the company anticipates commencing the pivotal trial early in calendar year 2022, filing the BLA later in 2022 and launching the product in 2023. The company noted that the proposed pivotal trial, albeit with a larger number of proposed participants, is similar to the previously completed first human volunteer pilot study, which indicated that the Lannett/HEC insulin glargine product was biosimilar to US-approved Lantus<sup>®</sup> (the reference biologic) in terms of meeting all pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) safety endpoints in the study.

Lantus<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of Sanofi S.A.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation for VX-880 and that the company has initiated a clinical trial for VX-880 in patients who have type 1 diabetes (T1D) with severe hypoglycemia and impaired hypoglycemic awareness.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“This program has its roots in the groundbreaking work that began in Dr. Doug Melton’s lab, progressed at Semma Therapeutics, and has been accelerated and brought to the clinic by the team at Vertex,” said Bastiano Sanna, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief of Cell and Genetic Therapies at Vertex. “Ours is the only approach that produces fully differentiated and fully functional insulin-secreting pancreatic islets. We are very pleased to have received FDA’s Fast Track Designation, which facilitates the development and expedites the review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. We continue to work with urgency to bring this innovative therapy to patients.”

“It’s a remarkable time for T1D research efforts worldwide, as this investigational treatment enters the clinic,” said Camillo Ricordi, M.D., Professor of Surgery, Director of the Diabetes Research Institute (DRI) and the Cell Transplant Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and Steering Committee Chair for the VX-880 clinical trial. “The field’s experience with the limited cadaveric islet transplants available, where some patients have experienced prolonged insulin independence for years, provides important proof-of-concept for the potential of cell therapy to be transformative for patients living with T1D.”

The first clinical trial sites at the University of Miami Health System, the University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts General Hospital are open for enrollment, and additional sites will be activated this year. To learn more visit clinicaltrials.gov.

<b>About VX-880</b>

VX-880, formerly known as STx-02, is an investigational allogeneic human stem cell-derived islet cell therapy that is being evaluated for patients who have T1D with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. VX-880 has the potential to restore the body’s ability to regulate glucose levels by restoring pancreatic islet cell function, including insulin production.

The VX-880 clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, as well as the chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection.

<b>About the Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial</b>

The clinical trial is a Phase 1/2, single-arm, open-label study in patients who have T1D with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. This will be a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different doses of VX-880. Approximately 17 patients will be enrolled in the clinical trial.

<b>About Type 1 Diabetes</b>

T1D results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas, leading to loss of insulin production and impairment of blood glucose control. The absence of insulin leads to abnormalities in how the body processes nutrients, leading to high blood glucose levels. High blood glucose can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis and over time, to complications such as kidney disease/failure, eye disease (including vision loss), heart disease, stroke, nerve damage and even death.

Due to the limitations and complexities of insulin delivery systems, it can be difficult to achieve and maintain balance in glucose control in patients with T1D. Hypoglycemia often results because of the difficulty in balancing the different factors that impact glucose levels, including insulin, diet and exercise. Hypoglycemia remains a critical limiting factor in glycemic management, and severe hypoglycemia can cause loss of consciousness, coma, seizures, injury, and can be fatal. Over time, patients with T1D can develop impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, meaning they are no longer able to perceive the early signs of a hypoglycemic event, which can be dangerous and result in life threatening events.

There are currently limited treatment options beyond insulin for the management of T1D.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Nasdaq: XLRN), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development, and commercialization of TGF-beta superfamily therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases, today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to sotatercept for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (World Health Organization Group 1).
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“In January of this year, we reported positive topline results from our PULSAR Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial of sotatercept in patients with PAH,” said Habib Dable, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. “Based on the results, we believe that sotatercept has the potential to shift the current treatment paradigm and provide significant benefit to patients with PAH on top of currently available therapies. Thus, we’re thrilled that the FDA has granted this Breakthrough Therapy designation—a first for an Acceleron-discovered medicine and for a therapeutic candidate in PAH—as it supports and aligns with our mission to deliver novel therapeutic options to patients in need as quickly as possible.”

The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may provide substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation conveys more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. For more information please visit the FDA website at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov&amp;esheet=52200623&amp;newsitemid=20200408005276&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.fda.gov&amp;index=1&amp;md5=7ba1bd9ebe0b3e4b12f4f7a4e8460269"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.fda.gov</a>.

In 2019, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for Sotatercept in PAH.

<b>About Sotatercept</b>

Sotatercept is an investigational agent designed to be a selective ligand trap for members of the TGF-beta superfamily to rebalance BMPR-II signaling, which is a key molecular driver of PAH. In preclinical studies of PAH, sotatercept reversed pulmonary vessel muscularization and improved indicators of right heart failure. Recent topline analysis of the PULSAR Phase 2 trial of sotatercept in patients with PAH revealed the trial met the primary as well as key and other secondary endpoints, with adverse events consistent with previously published data on sotatercept in other diseases. Sotatercept, which is part of a licensing agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb, is also being evaluated in the SPECTRA Phase 2 trial in patients with PAH. For more information, please visit <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov&amp;esheet=52200623&amp;newsitemid=20200408005276&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.clinicaltrials.gov&amp;index=2&amp;md5=1a329a513bae9116d6cbddbb284df0ce"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>

Sotatercept is an investigational therapy that is not approved for any use in any country.

<b>About PAH</b>

PAH is a rare and chronic, rapidly progressing disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries and elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation. PAH results in significant strain on the heart, often leading to limited physical activity, heart failure, and reduced life expectancy. The 5-year survival rate for patients with PAH is approximately 57%. Available therapies generally act by promoting the dilation of pulmonary vessels without addressing the underlying cause of the disease. As a result, PAH often progresses rapidly for many patients despite standard of care treatment. A growing body of research has implicated imbalances in BMP and TGF-beta signaling as a primary driver of PAH in familial, idiopathic, and acquired forms of the disease.

<b>About Acceleron</b>

<p align=""justify"">SAN FRANCISCO and LONDON, March 10, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended that the Phase 3 COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial - Intent to Care Early) trial evaluating VIR-7831 (GSK4182136) as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalization be stopped for enrollment due to evidence of profound efficacy.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The IDMC recommendation was based on an interim analysis of data from 583 patients enrolled in the COMET-ICE trial, which demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalization or death in patients receiving VIR-7831 as monotherapy compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. VIR-7831 was well tolerated. As the trial remains ongoing and blinded with patients continuing to be followed for 24 weeks, additional results, including epidemiology and virology data, will be forthcoming once the trial is completed.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Based on these results, Vir and GSK plan to submit an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and for authorizations in other countries. Data from this registrational trial will also form the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the FDA.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The companies also announced today the results of a new study submitted and pending online publication in <em>bioRxiv</em>, demonstrating that VIR-7831 maintains activity against current circulating variants of concern, including the UK, South African and Brazilian variants, based on in vitro data from pseudotyped virus assays. In contrast to other monoclonal antibodies, VIR-7831 binds to a highly conserved epitope of the spike protein, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In addition to COMET-ICE, the full COMET clinical development program for VIR-7831 includes:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>COMET-PEAK</strong>: An ongoing Phase 2 trial with two parts: to compare the safety and viral kinetics of 500 mg intramuscularly (IM) administered VIR-7831 to 500 mg intravenously administered VIR-7831 among low-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 and to evaluate the similarity in pharmacokinetics between VIR-7831 manufactured by different processes.</li>
 	<li><strong>COMET-TAIL:</strong> A Phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021 in high-risk adults to assess whether IM-administered VIR-7831 can reduce hospitalization or death due to COVID-19.</li>
 	<li><strong>COMET-STAR:</strong> A Phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021 in uninfected adults at high risk to determine whether IM-administered VIR-7831 can prevent symptomatic infection.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify""><strong>George Scangos, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Vir, said:</strong> “These exciting data with a single antibody against a conserved epitope bring us one step closer to delivering an effective new solution to patients around the globe. The dual-action design of VIR-7831 to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells, as well as its high barrier to resistance, are key distinguishing characteristics. These findings, paired with our pending publication of resistance data, demonstrate the potential of VIR-7831 to prevent the most severe consequences of COVID-19 and highlight its potential ability to protect against the current circulating strains of the virus.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Dr. Hal Barron, chief scientific officer and president R&amp;D, GSK, said:</strong> “We are pleased that this unique monoclonal antibody was able to bring such a profound benefit to patients. We look forward to the possibility of making VIR-7831 available to patients as soon as possible and to further exploring its potential in other settings.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Phase 3 portion of the COMET-ICE trial assessed the safety and efficacy of a single intravenous infusion of VIR-7831 (500 mg) or placebo in non-hospitalized participants globally, and this interim analysis included 291 patients in the treatment arm and 292 patients in the placebo arm. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who have progression of COVID-19 as defined by the need for hospitalization for at least 24 hours or death within 29 days of randomization. Among those studied, 63% were Hispanic or Latinx and 7% were Black or African American. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these populations are approximately three times more likely to be hospitalized¹ and approximately two times more likely to die² of COVID-19.</p>
<p align=""justify"">VIR-7831 is also being evaluated in the outpatient setting in BLAZE-4, a Phase 2 trial sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Eli Lilly’s bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) alone and bamlanivimab with other neutralizing antibodies, including VIR-7831, versus placebo in low-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Additionally, VIR-7831, along with VIR-7832 will be evaluated in the Phase 1b/2a National Health Service-supported AGILE trial in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. VIR-7832 is the second monoclonal antibody from the Vir-GSK collaboration to be investigated as a potential COVID-19 treatment.</p>
<p align=""justify"">VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 are investigational compounds, not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other regulatory authority.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>COMET-ICE Clinical Trial Design</strong>
The multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled COMET-ICE trial is investigating VIR-7831 in adults with mild or moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. The Phase 1 lead-in portion of the trial, which served as the first-in-human assessment, evaluated the safety and tolerability of a single 500 mg intravenous (IV) infusion of VIR-7831 or placebo over a 14-day period in 21 non-hospitalized adults enrolled across the United States.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In October 2020, based on a positive evaluation of safety and tolerability data of VIR-7831 from the lead-in part of the trial by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, the trial began enrolling patients in North America and additional sites in South America and Europe in the global Phase 3 portion of the trial. This part of the trial is assessing the safety and efficacy of a single IV infusion of VIR-7831 or placebo in approximately 1,300 non-hospitalized participants globally.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About VIR-7831 / GSK4182136</strong>
VIR-7831 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7831, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ technology, also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About VIR-7832 / GSK4182137</strong>
VIR-7832 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and an enhanced ability to clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7832, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend and other Fc technologies, has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life. Importantly, VIR-7832 also has been engineered to potentially enhance virus-specific T cell function, which could help treat and/or prevent COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Vir and GSK Collaboration</strong>
In April 2020, Vir and GSK entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The collaboration uses Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>GSK Commitment to Tackling COVID-19</strong>
GSK’s response to COVID-19 has been one of the broadest in the industry, with two potential treatments in addition to our vaccine candidates in development.</p>
<p align=""justify"">GSK is collaborating with several organizations on COVID-19 vaccines by providing access to our adjuvant technology. In addition to work with Sanofi, our collaboration with Medicago on an adjuvanted, protein-based vaccine candidate is now in late-stage clinical trials. An earlier stage collaboration with SK Bioscience is also ongoing, with funding from CEPI and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to develop differentiated, affordable COVID-19 vaccines for supply globally through the COVAX facility. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced, contributing to protecting more people.</p>
<p align=""justify"">GSK is also working with mRNA specialist, CureVac, to jointly develop next generation, multi-valent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine. GSK will also support manufacturing of up to 100m doses of CureVac’s first generation COVID-19 vaccine, if approved.</p>
<p align=""justify"">GSK is also exploring potential therapeutic or treatment options for COVID-19 patients. We are collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to develop existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19.</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">TOKYO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 11, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: <span class=""xn-person"">Kenji Yasukawa</span>, Ph.D., ""Astellas"") today announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to <span class=""xn-location"">Japan's</span> Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for enfortumab vedotin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that has progressed after anti-cancer medication. If approved, enfortumab vedotin would be the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) available in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> for people living with this form of urothelial cancer.

The submission is based on two global clinical trials with sites in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>. The Phase 3 EV-301 trial evaluated enfortumab vedotin versus chemotherapy in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 inhibitor. The Phase 2 EV-201 trial evaluated enfortumab vedotin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, including those who have also been treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy (cohort 1) and those who have not received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and who are ineligible for cisplatin (cohort 2).<sup>1,2</sup>

Enfortumab vedotin met the primary endpoints of overall survival (EV-301) and confirmed objective response rate per blinded independent central review (EV-201).<sup>3,4,5</sup>

""More than 24,000 people in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> are diagnosed with urothelial cancer each year. For those whose cancer progresses despite treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, there is no standard treatment option currently,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Andrew Krivoshik</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Oncology Therapeutic Area Head, Astellas. ""Based on data from two global clinical trials, and following the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's review, enfortumab vedotin may offer a new option for these patients.""

<b>About Urothelial Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Urothelial cancer is the most common type of bladder cancer (90 percent of cases), and can also be found in the renal pelvis (where urine collects inside the kidney), ureter (tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder) and urethra.<sup>6</sup> Globally, approximately 549,000 new cases of bladder cancer and 200,000 deaths are reported annually.<sup>7</sup> In Japan, it is estimated that 24,300 patients are diagnosed with this form of cancer and 9,500 deaths are reported annually.<sup>8</sup>

Locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer is an aggressive disease that is associated with poor survival and high healthcare costs.<sup>9</sup>  Five-year relative survival rates for metastatic disease are estimated to be approximately 7 percent.<sup>10</sup>

<b>About the EV-301 Trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The EV-301 trial (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3093605-1&amp;h=1875143278&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03474107%3Fterm%3Dev-301%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;a=NCT03474107"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03474107</a>) is a global, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial designed to evaluate enfortumab vedotin versus physician's choice of chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine) in approximately 600 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-based therapies.<sup>1</sup> The primary endpoint is overall survival of participants treated with enfortumab vedotin compared to those treated with chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, duration of response, and overall response rate, as well as assessment of safety/tolerability and quality-of-life parameters. Results of the EV-301 trial were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.

<b>About the EV-201 Trial<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The EV-201 trial (<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3093605-1&amp;h=2445728412&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03219333&amp;a=NCT03219333"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03219333</a>) is a single-arm, pivotal phase 2 clinical trial of enfortumab vedotin for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, including those who have also been treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy (cohort 1) and those who have not received a platinum-containing chemotherapy in this setting and who are ineligible for cisplatin (cohort 2). The trial enrolled 128 patients in cohort 1 and 91 patients in cohort 2 at multiple centers internationally.<sup>2</sup> The primary endpoint is confirmed objective response rate per blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include assessments of duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability. Results of the first cohort from the EV-201 trial were published in <i>The Journal of Clinical Oncology </i>and results from the second cohort were presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancer Symposium<i>.</i>

<b>About Enfortumab Vedotin<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Enfortumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.<sup>11,12</sup> Nonclinical data suggest the anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin is due to its binding to Nectin-4 expressing cells followed by the internalization and release of the anti-tumor agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) into the cell, which result in the cell not reproducing (cell cycle arrest) and in programmed cell death (apoptosis).<sup>11</sup>

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">March 11, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced the formation of the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition, a first-of-its-kind global scientific and public health partnership dedicated to the early detection of, and rapid response to, future pandemic threats. By connecting global centers of excellence in laboratory testing, genetic sequencing and public health research, the program will identify new pathogens, analyze potential risk level, rapidly develop and deploy new diagnostic testing and assess public health impact in real time.

The coalition is designed to help the global scientific and health community identify new viral threats, take quick action when one is discovered, and help prevent future pandemics. The sequences of the viruses that are found will be published in a public database so that health officials and laboratories can work together to identify if it's a novel strain, or a virus that has previously been detected. This program expands upon the viral surveillance and discovery work that Abbott has performed over the last three decades.

""We cannot fight what we cannot see coming. This program establishes a global network of 'eyes on the ground' that are always looking for threats, which helps the global health community to stay one step ahead of the next viral threat, and allows us to utilize Abbott's expertise and technology to quickly develop tests to address them,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Gavin Cloherty</span>, Ph.D., head of infectious disease research at Abbott. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a clear need for advanced surveillance and viral sequencing – and the critically important role of testing. Understanding what pathogenic threats are emerging will help us test, diagnose and hopefully help prevent the next pandemic.""

<b>Abbott is helping look for COVID-19 variants and ensuring COVID-19 tests are effective<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Abbott is playing an important role in helping to monitor for new variants or mutations to the virus that causes COVID-19. The company is collecting virus samples from around the world and looking for any changes (mutations) to the virus's genetic sequencing.

With decades of experience in viral surveillance, Abbott specifically designs its tests, including COVID-19 tests, with viral evolution in mind. As new strains are discovered, Abbott vigorously analyzes them so it can ensure its diagnostic tests can detect them. The coalition provides the network to collaborate with other leading institutions on this effort.

<b>A global force of scientific experts focused on outsmarting viruses <br class=""dnr"" /></b>The new Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition consists of global collaborators specializing in virus identification, surveillance, sample collection, testing and data analytics. The process to identify potential new viral threats begins with physicians across the network identifying patients with unknown conditions that they cannot treat or diagnose. Next, patient samples are tested by our partners on a global scale, followed by genetic sequencing and analyses to spot trends and identify peculiarities that may indicate an emerging threat or outbreak. If a potential threat is discovered, Abbott will quickly develop diagnostic testing to assist in containment efforts.

Abbott is in talks with additional non-governmental organizations, governments and research centers of excellence regarding participation and collaboration.

""In a sophisticated network like the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition, we have access to best-in-class science and technology that makes data collection, analysis and sharing efficient and effective,"" said Professor <span class=""xn-person"">Souleymane Mboup</span>, president of Institut de Recherche en Santé, de Surveillance Epidemiologique et de Formations (IRESSEF) of <span class=""xn-location"">Dakar, Senegal</span>. ""The key here is collaboration; no single lab or organization in any one country would be able to conduct testing and analysis of this breadth and scale but connecting global centers of excellence makes it possible for us all to assist in identifying the next potential threats to public health.""

<b>A history of hunting viruses around the globe – and a future dedicated to further advancing this vital work  <br class=""dnr"" /></b>As a leader in blood screening and infectious disease testing, Abbott created its Global Viral Surveillance Program more than 25 years ago to monitor HIV and hepatitis viruses and identify mutations, which helps ensure the company's diagnostic tests remain up to date and enable researchers to proactively evaluate and solve infectious disease challenges. This surveillance program will now be a part of the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition.

Through its surveillance efforts, the company recently announced the discovery of a high prevalence of HIV Controllers – a group of people living with controlled HIV without antiretroviral medications in the <span class=""xn-location"">Democratic Republic of Congo</span><sup>1</sup>, which could hold the key to a cure. Abbott also announced the finding of a new strain of HIV in 2019<sup>2</sup>.

And looking ahead, Abbott will focus on testing and digital solutions accessible to more people in more places for many of the world's most pressing health challenges, including infectious diseases. This work also is an important part of Abbott's <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3093566-1&amp;h=4153617053&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abbott.com%2Fsustainability&amp;a=2030"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">2030</a> sustainability strategy which includes a focus on transforming the care of infectious diseases. Across its business and through collaboration, Abbott will create new technologies to detect and monitor infectious diseases such as COVID-19, HIV, malaria and hepatitis, as well as tomorrow's pandemic threats.

<strong>PARIS and LEXINGTON, MASS. – March 12, 2021 -</strong> Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, and Translate Bio (NASDAQ: TBIO), a clinical-stage messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics company, today announced the start of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for MRT5500, an mRNA vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Companies expect interim results from this trial in the third quarter of 2021.
<p align=""justify""><em>“Our mRNA vaccine candidate is the result of our expertise in infectious diseases coupled with the innovative technologies of our partner,” </em>said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur. <em>“Initiating the Phase 1/2 trial represents an important step forward in our </em><em>goal of bringing</em><em> another </em><em>effective vaccine </em><em>to the ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“</em><em>We have made important progress towards developing mRNA vaccine candidates for infectious diseases through our collaboration with our partner Sanofi Pasteur</em><em>,” </em>said Ronald Renaud, Chief Executive Officer of Translate Bio. <em>“</em><em>With the impact of mRNA vaccines demonstrated during the pandemic, our joint development team remains steadfast in our commitment to advancing MRT5500 as part of the collaborative effort </em><em>to overcome this global health crisis.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">Preclinical studies are ongoing and will continue over the next several months to evaluate whether MRT5500, as well as additional mRNA vaccine candidates, will induce neutralizing antibodies against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, with the potential to inform current and future clinical development.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The joint development team is working on improving the temperature stability of the mRNA vaccine candidate and targeting a -20°C storage temperature for late-stage clinical trials and at launch. Efforts are also underway to enable the product to be stable at routine refrigerator temperature (2-8°C).</p>
<p align=""justify"">MRT5500 is being developed under a collaboration and license agreement between Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Phase 1/2 clinical trial</strong>
The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity (tolerability) and immunogenicity (immune response) of MRT5500, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. A total of 415 healthy adults 18 years of age and older are expected to be enrolled in the trial across 13 investigational sites.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Clinical trial participants will receive one dose of MRT5500, or two doses 21 days apart. Three different dose levels will be investigated (15µg, 45µg or 135µg).</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About previously-published preclinical results</strong>
Preclinical data <a title="""" href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.337535v1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><u>showed</u></a> that two immunizations of the mRNA vaccine induced high neutralizing antibody levels that are comparable to the upper range of those observed in infected humans.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Sanofi Pasteur and Translate Bio collaboration</strong>
In 2018, Translate Bio entered into a collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Sanofi Pasteur Inc., the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, to develop mRNA vaccines for up to five infectious disease pathogens. The agreement was first expanded in March 2020 to include development of a novel mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. In June 2020, the two Companies built upon the existing collaboration to pursue novel mRNA vaccines to broadly address current and future infectious diseases.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This collaboration brings together Sanofi Pasteur’s leadership in vaccines and Translate Bio’s mRNA research and development expertise. Under the agreement, the Companies are jointly conducting research and development activities to advance mRNA infectious disease vaccine candidates and mRNA vaccine platform development during a research term of at least four years after the original signing in 2018.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Shots on goal in the fight against COVID-19</strong>
In addition to the mRNA vaccine candidate in collaboration with Translate Bio, Sanofi is collaborating with GSK on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate using the same recombinant protein-based manufacturing technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines, combined with GSK’s established pandemic adjuvant platform. On February 22, 2021, GSK and Sanofi <a title=""announced"" href=""https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2021/2021-02-22-11-40-00"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">announced</a> the beginning of a new Phase 2 study with an improved antigen formulation. Enrollment of total 720 participants was completed on March 8. This vaccine is expected to be available in Q4 2021 pending Phase 3 outcomes and regulatory authorizations.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Translate Bio</strong>
Translate Bio is a clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics company developing a new class of potentially transformative medicines to treat diseases caused by protein or gene dysfunction, or to prevent infectious diseases by generating protective immunity. Translate Bio is primarily focused on applying its technology to treat pulmonary diseases with a lead pulmonary candidate being evaluated as an inhaled treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Additional pulmonary diseases are being evaluated in discovery-stage research programs that utilize a proprietary lung delivery platform.

<strong>OSAKA, Japan</strong> <strong>March 12, 2021 –</strong> Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited <strong>(</strong>TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK<strong>)</strong> (“Takeda”) today announced that it has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan for lanadelumab subcutaneous injection, a monoclonal antibody therapy for prophylaxis against attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE).

HAE is a rare genetic disorder that results in recurrent attacks of oedema – swelling – in various parts of the body, including the abdomen, face, feet, genitals, hands and throat.<sup>2,3,4 </sup>HAE affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 people worldwide.<sup>5 </sup>In Japan, it is estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 people are living with HAE, but only approximately 450 have been diagnosed due to low awareness of the disorder in the country.<sup>6

</sup>“HAE is unpredictable, debilitating and potentially life-threatening, and recognition of the disease remains low in Japan, meaning there are significant challenges relating to diagnosis and access to effective therapies,” said Naoyoshi Hirota, General Manager, Takeda Development Center, Japan. “Lanadelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and decreases plasma kallikrein activity, with a proven efficacy and safety profile as a preventive treatment for HAE attacks. Takeda is committed to bringing important therapies such as lanadelumab to patients with high unmet medical needs around the world. Subject to approval, we are looking forward to providing lanadelumab as a new treatment option for patients in Japan living with HAE.”

Lanadelumab, under the tradename TAKHZYRO<sup>®</sup>, received its first approval for the prevention of HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older in 2018 and is now available in more than 20 countries with additional regulatory submissions ongoing worldwide.<sup>7

</sup>The submission of the New Drug Application in Japan is primarily based on results of the global Phase 3 HELP (Hereditary Angioedema Long-term Prophylaxis) Study™ and the Phase 3 HELP Study Open-label Extension (OLE), in addition to interim results of a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lanadelumab in Japanese subjects.<sup>1,8 </sup>Combined, these studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety profile of lanadelumab as a preventive treatment for HAE attacks. If approved, lanadelumab will be available to patients in Japan as a pre-filled syringe presentation.

In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled HELP study, which included 125 people with HAE, lanadelumab reduced the mean number of monthly HAE attacks by 87% relative to placebo when administered at 300 mg every two weeks and 73% relative to placebo when administered at 300 mg every four weeks (adjusted P&lt;0.001).<sup>1 </sup>A prespecified, exploratory analysis showed that over the entire 26-week study (days 0-182), 44% (n=12/27) of patients taking lanadelumab 300 mg every two weeks were attack-free vs. 2% (n=1/41) of patients taking placebo.<sup>1 </sup>A post-hoc sensitivity analysis showed that 77% (n=20/26) of the patients receiving lanadelumab 300 mg every two weeks were attack-free during a steady-state (day 70-182) vs. 3% of patients on placebo (n=1/37).<sup>1</sup> The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events (excluding HAE attacks) in patients treated with lanadelumab (n=84) during the entire treatment period were injection site pain (42.9%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (23.8%), headache (20.2%), injection site erythema (9.5%), injection site bruising (7.1%), and dizziness (6.0%).<sup>1 </sup>Most treatment-emergent adverse events (98.5%) were mild to moderate in severity.<sup>1</sup> The HELP Study<sup>™</sup> is the largest randomized, controlled clinical prevention study conducted to date in HAE.

The regulatory submission in Japan will be evaluated by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Following its review, the PMDA will issue a report to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan for a final decision.

<strong>Takeda in Hereditary Angioedema
</strong>Hereditary Angioedema (HAE), like so many other rare diseases, is highly complex, and patients, their families and caregivers often undergo years of strain trying to understand their disease, get a definitive diagnosis and gain access to the medicines they need. At Takeda we are a committed champion for the patients we serve. Every individual living with HAE is unique and by listening and reacting to their needs, we translate the insights we gain into innovative solutions – from diagnosis to ongoing management. Advancing the science is crucial to the way we operate and we are unafraid to push at the boundaries of success in our mission to accelerate diagnosis and develop transformative and sustainable treatments that will make a difference to the lives of HAE patients, their support networks and those medical professionals who care for them.

<strong>About Lanadelumab
</strong>Lanadelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and decreases plasma kallikrein activity and is indicated for prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older. Lanadelumab is formulated for subcutaneous administration and has a half-life of approximately two weeks.<sup>7 </sup>Lanadelumab is intended for self-administration or administration by a caregiver. The patient or caregiver should be trained by a healthcare professional.<sup>7

</sup><strong>TAKHZYRO<sup>® </sup>(lanadelumab) Safety Information for Europe
</strong>Please consult the <a href=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/takhzyro-epar-product-information_en.pdf"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/takhzyro-epar-product-information_en.pdf"" data-action=""External"">TAKHZYRO Summary Product Characteristics (SmPC)</a> before prescribing.

TAKHZYRO treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). TAKHZYRO may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training on SC injection technique by a healthcare professional.<sup>7

</sup><strong>Contraindication
</strong>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.<sup>7

</sup><strong>Warnings and Precautions
</strong>Traceability: In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.<sup> 7

</sup>Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed. In case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, administration of TAKHZYRO must be stopped immediately and appropriate treatment must be initiated.<sup> 7

</sup>General: TAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks. In case of a breakthrough HAE attack, individualized treatment should be initiated with an approved rescue medication. There are no available clinical data on the use of lanadelumab in HAE patients with normal C1-INH activity.<sup> 7

</sup>Interference with coagulation test: Lanadelumab can increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of lanadelumab with the aPTT assay. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic coagulation through the activation of plasma kallikrein in the contact system. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein by lanadelumab can increase aPTT in this assay. None of the increases in aPTT in patients treated with TAKHZYRO were associated with abnormal bleeding adverse events. There were no differences in international normalised ratio (INR) between treatment groups.<sup> 7

</sup>Sodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.<sup> 7

</sup><strong>Interactions
</strong>No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on the characteristics of lanadelumab, no pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered medicinal products is expected.<sup> 7

</sup>As expected, concomitant use of the rescue medication C1 esterase inhibitor results in an additive effect on lanadelumab-cHMWK response based on the mechanism of action (MOA) of lanadelumab and C1 esterase inhibitor.<sup> 7

</sup><strong>Immunogenicity
</strong>Treatment with lanadelumab has been associated with development of treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in 11.9% (10/84) of subjects. All antibody titres were low. The ADA response was transient in 20% (2/10) of ADA positive subjects. 2.4% (2/84) of lanadelumab-treated subjects tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.<sup>7

</sup>The development of ADA including neutralising antibodies against TAKHZYRO did not appear to adversely affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles or clinical response.<sup>7

</sup><strong>Adverse Reactions
</strong>The most commonly observed adverse reaction (52.4%) associated with TAKHZYRO was injection site reactions (ISR) including injection site pain, injection site erythema and injection site bruising. Of these ISRs, 97% were of mild intensity, 90% resolved within 1 day after onset with a median duration of 6 minutes.<sup>7

</sup>Hypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was observed (1.2%)

MALVERN, Pa. &amp; SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: PHAS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for cardiopulmonary diseases, and BioVectra Inc., an innovative global contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), today announced a commercial scale supply agreement for the production of bentracimab, PhaseBio’s lead product candidate currently in a global Phase 3 clinical trial. Bentracimab is a novel, human monoclonal antibody fragment that in earlier clinical trials has shown immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of Brilinta® (ticagrelor).
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Under the terms of the agreement, BioVectra will provide its integrated CDMO services for the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of bentracimab for use in PhaseBio’s ongoing global clinical trials and for global commercial use upon regulatory approval. Utilizing a cost-efficient, E.coli-based manufacturing process at its manufacturing site in Windsor, Nova Scotia, BioVectra recently completed the first GMP run of bentracimab at commercial scale. Going forward, PhaseBio plans to integrate API manufactured at commercial scale at BioVectra into the ongoing Phase 2b and Phase 3 REVERSE-IT clinical trials to support global regulatory filings.

“As we prepare for the next phase of growth for bentracimab, we’re pleased to sign this agreement with BioVectra for the commercial supply and development of our novel reversal agent,” said Jonathan P. Mow, Chief Executive Officer of PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals. “Having recently expanded our global Phase 3 REVERSE-IT trial into Canada and the European Union, and with other countries on the horizon, the signing of this agreement and the completion of our first commercial-scale manufacturing run are important steps as we continue preparing our regulatory filings and commercialization efforts for bentracimab. We believe BioVectra will be an excellent partner as we move down the path of developing and potentially commercializing the first specific antiplatelet reversal agent for ticagrelor.”

Pending approval of the drug by regulators, the partnership will enable PhaseBio to supply bentracimab at launch in the U.S. to key trauma and critical care centers. Based on data from IQVIA®, PhaseBio believes that providing adequate bentracimab supply for initial stocking and demand-based reorders for these key centers will make bentracimab accessible to approximately 80% of the population in the U.S. who are prescribed P2Y<sub>12 </sub>inhibitors like ticagrelor.

“We’re excited to be partnering with PhaseBio under this new commercial agreement for the high-volume scale-up and global supply of bentracimab,” said Oliver Technow, Chief Executive Officer of BioVectra. “BioVectra is an expert CDMO with proven, specialized capability in scaling the most complex biologic drug substances produced from fermentation. Leveraging our fully integrated approach and 50 years of experience, our highly-skilled team looks forward to continuing to make a difference in patients’ lives by delivering on and supporting PhaseBio’s global commercialization of bentracimab from our new, large-scale Microbial Biomanufacturing facility.”

<b>About Bentracimab (PB2452)</b>

Bentracimab is a novel, recombinant, human monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment designed to reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in major bleeding and urgent surgery situations. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, bentracimab demonstrated the potential to bring life-saving therapeutic benefit through immediate and sustained reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity, mitigating concerns regarding bleeding risks associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs. The Phase 1 clinical trial of bentracimab in healthy volunteers was published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> in March 2019. In April 2019, bentracimab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation may be granted by the FDA when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapy. In September 2019, PhaseBio completed a Phase 2a trial in which bentracimab was investigated in older and elderly subjects on dual antiplatelet therapy of ticagrelor and low-dose aspirin. Additionally, the Phase 2a trial investigated a bentracimab regimen for the reversal of supratherapeutic doses of ticagrelor in healthy younger subjects. In both arms of the trial, bentracimab achieved immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor and was generally well-tolerated, with only minor adverse events reported. These results are consistent with the results observed in healthy younger subjects treated with ticagrelor in the previously published Phase 1 trial. PhaseBio initiated the REVERSE-IT trial, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of bentracimab, in March 2020 to support a Biologics License Application for bentracimab in both major bleeding and urgent surgery indications. There are currently no approved reversal agents for ticagrelor or any other antiplatelet drugs.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Donanemab, an investigational antibody that targets a modified form of beta amyloid called N3pG, showed significant slowing of decline in a composite measure of cognition and daily function in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease compared to placebo in results from Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) Phase 2 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study. Donanemab met the primary endpoint of change from baseline to 76 weeks in the Integrated Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), slowing decline by 32 percent relative to placebo, which was statistically significant. The iADRS is a clinical composite tool combining the cognitive measure ADAS-Cog13 and functional measure ADCS-iADL, two commonly used measures in Alzheimer’s disease. Donanemab also showed consistent improvements in all prespecified secondary endpoints measuring cognition and function compared to placebo, but did not reach nominal statistical significance on every secondary endpoint.

“We are extremely pleased about these positive findings for donanemab as a potential therapy for people living with Alzheimer’s disease, the only leading cause of death without a treatment that slows disease progression. We look forward to discussing the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study data and next steps with global regulators. In addition, we are committed to reproducing and extending these important findings in our second ongoing pivotal donanemab trial, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2,” said Mark Mintun, M.D., vice president of pain and neurodegeneration, Eli Lilly and Company. “With more than 30 years of dedication to finding solutions for this devastating disease, we are proud of our progress moving the field forward and advancing the science. These positive results give us hope for patients and their families.”

By targeting N3pG beta amyloid, donanemab treatment has been shown to rapidly result in high levels of amyloid plaque clearance, as measured by amyloid imaging. In TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, donanemab-treated patients, on average, showed an 84 centiloid reduction of amyloid plaque at 76 weeks compared to a baseline of 108 centiloids (less than 25 centiloids is typical of a negative amyloid scan). In this study, patients stopped receiving donanemab and switched to placebo once their plaque level was below 25 centiloids for two consecutive measures or below 11 centiloids at any one measure.

“This unique mechanism and antibody for clearing plaques, discovered at Lilly, has the potential to provide high levels of durable amyloid plaque clearance after limited duration dosing,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “In conjunction with our expertise in amyloid and tau imaging, this allowed us to conduct a trial to test if reducing amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s patients to levels seen in scans of healthy individuals could result in clinically meaningful slowing of cognitive decline. The positive results we have obtained today give us confidence in donanemab and support its rapid and deep plaque clearance for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.”

The safety profile of donanemab was consistent with observations from Phase 1 data. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were observed, which is consistent with amyloid plaque clearing antibodies. In the donanemab treatment group, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities – edema (ARIA-E) occurred in 27 percent of treated participants, with an overall incidence of 6 percent experiencing symptomatic ARIA-E.

The full results of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study will be presented at a future medical congress and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed clinical journal. Lilly plans to discuss these results with regulators to assess next steps for donanemab. In addition, TRAILBLAZER-EXT is an ongoing trial for those who participated in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ.

About TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Study
TRAILBLAZER-ALZ (NCT03367403) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center Phase 2 study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The trial enrolled 272 patients who were selected based on cognitive assessments in conjunction with amyloid plaque imaging and tau imaging. The study’s primary endpoint is change from baseline until 76 weeks in the Integrated Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), a composite tool combining the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL) for function. Key secondary endpoints include changes between baseline and 76 weeks in the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), ADCS-iADL, MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Other secondary biomarker endpoints include changes from baseline to week 76 in brain amyloid deposition and brain tau deposition. The safety, tolerability and efficacy of donanemab are also being evaluated in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center Phase 2 study TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (NCT04437511).

About Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition. Dementia due to Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of all cases.1 There are currently over 50 million people living with dementia around the world, with numbers expected to increase to nearly 152 million by 2050.2 Almost 10 million new cases of dementia are diagnosed each year worldwide, implying one new case every 3 seconds, and a significant increase in the caregiving burden placed on society and families. In the U.S. alone, there was an increase of 8 million new caregivers from 2015 to 2020.3 The current annual societal and economic cost of dementia is estimated at $1 trillion, an amount that is expected to double by 2030 unless we find a way to slow the disease.2

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced positive results demonstrating an overall survival (OS) benefit from the Phase 3 trial investigating the PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) monotherapy compared to chemotherapy, in patients previously treated with chemotherapy whose cervical cancer is recurrent or metastatic. The trial will be stopped early based on a unanimous recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), and the data will form the basis of regulatory submissions in 2021.

“Libtayo monotherapy is the first medicine to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival in women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer following progression on platinum-based chemotherapy in a Phase 3 trial,” said Krishnansu S. Tewari, M.D., Professor and Director of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at the University of California, Irvine and a trial investigator. “This landmark clinical achievement will bring hope to women with advanced cervical cancer who are often younger than patients with other cancers. This is reflected in this trial where the average age was 51.”

This is the largest Phase 3 randomized clinical trial in advanced cervical cancer, and included women (median age: 51 years) with either squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Patients were randomized to receive Libtayo monotherapy (350 mg every 3 weeks) or an investigator’s choice of commonly used chemotherapy (pemetrexed, vinorelbine, topotecan, irinotecan or gemcitabine). Compared to chemotherapy, patients receiving Libtayo experienced:

Total population: 31% reduced risk of death
Median 12.0 months survival for Libtayo (n=304) compared to 8.5 months for chemotherapy (n=304); hazard ratio (HR): 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.84 (p<0.001)
Squamous cell carcinoma: 27% reduced risk of death
Median 11.1 months survival for Libtayo (n=239) compared to 8.8 months for chemotherapy (n=238); HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.91 (p=0.003)
Adenocarcinoma: 44% reduced risk of death
Median 13.3 months survival for Libtayo (n=65) compared to 7.0 months for chemotherapy (n=66); HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.36-0.85 (p<0.005; not adjusted for multiplicity)
The primary endpoint for the trial was OS, analyzed first among patients with squamous cell carcinoma, then in the total population. Per a protocol-specified interim analysis, the IDMC reviewed OS data when approximately 85% of events had occurred among patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Based on the highly significant effect on OS among these patients, the IDMC recommended stopping the trial. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. The use of Libtayo in cervical cancer is investigational and has not been fully reviewed by any regulatory authority.

No new Libtayo safety signals were observed. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment: 300 patients in the Libtayo group (median duration of exposure: 15 weeks; range: 1-101 weeks) and 290 patients in the chemotherapy group (median duration of exposure: 10 weeks; range: 1-82 weeks). Adverse events (AEs) were observed in 88% of Libtayo patients and 91% of chemotherapy patients, with serious AEs occurring in 30% of Libtayo patients and 27% of chemotherapy patients. The 5 most common AEs were anemia (25% Libtayo, 45% chemotherapy), nausea (18% Libtayo, 33% chemotherapy), fatigue (17% Libtayo, 16% chemotherapy), vomiting (16% Libtayo, 23% chemotherapy) and constipation (15% Libtayo, 20% chemotherapy). Other AEs that occurred more often in the Libtayo group and in at least 10% of patients were fatigue (17% Libtayo, 16% chemotherapy), urinary tract infections (12% Libtayo, 9% chemotherapy), back pain (11% Libtayo, 9% chemotherapy) and arthralgia (10% Libtayo, 3% chemotherapy). Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 8% of Libtayo patients and 5% of chemotherapy patients.

“Recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer is notoriously difficult to treat and has no approved standard of care after first-line chemotherapy,” said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology, at Regeneron. “This trial, which enrolled patients regardless of their PD-L1 status, demonstrated that Libtayo helped patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer live longer after progression on prior chemotherapy. This is the fourth patient population in which Libtayo has shown clinical benefit and we look forward to submitting the results to regulatory authorities later this year.”

Today’s announcement follows the recent U.S. approval of Libtayo monotherapy for certain patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression. The FDA also recently authorized the use of Libtayo as the first immunotherapy indicated for patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI) or for whom an HHI is not appropriate, whose cancer is either locally-advanced (full approval) or metastatic (accelerated approval). In 2018, Libtayo was approved as the first systemic treatment for certain patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).

“We are committed to developing therapies for cancers with high unmet needs including patients with advanced cervical cancer,” said Peter C. Adamson, M.D., Global Development Head, Oncology and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi. “Combined with data from our non-melanoma skin cancer and lung cancer studies, these data contribute to the growing evidence demonstrating the significant potential of Libtayo to treat a spectrum of difficult-to-treat cancers.”

About the Phase 3 Trial
This open-label, randomized, multi-center, Phase 3 trial investigated Libtayo monotherapy versus an investigator’s choice of chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer that has progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were allowed to enroll regardless of PD-L1 expression status with 78% of patients having squamous cell carcinoma and 22% having adenocarcinoma. The trial included women from 14 countries: the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Canada, Russia, Poland, Spain, Brazil, Australia, the UK, Italy, Greece and Belgium.

About Cervical Cancer
Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and is most frequently diagnosed in women between the ages of 35 and 44. Almost all cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, with approximately 80% classified as squamous cell carcinoma (arising from cells lining the bottom of the cervix) and the remainder largely adenocarcinomas (arising from glandular cells in the upper cervix). Cervical cancer is often curable when detected early and effectively managed, but treatment options are more limited in advanced stages.

It is estimated that there are approximately 570,000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide each year. In the U.S. there are 14,500 new patients diagnosed annually and approximately 4,000 women die each year.

About Libtayo
Libtayo is a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.

In the U.S., Libtayo is approved for certain patients with advanced stages of CSCC, BCC and NSCLC with =50% PD-L1 expression. Outside of the U.S., Libtayo is approved for certain patients with advanced CSCC in the European Union and six other countries, including Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Canada.

The generic name for Libtayo in its approved U.S. indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the FDA. Outside of the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab.

About Regeneron’s VelocImmune® Technology
Libtayo was invented using Regeneron’s VelocImmune® technology that utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron’s co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create multiple antibodies including Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Dupixent® (dupilumab), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza™ (evinacumab-dgnb), Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn) and Regeneron’s antibody cocktail for COVID-19, which was recently granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S.

About the Libtayo Development Program
The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. The European Medicines Agency is assessing regulatory submissions for Libtayo monotherapy in advanced NSCLC with =50% PD-L1 expression and locally advanced BCC following treatment with an HHI, with European Commission decisions expected by mid-2021.

Libtayo monotherapy is being investigated in trials in adjuvant CSCC and neoadjuvant CSCC, as well as in trials combining Libtayo with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for both solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Libtayo is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS

What is Libtayo?
Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) and have received treatment with an HHI, or cannot receive treatment with an HHI.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with an HHI. This use is approved based on how many patients responded to treatment and how long they responded. Studies are ongoing to provide additional information about clinical benefit.

Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Libtayo may be used as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, or your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), and your tumor tests positive for high “PD-L1” and your tumor does not have an abnormal “EGFR”,” ALK “or “ROS1” gene.

It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.

What is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?
Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system. Libtayo can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more than one of these problems at the same time. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended.

Call or see your healthcare provider right away if you develop any new or worsening signs or symptoms, including:

Lung problems: cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain
Intestinal problems: diarrhea (loose stools) or more frequent bowel movements than usual, stools that are black, tarry, sticky or have blood or mucus, or severe stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness
Liver problems: yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, severe nausea or vomiting, pain on the right side of your stomach area (abdomen), dark urine (tea colored), or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal
Hormone gland problems: headache that will not go away or unusual headaches, eye sensitivity to light, eye problems, rapid heartbeat, increased sweating, extreme tiredness, weight gain or weight loss, feeling more hungry or thirsty than usual, urinating more often than usual, hair loss, feeling cold, constipation, your voice gets deeper, dizziness or fainting, or changes in mood or behavior, such as decreased sex drive, irritability, or forgetfulness
Kidney problems: decrease in your amount of urine, blood in your urine, swelling of your ankles, or loss of appetite
Skin problems: rash, itching, skin blistering or peeling, painful sores or ulcers in mouth or nose, throat, or genital area, fever or flu-like symptoms, or swollen lymph nodes
Problems can also happen in other organs and tissues. These are not all of the signs and symptoms of immune system problems that can happen with Libtayo. Call or see your healthcare provider right away for any new or worsening signs or symptoms, which may include: chest pain, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath or swelling of ankles, confusion, sleepiness, memory problems, changes in mood or behavior, stiff neck, balance problems, tingling or numbness of the arms or legs, double vision, blurry vision, sensitivity to light, eye pain, changes in eyesight, persistent or severe muscle pain or weakness, muscle cramps, low red blood cells, or bruising
Infusion reactions that can sometimes be severe. Signs and symptoms of infusion reactions may include: nausea, chills or shaking, itching or rash, flushing, shortness of breath or wheezing, dizziness, feel like passing out, fever, back or neck pain, or facial swelling.
Rejection of a transplanted organ. Your healthcare provider should tell you what signs and symptoms you should report and monitor you, depending on the type of organ transplant that you have had.
Complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in people who have received a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic). These complications can be serious and can lead to death. These complications may happen if you underwent transplantation either before or after being treated with Libtayo. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for these complications.
Getting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from becoming more serious. Your healthcare provider will check you for these problems during your treatment with Libtayo. Your healthcare provider may treat you with corticosteroid or hormone replacement medicines. Your healthcare provider may also need to delay or completely stop treatment with Libtayo if you have severe side effects.

Before you receive Libtayo, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you:

have immune system problems such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or lupus
have received an organ transplant
have received or plan to receive a stem cell transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic)
have a condition that affects your nervous system, such as myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Libtayo can harm your unborn baby
Females who are able to become pregnant:
Your healthcare provider will give you a pregnancy test before you start treatment.
You should use an effective method of birth control during your treatment and for at least 4 months after your last dose of Libtayo. Talk with your healthcare provider about birth control methods that you can use during this time.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment with Libtayo.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Libtayo passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of Libtayo.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

The most common side effects of Libtayo include muscle or bone pain, tiredness, rash, and diarrhea. These are not all the possible side effects of Libtayo. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi at 1-877-542-8296.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Basel, 15 March 2021 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and GenMark Diagnostics (NASDAQ: GNMK) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement for Roche to fully acquire GenMark at a price of US$ 24.05 per share in an all-cash transaction. This corresponds to a total transaction value of approximately US$ 1.8 billion on a fully diluted basis. This price represents a premium of approximately 43% to GenMark’s unaffected closing share price on February 10, 2021, the last trading day before a media report was published speculating about a potential sale process. The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of GenMark and Roche. Once the acquisition is completed, GenMark’s principal operations will continue at its current location in Carlsbad, California, USA.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Roche will promptly commence a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of GenMark’s common stock, and GenMark will file a recommendation statement containing the unanimous recommendation of the GenMark board that GenMark stockholders tender their shares to Roche.

GenMark’s syndromic panel testing portfolio will complement Roche’s current molecular diagnostics portfolio and the Roche global network will enable expanded reach for GenMark’s products. GenMark’s ePlex system drives lab efficiency through streamlined order-to-reporting workflow and enables better patient outcomes by rapidly diagnosing a patient’s symptoms. Infectious diseases are a leading cause of death globally, and earlier detection of the cause of an infection has been shown to improve patient outcomes and improve key hospital initiatives such as antibiotic stewardship and length of stay.

“Acquiring GenMark Diagnostics will broaden our molecular diagnostics portfolio to include solutions that can provide lifesaving information quickly to patients and their healthcare providers in the fight against infectious diseases,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Their proven expertise in syndromic panel testing provides faster targeted therapeutic intervention, resulting in improved patient outcomes and reduced hospital stays, and will contribute to Roche’s commitment to helping control infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. The rapid identification of bloodstream infections and the detection of antimicrobial resistance genes are more essential than ever for hospitals and their patients.”

“As a part of Roche, we can accelerate our mission to enable rapid diagnosis of infectious disease to improve patient outcomes. Together with Roche’s diagnostics healthcare solutions, we will be able to provide a full suite of molecular diagnostic solutions to customers around the world,” said Scott Mendel, CEO of GenMark Diagnostics.  “We are thrilled to become a part of Roche and are confident that this is the right path forward for GenMark and our customers.”

GenMark’s Respiratory Pathogen Panels identify the most common viral and bacterial organisms associated with upper respiratory infection, including SARS-CoV-2, complementing Roche’s extensive portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostics solutions.

Terms of the Agreement
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Roche will promptly commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of GenMark’s common stock for US$ 24.05 per share in cash. Following the completion of the tender offer, Roche will acquire all remaining shares at the same price of US$ 24.05 per share in cash through a second step merger.

The transaction is expected to close in the 2nd quarter of 2021 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of GenMark’s common stock and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.

Citi is acting as financial advisor to Roche and Sidley Austin LLP is acting as legal counsel to Roche. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor to GenMark and DLA Piper LLP is acting as legal counsel to GenMark.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AVEO Oncology (Nasdaq: AVEO) today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb to evaluate FOTIVDA<sup>®</sup> (tivozanib) in combination with OPDIVO<sup>®</sup> (nivolumab), Bristol Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in the pivotal Phase 3 TiNivo-2 trial in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following prior immunotherapy exposure. FOTIVDA is an oral, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies.

The randomized, open-label, controlled TiNivo-2 Phase 3 trial is expected to enroll approximately 326 patients with advanced RCC who have progressed following prior immunotherapy treatment. The study plans to enroll across clinical sites in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either FOTIVDA (1.34 mg/QD for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment) in combination with OPDIVO (480 mg every 4 weeks) or FOTIVDA alone. The TiNivo-2 study’s primary endpoint will assess progression free survival (PFS), with key secondary endpoints to include overall survival, overall response rate and duration of response, and safety.

“With the recent U.S. FDA approval of FOTIVDA in the relapsed/refractory RCC setting, I look forward to further exploring FOTIVDA’s immunomodulatory effects and differentiated tolerability profile in combination with OPDIVO,” said Toni Choueiri, M.D., Director, Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology; Director, Kidney Cancer Center; Jerome and Nancy Kohlberg Chair and Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “This combination was first explored in the Phase 1/2 TiNivo study, where it demonstrated favorable tolerability and prolonged PFS using the combination of FOTIVDA and OPDIVO in both treatment naïve and previously treated patients with advanced RCC. The TiNivo-2 Phase 3 study is expected to further our understanding of the activity and tolerability of this combination following prior immunotherapy.”

“The advanced RCC treatment landscape has seen significant benefit from the introduction of immunotherapy-VEGF TKI combinations in earlier-line treatment, and we believe that this benefit could extend to the relapsed/refractory setting with an effective, well-tolerated combination,” said Michael Bailey, president and chief executive officer of AVEO. “On the heels of the recent U.S. FDA approval of FOTIVDA as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies, we are keenly interested in exploring its full potential in the combination setting. Working with our clinical collaborators and Bristol Myers Squibb, our goal is to advance this trial as expeditiously as possible.”

Bristol Myers Squibb will provide OPDIVO clinical drug supply for the study. AVEO will serve as the study sponsor and will be responsible for costs associated with the trial execution.

OPDIVO<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of Bristol Myers Squibb.

<b>About FOTIVDA<sup>®</sup> (tivozanib)</b>

FOTIVDA<sup>®</sup> (tivozanib) is an oral, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is a potent, selective inhibitor of VEGFRs 1, 2, and 3 with a long half-life designed to improve efficacy and tolerability. AVEO received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for FOTIVDA on March 10, 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following two or more prior systemic therapies. FOTIVDA was approved in August 2017 in the European Union and other countries in the territory of its partner EUSA Pharma (UK) Limited for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC. FOTIVDA has been shown to significantly reduce regulatory T-cell production in preclinical models<sup>1</sup>. FOTIVDA was discovered by Kyowa Kirin.

<b>INDICATIONS</b>

FOTIVDA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following two or more prior systemic therapies.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>

<b>Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis:</b> Control blood pressure prior to initiating FOTIVDA. Monitor for hypertension and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension despite use of anti-hypertensive medications, reduce the FOTIVDA dose.

<b>Cardiac Failure:</b> Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with FOTIVDA.

<b>Cardiac Ischemia and Arterial Thromboembolic Events:</b> Closely monitor patients who are at increased risk for these events. Permanently discontinue FOTIVDA for severe arterial thromboembolic events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

<b>Venous Thromboembolic Events:</b> Closely monitor patients who are at increased risk for these events. Permanently discontinue FOTIVDA for severe venous thromboembolic events.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","DUBLIN, Ohio, March 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its Cordis business to Hellman & Friedman (H&F) for approximately $1 billion, which includes buyer’s assumption of certain liabilities and seller’s retention of certain working capital accounts. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of Cardinal Health’s fiscal year 2022, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances.

“Cordis has a long history of innovation in minimally-invasive cardiovascular technology, and we are confident that with H&F as its owner, Cordis will be well-positioned for growth, innovation and success,” said Mike Kaufmann, CEO of Cardinal Health. “Cardinal Health and H&F have a shared passion for delivering high-quality medical products to customers and we are excited about the future for the Cordis business under H&F’s ownership.”

“Our decision to divest Cordis demonstrates our disciplined approach to evaluating our portfolio and focusing our resources in our strategic growth areas where we are an advantaged owner,” Kaufmann continued. “Looking forward, we remain committed to our medical distribution and global medical products businesses.”

“Cordis is an excellent fit with our philosophy of investing in great businesses as a market-leading cardiovascular device manufacturer known for high-quality products, strong physician satisfaction and superb patient outcomes,” said Hunter Philbrick, Partner at H&F. “We are excited to invest in the talented Cordis, Ajax and Zeus teams to drive industry leadership, therapeutic innovation and improved patient experiences.”

“We at Ajax Health and Zeus Health are ecstatic about injecting growth into Cordis’ powerful platform, and will do so through investments in the core business and through an independent R&D engine – the ‘Cordis Accelerator’ – to develop and commercialize a new pipeline of products exclusively for Cordis,” said Duke Rohlen, CEO of Ajax Health and Zeus Health, partners to H&F in the transaction, and Executive Chairman-designate of Cordis and CEO of Cordis Accelerator. “We see an unparalleled opportunity to partner with both existing Cordis leadership and H&F to combine a best-in-class innovation engine with a strong and robust commercial chassis. Together, we will establish Cordis as the standard bearer for medical device innovation.”

After closing, most assets and liabilities associated with the Cordis business will transfer to H&F. Cardinal Health will retain full authority for lawsuits related to inferior vena cava filters in the United States and Canada, as well as liability associated with these matters. Cardinal Health estimates that, after completion of the transition services agreement, the divestiture of the Cordis business will decrease Medical segment profit by approximately $60 million to $70 million on an annual run-rate basis.

In connection with the entry into this definitive agreement, Cardinal Health will classify the Cordis business as held for sale, which Cardinal Health expects to result in a pre-tax loss of up to $120 million in the third quarter of its fiscal year 2021. Additionally, Cardinal Health was authorized to incur costs associated with the planned divestiture of up to $125 million, primarily in its fiscal years 2021 and 2022.

(""BioXcel"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: BTAI), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology, today announced that BXCL501, the Company's investigational, proprietary, orally dissolving thin film formulation of dexmedetomidine (""Dex""), has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") for the acute treatment of agitation associated with dementia. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of certain product candidates designed to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and the designation includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">“Managing dementia related agitation, specifically in elderly patients, represents a significant challenge for physicians and caregivers, as there are currently no FDA-approved therapies and off-label drugs come with black box warnings,"" stated Vimal Mehta, Chief Executive Officer of BioXcel. ""The FDA's decision to grant Breakthrough Therapy designation further underscores the significant unmet need for a new treatment for this underserved patient population, as well as highlights BXCL501’s potential in becoming the first therapeutic option, if approved, to address this debilitating medical condition. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to advance BXCL501 into a pivotal dementia program, in hopes of quickly bringing this therapy to the millions of patients across treatment settings that lack alternative options.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">The Breakthrough Therapy designation for BXCL501 was supported by the positive topline data from the Phase 1b/2 TRANQUILITY study for the acute treatment of agitation associated with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. BXCL501 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in agitation measures at 2 hours post-dose with both the 30 and 60 mcg doses as measured by multiple scales. The dose dependent response observed has the potential to support the Company’s plans to evaluate BXCL501 for use across the full range of dementia care settings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Breakthrough Therapy designation is an FDA program intended to expedite the development and regulatory review of investigational therapies that are designed to address serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy designation requires preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. This designation provides the Company with more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, and eligibility for other actions to expedite the FDA review, such as a rolling review of a New Drug Application (“NDA”), where the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the complete application is submitted. An NDA for a product candidate receiving breakthrough designation may also be eligible for priority review if the relevant criteria are met. Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for approval.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About Dementia Related Agitation</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">Dementia is a neurocognitive condition caused by damage to brain cells that leads to a decline in cognitive abilities and independent function. It affects approximately 6 million individuals in the United States, with Alzheimer's disease accounting for up to 80% of these cases. During the course of the disease, patients with dementia often suffer from psychological and behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, which has been reported in up to 70% of patients. Agitation associated with dementia can negatively affect both the patient and caregiver's quality of life. Caregiver burden can contribute significantly to burnout, which can result in premature institutionalization of the patient. Treating agitation associated with dementia has been a challenge for providers as there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of dementia-related agitation, and off-label therapies have black box warnings associated with their use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify""><strong>About BXCL501</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"" align=""justify"">BXCL501 is an investigational, proprietary, orally dissolving thin film formulation of dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2a receptor agonist for the treatment of agitation and opioid withdrawal symptoms. BioXcel believes that BXCL501 potentially targets a causal agitation mechanism, and the Company has observed anti-agitation results in multiple clinical studies across several neuropsychiatric disorders. BXCL501 has been granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the acute treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and dementia. BXCL501 has been studied in two Phase 3 trials (SERENITY I and II) for the acute treatment of schizophrenia related agitation and bipolar disorder related agitation, respectively, and in a Phase 1b/2 trial (TRANQUILITY) for the acute treatment of dementia related agitation. This product candidate is also currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 trial (RELEASE) for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms and in a Phase 2 trial (PLACIDITY) for the treatment of delirium related agitation.</p>

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

FOSTER CITY, Calif. &amp; KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that they have entered into an agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV that combine Gilead’s investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, and Merck’s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir,<b> </b>into a two-drug regimen with the potential to provide new, meaningful treatment options for people living with HIV.

Islatravir and lenacapavir are both potentially first-in-class medicines in late-stage clinical trials, with significant clinical data generated to date. Both medicines have long half-lives and have demonstrated activity at low dosages in clinical studies, which support development as an investigational combination regimen with long-acting formulations, both oral and injectable.

The first clinical studies of the oral combination are expected to begin in the second half of 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck will work as partners, sharing operational responsibilities, as well as development, commercialization and marketing costs, and any future revenues.

Merck and Gilead seek to build on their legacies of transforming HIV care by focusing on long-acting therapies, which may represent a meaningful innovation in HIV drug development. While daily, single tablet regimens are available for people living with HIV, options that would allow for less frequent, oral dosing or infrequent injections rather than daily dosing have the potential to address preference considerations, as well as issues associated with adherence and privacy.

As the field of HIV treatment evolves, long-acting therapies may provide additional options for people living with HIV and their physicians that will help continue to put the needs of individuals at the center of their own care.

“At Merck, we are resolute in our commitment to advancing the care of people living with HIV as part of our mission to save and improve lives,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Merck. “This collaboration with Gilead brings together two companies dedicated to the fight against HIV to develop potential new long-acting treatment options, and is an important step forward in our strategy to harness the full potential of islatravir for the treatment of HIV.”

“Through this agreement with Merck, Gilead is reinforcing its long-term role in transforming HIV care,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “Our work in HIV over the past decades has been shaped by listening to people living with HIV and the physicians who treat them. Now we are taking the same approach with long-acting therapies, combining the most advanced science from both companies to accelerate progress.”

Lenacapavir and islatravir, alone and in combination, are investigational and not approved anywhere globally. Their safety and efficacy have not yet been established.

<b>Terms of the Collaboration</b>

Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead and Merck will co-develop and co-commercialize long-acting products to treat people living with HIV that combine Gilead’s proprietary investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, and Merck’s proprietary investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir. The collaboration will initially focus on long-acting oral formulations and long-acting injectable formulations of these combination products, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed.

Across the oral and injectable formulation programs, Gilead and Merck will share global development and commercialization costs 60%/40%, respectively. For long-acting oral products, Gilead will lead commercialization in the U.S. and Merck will lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world. For long-acting injectable products, Merck will lead commercialization in the U.S. and Gilead will lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world.

Gilead and Merck will co-promote in the U.S. and other certain major markets. Merck and Gilead will share global product revenues equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-agreed per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2 billion a year in net product sales for the oral combination, the revenue split will adjust to 65% Gilead and 35% Merck for any revenues above the threshold. Upon passing $3.5 billion a year in net product sales for the injectable combination, the revenue split will adjust to 65% Gilead and 35% Merck for any revenues above the threshold.

Beyond the potential combinations of lenacapavir and islatravir, Gilead will have the option to license certain of Merck’s investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination with lenacapavir. Reciprocally, Merck will have the option to license certain of Gilead’s investigational oral integrase inhibitors to develop in combination with islatravir. Each company may exercise its option for an investigational oral integrase inhibitor of the other company following completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial of that integrase inhibitor. Upon exercise of an option, the companies will split development cost and revenues, unless the non-exercising company decides to opt-out. Both companies currently have oral once-weekly integrase inhibitors in preclinical development.

Cowen &amp; Company LLC is acting as financial advisor to Gilead. Hogan Lovells and White &amp; Case, LLP are serving as legal counsel to Gilead. Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius and Gibson Dunn are serving as legal counsel to Merck.

<b>About Islatravir (MK-8591)</b>

Islatravir (formerly MK-8591) is Merck’s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) that exhibits both translocation inhibition (which prevents nucleotide binding and incorporation to the DNA chain, resulting in immediate chain termination) and delayed chain termination (which prevents nucleotide incorporation even in the event of translocation). Islatravir is currently being evaluated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretrovirals, including the ILLUMINATE clinical trials program for oral, once-daily treatment. Islatravir is also being studied for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of HIV-1 infection as a single agent across a variety of formulations, including the IMPOWER clinical trials evaluating an oral once-monthly regimen. In 2012, Merck licensed islatravir (4’-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2’-deoxyadenosine or EFdA) from the Yamasa Corporation based in Choshi, Japan.

<b>About Lenacapavir</b>

Lenacapavir is a novel investigational capsid inhibitor that interrupts the activity of HIV capsid, a protein that surrounds and protects the virus’ genetic material and essential enzymes. In <i>in vitro</i> studies, lenacapavir interrupts multiple distinct stages of the viral lifecycle, potentially preventing the virus from becoming infectious and gaining access to uninfected cells.

The safety, efficacy and dosing of lenacapavir are being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical studies. Data presented at AIDS 2020 from the ongoing Phase 1 study support subcutaneous every six-month administration of lenacapavir for both HIV treatment and prevention studies. During IDWeek 2020, the company announced it would be evaluating the use of lenacapavir among cisgender women as an injectable PrEP option administered every six months. An additional lenacapavir for PrEP study in men who have sex with men and persons of trans experience is planned. Both studies are expected to begin in 2021.

<b>Zurich-Schlieren, Switzerland, March 15, 2021.</b> Molecular Partners AG (SIX: MOLN), a clinical-stage biotech company that is developing a new class of custom-built protein drugs known as DARPin® therapeutics, and its collaborator Novartis, today announced that ensovibep (formerly MP0420) is expected to be included in a global phase 3 randomized, controlled clinical trial as part of the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) program. The trial, ACTIV-3, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various therapies for the treatment of adults hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Ensovibep is a DARPin® therapeutic candidate designed to bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at three distinct locations to prevent viral entry into cells, and may provide added protection against variant strains.

“The NIH’s ACTIV-3 trial provides a major expansion of ensovibep’s clinical program and data collection, and recognizes the clinical and preclinical evidence we have delivered to-date supporting this candidate as a differentiated approach to COVID-19 treatment,” said Patrick Amstutz, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Molecular Partners. “Emerging variant strains and the challenges of vaccinating a global population create an ongoing need for effective antivirals to save lives. We will work closely with both our collaborator Novartis and the NIH to maximize support on this trial in parallel with the other clinical trials of ensovibep planned to initiate in the second quarter.”

ACTIV-3 is one of multiple ongoing trials in the NIH’s ACTIV program, a public-private partnership designed to speed development of the most promising treatments and vaccine candidates for COVID-19. In order to be selected for ACTIV-3, Molecular Partners provided the NIH with relevant data and in addition provided ensovibep for independent preclinical assessments by the NIH. Molecular Partners has recently submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ensovibep.

Ensovibep is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered ensovibep. Initial data from this study, run by Molecular Partners, indicate that ensovibep is well tolerated with a half-life in the range of 2-3 weeks.

In partnership with Novartis, Molecular Partners expects the initiation of additional clinical studies of ensovibep to initiate throughout the first half of 2021 with the goal of achieving clinical proof-of-concept and potential emergency use authorization within 2021. The intended clinical program includes a smaller Phase 2 trial specifically evaluating the ability of ensovibep to reduce infectivity, as well as a global Phase 2-3 study (EMPATHY), which will seek to enroll more than 2,000 patients in the ambulatory setting to evaluate the ability of ensovibep to prevent disease worsening, hospitalizations and death.
<h4><strong>ACTIV-3 Clinical Trial Design</strong></h4>
Once initiated, the ACTIV-3 trial arm evaluating ensovibep would initially enroll 300 participants who have been hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 with fewer than 13 days of symptoms, who will receive either ensovibep or placebo. Participants will also receive standard of care for COVID-19, including the FDA-approved antiviral remdesivir. Five days after dosing, participants’ clinical status will be assessed, based on need for supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or other supportive care. If the ensovibep treatment arm appears to have a positive benefit:risk profile, the trial will enroll an additional 700 participants. Trial participants will be followed for 90 days following enrollment to analyze their response to treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint is the time from randomization to participants’ sustained recovery for 14 days after release from the hospital.

&nbsp;
<h4>About Molecular Partners’ anti-COVID-19 program</h4>
Molecular Partners’ two antiviral DARPin® candidates, ensovibep and MP0423, are designed to target multiple different sites on the SARS-CoV-2 virus simultaneously for enhanced antiviral effects and potential use as both prophylactics and treatments. The benefits of this multi-specificity include cooperative binding, extremely high potencies and potential prevention of viral ‘escape’ via mutations. The candidates are formatted with a DARPin® domain that binds to human serum albumin (HSA) to support a longer half-life and hence longer activity. All DARPin® candidates are constructed to benefit from high-yield and low-cost microbial manufacturing. Molecular Partners is investigating whether the high thermal stability of DARPin® molecules can be used to overcome cold-chain requirements.

In March 2021, the Company announced positive initial data from its Phase 1 study of ensovibep in healthy volunteers, which showed that ensovibep was safe and well-tolerated with a half-life of 2-3 weeks. In October 2020, Molecular Partners entered into a collaboration with Novartis AG in the form of an option and license agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize Molecular Partners’ anti-COVID-19 DARPin® candidates. Per the terms of the agreement, Molecular Partners will conduct Phase 1 clinical trials for ensovibep and perform all remaining preclinical work for MP0423; Novartis will conduct Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, with Molecular Partners as sponsor of those trials. Upon option exercise, Novartis would be responsible for all further development and commercialization activities. Molecular Partners is also collaborating with AGC Biologics, Baccinex, and Ivers-Lee Clinical Supply Management (IL-CSM) to support development of its anti-COVID-19 program, and has reached an agreement with the Swiss Government regarding rights to purchase up to 3.2 million doses of ensovibep, if it is approved in Switzerland.

&nbsp;
<h4>About Molecular Partners AG</h4>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-49959"" src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Press-Release.png"" alt="""" width=""969"" height=""519"" />Basel, 16 March 2021- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the launch of the cobas<strong>®</strong> SARS-CoV-2 Variant Set 1 Test to detect and differentiate mutations found in variants that originated in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and Brazil (P.1). This research use only laboratory test can be used to help scientists track mutation prevalence and to assess any potential impact on diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, providing crucial insight for healthcare systems in making appropriate measures to combat COVID-19.

Variants of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 lineage gained prominence in late 2020, with each carrying a number of genomic mutations. Among them, mutations E484K, N501Y and del 69-70 are located in the spike protein, the region that enables the virus to attach to and enter the human cell. Studies have suggested that these mutations may be linked to increased disease transmissibility, and possibly decreased therapeutic and vaccine efficacy.<sup>1-4</sup>

“Viruses naturally evolve over time. While most mutations do not have a clinical impact, some variants need to be tracked carefully as they seem to spread more easily and quickly,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Continued surveillance is essential for public health. Our latest solution provides laboratories a fast and efficient way to investigate these variants found in infected individuals and the potential impact on existing therapies, vaccines and tests.”

The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Variant Set 1 Test runs on the widely available, high-volume <strong>cobas®</strong> 6800/8800 Systems. Pre-optimised assay design, ready-to-use test cassettes and predefined software parameters enable laboratories to reduce testing complexity and increase walkaway time.

It is important to note that Roche has confirmed its existing diagnostic tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 are not affected by known mutations and remain accurate and effective in detecting active infections. The company is conducting assessments on a regular basis and will continue to monitor as new variants arise.

<strong>About SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1</strong>
First reported in the UK in December 2020, B.1.1.7 variant has quickly become the dominant circulating variant and has since been found in countries worldwide.<sup>1</sup> B.1.1.7 carries a large number of mutations, eight of which are accumulated in the spike region. Preliminary studies have suggested that two such spike mutations, N501Y and del 69-70, are associated with increased transmissibility of the disease.<sup>2,3</sup> Another variant, B.1.351, which arose independently from B.1.1.7, was reported in South Africa in December 2020. In addition to having mutation N501Y, B.1.351 carries another spike mutation E484K, which appears to evade the body’s immune response, possibly diminishing vaccine efficacy.<sup>4</sup> Variant P.1, a close relative to B.1.351, has several defining mutations including N501Y and E484K in the spike region. P.1 has been circulating in the Amazon region as of late 2020 and is thought to evade immunity generated after infection by other variants.<sup>5</sup>

<strong>About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>
As a leading healthcare company we are doing all we can to support countries in minimising the impact of COVID-19. We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help to detect and diagnose the infection in patients, as well as providing digital support to healthcare systems, and we continue to identify, develop and support potential therapies which can play a role in treating the disease.

We understand the impact of COVID-19 goes beyond those who contract it, which is why we are working with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients continue to receive the tests, treatment and care they need during these challenging times. As we learn from the pandemic, we are partnering with governments and others to make healthcare stronger and more sustainable in the future.

<em>Our diagnostics solutions:</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. Our portfolio includes:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""disc"">
 	<li>a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, (FDA Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) and available in countries accepting the CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-based antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood targeting the nucleocapsid (FDA EUA and CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>an IL-6 test to assist in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 (FDA EUA and CE Mark)</li>
 	<li>Roche v-TAC, which could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic</li>

</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Our research into therapies</em>

Roche is committed to improving the treatment of COVID-19. We are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are exploring the potential of our investigational molecules.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In August we signed a collaboration agreement with Regeneron on developing and manufacturing and significantly increasing global supply of an investigational antibody combination for COVID-19 if it proves safe and effective in clinical trials and regulatory approvals are granted. We are also partnering with Atea to jointly develop AT-527, an orally administered direct-acting antiviral (DAA) currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. If approved, Atea will distribute AT-527 in the United States and Roche will be responsible for global manufacturing and distribution outside the United States.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the beginning of the pandemic, on 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA - a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. On 29 July we announced that COVACTA did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia or the key secondary endpoint of reduced mortality.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Separately, we have studied Actemra©/RoActemra© in the EMPACTA study in COVID-19 associated hospitalised pneumonia in patients that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. On 18 September we announced that the phase III EMPACTA study showed Actemra/RoActemra plus standard of care reduced the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. However, there was no statistical difference in mortality between patients who received Actemra/RoActemra or placebo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Actemra©/RoActemra© is also being studied in combination with the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the REMDACTA trial in partnership with Gilead, announced 28 May. Actemra©/RoActemra© is not approved by any health authority for use in COVID-19 pneumonia. Roche has further initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is engaged in multiple research collaborations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced new exploratory 2-year longer-term data from Part 2 of SUNFISH, a global placebo-controlled study evaluating Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) in people aged 2-25 years with Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The study suggests that gains in motor function observed with Evrysdi treatment at month 12 continued to improve or were maintained at month 24 across primary and secondary endpoint measures. Based on the natural history of the disease, people with Types 2 and 3 SMA who remain untreated decline in motor function over time. These data will be presented at the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Virtual Clinical &amp; Scientific Conference taking place from March 15-18.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“These results build on the one-year findings from the SUNFISH trial and importantly show the durability of improvement or stabilization of motor function through two years of treatment,” said SUNFISH principal investigator Eugenio Mercuri, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Pediatric Neurology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. “In addition, with no new safety signals identified, these second year results may support the favorable benefit-risk profile of Evrysdi over a longer period of time.”

Patients in SUNFISH Part 2 ranged in age from 2-25 and were treated with Evrysdi (n=120) or placebo and Evrysdi (n=60; patients in the placebo arm received placebo for 12 months followed by Evrysdi treatment for 12 months). The study evaluated a number of exploratory 24-month endpoints, which provide important insights into motor function and its impact on daily life. Findings demonstrated that Evrysdi:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Maintained motor function improvements between months 12 and 24 as measured by Motor Function Measure (MFM-32).*</li>
 	<li>Increased motor function as measured by Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM)** and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE)*** between months 12 and 24.</li>
 	<li>Stabilized motor function for patients who began treatment with Evrysdi after 12 months of placebo as measured by MFM-32, RULM and HFMSE.</li>
 	<li>Increased total score change from baseline, as measured by the caregiver-reported SMAIS**** upper limb module, and the patient-reported SMAIS score stabilized between months 12 and 24.</li>
</ul>
“These encouraging results confirm that the efficacy and safety of Evrysdi in people with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA can be sustained over time,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Therefore, these findings further highlight the potential longer-term benefit this first-of-its-kind medicine can have for people of varying ages and levels of SMA disease severity.”

Decreases in serious adverse events, high-grade adverse events and treatment-related adverse events were observed in the second year versus the first year in both treatment arms. The most common adverse events observed in the Evrysdi arm and the placebo and Evrysdi arm from 12-24 months were upper respiratory tract infection (15.8% and 10%, respectively), nasopharyngitis (21.7% and 16.7%, respectively), pyrexia (13.3% and 10%, respectively), headache (10% and 16.7%, respectively), diarrhea (7.5% and 10%, respectively), vomiting (11.7% and 13.3%, respectively) and cough (10% and 8.3%, respectively). The most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (6.7% and 0%, respectively) and influenza (0.8% and 0%, respectively).

Genentech leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.

<i>* MFM is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. It assesses 32 different motor functions from standing and walking through to use of hands and fingers.
** RULM is a scale designed to assess upper limb movement in people with SMA. It can capture progressive muscle weakness across the spectrum of the disease, reflective of the SUNFISH Part 2 study population.
*** HFMSE is intended to be used in assessing the functional motor abilities of people with SMA who are able to sit and walk.
**** SMAIS was developed to measure self-reported and caregiver-reported independence.</i>

<b>About Evrysdi™ (risdiplam)</b>

Evrysdi is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA by increasing and sustaining production of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA in adults and children 2 months of age and older in August of 2020. Evrysdi was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by FDA and EMA in 2017 and 2019, respectively. At this time, Evrysdi has been approved in seven countries and submitted in 57, including the EU 27 and Norway and Iceland.

Evrysdi is currently being evaluated in four multicenter trials in people with SMA:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants with the primary objective of assessing the safety profile of Evrysdi in infants and determining the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of Evrysdi in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 2 years, followed by an open-label extension. Enrollment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two-part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. The study has completed recruitment (n=174).</li>
 	<li>RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Evrysdi in babies (~n=25), from birth to 6 weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.</li>
</ul>
<b>About SMA</b>

SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement. Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

<b>What is Evrysdi?</b>

Evrysdi is a prescription medicine used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children 2 months of age and older.

It is not known if Evrysdi is safe and effective in children under 2 months of age.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted and granted priority review for a New Drug Application (NDA) for the hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2a) inhibitor belzutifan (pronounced bell-ZOO-ti-fan), a novel investigational candidate in Merck’s oncology pipeline, for the potential treatment of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), not requiring immediate surgery. This NDA is based on data from the Phase 2 Study-004 trial, in which belzutifan showed a confirmed overall response rate of 36.1% (n=22/61) (95% CI: 24.2-49.4) in patients with VHL disease-associated RCC. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of September 15, 2021.

“Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare genetic condition for which there is no systemic treatment option available and is associated with a high risk of cancer development in multiple organs. In fact, up to 70% of patients with VHL develop renal cell carcinoma during their lifetime,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “This priority review validates the important progress we have made to expand and diversify Merck’s oncology pipeline with innovative, new therapeutic approaches. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to bring belzutifan to patients in need.”

Merck is also studying belzutifan in advanced RCC and other tumor types through a broad clinical program. In addition to the ongoing Phase 2 Study-004 trial<strong>, </strong>belzutifan is being evaluated in Phase 3 trials as monotherapy and as part of a combination regimen in previously treated patients and as part of a combination regimen as a first-line treatment for advanced clear cell RCC.

<strong>About the Phase 2 Study-004 Trial</strong>

<strong>This application is based on data from Study-004 (ClinicalTrials.gov, </strong>NCT03401788 <strong>), which is a Phase 2, open-label trial evaluating belzutifan for the potential treatment of patients with VHL disease who had at least one measurable solid tumor localized to the kidney and who did not require immediate surgery. The study enrolled 61 patients who received belzutifan 120 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate in VHL disease-associated RCC. Secondary endpoints in RCC tumors include disease control rate, duration of response, time to response, progression-free survival, time to surgery and safety.</strong>

<strong>Additionally, this study evaluated response rates in other common VHL disease-associated tumors, including pancreatic cysts, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, and retinal hemangioblastomas.</strong>

<b>About Belzutifan</b>

Belzutifan (MK-6482) is a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of HIF-2a. Proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors, including HIF-2a, can accumulate in patients when VHL, a tumor-suppressor protein, is inactivated. If not properly regulated, the accumulation of HIF-2a can stimulate several oncogenes associated with cellular proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor growth, leading to the growth of both benign and malignant tumors. This inactivation of VHL has been observed in more than 90% of clear cell RCC tumors. Research into VHL biology that led to the discovery of HIF-2a was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2019.

<strong>About Von Hippel-Lindau Disease and Renal Cell Carcinoma</strong>

Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare genetic disease that affects one in 36,000 people (200,000 cases worldwide and 10,000 cases in the U.S. alone). Patients with VHL disease are at risk for benign blood vessel tumors as well as several cancers, including RCC. As many as 70% of people with VHL disease develop RCC.

Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs, and about seven of 10 RCCs are clear cell. Worldwide, it is estimated there were nearly 431,300 cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and almost 179,400 deaths from the disease in 2020. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated there will be almost 76,100 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and nearly 13,800 deaths from the disease in 2021.

<strong>Merck’s Focus on Cancer</strong>

Our goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck, the potential to bring new hope to people with cancer drives our purpose and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment. As part of our focus on cancer, Merck is committed to exploring the potential of immuno-oncology with one of the largest development programs in the industry across more than 30 tumor types. We also continue to strengthen our portfolio through strategic acquisitions and are prioritizing the development of several promising oncology candidates with the potential to improve the treatment of advanced cancers.

NEW YORK, Feb. 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TG Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TGTX), today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved UKONIQ™ (umbralisib), for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 based regimen and adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy.

UKONIQ is the first and only, oral, once daily, inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) delta and casein kinase 1 (CK1) epsilon. Accelerated approval was granted for these indications based on overall response rate (ORR) data from the Phase 2 UNITY-NHL Trial (NCT02793583). Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. This application was granted priority review for the MZL indication. In addition, UKONIQ was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for the treatment of MZL and orphan drug designation (ODD) for the treatment of MZL and FL.

Michael S. Weiss, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TG Therapeutics stated, “Today’s approval of UKONIQ marks a historic day for our Company with this being our first approval and we are extremely pleased to be able to bring our novel inhibitor of PI3K-delta and CK1-epsilon to patients with relapsed/refractory MZL and FL. We have built a commercial team with significant experience who will immediately start to engage our customers to educate them on UKONIQ and how to access the product for patients in need and expect to make UKONIQ available to US distributors in the next few days.” Mr. Weiss continued, “We want to thank the patients, physicians, nurses and clinical coordinators for their support and participation in our clinical trials, and the FDA for their collaboration throughout this process. We remain dedicated to patients with B-cell diseases and our mission of developing treatment options for those in need.”

“Despite treatment advances, MZL and FL remain incurable diseases with limited treatment options for patients who relapse after prior therapy and no defined standard of care. With the approval of umbralisib we now have a targeted, oral, once-daily option, offering a needed treatment alternative for patients,” stated Dr. Nathan Fowler, Professor of Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Study Chair of the UNITY-NHL MZL &amp;FL cohorts.

“The approval of umbralisib for the treatment of relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma offers patients a new treatment option, and new hope in the fight against these diseases,” stated Meghan Gutierrez, Chief Executive Officer of the Lymphoma Research Foundation.

<strong>EFFICACY &amp; SAFETY DATA IN RELAPSED/REFRACTORY MZL AND FL</strong>
The efficacy of UKONIQ monotherapy was evaluated in two single-arm cohorts, within the Phase 2 UNITY-NHL clinical trial, in 69 patients with MZL who received at least 1 prior therapy, including an anti-CD20 regimen, and in 117 patients with FL who received at least 2 prior systemic therapies, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an alkylating agent. The UNITY-NHL Phase 2 trial is an open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort study with patients receiving UKONIQ 800 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC) assessed overall response rate (ORR) according to the Revised International Working Group Criteria.

The safety of UKONIQ monotherapy was based on a pooled population from the 221 adults with MZL and FL in three single arm, open label trials and one open label extension trial. Patients received UKONIQ 800 mg orally once daily. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% of patients who received UKONIQ. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in =2% of patients were diarrhea-colitis (4%), pneumonia (3%), sepsis (2%), and urinary tract infection (2%). The most common adverse reactions (&gt;15%), including laboratory abnormalities, were increased creatinine (79%), diarrhea-colitis (58%, 2%), fatigue (41%), nausea (38%), neutropenia (33%), ALT increase (33%), AST increase (32%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), anemia (27%), thrombocytopenia (26%), upper respiratory tract infection (21%), vomiting (21%), abdominal pain (19%), decreased appetite (19%), and rash (18%).

<strong>ABOUT UKONIQ™</strong> <strong>(umbralisib) 200 MG TABLETS</strong>
UKONIQ is the first and only oral inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) delta and casein kinase 1 (CK1) epsilon. PI3K-delta is known to play an important role in supporting cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intercellular trafficking and immunity and is expressed in both normal and malignant B-cells. CK1-epsilon is a regulator of oncoprotein translation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer cells, including lymphoid malignancies.

UKONIQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based regimen and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy.

These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
<strong>Infections:</strong> Serious, including fatal, infections occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 10% of 335 patients, with fatal infections occurring in &lt;1%. The most frequent Grade =3 infections included pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infection. Provide prophylaxis for <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii </em>pneumonia (PJP) and consider prophylactic antivirals during treatment with UKONIQ to prevent CMV infection, including CMV reactivation. Monitor for any new or worsening signs and symptoms of infection, including suspected PJP or CMV, during treatment with UKONIQ. For Grade 3 or 4 infection, withhold UKONIQ until infection has resolved. Resume UKONIQ at the same or a reduced dose. Withhold UKONIQ in patients with suspected PJP of any grade and permanently discontinue in patients with confirmed PJP. For clinical CMV infection or viremia, withhold UKONIQ until infection or viremia resolves. If UKONIQ is resumed, administer the same or reduced dose and monitor patients for CMV reactivation by PCR or antigen test at least monthly.

<strong>Neutropenia:</strong> Serious neutropenia occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Grade 3 neutropenia developed in 9% of 335 patients and Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 9%. Monitor neutrophil counts at least every 2 weeks for the first 2 months of UKONIQ and at least weekly in patients with neutrophil count &lt;1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L (Grade 3-4) neutropenia during treatment with UKONIQ. Consider supportive care as appropriate. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue UKONIQ depending on the severity and persistence of neutropenia.

<strong>Diarrhea or Non-Infectious Colitis:</strong> Serious diarrhea or non-infectious colitis occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Any grade diarrhea or colitis occurred in 53% of 335 patients and Grade 3 occurred in 9%. For patients with severe diarrhea (Grade 3, i.e., &gt; 6 stools per day over baseline) or abdominal pain, stool with mucus or blood, change in bowel habits, or peritoneal signs, withhold UKONIQ until resolved and provide supportive care with antidiarrheals or enteric acting steroids as appropriate. Upon resolution, resume UKONIQ at a reduced dose. For recurrent Grade 3 diarrhea or recurrent colitis of any grade, discontinue UKONIQ. Discontinue UKONIQ for life-threatening diarrhea or colitis.

<strong>Hepatotoxicity: </strong>Serious hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevations (ALT and/or AST) occurred in 8% and &lt;1%, respectively, in 335 patients. Monitor hepatic function at baseline and during treatment with UKONIQ. For ALT/AST greater than 5 to less than 20 times ULN, withhold UKONIQ until return to less than 3 times ULN, then resume at a reduced dose. For ALT/AST elevation greater than 20 times ULN, discontinue UKONIQ.

<strong>Severe Cutaneous Reactions:</strong> Severe cutaneous reactions, including a fatal case of exfoliative dermatitis, occurred in patients treated with UKONIQ. Grade 3 cutaneous reactions occurred in 2% of 335 patients and included exfoliative dermatitis, erythema, and rash (primarily maculo-papular). Monitor patients for new or worsening cutaneous reactions. Review all concomitant medications and discontinue any potentially contributing medications. Withhold UKONIQ for severe (Grade 3) cutaneous reactions until resolution. Monitor at least weekly until resolved. Upon resolution, resume UKONIQ at a reduced dose. Discontinue UKONIQ if severe cutaneous reaction does not improve, worsens, or recurs. Discontinue UKONIQ for life-threatening cutaneous reactions or SJS, TEN, or DRESS of any grade. Provide supportive care as appropriate.

<strong>Allergic Reactions Due to Inactive Ingredient FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5:</strong> UKONIQ contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine), which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons, frequently in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.

<strong>Embryo-fetal Toxicity:</strong> Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, UKONIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.

<strong>Serious adverse reactions occurred</strong> in 18% of 221 patients who received UKONIQ. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in =2% of patients were diarrhea-colitis (4%), pneumonia (3%), sepsis (2%), and urinary tract infection (2%). Permanent discontinuation of UKONIQ due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients. Dose reductions of UKONIQ due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients. Dosage interruptions of UKONIQ due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients.

<strong>The most common</strong> <strong>adverse reactions</strong> (&gt;15%), including laboratory abnormalities, in 221 patients who received UKONIQ were increased creatinine (79%), diarrhea-colitis (58%, 2%), fatigue (41%), nausea (38%), neutropenia (33%), ALT increase (33%), AST increase (32%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), anemia (27%), thrombocytopenia (26%), upper respiratory tract infection (21%), vomiting (21%), abdominal pain (19%), decreased appetite (19%), and rash (18%).

<strong>Lactation:</strong> Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from umbralisib in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with UKONIQ and for at least one month after the last dose.

<strong>ABOUT MARGINAL ZONE LYMPHOMA</strong>
Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) comprises a group of indolent (slow growing) mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). MZL is generally considered a chronic and incurable disease. With an annual incidence of approximately 8,200 newly diagnosed patients in the United States<sup>1,2</sup>, MZL is the third most common B-cell NHL, accounting for approximately ten percent of all NHL cases. MZL consists of three different subtypes: extranodal MZL of the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL)<sup>3</sup>.

<strong>ABOUT FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA</strong>
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is typically an indolent form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that arises from B-lymphocytes. It is the second most common form of NHL. FL is generally not curable and is considered a chronic disease, as patients can live for many years with this form of lymphoma. With an annual incidence in the United States of approximately 13,200 newly diagnosed patients<sup>1,2</sup>, FL is the most common indolent lymphoma accounting for approximately 17 percent of all NHL cases<sup>4</sup>.

<span class=""xn-location"">WALTHAM, Mass.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 1, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Oncopeptides AB (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: ONCO),  a global biotech company focused on the development of therapies for difficult-to-treat hematological diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PEPAXTO® (melphalan flufenamide), known during clinical development as melflufen, in combination with dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one CD38-directed monoclonal antibody. This indication has been granted under accelerated approval based upon the HORIZON trial. PEPAXTO is the first anticancer peptide-drug conjugate approved in multiple myeloma.

""While the treatment landscape for multiple myeloma has dramatically improved in recent years, once patients become resistant to existing classes of therapy they can face a very guarded prognosis,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Paul G. Richardson</span>, MD, Clinical Program Leader and Director of Clinical Research at the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""Research has shown melphalan flufenamide to be a novel and innovative therapeutic option, which is active in refractory disease and has manageable toxicity, with the convenience of being administered by infusion once a month. Based on our findings, melphalan flufenamide is an important addition to the treatment armamentarium, with the potential to meaningfully improve outcomes in an area of important unmet medical need.""

The HORIZON study, evaluating intravenous PEPAXTO in combination with dexamethasone, included heavily pre-treated patients with a poor prognosis. This multi-center single arm study evaluated 157 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, of whom 97 were triple-class refractory and had received at least four prior lines of treatment. The Overall Response Rate for the patients within this group of patients with refractory multiple myeloma was 23.7 percent and the Median Duration of Response was 4.2 months. Of the subset of 97 patients, 41% had EMD (n=40), an aggressive and resistant disease associated with poor prognosis.

""We are proud to bring forward the first anticancer peptide-drug conjugate approved by the FDA for multiple myeloma,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jakob Lindberg</span>, Chief Scientific Officer at Oncopeptides. ""PEPAXTO uses innovative technology that links a peptide carrier to a cytotoxic agent. The conjugated agent is a highly lipophilic compound, which allows it to be rapidly distributed into cells. The compound then leverages amino peptidases that are overexpressed in Multiple Myeloma cells, causing the release of the cytotoxic payload.""

<span class=""xn-person"">Marty Duvall</span>, Chief Executive Officer at Oncopeptides added, ""The accelerated U.S. approval of PEPAXTO is a key step forward in fulfilling Oncopeptides' core mission, to bring hope to patients in their battle against difficult-to-treat hematological diseases. Moving ahead, our focus is to further advance PEPAXTO.  We look forward to receiving top line data from the phase 3 OCEAN study in the second quarter.  This comparative study is designed to support a future supplementary New Drug Application to expand the label.""

PEPAXTO was approved under accelerated approval, which allows for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

Oncopeptides expects PEPAXTO to become commercially available in the U.S. within approximately two weeks.

<b>About the HORIZON Study</b>

In total, 157 multiple myeloma patients have been enrolled in the pivotal phase 2 HORIZON study, evaluating intravenous PEPAXTO in combination with dexamethasone. The approval was based on a subgroup of HORIZON patients (n=97) who had received at least four prior lines of therapy and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one CD38-directed monoclonal antibody. In this subset of Triple Class Refractory patients, the Overall Response Rate (ORR) was 23.7 percent and Median Duration of Response (DOR) was 4.2 months.

The most common adverse reactions (=20%; Grade 1-4) were fatigue (55%), nausea (32%), diarrhea (27%), pyrexia (24%), and respiratory tract infection (24%).  The most common laboratory abnormalities (Grade 1-4) were leukocytes decrease (99%), platelets decrease (99%), lymphocytes decrease (97%), neutrophils decrease (95%), hemoglobin decrease (84%), and creatinine increase (68%).

<b>About Multiple Myeloma</b>

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell which produces antibodies to help fight infection. Multiple myeloma causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow. Approximately 7 per 100,000 Americans per year are diagnosed with multiple myeloma, making it a rare disease. A growing subset of this population is becoming triple-class refractory (TCR). The number of patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma is growing and the number of cases diagnosed annually is expected to almost double in 20 years. The average age for diagnosis is 70 years of age, and there is currently no cure.

<b>About PEPAXTO®</b>

PEPAXTO® (melphalan flufenamide) is the first anticancer peptide-drug conjugate for patients with triple-class refractory Multiple Myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy. PEPAXTO uses innovative technology that links a peptide carrier to a cytotoxic agent, resulting in a lipophilic compound. Due to its lipophilicity, PEPAXTO is distributed into cells.  PEPAXTO is designed to leverage aminopeptidases, which are overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells and cause the release of the cytotoxic agents. PEPAXTO is administered as a once monthly thirty-minute infusion.

<b>INDICATION</b>

PEPAXTO is indicated in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one CD38-directed monoclonal antibody. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

<b><u>Limitation of Use</u></b>

PEPAXTO is not indicated and is not recommended for use as a conditioning regimen for transplant outside of controlled clinical trials.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

PEPAXTO is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reaction to melphalan flufenamide or melphalan.

PEPAXTO may cause thrombocytopenia, which may lead to hemorrhage. Monitor platelets at baseline, during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitor more frequently during the first 2 months of treatment with PEPAXTO. Do not administer PEPAXTO if the platelet count is less than 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Withhold PEPAXTO until platelet count is 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L or greater and resume at same or reduced dose based on duration of interruption. Adjust dose and/or dose schedule based on signs and symptoms of bleeding.

PEPAXTO may cause neutropenia, which may lead to infection. Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline, during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitor more frequently during the first 2 months of treatment with PEPAXTO. Do not administer PEPAXTO if absolute neutrophil count is less than 1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Withhold PEPAXTO until absolute neutrophil count is 1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L or greater and resume at same or reduced dose based on duration of interruption. Consider leukocyte growth factor as clinically appropriate.

PEPAXTO may cause anemia. Monitor red blood cell counts at baseline, during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitor more frequently during the first 2 months of treatment with PEPAXTO. Treat anemia as clinically indicated. Dosage modification and dose delay of PEPAXTO may be required to allow for recovery of red blood cells.

Patients taking PEPAXTO experienced infections, including fatal infections. Consider antimicrobials as clinically appropriate.

Nonclinical safety studies with melphalan flufenamide at dosages exceeding the recommended dose for PEPAXTO were associated with mortality. The safety and efficacy of PEPAXTO has not been established for use as a conditioning regimen in patients receiving transplant.

Secondary malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes or acute leukemia have been reported in patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with PEPAXTO. Monitor patients long term for the development of secondary malignancies.

Based on its mechanism of action, PEPAXTO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PEPAXTO and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PEPAXTO and for 3 months after the last dose.

The most common adverse reactions (=20%; Grade 1-4) were fatigue (55%), nausea (32%), diarrhea (27%), pyrexia (24%), and respiratory tract infection (24%).

<b>Special Considerations</b>

<b>Use in Pregnancy</b>

Based on the mechanism of action, PEPAXTO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on PEPAXTO use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk. PEPAXTO is a genotoxic drug. Advise a woman of childbearing potential of the potential risks to the fetus.

<b>Lactation</b>

There is no information regarding the presence of melphalan flufenamide or its metabolites in human breast milk, or the effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with PEPAXTO and for 1 week after the last dose.

<b>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</b>

PEPAXTO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PEPAXTO and for 6 months after the last dose.

PEPAXTO may damage the developing male germ cells, resulting in possible genetic fetal abnormalities. Advise males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PEPAXTO and for 3 months after the last dose.

PEPAXTO can cause amenorrhea in premenopausal women and result in infertility. Based on findings of melphalan flufenamide in animals, PEPAXTO may impair male fertility. Alkylating drugs, such as PEPAXTO, can also cause irreversible testicular suppression in patients.

QUEBEC CITY &amp; LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medicago, a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Quebec City, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) are pleased to announce the start of Phase 3 clinical testing of Medicago’s plant-derived COVID-19 vaccine candidate in combination with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant, as part of the ongoing Phase 2/3 study. Medicago received approval from Canadian and US regulatory authorities to proceed with enrollment of healthy adults in the Phase 3 portion of the trial based on positive interim Phase 2 results. In parallel, Medicago has also initiated a feasibility study of a vaccine candidate to address the emerging COVID-19 variants.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“We are pleased to take the significant step of initiating the Phase 3 clinical trial at sites around the world,” said Takashi Nagao, CEO and President of Medicago. “This brings us one step closer to delivering an important new COVID-19 vaccine and contributing to the global fight against the pandemic along with our partner GSK.”

Thomas Breuer, Chief Medical Officer, GSK Vaccines said, “This advance to late stage clinical testing further reinforces our confidence in the adjuvanted vaccine candidate’s potential to make a difference in the continued fight against COVID-19. We look forward to sharing results later this year.”

Medicago’s plant-derived vaccine candidate against COVID-19 uses Coronavirus-Like-Particle (CoVLP) technology with the vaccine composed of recombinant spike (S) glycoprotein expressed as virus-like-particles (VLPs) co-administered with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant. Two doses of 3.75 micrograms of CoVLP are administered 21 days apart.

The vaccine candidate, in combination with the pandemic adjuvant, was granted Fast Track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 17, 2021. Fast Track designation allows the FDA to expedite the development and review of new medicines and vaccines intended to treat or prevent serious conditions and address an unmet medical need.

“The FDA’s decision to grant Fast Track designation for Medicago’s vaccine candidate will help us expedite our efforts to bring the first plant-derived COVID-19 vaccine to market, subject to regulatory approval,” said Carolyn Finkle, Chief Operating Officer of Medicago. “We are grateful to the FDA and look forward to continuing to work with them as we move forward in our clinical trials, planned application for Emergency Use Authorization, and eventual vaccine licensure application process.”

The Phase 3 portion of the study is an event-driven, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over design that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the adjuvanted CoVLP formulation, compared to placebo. The study will enroll up to 30,000 subjects initially composed of healthy adults (18y to 65y), followed by elderly adults (65y+) and adults with comorbidities. The trial will take place in 10 countries pending regulatory approvals, starting with Canada and the United States, and will enroll males and females from ethnically and racially diverse populations.

Information about how to participate in this clinical trial is available at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.CoVLPvaccine.com&amp;esheet=52396533&amp;newsitemid=20210316005332&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.CoVLPvaccine.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=70196ef1c0929823628ae1d8690a2390"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.CoVLPvaccine.com</a>.

The Phase 2 portion of the trial is approaching completion and results are expected to be made publicly available in April 2021.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, March 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today that mirikizumab met the primary and all key secondary endpoints in LUCENT-1, a 12-week Phase 3 induction study evaluating the efficacy and safety of mirikizumab for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). LUCENT-2, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance study of mirikizumab in patients who have completed the 12-week LUCENT-1 induction study is ongoing.

UC is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine, also referred to as the colon, that affects the lining of the colon and may cause small sores, or ulcers, to form.i This inflammation can cause abdominal pain, frequent and urgent trips to the bathroom, bloody stools and incontinence.1 UC can cause significant and debilitating disruptions in daily life. Millions of people live with UC globally.2

“There is a continued need for additional treatments that can provide people living with ulcerative colitis relief from their most challenging symptoms,” said William J. Sandborn, MD, Professor of Medicine, and Chief, Division of Gastroenterology, University of California San Diego. “Results of this study provide further clinical evidence of the potential for mirikizumab to become the first anti-IL-23p19 biologic for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.”

In LUCENT-1, mirikizumab met the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 12 compared to placebo (p<0.0001). Clinical remission is met when inflammation of the colon is controlled or resolved, leading to normalization or near-normalization of symptoms such as stool frequency and bleeding.

Mirikizumab also achieved all key secondary endpoints compared to placebo at Week 12 in patients with UC with highly statistically significant p-values, including reduced bowel urgency, clinical response, endoscopic remission, symptomatic remission and improvement in endoscopic histologic inflammation. In addition, mirikizumab demonstrated rapid improvement in patient symptoms as early as four weeks after initiating treatment. Mirikizumab also reduced symptoms among patients who had previously not responded to or stopped responding to biologic and/or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapies.

In the 12-week placebo-controlled induction study of LUCENT-1, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs among patients treated with mirikizumab was consistent with that of the previous Phase 2 mirikizumab study in UC and studies with the anti-IL-23p19 antibody class. The most common AEs included nasopharyngitis, anemia and headache for both placebo and mirikizumab-treated patients.

“People living with UC often struggle to effectively manage recurring flare ups of the disease,” said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. “With these positive results, we look forward to the continuation of the maintenance study through 52 weeks in hopes of providing a new option to people living with UC.”

The full LUCENT study results, including data from LUCENT-2 and LUCENT-3, will be disclosed at a future congress or publication.

“Ulcerative colitis can be debilitating and unpredictable for the hundreds of thousands of people living with this chronic disease,” said Dr. Caren Heller, Chief Scientific Officer for the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. “We’re encouraged by these promising results for a potential new treatment that may help provide symptom relief and remission.”

About Mirikizumab
Mirikizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23. Mirikizumab is being studied for the treatment of immune diseases, including psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

About the LUCENT Clinical Trial Program
The LUCENT Phase 3 clinical development program for mirikizumab includes LUCENT-1, LUCENT-2 and LUCENT-3. LUCENT-1 (NCT03518086) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 induction study of mirikizumab in patients with moderate to severe UC who had failed conventional and/or biologic treatments. LUCENT-2 (NCT03524092) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance study of mirikizumab in patients who have completed the 12-week LUCENT-1 induction study. LUCENT-3 (NCT03519945) is an open label extension study for eligible patients who have participated in mirikizumab UC trials.

The program began in 2018, with full results from the induction and maintenance studies anticipated in early 2022.

About Ulcerative Colitis
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon.1 UC occurs when the immune system sends white blood cells into the lining of the intestines, where they produce chronic inflammation and ulcerations.3 There is an unmet need for additional treatment options for UC that provide meaningful symptom relief, including bowel urgency, and deliver sustained clinical remission.

<strong>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- </strong>Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. (GBT) (NASDAQ: GBT) today announced it has entered into an agreement with Sanofi S.A. to exclusively in-license worldwide rights to two early-stage research programs in sickle cell disease (SCD): one that pursues a novel anti-sickling mechanism and another that leverages a new approach to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. These mechanisms are distinct and potentially complementary to that of Oxbryta<sup>®</sup> (voxelotor) tablets, a novel hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor approved in the United States for the treatment of SCD in patients ages 12 years and older. The programs, from Sanofi’s Bioverativ subsidiary, supplement GBT’s existing pipeline and support the company’s strategy to address SCD from multiple approaches.

“We envision a future in which sickle cell disease is a well-managed condition with the potential for a functional cure in the form of patient-friendly oral therapies. As we work toward this vision and our goal to transform the treatment and care of people living with this devastating disease, we are advancing our robust internal research programs with disease-modifying potential while continually exploring partnership opportunities across a variety of mechanisms,” said Jung E. Choi, chief business and strategy officer of GBT. “These novel discovery programs represent promising approaches that we believe may have the potential to lead to meaningful improvements for patients.”

Under the terms of the agreement, GBT will conduct all research, development, regulatory and commercialization activities worldwide. Sanofi will receive an upfront payment and is entitled to payments up to approximately $353 million upon achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones and single-digit tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.

<strong>About Sickle Cell Disease</strong>
Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects an estimated 100,000 people in the United States,<sup>1</sup> an estimated 52,000 people in Europe,<sup>2</sup> and millions of people throughout the world, particularly among those whose ancestors are from sub-Saharan Africa.<sup>1</sup> It also affects people of Hispanic, South Asian, Southern European and Middle Eastern ancestry.<sup>1</sup> SCD is a lifelong inherited rare blood disorder that impacts hemoglobin, a protein carried by red blood cells that delivers oxygen to tissues and organs throughout the body.<sup>3</sup> Due to a genetic mutation, individuals with SCD form abnormal hemoglobin known as sickle hemoglobin. Through a process called hemoglobin polymerization, red blood cells become sickled – deoxygenated, crescent-shaped and rigid.<sup>3-5</sup> The sickling process causes hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin due to red blood cell destruction) and blockages in capillaries and small blood vessels, which impede the flow of blood and oxygen throughout the body. The diminished oxygen delivery to tissues and organs can lead to life-threatening complications, including stroke and irreversible organ damage.<sup>4-7</sup>

<p align=""left"">SAN FRANCISCO, March 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FibroGen, Inc. (NASDAQ: FGEN) announced the initiation of LELANTOS-2, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pamrevlumab or placebo in combination with systemic corticosteroids in patients with ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).</p>
The primary objective of this global study is to evaluate the effect of pamrevlumab on muscle function in patients with DMD. Approximately 70 patients ages 6 to 12 years will be randomized 1:1 to receive pamrevlumab plus systemic corticosteroids, or placebo plus systemic corticosteroids every two weeks, for up to 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is ambulatory function assessment, measured by the change in North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) from baseline to Week 52. Additional secondary endpoints will be assessed in the study. Subjects who complete the 52-week study will be eligible for rollover into an open-label extension study with pamrevlumab and systemic corticosteroids. For more information about LELANTOS-2 please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04632940).

“Duchenne, the most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, is typically diagnosed by 2-6 years of age and progresses rapidly, resulting in the loss of independent motor function by the early teenage years,” said Elias Kouchakji, M.D., Senior Vice President, Clinical Development, Drug Safety, and Pharmacovigilance, FibroGen. “The initiation of LELANTOS-2, the second Phase 3 clinical trial in the pamrevlumab clinical development program, underscores our commitment to delivering a meaningful treatment for DMD, an area with high unmet medical need.”

Pamrevlumab is a first-in-class antibody developed by FibroGen to inhibit the activity of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a common factor in fibrotic and proliferative disorders characterized by persistent and excessive scarring that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Importantly, skeletal muscle from DMD patients shows elevated levels of CTGF, and a major manifestation of DMD is cardiac fibrosis.

“The initiation of our second Phase 3 study of pamrevlumab for DMD furthers our research on the clinical benefits of inhibiting connective tissue growth factor, an important biological mediator in fibrotic and proliferative disorders,” said Mark Eisner, M.D, M.P.H, Chief Medical Officer, FibroGen. “We are committed to advancing the science of CTGF biology and evaluating clinical benefit in diverse diseases with unmet medical need, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.”

<strong>About Pamrevlumab</strong>
Pamrevlumab is a first-in-class antibody developed by FibroGen that inhibits the activity of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a common factor in fibrotic and proliferative disorders. Pamrevlumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). For information about pamrevlumab studies currently recruiting patients, please visit <a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>.

<strong>About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</strong>
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare and debilitating neuromuscular disease that affects approximately 1 in every 5,000 newborn boys. The fatal disease is caused by a genetic mutation leading to the absence or defect of dystrophin, a protein necessary for normal muscle function. The absence of dystrophin results in muscle weakness, muscle loss, fibrosis, and inflammation. Patients with DMD are often wheelchair-bound before the age of 12, and their progressive muscle weakness may lead to serious medical problems relating to respiratory and cardiac muscle.

<strong>About FibroGen</strong>
FibroGen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing, and commercializing a pipeline of first-in-class therapeutics. The Company applies its pioneering expertise in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) biology to advance innovative medicines for the treatment of unmet needs.

<b>SPRING HOUSE, PENNSYLVANIA, March 16, 2021</b> – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced long-term data from the Phase 3 DISCOVER-2a study showing that the skin clearance, joint symptom relief, and safety of TREMFYA® (guselkumab) previously demonstrated through 24 weeks and one year (Week 52) in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) continued through two years (Week 112).<sup>1,2</sup> These findings also confirmed that the robust efficacy TREMFYA demonstrated in patients at Week 24 on physical function, physical aspects of health-related quality of life, and resolution of enthesitisb and dactylitisc was also seen through Week 100.<sup>1-8</sup> In addition, the extent of radiographic progression<sup>d</sup> was studied through two years. These data will be presented virtually in abstract, poster, and video form during the Innovations in Dermatology: Virtual Spring Conference, March 16–20, 2021.<sup>1,2 </sup>TREMFYA is the first and only IL-23 inhibitor therapy approved in the U.S. to treat both adults with active PsA and adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO).<sup>9</sup>

“PsA can be a chronically painful and debilitating disease, and many PsA patients are still searching for enduring relief of their symptoms,” said Philip J. Mease,e M.D., of the Swedish Medical Center/Providence St. Joseph Health and the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington and presenting author. “These data, which show that the observed benefits of TREMFYA in PsA continue through two years, represent positive news for physicians and patients alike.”

Results showed that at Week 100:<sup>1,2</sup>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Complete Skin Clearance:<sup>2</sup></b> In patients who had clinically meaningful skin involvement<sup>f</sup> at baseline, 59 percent of those receiving TREMFYA every four weeks (q4w)<sup>g </sup>and 53 percent of those receiving TREMFYA every eight weeks (q8w) achieved complete skin clearance (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] 100;<sup>h</sup> utilizing non-responder imputation [NRI], with this method of analysis, subjects with missing data are assumed to be non-responders).</li>
 	<li><b>Joint Symptom Improvement:<sup>2</sup></b> Among randomized patients, 76 percent of those receiving TREMFYA q4w and 74 percent of those receiving TREMFYA q8w achieved at least 20 percent improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR 20) response criteriai (utilizing NRI).<sup>j</sup></li>
 	<li><b>Radiographic Progression</b>: At Week 24, TREMFYA q4w demonstrated statistically significant inhibition of radiographic progression of joint structural damage (p=0.011) (as measured by PsA-modified van der Heijde-Sharp [vdH-S scores]).<sup>k</sup> TREMFYA q8w afforded numerically, but not statistically significant, less radiographic progression (p=0.072) compared with placebo.<sup>3,4</sup> From Week 52-100, low rates of radiographic progression of joint damage were observed in patients receiving TREMFYA q4w (0.75) and TREMFYA q8w (0.46), which were both further numerically reduced from the results observed during Weeks 0-52 (1.06, q4w; 0.99, q8w)<sup>.1,2</sup> In the group of patients who crossed over from placebo to TREMFYA q4w at Week 24, mean changes in vdH-S scores were 1.12 from Week 0-24 while receiving placebo, and 0.34 from Week 24-52 and 0.13 from Week 52-100 while receiving TREMFYA q4w, indicating that further numerical improvements were also made through Year Two in this group.<sup>1,2</sup></li>
 	<li><b>Durability:<sup>1,2</sup></b> Robust joint and skin response rates and mean improvements from baseline in outcome measures were maintained through two years, and approximately 90 percent of patients randomized to TREMFYA q4w or q8w continued treatment with TREMFYA through Week 100.</li>
 	<li><b>Safety:<sup>1,2</sup> </b>No new safety signals were observed in the safety analysis conducted through Week 112. TREMFYA safety in patients with active PsA through two years was comparable to safety at six months and one year and generally consistent with TREMFYA safety in patients with moderate to severe plaque PsO.<sup>10,11</sup></li>
</ul>
In addition, results showed 56 percent of TREMFYA q4w patients and 55 percent of TREMFYA q8w patients achieved at least 50 percent improvement in ACR score (utilizing NRI).<sup>2</sup> Among patients who had clinically meaningful PsO at baseline, 62 percent of TREMFYA q4w patients and 55 percent of TREMFYA q8w patients achieved complete skin clearance as measured by the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (utilizing NRI).<sup>2</sup>

“PsA is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin, joints, and soft tissue and therefore, sustained control of this inflammation is important to physicians and patients,” said Alyssa Johnsen, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Rheumatology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “These long-term study results further bolster our confidence in the ability of TREMFYA to significantly improve the diverse manifestations of PsA over time.”

TREMFYA is the first and only treatment approved for both adults with moderate to severe plaque PsO and for adults with active PsA that selectively inhibits IL-23, a cytokine that is a key driver of the inflammatory immune response associated with the symptoms of these chronic autoimmune diseases.<sup>9,12</sup>

TREMFYA was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque PsO in July 2017 and in July 2020 for adults with active PsA.<sup>9</sup> The PsA approval was based on results from DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2, which showed TREMFYA reached each study’s primary endpoint of ACR 20 response at 24 weeks.<sup>4,5</sup> Complete study results were previously published in <i><a class=""Link"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lancet-simultaneously-publishes-two-phase-3-studies-detailing-comprehensive-efficacy-and-safety-of-tremfya-guselkumab-a-first-in-class-il-23-p19-subunit-inhibitor-in-psoriatic-arthritis-301035657.html"" aria-label=""The Lancet."" data-cms-ai=""0"">The Lancet.</a></i><sup>4,5</sup>

<b>Editor’s Note:</b>

a. In DISCOVER-2, patients were randomized to TREMFYA 100mg q4w or q8w for two years, or to placebo with crossover to TREMFYA q4w at Week 24 through two years.<sup>14</sup>
b. Enthesitis is defined as pain where the bone, tendon and ligament meet.<sup>15</sup>
c. Dactylitis is defined as severe inflammation of the finger and toe joints.<sup>16</sup>
d. Radiographic progression is measured by scoring the erosions and joint space narrowing in the hands and feet.<sup>17</sup>
e. Dr. Mease is a paid consultant for Janssen. He has not been compensated for any media work.
f. Clinically meaningful defined as =3 percent body surface area psoriatic involvement and an IGA score of at least 2 at baseline.
g. TREMFYA q4w is not currently FDA-approved.
h. PASI 75/90/100 is defined as at least 75/90/100 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score. The PASI score grades the amount of surface area on each body region that is covered by PsO plaques and the severity of plaque redness, thickness, and scaliness.<sup>18</sup>
i. ACR 20/50/70 response is defined as both at least 20/50/70 percent improvement from baseline in the number of tender and number of swollen joints, and at least 20/50/70 percent improvement from baseline in three of the following five criteria: patient global assessment, physician global assessment, functional ability measure, visual analog pain scale, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein.<sup>19</sup>
j. ACR response rates at Week 100 were determined post-hoc using NRI, which categorized patients who discontinued the study as non-responders from Week 24 to 100.
k. Change in total vdH-S score is defined by change of score from baseline. The total vdH-S score combines erosion and joint space narrowing scores derived from radiographs of joints in hands and feet.<sup>20</sup> TREMFYA is not approved in the U.S. for inhibition of structural damage.
l. FACIT-F scale is measured on a 4-point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued).<sup>21</sup>

<b>About DISCOVER-1 (NCT03162796)<sup>22</sup></b>
DISCOVER-1 was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in participants with active PsA, including those previously treated with one or two biologic tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. DISCOVER-1 evaluated 381 participants and continued through approximately one year.

The study consisted of a screening phase of up to six weeks, a blinded active treatment phase of 52 weeks that included a placebo-controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and an active treatment period from Week 24 to Week 52. It also included a safety follow-up phase of eight weeks after Week 52 (Week 52 to Week 60; 12 weeks from the last administration of study agent at Week 48 through to the final visit in the safety follow-up phase). Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity and biomarker evaluations were performed in the study on a defined schedule.

<b>About DISCOVER-2 (NCT03158285)<sup>14</sup></b>
DISCOVER-2 was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA administered by SC injection in bio-naïve patients with active PsA. DISCOVER-2 evaluated 739 participants and continued through approximately two years.

The study consisted of a screening phase of up to six weeks, a blinded active treatment phase (approximately 100 weeks) that included a placebo-controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and an active treatment period from Week 24 to Week 100. It also included a safety follow-up phase of 12 weeks after the last administration of study agent. Clinical efficacy, radiographic efficacy, health economics, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarker, and pharmacogenomics evaluations were performed in the study on a defined schedule.

<b>About Psoriatic Arthritis</b>
PsA is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by peripheral joint inflammation, enthesitis (pain where the bone, tendon and ligament meet), dactylitis (severe inflammation of the finger and toe joints), axial disease, and the skin lesions associated with PsO.<sup>15,16,23</sup> In addition, in patients with PsA, comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, anxiety and depression are often present.<sup>24</sup> Studies show up to 30 percent of people with PsO also develop PsA.<sup>25</sup> The disease causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints; it commonly appears between the ages of 30 and 50, but can develop at any time.<sup>25</sup> Nearly half of patients with PsA experience moderate fatigue and about 30 percent suffer from severe fatigue as measured by the modified fatigue severity scale.<sup>26</sup> Although the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in disease onset.<sup>27</sup>

<b>About TREMFYA® (guselkumab)<sup>9</sup></b>
Developed by Janssen, TREMFYA is the first approved fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as PsO and PsA.<sup>28</sup>

TREMFYA is approved in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque PsO who are candidates for systemic therapy (injections or pills) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet light), and for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA. It is also approved in the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque PsO in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy and for the treatment of active PsA in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy.

The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA®.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amathus Therapeutics announced today a strategic collaboration with Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, to develop novel small molecule therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Edward Holson, President and CSO of Amathus added that Amathus will focus on exploiting genetically defined pathways and core pathologies in multiple disease indications, “the Amathus team has demonstrated activation of molecular chaperones is possible and the potential to address core mitochondrial dysfunction with specificity holds tremendous therapeutic potential. The Merck neuroscience team is an ideal partner to translate this novel approach into potential first-in-class, disease modifying treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Amathus will be responsible for identifying and progressing novel chaperone activators through preclinical discovery. Merck has the option to acquire Amathus Therapeutics and its pipeline of mitochondrial targeted candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and renal diseases. Amathus will receive an upfront payment from Merck and, upon Merck’s exercise of its option, will be eligible for milestone payments associated with the successful development of candidates in excess of $500 million per program. Upon exercise of its option, Merck will be solely responsible for clinical development and commercialization.

“We are excited to be working with the Amathus team to investigate the company’s novel mitochondrial targeted candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions,” said Fiona Marshall, Senior Vice President, Head of Discovery Sciences and Translational Medicine, Merck Research Laboratories. “External collaborations that supplement and complement our internal pipeline programs remain a cornerstone of Merck’s discovery strategy.”

<b>About Innovet</b>

Innovet Italia is an innovative animal health company, founded in Italy in 1996. Its main goal is to bring scientific innovation in niche fields of the veterinary market. The philosophy that drives Innovet's development is to follow where nature leads, studying and mimicking natural protective body responses rather than ""artificially"" fighting the mechanisms of diseases. Based on such a strategic idea, Innovet's research team discovered and patented a family of bioactive lipid amides (i.e., aliamides, whose parent compound is palmitoylethanolamide, PEA) able to naturally restore the physiological balance of the hyper-reactive tissues. PEA, its micronized and ultramicronized forms and various other congeners, are the main components of Innovet's innovative products. Innovet's commercial effort is mainly focused on the small animal health field, in many market segments (i.e. dermatology, orthopedics, oral health, uro-nephrology, behavior, gastroenterology, ophthalmology and algology).

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved an expanded label for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 3 years and older with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT is not a treatment option. This approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-204 trial, in which KEYTRUDA monotherapy demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with brentuximab vedotin (BV), a commonly used treatment. KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.48-0.88]; p=0.0027) and showed a median PFS of 13.2 months versus 8.3 months for patients treated with BV. The approval is also based on supportive data from an updated analysis of the KEYNOTE-087 trial; KEYNOTE-087 was the basis for the 2017 EC approval of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory cHL who have failed ASCT and BV or who are transplant ineligible and have failed BV. This approval is the first pediatric approval for KEYTRUDA in the European Union (EU).

“The European Commission’s approval of an expanded use of KEYTRUDA provides another option for adult and pediatric patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have disease progression after earlier lines of therapy or relapse after transplantation,” said Dr. Vicki Goodman, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are driven to advance therapies to help improve outcomes for patients with blood cancers, including those with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, through our broad clinical program.”

This approval allows marketing of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland.

Merck is continuing to study KEYTRUDA across hematologic malignancies through a broad clinical program, including multiple registrational trials in cHL and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and more than 60 investigator-initiated studies across 15 tumors. In addition to KEYTRUDA, Merck is evaluating several clinical-stage assets for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies, including MK-1026 (formerly known as ARQ 531), a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and MK-2140 (formerly known as VLS-101), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting ROR1.

<b>Data Supporting the European Approval</b>

The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-204 (NCT02684292), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study conducted in 304 patients with relapsed or refractory cHL. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks or BV 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks. Randomization was stratified by prior ASCT (yes vs. no) and disease status after frontline therapy (primary refractory vs. relapse less than 12 months after completion vs. relapse 12 months or more after completion). Treatment with KEYTRUDA was continued until unacceptable toxicity, documented disease progression or a maximum of 35 cycles. Disease assessment was performed every 12 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was PFS and the secondary efficacy outcome measure was objective response rate (ORR), both assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to the 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. KEYNOTE-204 is ongoing to assess the additional primary efficacy outcome measure of overall survival (OS).

In KEYNOTE-204, KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.48-0.88]; p=0.0027) and showed a median PFS of 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.9-19.4) compared with 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.7-8.8) for patients treated with BV. For patients treated with KEYTRUDA, the ORR was 66% (95% CI, 57-73), with a complete response (CR) rate of 25% and a partial response (PR) rate of 41%. For patients treated with BV, the ORR was 54% (95% CI, 46-62), with a CR rate of 24% and a PR rate of 30%. The difference in ORRs was not statistically significant. Among the responding patients, median duration of response (DOR) was 20.7 months (range, 0.0+ to 33.2+) with KEYTRUDA versus 13.8 months (range, 0.0+ to 33.9+) with BV.

In this trial, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 10 months (range, 1 day to 2.2 years), with 68% of patients receiving at least six months of treatment and 48% receiving at least one year of treatment. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients who received KEYTRUDA. Serious adverse reactions in =1% of patients included pneumonitis, pneumonia, pyrexia, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, febrile neutropenia and sepsis. Three patients (2%) died from causes other than disease progression: two from complications after allogeneic HSCT and one from an unknown cause. Permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients; discontinuation of treatment due to pneumonitis occurred in 7% of patients. Dosage interruption of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30% of patients. Adverse reactions that required dosage interruption in =3% of patients were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, transaminase increase and pneumonia. Thirty-eight percent of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. The most common adverse reactions (=20%) were upper respiratory tract infection (41%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), diarrhea (22%), and pyrexia, fatigue, rash and cough (20% each).

<b>About Hodgkin Lymphoma in Europe</b>

Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that develops in the white blood cells called lymphocytes, which are part of the immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma can start almost anywhere – most often in lymph nodes in the upper part of the body, with the most common sites being in the chest, neck or under the arms. In the EU, there were nearly 20,000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed, and nearly 4,000 people died from the disease in 2020. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for approximately nine in 10 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma.

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,300 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% of these patients interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

<span class=""bwuline"">Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</span>

<i>KEYTRUDA</i> <i>as a Single Agent</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

<i>KEYTRUDA with Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen, which was at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT =3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT =3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT =3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span>

<i>Adrenal Insufficiency</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated.

Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; <i>Gastrointestinal:</i> Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; <i>Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:</i> Myositis/polymyositis rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; <i>Endocrine:</i> Hypoparathyroidism; <i>Hematologic/Immune:</i> Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

CUPERTINO, Calif., Feb. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- DURECT Corporation (Nasdaq: DRRX) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved POSIMIR® (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression. The approval was based on positive data from a randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, placebo–controlled clinical trial in patients undergoing arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery with an intact rotator cuff. The primary outcome measures were mean pain intensity and total opioid rescue analgesia administered, both evaluated over the first 72 hours after surgery versus placebo. POSIMIR demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both primary outcome measures: a 1.3 point, or 20%, reduction in mean pain intensity on a 0-10 point pain scale (p=0.01), and a 67% reduction in I.V. morphine-equivalent rescue opioid use, from a median of 12 mg in the placebo group to 4 mg in the POSIMIR group (p=0.01). Please see important safety information including the Boxed Warning below and the POSIMIR full prescribing information.

""We are excited to announce the approval of POSIMIR, a novel, non-opioid, sustained-release local analgesic for the treatment of post-surgical pain following arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery,"" said James E. Brown, President and CEO of DURECT. ""This FDA approval provides an important new option to help orthopedic surgeons in their efforts to minimize opioid use while managing acute pain for up to 72 hours after this painful surgery.""

""In my experience, POSIMIR was easy to administer into the subacromial space under arthroscopic guidance, where it can directly address the source of postsurgical pain,"" said Sten Rasmussen, MD CBE PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital, and Professor and Head of the Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Denmark, a principal investigator in the POSIMIR registration trial. ""A non-opioid product providing up to three days of local analgesia would be a significant benefit to patients.""

""The first 72 hours after surgery are typically when patients experience the most severe postsurgical pain,"" said T J Gan, MD MHS FRCA MBA, Professor and Distinguished Endowed Chair, Department of Anesthesiology at Stony Brook University Renaissance School of Medicine. ""So, a new sustained-release product providing continuous analgesia during this critical period is a welcome addition to the armamentarium for anesthesiologists and surgeons, especially as we aim to reduce the use of postsurgical opioids whenever possible.""

<b>About POSIMIR</b>

POSIMIR (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use is a novel and proprietary product that combines the strength of 660 mg of bupivacaine base with the innovative SABER® platform technology, enabling continuous sustained delivery of a non-opioid local analgesic over 3 days in adults. POSIMIR contains more bupivacaine than any other approved single-dose sustained-release bupivacaine product. At the end of surgery, POSIMIR is administered into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization, where it continuously releases bupivacaine for 72 hours or more. DURECT is in discussions with potential partners regarding the licensing of commercialization rights to POSIMIR, for which DURECT holds worldwide rights.

<b>About Subacromial Decompression Shoulder Surgery</b>

Subacromial decompression is a type of shoulder surgery used to treat impingement syndrome, a common repetitive-use injury that causes pain when the arm is raised over the head. The procedure is typically performed arthroscopically, meaning that several small incisions are made in the skin and muscle of the shoulder through which a camera lens (arthroscope) and surgical instruments are inserted during surgery. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression is generally considered outpatient surgery, and most patients go home within a few hours of surgery. The recovery period may extend from weeks to months, but the most intense pain typically occurs during the first 3 days after surgery and is often managed with oral opioids. There are over 600,000 surgeries involving arthroscopic subacromial decompression performed each year in the U.S.

<u>Postmarketing Requirements</u>

In connection with this approval, the Company or its licensee, will be required to conduct two postmarketing non-clinical studies.

<u>Indications and Usage</u>

POSIMIR (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use is indicated in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression.

<u>Limitations of Use</u>

Safety and effectiveness have not been established in other surgical procedures, including soft tissue surgical procedures, other orthopedic procedures, including for intra-articular administration, and boney procedures, or when used for neuraxial or peripheral nerve blockade.

<b>Important Safety Information</b>

<b>BOXED WARNING: Risk of Potential Adverse Embolic Effects Resulting From Inadvertent Intravascaular Injection. Inadvertent intravascular injection could cause POSIMIR droplets to be deposited in the pulmonary and other capillary beds.  Administer POSIMIR into the subacromial space at the end of arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Direct arthroscopic visualization must be used to confirm proper placement of the needle tip before injecting POSIMIR.</b>

In POSIMIR clinical studies, no inadvertent intravascular injections were observed. Do not inject POSIMIR intravascularly.

POSIMIR is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any amide local anesthetic, or other components of POSIMIR, as well as in patients undergoing obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. There is a risk of joint cartilage necrosis with unapproved intra-articular use of POSIMIR. Unintended intravascular injection of POSIMIR may be associated with systemic toxicities, including CNS or cardiorespiratory depression and coma, progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. As with other local anesthetics, patients should be monitored for central nervous system, cardiovascular, and allergic reactions. Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 168 hours following administration of POSIMIR. Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with use of local anesthetics. There have been reports of chondrolysis (mostly in the shoulder joint) following intra-articular infusion of local anesthetics, which is an unapproved use. POSIMIR should be used cautiously in patients with impaired hepatic and cardiovascular function. Adverse events reported with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% and greater than control following POSIMIR administration in shoulder surgery were dizziness, dysgeusia, dysuria, headache, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tinnitus, and vomiting. Adverse events reported with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% and greater than control following POSIMIR administration in soft tissue surgical procedures were anemia, bradycardia, constipation, C-reactive protein increased, diarrhea, dizziness, dysgeusia, headache, nausea, oropharyngeal pain, post-procedural contusion (bruising), procedural pain, pruritus, pyrexia, somnolence, surgical site bleeding, visible bruising and vomiting.

<p align=""justify"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved AMONDYS 45 (casimersen). AMONDYS 45 is an antisense oligonucleotide from Sarepta’s phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) platform, indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 45 skipping. This indication is based on a statistically significant increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle observed in patients treated with AMONDYS 45, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit for those patients who are exon 45 amenable. Consistent with the accelerated approval pathway, the continued approval of AMONDYS 45 may be contingent on confirmation of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The ESSENCE trial – a placebo-controlled confirmatory trial to support the AMONDYS 45 approval – is ongoing and expected to conclude in 2024.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Although kidney toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies with AMONDYS 45, kidney toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Kidney function should be monitored in patients taking AMONDYS 45. In the clinical trial, the most common adverse reactions observed in at least 20% of patients treated with AMONDYS 45 and at least 5% more frequently than in placebo were (AMONDYS 45, placebo): upper respiratory tract infections (65%, 55%), cough (33%, 26%), fever (33%, 23%), headache (32%, 19%), joint pain (21%, 10%), and pain in mouth and throat (21%, 7%).</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This is an important day for Sarepta and, far more importantly, for the patients that we serve. After years of scientific commitment, investment and development, the approval of AMONDYS 45, Sarepta’s third approved RNA therapy, offers treatment to the 8% of the DMD community who have a confirmed exon 45 amenable mutation,” said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta. “Along with our other approved RNA therapies, we can now offer treatment options for nearly 30% of Duchenne patients in the U.S. And our commitment to bring therapies to the greatest percentage of the DMD community as soon as possible continues.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Decades of research and commitment have fueled and now accelerate our progress towards new treatments for Duchenne,” said Marissa Penrod, founder of Team Joseph and parent of an 18-year old with Duchenne. “The extraordinary diligence and persistence of the Duchenne community – patients and families, clinicians and researchers – have led us to today’s approval, where we now have exon-skipping treatments for almost a third of those with Duchenne.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">AMONDYS 45 is priced at parity with Sarepta’s other approved exon-skipping treatments.

<p align=""justify""><strong>About AMONDYS 45</strong>
AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) is an antisense oligonucleotide indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the <em>DMD</em> gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses Sarepta’s proprietary phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping,” of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to allow for production of an internally truncated dystrophin protein.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AMONDYS 45 is approved under accelerated review based on an increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle of patients amenable to exon 45 skipping. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AMONDYS 45 has met the full statutory standards for safety and effectiveness and as such is not considered investigational or experimental.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Important Safety Information for AMONDYS 45</strong>
Kidney toxicity was observed in animals who received casimersen. Although kidney toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies with AMONDYS 45, kidney toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Kidney function should be monitored in patients taking AMONDYS 45. Because of the effect of reduced skeletal muscle mass on creatinine measurements, creatinine may not be a reliable measure of kidney function in DMD patients. Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting AMONDYS 45. Consider also measuring glomerular filtration rate using an exogenous filtration marker before starting AMONDYS 45. During treatment, monitor urine dipstick every month, and serum cystatin C and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) every three months. Only urine expected to be free of excreted AMONDYS 45 should be used for monitoring of urine protein. Urine obtained on the day of AMONDYS 45 infusion prior to the infusion, or urine obtained at least 48 hours after the most recent infusion, may be used. Alternatively, use a laboratory test that does not use the reagent pyrogallol red, as this reagent has the potential to cross react with any AMONDYS 45 that is excreted in the urine and thus lead to a false positive result for urine protein.</p>
<p align=""justify"">If a persistent increase in serum cystatin C or proteinuria is detected, refer to a pediatric nephrologist for further evaluation.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Adverse reactions observed in at least 20% of patients treated with AMONDYS 45 and at least 5% more frequently than in the placebo group were (AMONDYS 45, placebo): upper respiratory tract infections, including upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis and rhinitis (65%, 55%), cough (33%, 26%), pyrexia (33%, 23%), headache (32%, 19%), arthralgia (21%, 10%), and oropharyngeal pain (21%, 7%).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Other adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with AMONDYS 45, and that were reported at a rate at least 5% more frequently in the AMONDYS 45 group than in the placebo group, were: ear pain, nausea, ear infection, post-traumatic pain, and dizziness and light-headedness.</p>

GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the SWIFT-2 trial as part of the phase 3 clinical programme investigating the safety and efficacy of GSK3511294 (“GSK’294”) in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA).

GSK’294 is an investigational medicine with potential to be the first biologic to deliver long-acting suppression of IL-5 in patients with SEA from one subcutaneous injection every six months.

<strong>Christopher Corsico, Senior Vice President Development, GSK, said:</strong> “Around 10% of all asthma patients suffer from the avoidable symptoms of severe eosinophilic asthma and only one in four patients who are eligible for a biologic therapy currently receive one. These patients might benefit from more targeted therapies to better control their condition. We believe GSK’294 could provide another option to these patients that build on the positive impact seen with current anti-IL5 treatments and may also offer the advantage of one subcutaneous injection every six months.”

GSK’294 is an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody currently in development for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. It is a distinct, new biologic entity and has been engineered for high affinity and long-acting suppression of IL-5 function. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the proliferation, activation and survival of eosinophils, making it a proven treatment target for severe asthma patients with higher levels of eosinophils. In patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, targeted anti-IL-5 therapies are a well-established and effective treatment approach.

GSK’294 has progressed from phase 1 to phase 3 studies in three and a half years. The planned phase 3 programme, which involves three studies and 2,450 patients, will assess the efficacy and safety of GSK’294.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>SWIFT 1</strong> (N=375) and <strong>SWIFT 2</strong> (N=375) will assess the efficacy and safety of GSK’294 in participants with severe uncontrolled asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype despite standard of care treatment with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus at least one additional controller.</li>
 	<li><strong>NIMBLE</strong> (N=1700 patients) will assess whether participants with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype, who are currently benefitting from mepolizumab or benralizumab treatment can maintain treatment benefit when switched to GSK’294. Throughout the study, all participants will continue their non-biologic baseline standard of care asthma treatment.</li>
</ul>
<strong>About severe asthma and eosinophilic inflammation</strong>

Severe asthma is defined as asthma which requires treatment with medium or high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming ‘uncontrolled’ or which remains ‘uncontrolled’ despite this therapy. Severe asthma patients are also often categorised by long-term use of oral corticosteroids (OCS).  Eosinophils play a core role in more than 50% of patients with severe asthma, providing a proven target for treatment.

<strong>GSK’s commitment to respiratory disease</strong>

For over 50 years, GSK has led the way in developing medicines that advance the management of asthma and COPD. From introducing the world’s first selective short-acting beta agonist in 1969, to launching six treatments in five years to create today’s industry-leading respiratory portfolio, we continue to innovate so we can reach the right patients, with the right treatment. Working together with the healthcare community, we apply world-class science to discover and understand the molecules that become the medicines of tomorrow. We won’t stand still until the simple act of breathing is made easier for everyone.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: RISK OF MEDICATION ERRORS AND HEPATOTOXICITY
Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering Acetaminophen Injection to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that:

the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused;
the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg;
infusion pumps are properly programmed; and
the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits.
Acetaminophen Injection contains acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed the maximum daily limits, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product.

FOSTER CITY, Calif. &amp; BAGSVÆRD, Denmark--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Novo Nordisk A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: NOVO B) today announced that the companies have expanded their clinical collaboration in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

The companies will conduct a Phase 2b double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety and efficacy of Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and a fixed-dose combination of Gilead’s investigational FXR agonist cilofexor and investigational ACC inhibitor firsocostat, alone and in combination in people with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to NASH. The four-arm study in approximately 440 patients will evaluate the treatments’ impact on liver fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution and will begin recruitment in the second half of 2021.

This new Phase 2b study builds on positive results from a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study presented at the Liver Meeting Digital Experience™ in November 2020 investigating semaglutide, alone and in combination with cilofexor and/or firsocostat, in 108 people with NASH and mild to moderate fibrosis. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that all regimens were well tolerated over 24 weeks. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal. Across all groups, 5–14% of people discontinued any trial treatment due to adverse events.

In addition, post-hoc analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints assessing biomarkers of liver health at 24 weeks showed statistically significant improvements in hepatic steatosis (measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction; MRI-PDFF) and liver injury (measured by serum alanine aminotransferase; ALT) in the combination treatment arms versus semaglutide alone. Liver stiffness and the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score declined in all groups; however, statistically significant differences between groups were not observed.

“NASH is a disease with a high unmet medical need, as no drugs are currently approved to treat this potentially life-threatening condition. Building on the positive results from our proof-of-concept trial, we hope together with Gilead to demonstrate the potential for semaglutide with cilofexor and firsocostat to help people living with NASH,” said Martin Holst Lange, Executive Vice President and Head of Development at Novo Nordisk.

“Gilead is pleased to expand our collaboration with Novo Nordisk and advance understanding of the potential for combination approaches in treating people living with cirrhosis due to NASH,” said Mark Genovese, MD, Senior Vice President, Inflammation Clinical Development at Gilead Sciences. “This study is the latest example of our persistent focus on driving innovation to improve the lives of people living with liver diseases and fibrosis.”

Cilofexor and firsocostat are investigational compounds and are not approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authority. Their safety and efficacy have not been established. Semaglutide has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority for the treatment of patients living with NASH but has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About NASH</span></b>

NASH is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterised by fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver, which can lead to scarring or fibrosis, that impairs liver function. The risk of progression to advanced liver disease, including liver decompensation (loss of liver function) and liver cancer, is higher in people with NASH than in the general population and NASH could become the leading reason for liver transplants in most countries. Currently, no pharmacotherapy is globally approved for the treatment of NASH, and people with NASH are left with very few management options.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Boston Pharmaceuticals announced today a pioneering three-year out-license and option agreement with GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LSE/NYSE: GSK). Boston Pharmaceuticals will become a preferred GSK partner for select pre-phase 2 programs. This new agreement builds on the relationship established in 2018 with Boston Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of five GSK programs.

“This new agreement validates Boston Pharmaceuticals as a trusted development partner with whom pharmaceutical companies can collaborate,” said Robert Armstrong, Ph.D., CEO of Boston Pharmaceuticals. “GSK has been an excellent partner and we look forward to advancing these pre-phase 2 assets into and through the clinic to evaluate their potential to improve patient lives.”

Initially, GSK will out-license and option two programs to Boston Pharmaceuticals:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>GSK3903371 - a monoclonal antibody targeting the Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein (IL1RAP), a tumor-associated antigen driving tumor growth and immunosuppression.</li>
 	<li>GSK3502421 - an orally available, small molecule inhibitor for potential neurological disorders that targets Receptor Interacting Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (RIPK1), a key component of the TNF-driven inflammation and necroptosis pathway.</li>
</ul>
“We are pleased to further strengthen our relationship with Boston Pharmaceuticals as they continue to help us translate great science into medicines,” said John Lepore, SVP, Research of GSK. “This agreement makes strong strategic sense as it helps us assess the potential of multiple early-stage programs and focus on progressing our own internal assets, while maintaining pipeline optionality for the future.”

Under the agreement, Boston Pharmaceuticals will be responsible for further development of select programs through proof-of-concept (PoC). Following the completion of PoC studies, GSK will have the option to reacquire each program under pre-agreed terms for subsequent development and worldwide commercialization.

If GSK exercises its repurchase option, Boston Pharmaceuticals will receive a one-time payment, as well as be eligible for approval and sales milestones and royalties. In the event GSK chooses not to reacquire a program, Boston Pharmaceuticals may continue development and potential commercialization of the program. GSK will then be eligible to receive milestones and royalty payments.

<p align=""justify"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today shared new results from the ongoing study of SRP-9003 (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.hSGCB), the Company’s investigational gene therapy for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2E (LGMD2E). In the first look at expression data from biopsies taken two years after a single administration of SRP-9003, results found sustained protein expression in muscle tissue. In functional outcomes assessments taken two years following treatment in Cohort 1 (low-dose cohort) and one year after treatment in Cohort 2 (high-dose cohort), patients continued to demonstrate stability in their NSAD (North Star Assessment for Dysferlinopathies) total score and improvements on timed function tests. Results are being presented today at the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference.</p>
<p align=""justify"">SRP-9003 is in development for the treatment of LGMD2E (also known as beta-sarcoglycanopathy and LGMDR4), a devastating monogenic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of beta-sarcoglycan (beta-SG) proteins. SRP-9003 is a gene therapy construct that transduces skeletal and cardiac muscle, delivering a gene that codes for the full-length beta-SG protein, the absence of which is the sole cause of the progressive degeneration and a shortened lifespan characterized by the disease.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This data is the first look at longer-term expression data with any gene therapy for muscular dystrophy. The meaningful and sustained levels of beta-sarcoglycan protein expression at two years and continued strength of the functional outcomes measured are tremendously positive and support continued advancement of this investigational treatment for patients,” said Louise Rodino-Klapac, Ph.D., executive vice president and chief scientific officer, Sarepta Therapeutics. “In Cohort 2, we also saw strong expression of delta-sarcoglycan and gamma-sarcoglycan proteins in addition to beta-sarcoglycan, which suggests that SRP-9003 is working to restore the dystrophin associated protein complex, or DAPC, which provides biological support for the sustained functional benefits observed in both cohorts. LGMD2E is one of the most severe forms of LGMD and causes significant disability in children while frequently leading to early mortality and the data continue to suggest this treatment could bring much needed hope to these patients.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Efficient transduction in skeletal muscle and robust beta-sarcoglycan protein expression were seen in both dose cohorts following infusion with SRP-9003, and significant creatine kinase (CK) reductions were observed.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Cohort 1 (Dosed at 1.85×10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg), 24 months following treatment:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>As measured by western blot, mean beta-SG of 54% at 24 months of normal control, compared to 36% measured at Day 60.</li>
 	<li>Percent immunofluorescent (IF) positive fibers was 48% compared to normal control, compared to 51% at Day 60.</li>
 	<li>Participants showed a mean intensity of 35% of transduced beta-SG, properly localized to the muscle sarcolemma, as measured by IF, compared to 47% at Day 60.</li>
 	<li>The mean NSAD improvement from baseline of 5.7 points at 18 months was sustained through 24 months.</li>
 	<li>All three participants demonstrated continued improvements from baseline across all functional measures, including time-to-rise, four-stair climb, 100-meter walk test and 10-meter walk test.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">Cohort 2 (Dosed at 7.41×10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg), 12 months following treatment:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>At Day 60, the expression of beta-SG (72% mean positive fibers and 73% mean intensity) resulted in increased expression of delta-sarcoglycan, with 65% mean positive fibers and 103% intensity, and gamma-sarcoglycan, 60% mean positive fibers and 97% intensity. These results suggest treatment with SRP-9003 demonstrates reconstitution of the DAPC, which could lead to improved membrane integrity and thus improved clinical motor outcomes measures.</li>
 	<li>All three participants demonstrated improvements from baseline across all functional measures, including the NSAD, time-to-rise, four-stair climb, 100-meter walk test and 10-meter walk test.</li>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About SRP-9003 and the Study</strong>
SRP-9003 uses the AAVrh74 vector, which is designed to be systemically and robustly delivered to skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle, making it an ideal candidate to treat peripheral neuromuscular diseases. AAVrh74 has lower immunogenicity rates than reported with other human AAV vectors. The MHCK7 promoter has been chosen for its ability to robustly express in the heart, which is critically important for patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2E (LGMD2E), also known as beta-sarcoglycanopathy and LGMDR4, many of whom die from pulmonary or cardiac complications.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This open label, first-in-human study is evaluating a single intravenous infusion of SRP-9003 among children with LGMD2E between the ages of 4 and 15 years with significant symptoms of disease. The SRP-9003 study has two cohorts, each studying a different dose-per-kilogram based on the weight of the patient. Three participants in the low-dose cohort (Cohort 1) were treated with a one-time infusion of SRP-9003 dosed at 1.85×10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg and an additional three participants in the high-dose cohort (Cohort 2) received a one-time infusion dosed at 7.41×10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg based on linear standard qPCR titer method. The six participants were between the ages of 4 and 13. Post-treatment biopsies were taken at 60 days.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sarepta has exclusive rights to the LGMD2E gene therapy program initially developed at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy</strong>
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases that cause progressive, debilitating weakness and wasting that begin in muscles around the hips and shoulders before progressing to muscles in the arms and legs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2E (LGMD2E) begin showing neuromuscular symptoms such as difficulty running, jumping and climbing stairs before age 10. The disease, which is an autosomal recessive subtype of LGMD, progresses to loss of ambulation in the teen years and often leads to early mortality. There is currently no treatment or cure for LGMD2E.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sarepta has five LGMD gene therapy programs in development, including subtypes for LGMD2E, LGMD2D, LGMD2C, LGMD2B and LGMD2L, and holds an option for a sixth program for LGMD2A.</p>

HAMILTON, Bermuda, March 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Nasdaq: KNSA) (Kiniksa), a biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of assets designed to modulate immunological pathways across a spectrum of diseases, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ARCALYST <sup><em>®</em></sup> (rilonacept), a weekly, subcutaneously-injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß) signaling, for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years and older. The commercial launch is expected in April 2021.

“The approval of ARCALYST in recurrent pericarditis offers patients the first and only FDA-approved therapy for this devastating disease and also represents a transformational event for Kiniksa,” said Sanj K. Patel, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Kiniksa. “I would like to thank the recurrent pericarditis community and specifically acknowledge the exceedingly dedicated patients, nurses, physicians and caregivers who participated in the clinical trials as well as the Kiniksa team whose absolute focus on patients made this possible. We look forward to launching ARCALYST for recurrent pericarditis with the support of our experienced commercial and medical affairs teams and, importantly, providing this breakthrough therapy to patients suffering with this debilitating disease as quickly as possible.”

Recurrent pericarditis is a painful autoinflammatory cardiovascular disease that typically presents with chest pain and is often associated with changes in electrical conduction and sometimes buildup of fluid around the heart, called pericardial effusion. Patients who have additional pericarditis episodes following a symptom-free period of 4-6 weeks or longer are identified as having recurrent pericarditis. Recurrent pericarditis symptoms have an impact on quality of life, limit physical activities, and lead to frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Data show that approximately 40,000 patients in the U.S. seek and receive treatment for recurrent pericarditis each year. Of that group, approximately 14,000 patients experience a second or subsequent event (recurrence) due to persistent underlying disease or inadequate response to conventional therapies, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and corticosteroids.

The FDA approval of ARCALYST in recurrent pericarditis follows positive data from RHAPSODY, a pivotal Phase 3 trial of ARCALYST in recurrent pericarditis. RHAPSODY met its prespecified primary endpoint of time-to-first adjudicated pericarditis recurrence in the randomized withdrawal period and all major secondary efficacy endpoints with statistical significance. The data showed that ARCALYST treatment in the trial improved clinically meaningful outcomes associated with the significant unmet medical need in recurrent pericarditis. There were rapid and sustained reductions in both reported pain and inflammation as early as after the first dose. Median time to treatment response was 5 days, with a 97% treatment response rate. Patients randomized to ARCALYST experienced a 96% reduction in the risk for a recurrent pericarditis event (Hazard Ratio = 0.04, p&lt;0.0001), with 92% of trial days being pain free or at most experiencing minimal pain, compared to 40% of trial days on placebo (p&lt;0.0001). The most common adverse events were injection site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections. RHAPSODY data were published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine </em>simultaneously with a late-breaking scientific presentation at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2020.

“Recurrent pericarditis is a debilitating disease that disrupts the lives of afflicted patients. Data have shown that recurrent pericarditis stems from an underlying autoinflammatory pathophysiology mediated by IL-1a and IL-1ß,” said Allan Klein, MD, of Cleveland Clinic, co-principal investigator of RHAPSODY and compensated member of a 2019 Kiniksa scientific advisory committee. “This approval supports the concept of a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic strategy as a paradigm shift in the management of patients with this devastating disease.”

Kiniksa is providing Kiniksa One Connect™, a program that will assist patients on their treatment journey. The program will help provide access, initiation, affordability solutions and ongoing support for any patient receiving ARCALYST therapy. For more information, call 1-833-KINIKSA (1-833-546-4572).

“The approval of ARCALYST in recurrent pericarditis is an extremely important achievement for those suffering from this disease as there can be significant impact on a patient’s physical and emotional health as well as quality of life,” said Dona Winnowski, President of the Pericarditis Alliance. “The development and commercialization of new medicines for underserved and severe diseases are essential, and this first FDA-approved therapy in recurrent pericarditis brings hope to patients and their families.”

ARCALYST was discovered by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) and received initial FDA approval in February 2008 for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome, and subsequent approval for the maintenance of remission of deficiency of IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) in December 2020.

Kiniksa licensed ARCALYST from Regeneron in 2017 for evaluation in diseases believed to be mediated by both IL-1a and IL-1ß, including recurrent pericarditis. Upon this approval by the FDA for recurrent pericarditis, Kiniksa takes responsibility for sales and distribution of ARCALYST for all the approved indications in the United States, including CAPS and DIRA, and will evenly split profits with Regeneron, as described in the ARCALYST License Agreement.

Recurrent pericarditis is a painful and debilitating autoinflammatory cardiovascular disease that typically presents with chest pain and is often associated with changes in electrical conduction and sometimes buildup of fluid around the heart, called pericardial effusion. Patients who have additional pericarditis episodes following a symptom-free period of 4-6 weeks are identified as having recurrent pericarditis. Recurrent pericarditis symptoms have an impact on quality of life, limit physical activities, and lead to frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

<strong>About ARCALYST</strong>
ARCALYST is a weekly, subcutaneously-injected, recombinant dimeric fusion protein that blocks IL-1a and IL-1ß signaling. ARCALYST was discovered by Regeneron and is approved by the FDA for recurrent pericarditis, CAPS, including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome, and DIRA. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis in 2019 and Orphan Drug designation to ARCALYST for the treatment of pericarditis in 2020.

<strong>About RHAPSODY</strong>
RHAPSODY is the global, randomized withdrawal design, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCALYST in recurrent pericarditis. Eligible patients presented at screening with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain of = 4 on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) value = 1 mg/dL within the 7-day period prior to first study drug administration. Patients could be receiving concomitant NSAIDs and/or colchicine and/or oral corticosteroid treatment in any combination. The study was comprised of 4 periods: a screening period; a single-blind run-in period during which patients received a loading dose of ARCALYST 320 mg injected subcutaneously (SC) followed by 160 mg SC weekly while background pericarditis medications were tapered and discontinued; a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal period during which clinical responders to ARCALYST were randomized 1:1 and received 160 mg SC weekly ARCALYST or placebo; and a long-term extension treatment period with up to 24 months of open-label ARCALYST 160 mg SC weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint was time-to-first pericarditis-recurrence in the randomized withdrawal period. The Clinical Endpoint Committee adjudicated all suspected pericarditis recurrences for inclusion in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. Kiniksa will continue to follow patients in the long-term extension treatment period for up to 24 months. The co-principal investigators are Dr. Allan Klein of Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Massimo Imazio of the University of Torino, Italy.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for mavacamten, an investigational, novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin, for patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of January 28, 2022.

“HCM, which is the most common inherited heart disease, can be a chronic, debilitating, and progressive condition where patients may experience symptoms of shortness of breath, dizziness and fatigue as well as serious, life-altering complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke and sudden cardiac death,” said Roland Chen, M.D., Senior Vice President, Cardiovascular Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “Today’s acceptance from the FDA puts us one step closer to having a highly targeted therapeutic approach for oHCM, as mavacamten is a first-in-class myosin inhibitor developed to address the underlying molecular defect of the disease. We are committed to supporting patients in need of HCM treatment and look forward to working with the FDA.”

The NDA submission was based on the results of the pivotal Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM trial, which evaluated mavacamten in patients with symptomatic oHCM versus placebo. Results from the trial showed that mavacamten demonstrated a robust treatment effect, with clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms, functional status, and quality of life, as well as the ability to relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. In the EXPLORER-HCM study all primary and secondary endpoints were met with statistical significance.

Mavacamten is an investigational therapy that is not approved for use in any country.

<b>About Mavacamten</b>

Mavacamten is a first-in-class, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin, under investigation for the treatment of conditions in which excessive cardiac contractility and impaired diastolic filling of the heart are the underlying cause. Mavacamten is thought to work by reducing cardiac muscle contractility by inhibiting excessive myosin-actin cross-bridge formation that results in hypercontractility, left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced compliance. In clinical and preclinical studies, mavacamten has consistently reduced biomarkers of cardiac wall stress, lessened excessive cardiac contractility, and increased diastolic compliance.

<b>About EXPLORER-HCM</b>

The EXPLORER-HCM Phase 3 trial enrolled a total of 251 patients with symptomatic (NYHA Class II or III), obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. All participants had measurable left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (resting and/or provoked) =50 mmHg at baseline.

The primary endpoint for EXPLORER-HCM was a composite functional analysis designed to capture mavacamten’s effect on both symptoms and function. Secondary endpoints were changes from baseline to week 30 in post­exercise LVOT gradient, pVO2, proportion of patients with at least one NYHA class improvement, and measures of patient­reported outcomes. Additional endpoints included changes from baseline to Week 30 in echocardiographic indices, circulating biomarkers, cardiac rhythm patterns and accelerometry.

<b>About Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</b>

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, is a chronic, progressive disease in which excessive contraction of the heart muscle and reduced ability of the left ventricle to fill can lead to the development of debilitating symptoms and cardiac dysfunction. HCM is estimated to affect one in every 500 people.

The most frequent cause of HCM is mutations in the heart muscle proteins of the sarcomere. In either obstructive or non-obstructive HCM patients, exertion can result in fatigue or shortness of breath, interfering with a patient’s ability to participate in activities of daily living. HCM has also been associated with increased risks of atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure and sudden cardiac death, with mortality among HCM patients shown to be approximately three-fold higher than the U.S. general population at similar ages.

There are currently approximately 160,000 to 200,000 people diagnosed with symptomatic obstructive HCM across the U.S. and EU, with no existing effective drug treatment options beyond limited symptomatic relief.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

KENILWORTH, N.J. &amp; WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Eisai today announced the first presentation of investigational data from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 trial in an oral plenary session (Plenary Session #10191) at the virtual Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) 2021 Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer. The trial evaluated the combination of KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, plus LENVIMA, the orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, for the treatment of certain patients with advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer following one prior platinum-based regimen in any setting.

The study met the dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, and overall survival (OS) as well as the secondary efficacy endpoint of objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, in the all-comer population (mismatch repair proficient [pMMR] and mismatch repair deficient [dMMR]) and in the pMMR subgroup. Median follow-up was 11.4 months for both the all-comer population and the pMMR subgroup. A statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS was seen in the all-comer population, in which KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA (n=411) reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 44% (HR=0.56 [95% CI: 0.47-0.66]; p&lt;0.0001), with a median PFS of 7.2 months (95% CI: 5.7-7.6; number of events=281) versus 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.6-4.2; number of events=286) for patients who received chemotherapy (treatment of physician’s choice [TPC] of doxorubicin or paclitaxel; n=416). Additionally, a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS was seen in the all-comer population, in which KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA reduced the risk of death by 38% (HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.51-0.75]; p&lt;0.0001), with a median OS of 18.3 months (95% CI: 15.2-20.5; number of events=188) versus 11.4 months (95% CI: 10.5-12.9; number of events=245) for patients who received TPC. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA was generally consistent with the established safety profiles of the individual monotherapies.

“Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, the most common type of gynecologic cancer in the U.S., face low survival rates when diagnosed at an advanced stage or at recurrence, especially once the disease progresses after prior platinum-based therapy and is not amenable to curative surgery or radiation,” said Dr. Vicky Makker, Principal Investigator and Medical Oncologist, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “With a 38% reduction in risk of death regardless of mismatch repair status, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA significantly improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy in the all-comer group of patients with advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, which is very encouraging, as this arm included an investigational patient population for which more data have been sought after by the gynecologic oncology community.”

In the all-comer population, the secondary efficacy endpoint of ORR was 31.9% (95% CI: 27.4-36.6), with a complete response (CR) rate of 6.6% and a partial response (PR) rate of 25.3%, for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 14.7% (95% CI: 11.4-18.4), with a CR rate of 2.6% and a PR rate of 12.0% for patients who received TPC (ORR difference versus TPC: 17.2 percentage points; p&lt;0.0001). For patients who responded, the median duration of response (DOR) was 14.4 months (range: 1.6-23.7) for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 5.7 months (range: 0.0-24.2) for patients who received TPC.

“In this confirmatory Phase 3 study, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA demonstrated statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival, overall survival and objective response rate versus chemotherapy,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Oncology Clinical Research, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are encouraged by these results that reaffirm Merck’s and Eisai’s commitment to explore the potential of the combination to help more patients with difficult-to-treat types of cancer.”

“The positive results seen in KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 help confirm the currently approved use of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination in certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma,” said Dr. Takashi Owa, Chief Medicine Creation Officer and Chief Discovery Officer, Oncology Business Group at Eisai. “As this stage of disease has been notoriously difficult to treat, Eisai and Merck remain committed to addressing the unmet need of advanced endometrial carcinoma. We are grateful to the patients and healthcare providers whose participation and persistence amid a global pandemic have made this milestone possible.”

Results were similar across the all-comer population and the pMMR subgroup. In the pMMR subgroup, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% (HR=0.60 [95% CI: 0.50-0.72]; p&lt;0.0001), with a median PFS of 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.6-7.4; number of events=247) versus 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.6-5.0; number of events=238) for patients who received TPC. KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA reduced the risk of death by 32% (HR=0.68 [95% CI: 0.56-0.84]; p=0.0001), with a median OS of 17.4 months (95% CI: 14.2-19.9; number of events=165) versus 12.0 months (95% CI: 10.8-13.3; number of events=203) for patients who received TPC. The secondary endpoint of ORR was 30.3% (95% CI: 25.5-35.5), with a CR rate of 5.2% and a PR rate of 25.1%, for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 15.1% (95% CI: 11.5-19.3), with a CR rate of 2.6% and a PR rate of 12.5%, for patients who received TPC (ORR difference versus TPC: 15.2 percentage points; p&lt;0.0001). For patients who responded, the median DOR was 9.2 months (range: 1.6-23.7) for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 5.7 months (range: 0.0-24.2) for patients who received TPC.

In the all-comer population, in the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm (n=406), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 18.7% of patients, of LENVIMA in 30.8% of patients, and of both in 14.0% of patients. In the TPC arm (n=388), TEAEs of any grade led to discontinuation of chemotherapy in 8.0% of patients. Grade 5 TEAEs of any cause occurred in 5.7% of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm and in 4.9% of patients in the TPC arm. Grade =3 TEAEs occurred in 88.9% of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm and in 72.7% of patients in the TPC arm. In the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm, the most common TEAEs of any grade occurring in at least 25% of patients were hypertension (64.0%), hypothyroidism (57.4%), diarrhea (54.2%), nausea (49.5%), decreased appetite (44.8%), vomiting (36.7%), weight decrease (34.0%), fatigue (33.0%), arthralgia (30.5%), proteinuria (28.8%), anemia (26.1%), constipation (25.9%) and urinary tract infection (25.6%). In the TPC arm, the most common TEAEs of any grade occurring in at least 25% of patients were anemia (48.7%), nausea (46.1%), neutropenia (33.8%), alopecia (30.9%), and fatigue (27.6%). Median treatment duration was 231 days (range: 1-817) with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA and 104.5 days (range: 1-785) with TPC.

KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 is the confirmatory trial for KEYNOTE-146/Study 111, which supported the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) 2019 accelerated approval of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not MSI-H or dMMR, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.

<strong>About Endometrial Cancer</strong>

Endometrial cancer begins in the inner lining of the uterus, which is known as the endometrium and is the most common type of cancer in the uterus. In 2020, it was estimated there were more than 417,000 new cases and more than 97,000 deaths from uterine body cancers worldwide (these estimates include both endometrial cancers and uterine sarcomas; more than 90% of uterine body cancers occur in the endometrium, so the actual numbers for endometrial cancer cases and deaths are slightly lower than these estimates). In the U.S., it is estimated there will be more than 66,000 new cases of uterine body cancer and nearly 13,000 deaths from the disease in 2021. The five-year survival rate for metastatic endometrial cancer (stage IV) is estimated to be approximately 17%.

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,400 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% of these patients interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Colitis</span>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

<span class=""bwuline"">Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</span>

<i>KEYTRUDA</i> <i>as a Single Agent</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

<i>KEYTRUDA with Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen, which was at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT =3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT =3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT =3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

<span class=""bwuline"">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</span>

<i>Adrenal Insufficiency</i>

KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated.

PONVORY™ also prevented disability from worsening for most people. Nine in 10 PONVORY™-treated patients did not have worsening of 3-month disability, and PONVORY™ showed a numerical benefit in delaying disability progression. The difference in rates of disability progression was not statistically significant between the PONVORY™ and teriflunomide groups.<sup>3</sup>

""MS is a complex disease, and any individual's response to MS disease-modifying therapy can vary,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Bruce Bebo</span>, Executive Vice President of Research at the National MS Society. ""It's so important that people living with MS have access to effective treatment options. We are pleased that there is a new therapy approved for relapsing MS.""

If treatment needs to be stopped, PONVORY™ leaves the blood within one week, with effects on the immune system wearing off in one to two weeks for most patients.<sup>3</sup> This may offer additional flexibility in treatment management if patients need to receive vaccines, address potential infections, or begin family planning. PONVORY™ has no known food restrictions and requires no genetic testing or first-dose monitoring for most patients.<sup>3</sup>

""In the pivotal study, ponesimod demonstrated superior clinical efficacy in reducing annual relapses and MRI activity compared against teriflunomide, another oral MS therapy. Those results, combined with a favorable side effect profile, make ponesimod a useful treatment option for people with relapsing MS,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Robert J. Fox</span>, M.D., Staff Neurologist, Mellen Center for MS Treatment and Research, Vice-Chair for Research, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Fox has served as a paid consultant to Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Janssen as a member of the ponesimod Advisory Board.

PONVORY™ has a proven safety profile and was generally well-tolerated over multiple clinical studies totaling more than 10 years, with overall adverse event rates similar to placebo in the Phase 2 and teriflunomide in the Phase 3 trials.<sup>3,4,5,8</sup> The most common adverse events observed in the Phase 3 trial in PONVORY™-treated patients were upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation (abnormal liver tests) and hypertension (high blood pressure).<sup>8</sup>

""Every person with multiple sclerosis is affected differently, given variability in both the underlying disease and emerging symptoms. Continued innovation in this space is critical, and we're committed to meeting patients' evolving healthcare needs,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Mathai Mammen</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research &amp; Development, Johnson &amp; Johnson. ""We are proud to offer PONVORY as a valuable new option for people with MS that may help them gain better control of their disease.""

Janssen CarePath offers a comprehensive support program that helps patients get started on PONVORY™ and stay on track. Janssen CarePath provides information on insurance coverage, potential out-of-pocket costs and treatment support, and identifies options that may help make treatment more affordable, including the Janssen CarePath Savings Program for commercially insured patients who are eligible. For patients who are prescribed PONVORY™, the Wellness Companion Program by Janssen CarePath provides patients with one-on-one education to help them get started and continue treatment.

<b>About the Phase 3 Study<sup>8</sup></b><br class=""dnr"" />The Oral Ponesimod Versus Teriflunomide In Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (OPTIMUM) trial was a head-to-head, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study comparing efficacy, safety and tolerability of PONVORY™ 20 mg versus teriflunomide 14 mg in adults with relapsing MS. The primary endpoint of the study, which included 1,133 participants, was the annualized relapse rate (ARR) from baseline through the study period. The study included several other important efficacy endpoints, including the number of new Gd-enhancing T1 lesions from baseline to Week 108, the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions from baseline to Week 108, and the time to 3-month and 6-month confirmed disability progression.

<b>About Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</b><br class=""dnr"" />MS is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in which immune cells attack myelin (the protective casing that insulates nerve cells), damaging or destroying it and causing inflammation.<sup>9</sup> This affects how the CNS processes information and communicates with the rest of the body, causing the neurologic signs and symptoms of MS.<sup>10</sup> Symptoms vary by person, but common symptoms include fatigue, balance and walking problems, numbness or tingling, dizziness and vertigo, vision problems, bladder and bowel problems and weakness.<sup>11,12,13</sup>

<b>About PONVORY™</b><br class=""dnr"" />PONVORY™ (ponesimod) is a daily oral selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator, indicated to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease.<sup>1,2,3</sup> PONVORY™ is believed to work by keeping immune cells called lymphocytes out of the blood by trapping them in the lymph nodes.<sup>3</sup> The way PONVORY™ exerts therapeutic effects in MS is unknown, but may help keep the lymphocytes out of the central nervous system, where they could cause damage.<sup>3</sup>

PONVORY™ does not require genetic testing or first-dose cardiac monitoring for most patients. Because initiation of PONVORY™ treatment results in a decrease in heart rate, first-dose monitoring is recommended in patients with certain preexisting cardiac conditions.<sup>3</sup>

It is not known if PONVORY™ is safe and effective in children.

Janssen submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for ponesimod for treatment of adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis in Q1 2020, which is currently under review.

A member of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd is party to a revenue sharing agreement with Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd, which provides for certain payments to Idorsia related to the sales of ponesimod.

<b>About the Wellness Companion Program</b><br class=""dnr"" />The Wellness Companion Program is limited to education for patients about their Janssen therapy, its administration and/or their disease. It is intended to supplement a patient's understanding of their therapy. It does not provide medical advice, health coaching or improved wellness as a result of engaging with the program, replace a treatment plan from the patient's doctor or nurse, provide case management services, or serve as a reason to prescribe.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>

<b>WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PONVORY™?</b>

<b>PONVORY™ may cause serious side effects, including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Infections</b> - PONVORY™ can increase your risk of serious infections that can be life–threatening and cause death. PONVORY™ lowers the number of white blood cells (lymphocytes) in your blood. This will usually go back to normal within 1 to 2 weeks of stopping treatment. Your healthcare provider should review a recent blood test of your white blood cells before you start taking PONVORY™. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms of an infection during treatment and for 1 to 2 weeks after your last dose of PONVORY™:
<ul>
 	<li>fever</li>
 	<li>tiredness</li>
 	<li>body aches</li>
 	<li>chills</li>
 	<li>nausea</li>

PALO ALTO, Calif., March 20, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver meaningful medicines for patients with genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers, today announced early results from an ongoing Phase 2b proof-of-concept, open-label study of encaleret for the treatment of Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1 (ADH1). The data are featured in an ePoster presentation titled ‘The Effects of Encaleret (CLTX-305) on Mineral Physiology in ADH1 Demonstrate Proof-of-Concept: Early Results from an Ongoing Phase 2B, Open-Label, Dose-Ranging Study’ at the Endocrine Society’s 2021 Annual Meeting (ENDO 2021) taking place virtually from March 20<sup>th</sup> – 23<sup>rd</sup>.

“ADH1 is a rare genetic form of hypoparathyroidism caused by pathogenic variants in the calcium-sensing receptor (<em>CASR)</em> gene that are estimated to be harbored by 12,000 individuals in the United States<sup>1</sup>. Patients with ADH1 experience a range of symptoms associated with low blood calcium and high urine calcium, which cannot be adequately addressed with current standard of care therapies,” said Rachel Gafni, M.D., Senior Research Physician and Head, Mineral Homeostasis Studies Group of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health (NIH). “In these initial results from the Phase 2b study of encaleret in ADH1, blood and urine calcium levels were normalized in all trial participants within five days of treatment.”

In these data from the ongoing Phase 2b open-label, dose-ranging study, six adults with ADH1 with four distinct<em> CASR</em> genotypes were administered encaleret. Calcitriol (active Vitamin D) therapy (current standard of care) was discontinued prior to and throughout the study. Non-dietary calcium supplements were withheld in five participants with adequate dietary calcium intake. Participants received sequential, increasing daily doses of encaleret starting at 30 mg while undergoing intensive safety monitoring and frequent blood and urine sampling for biochemical measures. Following five days of dosing with encaleret, blood calcium, parathyroid hormone, phosphorus and magnesium were within the normal range on average. Urinary calcium excretion was normal or undetectable in all participants.

Baseline and day 5 blood and urine calcium levels are summarized in the figure below:

<a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SNU7vw0ZdZcT5Cqykwx3UNYuG9mjnLcZSfr81ihTBNV7xYgZSF6eu0zC79pa3RscpTdntimFVXo1nIEPA5ftyOkRdhlIWFJoduG_gHc_jmclow_bfM7CagTqInpSYfy8vSZMF6nX18kK8tIeEFTYNsVuR0Mb_R9YFTv-dcHz9WXr846tZt1Z9YnFhtWYyWt7QQIkaRD1WJsloF76Gdn1HZpH6inhQJY6oxCjCFTK0j0Sam9QKrY8cHq1N-yDoGeRt4OaDCuW4_7JcqhRiVz9XQ=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/09f2eee6-0e25-4c52-aa4b-83674ad51af5</a>

Throughout this initial period of dose escalation, encaleret was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events and no adverse events of moderate or severe intensity reported. Two participants experienced transient, asymptomatic hypophosphatemia which was the only treatment-related adverse event. The tolerability and consistent mineral responses following encaleret administration in all six ADH1 trial participants demonstrates proof of concept that encaleret may be an efficacious therapy option for ADH1.

The Company intends to meet with regulatory health authorities in 2021 to discuss potential paths to registration prior to initiation of a Phase 3 registrational study in patients with ADH1. If the development program is successful, encaleret could be the first approved therapy option indicated specifically for the treatment of ADH1.

“A close collaboration between world-leading experts in calcium homeostasis at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research at the NIH and BridgeBio has made possible the development of encaleret for ADH1,” said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Calcilytix, an affiliate of BridgeBio that is focused on developing encaleret. “We look forward to working with regulators this year to define a potential path to approval for encaleret for the treatment of ADH1 and to exploring its potential use in patients with other forms of hypoparathyroidism.”

At ENDO 2021, BridgeBio also presented clinical study designs for the Phase 2b study of encaleret in ADH1; for its Phase 2 study of low-dose infigratinib, an FGFR1-3 inhibitor, for children with achondroplasia, the most common form of genetic short stature; and for its Phase 1/2 study of its investigational AAV5 gene therapy candidate for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases that could potentially be addressable with AAV gene therapy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., March 20, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) today announced that data from the open-label long-term extension of the Phase 3 study of 15 µg/kg dose of vosoritide was presented at an oral presentation at ENDO21, the Endocrine Society’s Annual Meeting by Professor Ravi Savarirayan, M.B., B.S., M.D., clinical investigator from the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Royal Children’s Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria. Vosoritide is an investigational, once daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for the treatment of achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans.

The data from the open-label extension presented at ENDO21 showed that children maintained an increase in Annual Growth Velocity (AGV) through the second year of continuous treatment with vosoritide.  Children who received two years of vosoritide therapy had a baseline mean AGV of 4.28 cm/year. After one year of treatment, mean AGV was 5.71 cm/year and after the second year mean AGV was 5.65 cm/year, demonstrating sustained restoration of a major portion of the growth deficit in achondroplasia through the second year of treatment. Children also had an improved height z-score, which is a measure of height relative to that of a similar population of average height.

In the children who were crossed over from placebo to vosoritide in the open-label extension arm, similar efficacy after one year was observed compared to children who received treatment with vosoritide after one year.  Children who were crossed over to treatment had a baseline mean AGV of 3.99 cm/year.  After one year of treatment, mean AGV was 5.57 cm per year.

Retention of subjects on treatment was high with 93% of patients originally randomized to receive vosoritide remaining on treatment two years later.

“This is an important extension of the original study’s findings and confirm that the benefits of vosoritide are sustained during treatment through two years,” said Savarirayan.  “While these two-year data are encouraging at showing a durable treatment effect, longer term follow-up will provide additional insights on improvements in body proportions and whether such improvements can potentially make a difference in certain aspects of a child’s life.”

“Maintaining a consistent level of growth is important because it supports that vosoritide is addressing the root cause of achondroplasia,” said Melita Irving, Clinical Geneticist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK and investigator for the vosoritide clinical program at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital. “The clinical program for vosoritide is robust and will continue to evaluate the impact on other important medical outcomes in achondroplasia through long-term evaluation. Overall, the data are encouraging, and allows us to imagine the potential for this first and only targeted precision treatment for achondroplasia.”

“We continue to take a relentless approach to advance our understanding of how vosoritide could potentially benefit children with achondroplasia, and to collect the information families and physicians will need to make informed decisions about the choice of treatment,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President, Worldwide Research and Development at BioMarin. “We are encouraged by the consistency of this data with our expectations based on the known biology of CNP effects on growth, and with earlier studies, specifically with regards to durability of effect in absence of pathological advancement of bone age. We are grateful to the children, families and investigators for participating in this study and allowing the opportunity for the scientific exchange of clinical data at medical meetings like ENDO2021.”

Vosoritide Safety

The 2-year data demonstrated that vosoritide, administered at 15ug/kg/day was generally well tolerated with no new safety findings. The majority of adverse events (AEs) were mild and no serious adverse events were reported as study drug-related.  Injection site reactions were the most common drug-related AEs, and all were transient. There were no AEs related to disproportionate bone growth or bone pathology. No clinically significant blood pressure decreases or new safety findings were observed.

Regulatory Status

In 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted and validated the marketing authorization application for vosoritide for achondroplasia. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion is expected in Europe in June of 2021. The U.S. New Drug Application (NDA) for vosoritide is under review by the FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of August 20, 2021. In the United States, the Company has chosen to provide the 2-year outcomes from the Phase 3 extension study to the FDA as additional data to convey the vosoritide treatment effect and long-term durability. The Company believes that supplying this additional data could result in a major amendment, resetting the current PDUFA target action date out three months to November.

In January 2021, the Company received notice from the FDA that the NDA for vosoritide had been granted Priority Review Designation based on the serious pediatric indication it addresses, and the lack of treatment options currently available. Consistent with FDA’s policy on changes to review classification for an ongoing application review, the PDUFA action date is not affected by this designation.  If approved, the vosoritide NDA may qualify for a Priority Review Voucher (PRV).  A PRV confers priority review to a subsequent drug application that would not otherwise qualify for that designation. The rare pediatric disease review voucher program is designed to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention or treatment of rare pediatric diseases.

Upon the acceptance of the regulatory submission for vosoritide, the Agency reiterated a position raised during the Pediatric Advisory Committee (PAC) and Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) held on May 11, 2018 recommending two-year controlled trials in different age groups.  BioMarin believes the highly persuasive outcomes from the one-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, coupled with data from the Phase 2 program with up to 5 years of long-term follow-up that has been compared to robust natural history data on growth and the updated 2-year data from the Phase 3 study, offers a rigorous and reliable method to assess whether vosoritide has a durable impact on the rate of endochondral bone growth that ultimately increases final adult height.

Vosoritide has also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. The Orphan Drug Designation program is intended to advance the evaluation and development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions.

Description of Phase 3 Extension Study

This is an ongoing open-label long-term extension study to a completed pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in children with achondroplasia. A total of 119 children were enrolled in the extension study after completion of the pre-treatment observation period and one year of treatment in the pivotal phase 3 study, and all are receiving open-label treatment with vosoritide 15 mcg/kg daily. Vosoritide is being tested in children whose growth plates are still “open.”  This is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia. The extension study is evaluating safety, AGV, and cumulative annual height gain until participants reach final adult height.  A wide range of secondary and exploratory endpoints include anthropometric measures such as height Z-score, body and limb proportionality and joint geometry; biochemical, biomarker and radiological assessments of bone growth and health; and evaluations of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), developmental status, and functional independence. These additional endpoints address the overall impact vosoritide has on achondroplasia.

About Achondroplasia

Achondroplasia, the most common form of skeletal dysplasia leading to disproportionate short stature in humans, is characterized by slowing of endochondral ossification, which results in disproportionate short stature and disordered architecture in the long bones, spine, face and base of the skull. This condition is caused by a change in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), a negative regulator of bone growth. Beyond disproportionate short stature, people with achondroplasia can experience serious health complications, including foramen magnum compression, sleep apnea, bowed legs, mid-face hypoplasia, permanent sway of the lower back, spinal stenosis and recurrent ear infections. Some of these complications can result in the need for invasive surgeries such as spinal cord decompression and straightening of bowed legs. In addition, studies show increased mortality at every age.

More than 80% of children with achondroplasia have parents of average stature and have the condition as the result of a spontaneous gene mutation. The worldwide incidence rate of achondroplasia is about one in 25,000 live births. Vosoritide is being tested in children whose growth plates are still “open”, typically those under 18 years of age. This is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia. In the U.S., Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and most of Asia Pacific, there are currently no licensed medicines for achondroplasia.

The AstraZeneca US Phase III trial of AZD1222 demonstrated statistically significant vaccine efficacy of 79% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% efficacy at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation.

This interim safety and efficacy analysis was based on 32,449 participants accruing 141 symptomatic cases of COVID-19. The trial had a 2:1 randomisation of vaccine to placebo.

Vaccine efficacy was consistent across ethnicity and age. Notably, in participants aged 65 years and over, vaccine efficacy was 80%.

The vaccine was well tolerated, and the independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) identified no safety concerns related to the vaccine. The DSMB conducted a specific review of thrombotic events, as well as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with the assistance of an independent neurologist. The DSMB found no increased risk of thrombosis or events characterised by thrombosis among the 21,583 participants receiving at least one dose of the vaccine. The specific search for CVST found no events in this trial.

Ann Falsey, Professor of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, US, and co-lead Principal Investigator for the trial, said: “These findings reconfirm previous results observed in AZD1222 trials across all adult populations but it’s exciting to see similar efficacy results in people over 65 for the first time. This analysis validates the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as a much-needed additional vaccination option, offering confidence that adults of all ages can benefit from protection against the virus.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “These results add to the growing body of evidence that shows this vaccine is well tolerated and highly effective against all severities of COVID-19 and across all age groups. We are confident this vaccine can play an important role in protecting millions of people worldwide against this lethal virus. We are preparing to submit these findings to the US Food and Drug Administration and for the rollout of millions of doses across America should the vaccine be granted US Emergency Use Authorization.”

AstraZeneca will continue to analyse the data and prepare for the primary analysis to be submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks. In parallel, the primary analysis will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Amongst participants in the interim analysis, approximately 79% were white/Caucasian, 8% black/African American, 4% native American and 4% Asian, and 22% of participants were Hispanic.

Approximately 20% of participants were 65 years and over, and approximately 60% had co-morbidities associated with an increased risk for progression of severe COVID-19, such as diabetes, severe obesity or cardiac disease.

This AstraZeneca-led US Phase III trial included two doses administered at a four week interval. Previous trials have shown that an extended interval of up to 12 weeks demonstrated greater efficacy, which was also supported by immunogenicity data. This evidence suggests administration of the second dose with an interval longer than four weeks could further increase efficacy and accelerates the number of people who can receive their first dose.

The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius or 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered without the need for preparation within existing healthcare settings.

AstraZeneca continues to engage with governments, multilateral organisations and collaborators around the world to ensure broad and equitable access to the vaccine at no profit for the duration of the pandemic.

<b>D8110C00001<sup>1
</sup></b>The US Phase III trial, called D8110C00001, was led by AstraZeneca and funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in collaboration with the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) and the Army Contracting Command, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the US National Institutes of Health. The NIAID-supported COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) participated in the trial.

D8110C00001 is a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 compared to placebo for the prevention of COVID-19, in 32,449 participants across 88 trial centres in the US, Peru and Chile. Trial participants aged 18 years or over who are healthy or have medically stable chronic diseases and are at increased risk for being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular doses of either 5 x10<sup>10</sup> viral particles of AZD1222 or saline placebo four weeks apart.

<b>AZD1222
</b>AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

In May 2020, AstraZeneca <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-advances-response-to-global-covid-19-challenge-as-it-receives-first-commitments-for-oxfords-potential-new-vaccine.html"">received</a> support of more than $1bn from BARDA for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine under an agreement with the US Department of Defense’s Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense. The Phase III D8110C00001 trial is part of this funding agreement.

The vaccine has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation or emergency use in more than 70 countries across six continents, and with the Emergency Use Listing granted by the World Health Organization this accelerates the pathway to access in up to 142 countries through the COVAX Facility.

<strong>Hamburg, Germany, 22 March 2021:</strong>
Evotec SE (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: EVT, MDAX/TecDAX, ISIN: DE0005664809) today announced that the Company has entered into a multi-RNA target alliance with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) with the goal to discover and develop RNA targeting small molecule therapeutics for highly attractive targets that are difficult to address via more conventional approaches.

Evotec and Takeda will jointly identify and develop small molecules targeting a range of RNA targets aligned with Takeda’s research and development areas. The collaboration will leverage Evotec’s extensive RNA targeting platform to optimally identify promising RNA sequences to target with small molecule ligands that can be developed into potentially first-in-class therapeutics.

Under the terms of the agreement, Evotec will receive significant research funding and will be eligible to receive discovery, pre-clinical, clinical, commercial and sales milestone payments of up to US$ 160 m per programme. Additionally, Evotec is entitled to tiered royalties on net sales of any products resulting from the collaboration.

<strong>Dr Cord Dohrmann, Chief Scientific Officer of Evotec, commented:</strong> “Many highly validated targets have proven to be intractable via conventional protein targeting approaches. For this reason, Evotec has been pioneering RNA targeting strategies and approaches for quite some time. We are very excited about the opportunity to collaborate with Takeda in this field as both companies share the vision to jointly develop small molecule therapeutics against high value RNA targets that will deliver long awaited therapeutics.”

“Takeda recognizes targeting RNA with small molecules as a promising new modality that has tremendous potential for much needed medicines for patients through modulating historically undruggable targets”<strong>, said Dr Larry Hamann, Head, Drug Discovery Sciences, Takeda.</strong> “We are excited to be working with Evotec and their impressive capabilities.”
<h5><em>About Evotec’s RNA platform</em></h5>
<em>The structure-based recognition of RNA tertiary structures by RNA-targeted small molecules (“rSM”) provides an alternative to sequence-based approaches, such as antisense oligonucleotides (“ASOs”). rSM approaches enable novel therapeutic potential by allowing to target highly conserved parts of RNA, creating pathways in cases where the encoded protein cannot be targeted conventionally, and unlocking the largely unexplored field of non-coding RNAs, which can also be disease drivers. </em>

<em>Evotec’s proprietary RNA targeting platform is specifically designed to</em>
<ol>
 	<li><em>identify RNA tertiary structural elements where rSM are able to bind with sufficient selectivity and affinity,</em></li>
 	<li><em>discover and develop suitable rSM binders that potentially deliver orally available drugs, and</em></li>
 	<li><em>identify and deliver proof-of-target engagement for disease-relevant RNA structures, allowing biologically active rSM binders. </em></li>
</ol>
<em>Evotec’s cutting-edge RNA small molecule platform builds on the well-established drug discovery routes within Evotec and combines them with novel, highly innovative technologies such as third generation sequencing, sequencing-based structure elucidation of RNA molecules, which constitute a first-class expertise in this area.</em>

Basel, 22 March 2021 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Phase III IMpower010 study evaluating Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), compared with best supportive care (BSC), met its primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) at the interim analysis. Tecentriq showed a statistically significant improvement in DFS as adjuvant therapy following surgery and chemotherapy in all randomised Stage II-IIIA populations with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The magnitude of DFS benefit was particularly pronounced in the PD-L1-positive population.

Follow-up will continue with planned analyses of DFS in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which at the time of analysis did not cross the threshold, and overall survival (OS) data, which were immature at the time of interim analysis. Safety for Tecentriq was consistent with its known safety profile and no new safety signals were identified. Results from the IMpower010 study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to health authorities globally, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.

“With these landmark results, Tecentriq has become the first cancer immunotherapy to help many people with resectable early lung cancer live longer without their cancer returning,"" said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We’re excited by the clinical benefit adjuvant Tecentriq may bring to lung cancer patients, particularly in the PD-L1-positive population. We will submit these data to regulatory authorities as soon as possible.”

Tecentriq has previously shown clinically meaningful benefit in various types of lung cancer, with five currently approved indications in markets around the world. It was the first approved cancer immunotherapy for front-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (chemotherapy). Tecentriq also has four approved indications in NSCLC as either a single agent or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies.

Furthermore, Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across different lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines, as well as studies in metastatic, adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings across various tumor types.

<strong>About the IMpower010 study
</strong>IMpower010 is a Phase III, global, multicentre, open-label, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq compared with BSC, in participants with Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (UICC 7th edition), following surgical resection and up to 4 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The study randomised 1,005 people with a ratio of 1:1 to receive either at most 16 cycles of Tecentriq or BSC. The primary endpoint is investigator-determined DFS in the PD-L1-positive Stage II-IIIA, all randomised Stage II-IIIA and ITT Stage IB-IIIA populations. Key secondary endpoints include OS in the overall study population, ITT Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC.

<strong>About NSCLC
</strong>Lung cancer is the one of the leading causes of cancer death globally.<sup>1</sup> Each year 1.8 million people die as a result of the disease; this translates into more than 4,900 deaths worldwide every day.<sup>1</sup> Lung cancer can be broadly divided into two major types: NSCLC and small cell lung cancer. NSCLC is the most prevalent type, accounting for around 85% of all cases.<sup>2</sup> NSCLC comprises non-squamous and squamous-cell lung cancer, the squamous form of which is characterised by flat cells covering the airway surface when viewed under a microscope.<sup>2</sup>

<strong>About Tecentriq</strong>
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of NSCLC, SCLC, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and for hepatocellular carcinoma. In the US, Tecentriq is also approved in combination with Cotellic® (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) for the treatment of people with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

<strong>About Roche in cancer immunotherapy</strong>
Roche’s rigorous pursuit of groundbreaking science has contributed to major therapeutic and diagnostic advances in oncology over the last 50 years, and today, realising the full potential of cancer immunotherapy is a major area of focus. With over 20 molecules in development, Roche is investigating the potential benefits of immunotherapy alone, and in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapies or other immunotherapies with the goal of providing each person with a treatment tailored to harness their own unique immune system to attack their cancer. Our scientific expertise, coupled with innovative pipeline and extensive partnerships, gives us the confidence to continue pursuing the vision of finding a cure for cancer by ensuring the right treatment for the right patient at the right time.

In addition to Roche’s approved PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), Roche’s broad cancer immunotherapy pipeline includes other checkpoint inhibitors, such as tiragolumab, a novel cancer immunotherapy designed to bind to TIGIT, individualised neoantigen therapies and T-cell bispecific antibodies.

Basel, 22 March 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the decision to discontinue dosing in the Phase III GENERATION HD1 study of tominersen in manifest Huntington’s disease (HD). The decision was based on the results of a pre-planned review of the data from the Phase III study conducted by an unblinded Independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). The iDMC made its recommendation based on the investigational therapy’s potential benefit/risk profile for study participants. No new or emerging safety signals were identified for tominersen in the review of the data from this study. Roche intends to continue following participants for safety and clinical outcomes, without the dosing of the investigational medicine or placebo. Once full data from the Phase III study are available and analysed, Roche will share learnings and future plans with the HD community.

Dosing will be paused in the open-label extension study (GEN-EXTEND) of tominersen while data are carefully analysed to inform next steps on this study.

“This is very unfortunate news to deliver on the tominersen Phase III study and we know it will be especially difficult for people with Huntington’s disease to hear. The HD community currently has no treatments to stop or slow the progression of this rare neurodegenerative disease that impacts families across generations.” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche's Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “GENERATION HD1 is the largest clinical trial in Huntington’s disease to date and we do know that the data generated will significantly advance our understanding of huntingtin-lowering as a potential treatment approach. We would like to thank all of the individuals and families participating in the study for their contribution, as well as the broader HD community for their commitment and collaboration.”

The Phase I PK/PD study (GEN-PEAK) of tominersen and the observational Roche HD Natural History Study will continue.

<strong>About tominersen and the clinical trials</strong>
Tominersen, previously IONIS-HTTRx or RG6042, is an investigational antisense therapy designed to reduce the production of all forms of the huntingtin protein (HTT), including its mutated variant, mHTT. In December 2017, Roche licensed the investigational molecule from Ionis Pharmaceuticals.

Tominersen is being investigated in HD in the following clinical studies:
<ul>
 	<li>GENERATION HD1: a randomised, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of treatment with tominersen in people with manifest HD over 25 months. Study participants were randomised to either 120 mg every-2-months or 120 mg every-4-months intrathecal injections of tominersen, or placebo. The study has recruited 791 participants from 18 countries around the world.</li>
 	<li>GEN-EXTEND: an open label extension study for participants coming from any Roche HD study. Participants receive 120mg tominersen every-2-months or every-4-months in the study.</li>
 	<li>GEN-PEAK: a Phase I study aiming to better understand the pharmacokinetics of tominersen and how tominersen affects mHTT levels and other markers in the spinal fluid and blood, which studies a range of doses from 30 mg to 120 mg of tominersen over two administrations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>About Huntington’s disease</strong>
Huntington’s disease is a rare genetic, progressive condition that causes the nerve cells in the brain to break down, causing problems with a person’s ability to think, move and function, leading to increasing disability and loss of independence. It has a devastating impact on people living with the disease, and the hereditary nature of HD means it profoundly affects entire families for generations. Survival ranges from approximately 10-20 years following motor onset of the disease. There is no known cure for HD and no approved therapies that treat the underlying cause.

ACTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 20, 2021-- Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ: PODD) (Insulet or the Company), the global leader in tubeless insulin pump technology with its Omnipod<sup>®</sup> brand of products, today announced positive results from the first pivotal trial for the Omnipod<sup>®</sup> 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System. Omnipod 5, the world’s first tubeless, wearable system that continuously adapts insulin delivery based on glucose levels and trends, significantly improved time in range and reduced HbA1c in children, adolescents, and adults, aged 6-70 years, with type 1 diabetes. The data was presented at ENDO 2021, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting and a leading forum for endocrinology research and clinical care worldwide.

“Our team has been committed to developing a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system to advance the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes,” said Trang Ly MBBS, FRACP, PhD, Insulet Senior Vice President and Medical Director. “Our pivotal study has achieved remarkable improvement in glucose control, evidenced by impressive reduction in HbA1c and improved time in range, together with the lowest rates of hypoglycemia. We are incredibly proud of these results, which demonstrate the system is safe and effective across a wide range of age groups. This is another step forward in our mission to simplify life for people with diabetes.”

<b>Omnipod 5 System Pivotal Study Overview</b>

Insulet presented its data in two groups of type 1 diabetes patients: 128 adults and adolescents between 14 and 70 years old, and 112 children age 6 to 13.9 years. The participants used the Omnipod 5 System at home for a period of 3 months after a 14-day period using their standard therapy, which included both pump therapy and multiple daily injections.

The Omnipod 5 System showed a significant increase in time in range (70-180 mg/dL) in the adults and adolescents, from 65% to 74%, or an additional 2.2 hours per day, and an overall reduction of HbA1c from 7.16% to 6.78%. Participants also saw a decrease in mean glucose from 161 to 154 mg/dL. Median time below 70 mg/dL improved from 2.0 to 1.1%. At a target glucose of 110 mg/dL, subjects achieved 76% time in range.

In children, time in range improved from 53% to 68%, corresponding to an additional 3.7 hours per day in target range. Additionally, HbA1c improved from 7.67% to 6.99% and the mean glucose level decreased from 183 to 160 mg/dL. Median time below 70 mg/dL stayed remarkably low at 1.5%.

“The daily management of type 1 diabetes is relentless,” said Jose S., father of a pediatric pivotal trial participant. “Caregivers make multiple decisions each day that profoundly affect their loved one’s wellness and safety. Insulet’s Omnipod 5 System reduces this burden by automating much of the decision making. It also provided me peace of mind by mitigating the threat of hypoglycemia.”

Assistant Professor Gregory Forlenza at Barbara Davis Center, University of Colorado and Principal Investigator agreed that Omnipod 5 makes diabetes management simpler, while improving overall clinical results for users.

“The Omnipod 5 System is phenomenal, improving diabetes outcomes for children and adults while greatly reducing the burden of diabetes management,” said Dr. Forlenza. “With the algorithm built into the Pod itself, it is easier than ever for people with diabetes to rely on automated insulin delivery to manage their blood glucose levels and keep them in range. Insulet has created a very impressive device that will surely change lives.”

Nearly all participants completed the pivotal study (98% of all participants) and virtually all of those opted to continue using the Omnipod 5 System during an extension phase of the study. The study results and participants’ desire to continue with the extension phase demonstrates their overall satisfaction with the Omnipod 5 System.

“It was remarkable how quickly every family learned to trust the automation, allowing people to sleep through the night for the first time in years,” said Professor Irl Hirsch, University of Washington. “The significant improvement in glycemic outcomes they achieved with the use of Omnipod 5, including the remarkably low rates of hypoglycemia, led to a tremendous reduction in the burden of care for so many.”

The Omnipod 5 System received breakthrough device designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is currently under review. The Company expects to launch Omnipod 5 in limited release during the first half of 2021.

<strong>Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 March 2021</strong> – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Refusal to File letter covering the label expansion application for once-weekly semaglutide 2.0 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes which was filed on 20 January 2021. A refusal to file letter is received when the FDA determines additional information is required to review a complete application.

In the letter, FDA has requested additional information including data relating to a proposed new manufacturing site. While additional information needs to be included in the resubmission, Novo Nordisk believes the already completed clinical trial programme will be sufficient for approval of the label expansion application.

Novo Nordisk expects to resubmit the application to FDA during the second quarter of 2021.

<b>REGEN-COV also significantly shortened the duration of symptoms by 4 days</b>

<b>All doses (8,000 mg, 2,400 mg and 1,200 mg) had similar efficacy across all endpoints</b>

<b>Companion dose-ranging Phase 2 trial showed significant and comparable viral reductions for all REGEN-COV doses tested, including as low as 300 mg</b>

<b>FDA recently updated U.S. EUA fact sheets for all authorized monoclonal antibody treatments, indicating that REGEN-COV is the only one to retain potency against key emerging variants</b>

<b>Regeneron will share new data with regulatory authorities immediately and request that a lower 1,200 mg dose be added to EUA</b>

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <b>REGN</b>) today announced positive topline results from the largest trial to date assessing a COVID-19 treatment in infected non-hospitalized patients (n=4,567). This definitive Phase 3 outcomes trial in high-risk non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients (""outpatients"") met its primary endpoint, showing the investigational REGEN-COV™ (casirivimab with imdevimab) significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% (1,200 mg intravenous [IV]) and 71% (2,400 mg IV) compared to placebo.

""This is a landmark moment in the fight against COVID-19 as this large well-controlled trial provides conclusive results demonstrating that REGEN-COV can dramatically reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in the outpatient setting,"" said Suraj Saggar, D.O., trial investigator and Chief of Infectious Disease at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey. ""With so many people still getting infected, as well as recent data showing that REGEN-COV addresses emerging variants, these data underscore the need to rapidly adopt REGEN-COV as standard-of-care to offer high-risk patients their best chance to reduce serious consequences like hospitalization or death.""

REGEN-COV also met all secondary endpoints in the Phase 3 outcomes trial, including the ability to reduce symptom duration. In addition, a companion Phase 2 trial showed that even the lowest doses tested (IV: 300 mg; subcutaneous [SC]: 600 mg) had significant viral load reductions over the first 7 study days, comparable to the 2,400 mg and 1,200 mg IV doses.

""With approximately 60,000 newly diagnosed individuals in the U.S. every day and 40,000 still in the hospital because of COVID-19, we are committed to working with the government, healthcare providers and others to support rapid and widespread adoption of REGEN-COV in appropriate patients,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""We will discuss the new data with regulatory authorities and request that the 1,200 mg dose be rapidly added to the U.S. Emergency Use Authorization, in order for the anticipated REGEN-COV supply to be available to treat even more patients. These Phase 3 data will also form the basis of a full Biologics License Application.""

A safety assessment was conducted on all available patient data up to day 169, and identified no new safety signals. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were largely related to COVID-19 and occurred in 1.1% of patients in the 1,200 mg group, 1.3% in the 2,400 mg group and 4.0% in the placebo group. There was 1 death in the 1,200 mg group (n=827), 1 death in the 2,400 mg group (n=1,849) and 5 deaths in the placebo groups (n=1,843).

All patients in this analysis had at least one risk factor, including obesity (58%), age ³50 years (51%) and cardiovascular disease, including hypertension (36%). Approximately 35% of patients were Latino/Hispanic, 5% were Black/African American and the median age was 50 years (range: 18-96 years).

<b>Dose-ranging Virology Trial
</b>A companion dose-ranging Phase 2 trial of 803 outpatient COVID-19 patients was conducted to evaluate the antiviral effect of several different REGEN-COV doses (IV: 2,400 mg, 1,200 mg, 600 mg and 300 mg; SC: 1,200 mg and 600 mg). All tested doses met the primary endpoint, rapidly and significantly reducing patients' viral load (log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) compared to placebo (p£0.001). Each dose demonstrated similar efficacy, including the lowest doses tested (IV: 300 mg; SC: 600 mg).

""These encouraging results confirm the rapid and significant antiviral effects of REGEN-COV, even at much lower and subcutaneous doses,"" said David Weinreich, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development at Regeneron. ""We are grateful to all patients and investigators who participated in these and other ongoing REGEN-COV trials. We will share both our Phase 3 outcomes data and our Phase 2 virology data with regulatory authorities to discuss next steps, including the possibility of utilizing lower doses and more convenient subcutaneous administration.""

Detailed results from both trials will be shared with regulatory authorities and submitted for peer review as soon as possible. REGEN-COV continues to be evaluated in clinical trials in multiple settings for COVID-19: in non-hospitalized and certain hospitalized patients, including the open-label RECOVERY trial of hospitalized patients in the UK, and a trial for the prevention of COVID-19 in household contacts of infected individuals. As of March 2021, more than 25,000 people have participated in clinical trials involving REGEN-COV.

The development and manufacturing of REGEN-COV have been funded in part with federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

The company expected to provide approximately 750,000 doses at the 2,400 mg dose level, but now anticipates being able to provide approximately 1.25 million doses if the 1,200 mg dose is added to the EUA. Due to the pandemic, many organizations are currently utilizing the same limited manufacturing resources including external fill and finish capacity, and this may impact the timing of final delivery of doses. The government is obligated to purchase all finished doses supplied by June 30, 2021, up to 1.25 million doses total, and may accept doses after this date at its discretion.

Roche, which is responsible for REGEN-COV outside the U.S., continues to work with the European Medicines Agency, governments and other health authorities across the globe to bring this antibody cocktail to as many patients as possible.

<b>About the REGEN-COV Antibody Cocktail
</b>REGEN-COV (casirivimab with imdevimab) is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987) that was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, using Regeneron's proprietary <i>VelocImmune<sup>®</sup></i> and <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup></i> technologies. The two potent, virus-neutralizing antibodies that form the cocktail bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus's spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in <i><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3105488-1&amp;h=1690775003&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3048827-1%26h%3D293747952%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Finvestor.regeneron.com%252Fnews-releases%252Fnews-release-details%252Ftwo-science-publications-highlight-potential-regn-cov2-anti%26a%3DScience&amp;a=Science"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Science</a></i>.

If an infusion-related reaction occurs, consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>Clinical Worsening After REGEN-COV Administration</b>: Clinical worsening of COVID-19 after administration of REGEN-COV has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever, hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty, arrythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia), fatigue, and altered mental status. Some of these events required hospitalization. It is not known if these events were related to REGEN-COV use or were due to progression of COVID-19.</li>
 	<li><b>Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID-19:</b> Benefit of treatment with REGEN-COV has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as REGEN-COV, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Therefore, REGEN-COV is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID-19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non-COVID-19 related comorbidity.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Adverse Reactions</u></b><b>:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 4 (1.6%) patients in REGEN-COV 2,400 mg group, 2 (0.8%) patients in REGEN-COV 8,000 mg group and 6 (2.3%) patients in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were considered to be related to study drug. SAEs that were reported as Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were pneumonia, hyperglycemia, nausea and vomiting (2,400 mg REGEN-COV), intestinal obstruction and dyspnea (8,000 mg REGEN-COV) and COVID-19, pneumonia and hypoxia (placebo). <b>REGEN-COV is</b><b> not authorized at the 8,000 mg dose (4,000 mg casirivimab and 4,000 mg imdevimab).</b></li>
 	<li>One anaphylactic reaction was reported in the clinical program. The event began within 1 hour of completion of the infusion, and required treatment including epinephrine. The event resolved.

Basel, 23 March 2021 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today the launch of eight new configurations for <strong>cobas pro</strong> integrated solutions, in countries accepting the CE mark. As a result, this analyser can deliver up to 4,400 tests per hour, doubling its previous testing capacity.<sup>1</sup> This makes it the ideal choice for labs seeking greater flexibility in ramping up their testing capacity, to adapt to evolving clinical chemistry and immunochemistry testing needs.

Today, the importance of accurate and timely diagnostic testing can be felt across the globe. Growing testing demands put laboratories under significant pressure to increase their testing volumes and operational efficiency, with fewer resources. At the same time, clinicians and patients rely on accurate and timely results to make informed decisions. To overcome these challenges, labs require reliable diagnostic solutions that ensure simplified testing, allowing for earlier diagnosis and improved patient care.

“We are excited to release eight new high throughput configurations for <strong>cobas pro</strong> integrated solutions which have been designed to address the individual needs of healthcare professionals to maximise throughput and efficiency,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “By building on a system with proven reliability and performance, we continue to simplify laboratory operations so that patients can benefit from shorter time to results and faster treatment decisions.”

<strong>cobas pro</strong> integrated solutions now offers the possibility to add two additional analytical units of <strong>cobas c</strong> 503 and/or <strong>cobas e</strong> 801, consolidating up to four analytical units on a single platform and thus serving the needs of high throughput labs.<sup>1</sup> Labs can now benefit from eight new configurations, allowing them to better tailor their instrumentation to their individual needs.<sup>1</sup> As a result, <strong>cobas pro</strong> integrated solutions can deliver up to 4,400 tests per hour, doubling its previous testing capacity.<sup>1</sup> Running more tests across a broad range of disease areas including cardiology, oncology and infectious diseases, enables labs to further extend their value for physicians and patients. Furthermore, by consolidating a greater number of samples on a single platform and offering the industry’s broadest clinical chemistry and immunochemistry assay menu of over 230 diagnostic tests, this analyser helps to simplify sample processing and laboratory workflows.<sup>2-4</sup>

<strong>About cobas pro integrated solutions
</strong>Launched in 2018, <strong>cobas pro</strong> integrated solutions is a scalable and modular solution designed to achieve mid-to-high volume clinical chemistry and immunochemistry testing needs. It aims to increase efficiency with fast analytical units, intelligent sample routing, and short assay incubation times, with 93% of Roche immunoassays having reaction times of 18 minutes or less.<sup>5</sup> This analyser features automated maintenance and <strong>cobas</strong>® AutoCal, an automated calibration procedure, to save hands-on time. Additionally, it incorporates <strong>cobas</strong>® SonicWash, an ultrasonic probe cleaning to ensure sample integrity.

<strong>cobas pro</strong> integrated solutions provides fully standardised results and operation to <strong>cobas</strong>® <strong>pure </strong>integrated solutions. Together, they deliver a seamless experience and the highest level of standardisation using the same reagents and assay menu, delivering consistent results and operation, and therefore allow for flexible staff assignment and minimal training needs. It makes these systems also ideal candidates for integrated health networks and lab chains.

<strong>cobas pro</strong> integrated solutions is fully compatible with the <strong>cobas</strong>® <strong>mobile</strong> solution, a tablet that integrates multiple Roche applications, allowing laboratory professionals to interact with the analyser from anywhere in the lab.

With <strong>cobas pro</strong> integrated solutions, the required sample volume per test has been reduced on average by 43% compared to previous generation systems.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, the plastic generated per test result has been reduced by up to 78% due to smaller reagent pack sizes with a higher number of tests per pack.<sup>7</sup>

<p align=""justify""><em>Copenhagen, DK and Boston, MA, U.S. March 22, 2021 – </em>Zealand Pharma A/S (Nasdaq: ZEAL) (CVR-no. 20045078,) a biotechnology company aspiring to deliver innovation with novel peptide therapeutics, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Zegalogue<sup>® </sup>(dasiglucagon) injection for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes aged 6 years and above.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This approval will help enable appropriate children and adults with diabetes to be able to address sudden and severe hypoglycemia, which can quickly progress from a mild event to an emergency,” said Dr. Jeremy Pettus, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of California San Diego. “The magnitude and consistency of effect seen in the Phase 3 pivotal studies is clinically meaningful as minutes matter in severe hypoglycemia. Zegalogue provided resolution of severe hypoglycemia following administration, with a median time to blood glucose recovery of 10 minutes across these clinical studies.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Severe hypoglycemia is an acute, life-threatening condition resulting from a critical drop in blood glucose levels associated primarily with insulin therapy and is one of the most feared complications of diabetes treatment<sup>1</sup>. Children with diabetes on insulin are particularly affected, with 7 out 100 children up to the age of 18 reporting severe hypoglycemia in the previous 6 months<sup>2</sup>. While patients have the ability to monitor and adjust their blood glucose levels to remain in proper glycemic control, it’s not always possible to prevent a severe hypoglycemic event.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The U.S. FDA approval of Zegalogue is an exciting achievement for both patients and Zealand,” said Emmanuel Dulac, President and CEO of Zealand Pharma. “We would like to thank the trial participants, their families and caregivers, the investigators and their staff, and our employees who made the Zegalogue clinical studies and this resulting approval possible. We are committed to helping people with diabetes manage the potential consequences of their disease and look forward to making Zegalogue available in the U.S. in June.  Field sales, market access and medical teams, along with comprehensive patient support services, are in place to maximize awareness to healthcare providers and preparedness to patients affected by severe hypoglycemia.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The FDA approval was based on efficacy results from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter Phase 3 studies of Zegalogue in children aged 6 to 17 and in adults with type 1 diabetes. The primary efficacy endpoint for all three studies was time to plasma glucose recovery (treatment success), defined as an increase in blood glucose of =20 mg/dL from time of administration, without additional intervention within 45 minutes. The primary endpoint was successfully achieved across the adult and pediatric studies with a significantly faster median time to blood glucose recovery of only 10 minutes following Zegalogue administration compared to 30-45 minutes placebo. In the main Phase 3 adult trial 99% of patients recovered within 15 minutes.</p>
In these studies, the most common adverse events reported (=2%) were nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, and injection site pain in adults; and nausea, vomiting, headache, and injection site pain in pediatrics.

<p align=""justify""><strong>INDICATION</strong>
ZEGALOGUE (dasiglucagon) injection is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes aged 6 years and above.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
ZEGALOGUE is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because of the risk of substantial increase in blood pressure and in patients with insulinoma because of the risk of hypoglycemia.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Warnings and Precautions</strong>
ZEGALOGUE is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because glucagon products may stimulate the release of catecholamines from the tumor. If the patient develops a substantial increase in blood pressure and a previously undiagnosed pheochromocytoma is suspected, 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate, administered intravenously, has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In patients with insulinoma, administration of glucagon products may produce an initial increase in blood glucose; however, ZEGALOGUE administration may directly or indirectly (through an initial rise in blood glucose) stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycemia. ZEGALOGUE is contraindicated in patients with insulinoma. If a patient develops symptoms of hypoglycemia after a dose of ZEGALOGUE, give glucose orally or intravenously.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Allergic reactions have been reported with glucagon products; these include generalized rash, and in some cases anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties and hypotension. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions.</p>
<p align=""justify"">ZEGALOGUE is effective in treating hypoglycemia only if sufficient hepatic glycogen is present. Patients in states of starvation, with adrenal insufficiency or chronic hypoglycemia may not have adequate levels of hepatic glycogen for ZEGALOGUE administration to be effective. Patients with these conditions should be treated with glucose.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Adverse Reactions</strong>
The most common adverse reactions (=2%) associated with ZEGALOGUE in adults were nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea and injection site pain; in pediatrics: nausea, vomiting, headache and injection site pain.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Drug Interactions</strong>
Patients taking beta-blockers may have a transient increase in pulse and blood pressure when given ZEGALOGUE. In patients taking indomethacin, ZEGALOGUE may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or may produce hypoglycemia. ZEGALOGUE may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.</p>

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved Pemazyre<sup>®</sup> (pemigatinib), a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer (BTC) with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion gene<sup>1</sup>, worsening after cancer chemotherapy.

“The MHLW approval of Pemazyre is an important milestone for the BTC community, and underscores our commitment to finding and delivering solutions for patients with significant unmet medical needs,” said Lothar Finke, M.D., Ph.D., General Manager, Incyte Asia. “BTC is a rare and serious condition, and we are proud that with the support of the MHLW we will be able to bring a new targeted treatment to more patients around the world.”

BTC is a rare cancer that forms in the bile duct. Cholangiocarcinoma, a subtype of BTC, is classified based on its origin: intrahepatic, which occurs in the bile duct inside the liver and extrahepatic, which occurs in the bile duct outside the liver. Patients with BTC are often diagnosed at a late or advanced stage when the prognosis is poor<sup>2,3</sup>. FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, which occur almost exclusively in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, are observed in a small percentage of Japanese patients with BTC<sup>4,5,6,7</sup>.

The approval is based on data from the FIGHT-202 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of pemigatinib in adult patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with documented FGF/FGFR status. In FIGHT-202 patients harboring FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements (Cohort A), Pemazyre monotherapy resulted in an overall response rate of 36% (primary endpoint), and median DOR of 7.49 months (secondary endpoint). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) were grade =2 hyperphosphatemia (58.2%). Other frequent TEAEs (all grades) observed in =30% of patients were alopecia, diarrhea, fatigue, dysgeusia, nausea, constipation, stomatitis, dry mouth and decreased appetite. The majority of these TEAEs were grade =2. The TEAE with grade =3 that occurred in =10% of patients was hypophosphatemia.

Previously, the MHLW granted Orphan Drug Designation for Pemazyre – a designation granted to investigational compounds intended to treat rare diseases that affect fewer than 50,000 people in Japan, and for which there is a high medical need<sup>8</sup>. Designated orphan drugs are eligible for priority review for marketing authorizations to ensure supply to clinical settings at the earliest opportunity<sup>8</sup>.

<b>About FIGHT-202</b>

The FIGHT-202 Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study (NCT02924376) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of pemigatinib – a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 inhibitor – in adult (age = 18 years) patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with documented FGF/FGFR status.

Patients were enrolled into one of three cohorts – Cohort A (FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements), Cohort B (other FGF/FGFR genetic alterations) or Cohort C (no FGF/FGFR genetic alterations). All patients received 13.5 mg pemigatinib orally once daily (QD) on a 21-day cycle (two weeks on/one week off) until radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The primary endpoint of FIGHT-202 is overall response rate (ORR) in Cohort A, assessed by independent review per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints include ORR; progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety in all cohorts.

<b>About Pemazyre<sup>®</sup> (pemigatinib)</b>

Pemazyre is a kinase inhibitor indicated in the United States for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test<sup>9</sup>. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

In Japan, Pemazyre is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer (BTC) with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion gene, worsening after cancer chemotherapy.

Pemazyre is a potent, selective, oral inhibitor of FGFR isoforms 1, 2 and 3 which, in preclinical studies, has demonstrated selective pharmacologic activity against cancer cells with FGFR alterations.

Pemazyre is marketed by Incyte in the United States and will be marketed by Incyte in Japan. Incyte has granted Innovent Biologics, Inc. rights to develop and commercialize pemigatinib in hematology and oncology in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Incyte has retained all other rights to develop and commercialize pemigatinib outside of the United States.

Additionally, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion recommending the conditional marketing authorization of pemigatinib for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.

Pemazyre is a trademark of Incyte Corporation.

<span class=""xn-location"">WALTHAM, Mass.</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">DENVER</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 23, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --<b> </b>Fresenius Medical Care North America (FMCNA) and <span class=""xn-person"">DaVita Kidney Care</span> today announced an expanded agreement to provide home dialysis technology—including NxStage home hemodialysis (HHD) machines, dialysis supplies, and a connected health platform—to DaVita patients across <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. The agreement supports both companies' goals to empower more patients to choose home dialysis, which can provide a higher quality of life for people living with chronic kidney failure*<sup>1</sup>.

""For patients choosing home dialysis, it can mean more freedom and also active participation in their care, which is why we're always looking for new solutions that ease the burden on our patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Keith Hartman</span>, group vice president for DaVita home modalities. ""We're expanding our use of NxStage home hemodialysis machines that have invaluable remote capabilities and connectivity for our patients. By transmitting treatment information, we hope to help identify irregularities and prevent avoidable complications, thus supporting patients' desire to stay on their treatment of choice longer.""

""We are excited to expand our longstanding collaboration with DaVita to help more patients benefit from the portability, dependability, and flexibility of our NxStage home machines, which are designed to be easy to use,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Joe Turk</span>, president of Home and Critical Care Therapies for FMCNA. ""Our HHD technology is bringing home dialysis to more patients than ever before, aligning both with evidence supporting dialysis at home as well as the recently-confirmed Medicare programs to accelerate home adoption.""

This agreement also allows patients to access Nx2me Connected Health, a state-of-the-art connected health platform that simplifies collection and sharing of treatment information with the dialysis clinic and care team. Nx2me Connected Health accesses treatment information directly from the HHD machine; including weight, blood pressure, and temperature via Bluetooth; and medication taken, notes, and answers to health assessment questions as entered by patients.

""Home hemodialysis can be a fantastic clinical option for many patients while also better aligning with their lifestyles,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Martin Schreiber</span>, chief medical officer for DaVita home modalities. ""We're committed to bringing innovative solutions that build on our prior advancements and can help further transform our patients' experience while treating at home.""

The NxStage home hemodialysis machines from Fresenius Medical Care are the first and only truly portable hemodialysis systems cleared for home use in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, including solo hemodialysis** during waking hours and nocturnal hemodialysis while both the patient and care partner sleep. Its small size offers greater flexibility to patients interested in traveling, as they can more easily bring their treatment supplies with them. The machine uses the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3104813-1&amp;h=1317956617&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nxstage.com%2Fhcp%2Fproducts%2Fpureflow-sl%2F&amp;a=PureFlow+SL"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">PureFlow SL</a> to create dialysate using a combination of purified tap water and concentrated dialysate. The NxStage HHD machine can also be used with bagged dialysate – a practical option for situations when clean water supply is not available, and during travel.

Offering a convenient, connected, and confident experience for patients is at the core of DaVita's home dialysis program. As a pioneer in the kidney care community, DaVita offers a range of innovative solutions to meet patient needs at every stage and setting in their care journey, ensuring seamless continuity of care through life's changes. By coupling comprehensive patient education platforms with personalized care plans, DaVita supports patients' efforts to remain healthy and on their modality of choice, where they're able to lead their best possible lives.

BAGSVÆRD, <span class=""xn-location"">Denmark</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 23, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- New results from the STEP phase 3a clinical trial programme demonstrated weight loss with investigational treatment of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo. In the STEP 4 trial, study participants who reached the maintenance dose of semaglutide 2.4 mg during a 20-week run-in period were randomised to either continue treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg or switch to placebo for 48 weeks.<sup>(1)</sup> The full results of the STEP 4 trial were presented today at the virtual Endocrine Society (ENDO) 2021 Annual Meeting and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

""For people with obesity, maintaining weight loss in the long term is challenging as both physiological and hormonal changes that occur following an initial weight loss can lead to weight regain. These changes, known as metabolic adaptation, result in lasting increased levels of hunger and desire to eat while reducing energy expenditure,"" said Dr <span class=""xn-person"">Domenica Rubino</span>, lead investigator of the STEP 4 trial and Director of Washington Center for Weight Management and Research. ""Like any other chronic disease, obesity requires a long-term, individualised approach to care, inclusive of medication and lifestyle components.""

Following the 20-week run-in period, people who continued treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg for an additional 48 weeks continued to lose weight with a statistically significant additional mean weight loss of 7.9% <sup>(1)</sup> (8.8% for the trial product estimand <sup>(2)</sup>) from week 20 to week 68. People who were switched to placebo following the 20-week run-in period regained 6.9% <sup>(1) </sup>of their body weight from week 20 to 68 (6.5% for the trial product estimand <sup>(2)</sup>). The estimated treatment difference [ETD] for the treatment policy estimand was -14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -16.0, -13.5; p&lt;0.0001). People who stayed on semaglutide 2.4 mg throughout the entire 68-week trial achieved a total weight loss of 17.4% <sup>(1)</sup> (18.2% for the trial product estimand <sup>(2)</sup>). Both treatment groups followed a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity programme throughout the study.<sup>(1)</sup>

""Obesity is a chronic disease that requires ongoing management and the results from STEP 4 trial strengthens the evidence around the potential of semaglutide 2.4 mg to transform the medical management of obesity,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Martin Holst Lange</span>, executive vice president, Development at Novo Nordisk. ""Millions of people living with obesity are in need of additional treatment options to help them lose weight and keep it off. The results from STEP 4 show that to sustain weight loss it is important to maintain treatment and that semaglutide 2.4 mg has the potential to offer sustained weight loss of more than 17% after 68 weeks of treatment.""

The semaglutide 2.4 mg safety profile is in line with observations seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists. It is generally well-tolerated, and the most common adverse events among people treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg were gastrointestinal events.<sup>(1)</sup>

<b>About STEP 4 and the STEP clinical trial programme</b>

STEP 4 was a 68-week phase 3a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial that compared the safety and efficacy of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo on change in body weight. The trial was designed to assess the effect of continuing versus discontinuing semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with obesity (BMI 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), or overweight (BMI 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with at least one weight-related comorbidity and without type 2 diabetes (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;6.5%). During the 20-week run-in period (Week 0 to Week 20), participants were treated with semaglutide (16 weeks escalation, followed by 4 weeks at the target dose) as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention (–500 kcal/day diet together with 150 minutes/week of physical activity). Following the run-in period, the 803 people who reached the maintenance dose of semaglutide (2.4 mg) reduced their mean body weight from 107.2 kg (Week 0) to 96.1 kg (Week 20) and were randomised (in a 2:1 ratio) to continue treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg or switch to placebo for a further 48 weeks (Week 20 to Week 68) with lifestyle intervention.<sup>(2)</sup>

The primary endpoint of the trial was the percentage change in body weight from randomisation (Week 20) to the end of treatment (Week 68). Confirmatory secondary endpoints included change in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning score on the 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36), assessed from randomisation (Week 20) to the end of treatment (Week 68). Supportive secondary endpoints included percent change in body weight from baseline (Week 0) to the end of treatment (Week 68).<sup>(2) </sup>

STEP (<b>S</b>emaglutide <b>T</b>reatment <b>E</b>ffect in <b>P</b>eople with obesity) is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3a programme consists of four trials and has enrolled approximately 4,500 adults with overweight or obesity.<sup>(3)</sup>

<b>About subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management</b>

Once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg is under investigation for chronic weight management and not yet approved for people with obesity. It is currently under regulatory review in several countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Semaglutide is an analogue of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone, with 94% similarity to the native human GLP-1 molecule. <sup>(4,5)</sup>  It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their food cravings.<sup>(4)</sup>

<b>About obesity</b>

Obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management.<sup>(6,7)</sup> It is associated with many serious health complications and decreased life expectancy.<sup>(8,9) </sup>Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes,<sup>(7)</sup> heart disease,<sup>(7)</sup> obstructive sleep apnoea,<sup>(10)</sup> non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<sup>(11)</sup> and certain types of cancer.<sup>(12)</sup> The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that obesity also increases the risk for severe illness and hospitalisation due to COVID-19.<sup>(13,14) </sup>

The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. In 2016, 13% of adults, or approximately 650 million adults, were living with obesity worldwide.<sup>(15) </sup>

<b>Berlin, March 23, 2021 </b>– Bayer announced today that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) has granted marketing authorization for larotrectinib, under the brand name Vitrakvi™, for the treatment of Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (<i>NTRK</i>) fusion-positive advanced or recurrent solid tumors. Vitrakvi is a highly selective TRK inhibitor exclusively designed to treat tumors that have an <i>NTRK</i> gene fusion. Vitrakvi has demonstrated high response rates, durable responses and a favorable safety profile in adults and children with TRK fusion cancer. For those patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors and with CNS metastases, responses and a high disease control rate have been observed. It is already approved in the U.S., countries of the European Union (EU), the UK and other markets around the world.

“There remains a high unmet need for new and innovative cancer treatments in Japan. The approval of Vitrakvi marks an important step towards treating TRK fusion cancer based on the oncogenic driver rather than the site or origin in the body,” said Makoto Tahara, MD., Ph.D. Chief, Department of Head and Neck Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East. “Clinicians now have the option to replace less tailored treatment approaches with a precision oncology treatment specifically designed to treat patients with TRK fusion cancer.”

The marketing authorization of Vitrakvi follows the approval of the expanded use of FoundationOne<sup>®</sup>CDx, a comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) test, in Japan for use as a companion diagnostic (CDx) to identify patients with TRK fusion cancer who are expected to benefit from treatment with Vitrakvi. The CDx approval is part of the global collaboration between Bayer and Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI), for which Chugai is the local development partner of FMI.

“Treatments that directly address the genomic abnormality driving tumor growth, such as Vitrakvi, can provide value to patients and physicians in Japan with the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes regardless of tumor type or patient age,” said Scott Z. Fields, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development at Bayer's Pharmaceutical Division. “This approval further underscores the importance of high quality and accessible genomic testing to allow more precise identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from a treatment specifically designed to treat tumors with an <i>NTRK</i> gene fusion. It supports clinicians to get the right treatment, that is efficacious and has a favorable safety profile, to the right patient at the right time.”

The approval of Vitrakvi in Japan is based on data from 125 patients from the Phase II NAVIGATE trial in adult and adolescent patients and the Phase I/II pediatric SCOUT trial. Results analyzed from the NAVIGATE trial population showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 65.2% with a complete response (CR) rate of 16.9% and in SCOUT an ORR of 88.9% with a CR rate of 22.2%. Larotrectinib showed a favorable safety profile based on the safety data from 116 patients in the NAVIGATE trial and 73 patients in the SCOUT trial.

TRK fusion cancer is rare overall, affecting both children and adults and occurs in varying frequencies across various tumor types. TRK fusion cancer occurs when an <i>NTRK</i> gene fuses with another unrelated gene, producing an altered TRK protein. The altered protein, or TRK fusion protein, becomes constitutively active or overexpressed, triggering a signaling cascade. These TRK fusion proteins act as oncogenic drivers that fuel the spread and growth of the patients’ cancer, regardless of where it originates in the body. Vitrakvi, an oral, highly selective TRK inhibitor, was investigated in clinical trials across multiple different histologies of solid tumors including lung and thyroid cancer, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, colon and breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, salivary gland cancer and infantile fibrosarcoma. It has shown remarkable efficacy and tolerability across tumor types regardless of patient age in clinical trials with a follow-up time of more than three years in adults and children with TRK fusion cancer, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

<b>About Vitrakvi™ (Larotrectinib)</b>
Vitrakvi™ (larotrectinib), a highly selective TRK inhibitor, was exclusively designed to treat tumors that have a <i>NTRK</i> gene fusion. The compound has demonstrated high response rates and durable responses over three years in adults and children with TRK fusion cancer, including responses and a high disease control rate in central nervous system (CNS) tumors. It has the largest dataset and longest follow-up data of any TRK inhibitor. The dataset of 159 patients was published in The Lancet Oncology and additional updates were presented at the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020.

Vitrakvi is approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., countries of the European Union (EU), the UK and other markets around the world. Additional filings in other regions are underway or planned.

Following the acquisition of Loxo Oncology by Eli Lilly and Company in February 2019, Bayer now possesses the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize larotrectinib worldwide, and also has exclusive rights to the investigational TRK inhibitor selitrectinib (BAY 2731954) which is currently in clinical development.

Positive high-level results from the primary analysis of the Phase III trial of AZD1222 in the US have confirmed vaccine efficacy consistent with the pre-specified interim analysis announced on Monday 22 March 2021.

These results have been presented to the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. The primary analysis is pre-specified in the protocol and will be the basis for a regulatory submission for Emergency Use Authorization to the US Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks.

This primary efficacy analysis included the accrual of 190 symptomatic cases of COVID-19 from the 32,449 trial participants, an additional 49 cases to the previously announced interim analysis. Participants were randomised on a 2:1 ratio between the vaccine and placebo group.

The primary endpoint, vaccine efficacy at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 was 76% (confidence interval (CI): 68% to 82%) occurring 15 days or more after receiving two doses given four weeks apart. In addition, results were comparable across age groups, with vaccine efficacy of 85% (CI: 58% to 95%) in adults 65 years and older. A key secondary endpoint, preventing severe or critical disease and hospitalisation, demonstrated 100% efficacy. There were eight cases of severe COVID-19 observed in the primary analysis with all of those cases in the placebo group.

The vaccine was well tolerated, and no safety concerns related to the vaccine were identified.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “The primary analysis is consistent with our previously released interim analysis, and confirms that our COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in adults, including those aged 65 years and over. We look forward to filing our regulatory submission for Emergency Use Authorization in the US and preparing for the rollout of millions of doses across America.”

There were 190 cases in the primary analysis. There are 14 additional possible or probable cases to be adjudicated so the total number of cases and the point estimate may fluctuate slightly.

AstraZeneca will also submit the primary analysis for peer-reviewed publication in the coming weeks.

<b>D8110C00001<sup>1
</sup></b>The US Phase III trial, called D8110C00001, was led by AstraZeneca and funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in collaboration with the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) and the Army Contracting Command, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the US National Institutes of Health. The NIAID-supported COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) participated in the trial.

D8110C00001 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre Phase III trial assessing the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 compared to placebo for the prevention of COVID-19, in 32,449 participants across 88 trial centres in the US, Peru and Chile. Trial participants aged 18 years or over who are healthy or have medically stable chronic diseases and are at increased risk for being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular doses of either 5 x10<sup>10</sup> viral particles of AZD1222 or saline placebo four weeks apart.

The pre-specified statistical analysis plan required at least 75 adjudicated cases at interim analysis, and at least 150 adjudicated cases at primary analysis.

<b>AZD1222
</b>AZD1222 was co-invented by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.

In May 2020, AstraZeneca <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-advances-response-to-global-covid-19-challenge-as-it-receives-first-commitments-for-oxfords-potential-new-vaccine.html"">received</a> support of more than $1bn from BARDA for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine under an agreement with the US Department of Defense’s Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense. The Phase III D8110C00001 trial is part of this funding agreement.

The vaccine has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation or emergency use in more than 70 countries across six continents, and with the Emergency Use Listing granted by the World Health Organization this accelerates the pathway to access in up to 142 countries through the COVAX Facility.

TOKYO, March 23, 2021 -- Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced today that it obtained approval from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the anticancer agent/antimicrotubule binding anti-CD79b monoclonal antibody Polivy<sup>®</sup> intravenous infusion 30mg and 140mg [generic name: polatuzumab vedotin (genetical recombination)] in combination with bendamustine (freeze-dried formulation) and rituximab (BR therapy) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

“I am very pleased that Polivy in combination with BR therapy now can be offered to patients as a new treatment option for R/R DLBCL, a disease with high unmet medical needs, in the hematologic cancer field following Rituxan<sup>®</sup> and Gazyva<sup>®</sup>,” said Chugai’s President and CEO Dr. Osamu Okuda. “We are preparing to bring this first-in-class anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to patients so that we may contribute to realize a better treatment.”

The approval is based on data including the results from a multicenter overseas phase Ib/II clinical study (GO29365) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Polivy in combination with BR therapy compared to BR therapy alone, and a multicenter, single-arm Japanese phase II study (JO40762/P-DRIVE study) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in R/R DLBCL.

The efficacy and safety of Polivy and BR therapy (40 patients) compared with BR therapy alone (40 patients) was studied in the randomized phase II part of the GO29365 study in 80 patients with R/R DLBCL not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The primary endpoint of the complete response rate (CRR) at the time point of primary response assessment (PRA; 6 to 8 weeks after last dose of Polivy) as evaluated by an independent assessment committee using positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was 40% (16/40 patients; 95% CI: 24.9-56.7%) in the Polivy + BR therapy group, and 17.5% (7/40 patients; 95% CI: 7.3-32.8%) in the BR therapy group (data cut-off: April 30, 2018). Adverse reactions occurred in 36 (92.3%) patients out of 39 patients who received Polivy. The most common adverse reactions were neutropenia 53.8% (21/39 patients), thrombocytopenia 41.0% (16/39 patients), diarrhea and anemia 33.3% (13/39 patients) each, fatigue and nausea 23.1% (9/39 patients) each, and pyrexia and peripheral neuropathy 20.5% (8/39 patients) each.

In the P-DRIVE study, the efficacy and safety of Polivy + BR therapy were studied in 35 patients with R/R DLBCL not eligible for ASCT. The primary endpoint of the CRR at the PRA as assessed by the principal investigator using PET-CT was 34.3% (12/35 patients), (95% CI: 19.1-52.2%) (data cut-off: December 24, 2019). Adverse reactions occurred in 33 (94.3%) patients out of 35 patients who received Polivy. The most common adverse reactions were anemia 37.1% (13/35 patients), nausea 31.4% (11/35 patients), thrombocytopenia and neutropenia 25.7% (9/35 patients) each, constipation, decreased platelet count and decreased neutrophil count 22.9% (8/35 patients) each, and malaise and decreased appetite 20.0% (7/35 patients) each.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled global phase III study (GO39942/POLARIX study) is ongoing for untreated DLBCL to compare the efficacy and safety of Polivy in combination with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisolone (R-CHP) to rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone (R-CHOP).

<strong>About polatuzumab vedotin</strong>
Polatuzumab vedotin was developed by Roche using Seattle Genetics’ ADC technology. It is a first-in-class anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), comprising the anti-CD79b humanized monoclonal antibody and a tubulin polymerization inhibitor attached together using a linker. The CD79b protein is expressed specifically in the majority of B-cells, making it a promising target for the development of new therapies<sup>2,3)</sup>. Polatuzumab vedotin binds to CD79b and destroys these B-cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent, which is thought to suppress the effects on normal cells<sup>4,5)</sup>. Polatuzumab vedotin was granted accelerated approval in the US in June 2019 and conditional marketing authorization in the EU in January 2020, respectively.

<strong>About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)</strong>
DLBCL is one of the histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), which is categorized as an aggressive disease that progresses on a monthly basis. DLBCL is the most common form of NHL, accounting for 30-40 percent of NHL<sup>6-8)</sup>. DLBCL frequently occurs in middle-aged and older people, mainly in their 60’s<sup>9)</sup>. The median age at diagnosis has been reported to be 64<sup>10)</sup>.

The combination of rituximab and chemotherapy is the standard therapy for untreated DLBCL; however, recurrence has been observed in about 40% of patients due to insufficient therapeutic effect<sup>11)</sup>. In addition, although autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is recommended for eligible patients with recurrent or refractory DLBCL, ASCT cannot be performed in about half of these patients due to failure of salvage chemotherapy prior to ASCT<sup>12)</sup>. Furthermore, no standard therapy has been established for patients ineligible for ASCT due to reasons including age or complications<sup>13)</sup>. Therefore, more useful new treatment options for relapsed or refractory DLBCL are in great need.

Salvage chemotherapy: Salvage chemotherapy or salvage therapy is used to treat patients with hematologic malignancy who experienced no therapeutic effects (refractory), or recurrence/relapse of the disease. Applicable treatment may vary depending on the type of cancer. Combination therapies of multiple drugs including anticancer agents<sup>14)</sup> are generally used.

57744,"EirGenix Report Results of EG12014 (biosimilar, trastuzumab) in P-III Trial for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer","TAIPEI, March 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — In a press conference today, EirGenix, Inc. (6589.TT) announced that the Phase III clinical trial (Trial No.: EGC002, NCT03433313) of its breast cancer biosimilar, EG12014 (proposed trastuzumab biosimilar, also called EGI014), has met its primary endpoint. EG12014 has shown equivalent efficacy to Herceptin® in regards to its clinical response (pathologic complete response, pCR), in addition to demonstrating a comparable safety profile. EirGenix will proceed with the preparations for submissions of Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA, Market Approval Application (MAA) to European Medicines Agency (EMA) and New Drug Application to TFDA, exact timings remain confidential.
 
 This phase III clinical trial is a multi-national, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded study involving female with early, HER2-positive breast cancer. The purpose of the trial was to demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence in terms of efficacy between EG12014 to Herceptin®, and to compare the safety, immunogenicity and PK between the two trastuzumab products. A total of 807 enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two parallel treatment groups and received anthracycline-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 12 weeks (cycle 1 to 4). After chemotherapy, patients received EG12014 or Herceptin® in combination with paclitaxel, every 3 weeks for 12 weeks (cycle 5 to 8). All patients were scheduled for tumor removal surgery (breast and axillary lymph nodes) 3 to 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy (pre-operative treatment). Two (2) to 6 weeks after surgery, eligible patients continued with trastuzumab therapy in the adjuvant study to complete 12 months of overall trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant cycle 1 to 13), followed by a 20-week long-term safety follow-up (after final dose of trastuzumab).
 
 During tumor removal surgery, samples were collected for assessment of a pathologic complete response (pCR) by an independent central laboratory. The primary endpoint of pCR is defined as absence of invasive cancer in the breast and axillary nodes, irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ (ypT0/is ypN0). Demonstration of therapeutic equivalence in regards to the pCR between the two treatment groups (EG12014 vs Herceptin®) in the pre-operative treatment setting was based on the pre-specified risk ratio (0.741 – 1.349) and probability difference (-0.13 – 0.13). The topline results demonstrated that EG12014 met equivalence to Herceptin® in terms of clinical response in both analysis populations (per-protocol and full-analysis sets). Additionally, the safety profiles of the two treatment arms were shown to be comparable in the pre-operative treatment setting.
 
 According to Roche’s annual report, global sales of Herceptin® totaled 3.73 billion CHF in 2020. The US and EU market are 1.36 billion CHF and 0.67 billion CHF respectively. Herceptin® sales were 34% lower than in 2019, driven by biosimilar competition, which was introduced in the second half of 2019 in the US and mid-2018 in Japan and Europe. Upon approval Sandoz AG, a global leader in generics and biosimilars will sell EG12014 globally in all markets except for Taiwan and Mainland China, as per the licensing agreement signed with EirGenix in April 2019. The licensing agreement included a signing fee and milestone payments , and a profit sharing of product sales in the authorized markets after product launch. The revenue from the milestone payments will be recognized in stages in accordance to standard accounting procedures and will serve to benefit the company’s current operations and further development. In 2019, Taiwan’s National Health Insurance (NHI) paid approximately 1.657 billion New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) for Herceptin®.
 
 Current demand for complex biological drugs has increased and will continue to rise in the future. With the drug patents of major biological drugs set to expire in the near future, the development of biosimilars has been greatly encouraged within the industry. The demand has been driven by the need for more cost-effective drugs in countries with limited medical resources. EirGenix is currently the first and only biopharmaceutical company in Taiwan to have successfully signed a licensing agreement with a global pharmaceutical company for a biosimilar. EirGenix is also one of only a handful of Taiwanese biopharmaceutical companies to have independently developed a biosimilar product into Phase III clinical trials and successfully demonstrating its equivalent efficacy. With such developmental achievements, EirGenix is rightfully worthy of investors’ attention and expectations.

LEIDEN, Netherlands &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProQR Therapeutics N.V. (Nasdaq: PRQR) (the “Company”), a company dedicated to changing lives through the creation of transformative RNA therapies for inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), today announced results from a planned analysis of its Phase 1/2 <em>Stellar</em> trial of QR-421a in adults with Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (nsRP) due to <em>USH2A</em> exon 13 mutations. In the trial, QR-421a demonstrated benefit on multiple measures of vision that moved in concordance, including visual acuity, visual fields, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal imaging, after a single dose. QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Based on these findings, the Company plans to advance QR-421a to two parallel pivotal Phase 2/3 trials by year end 2021 – one in early-moderate patients, one in advanced patients.

“We’re pleased to have met all the objectives we set for the <em>Stellar</em> trial, including determining suitable registration endpoints, the dose, dosing interval, and patient population for the Phase 2/3 pivotal trials,” said Aniz Girach, MD, Chief Medical Officer of ProQR, “With just a single dose, QR-421a demonstrated clinical proof of concept with benefit observed in treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes in multiple concordant measures of vision. As expected, we saw benefits in both advanced and early-moderate patients in this slow progressing, debilitating eye disease, allowing us to advance this important investigational therapy for all patients with Usher syndrome and nsRP due to <em>USH2A</em> exon 13 mutations. Based on preliminary Regulatory guidance, we plan to submit protocols to advance QR-421a to pivotal testing. This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal trials, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through clinical development.”

“The safety profile and efficacy findings for QR-421a are very encouraging,” said Robert Koenekoop, MD, MSc, PhD, FRCS(C), FARVO, a clinical-scientist from the Montreal Children’s Hospital and Professor of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Department of Pediatric Surgery. “Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to <em>USH2A </em>exon 13 mutations are devastating retinal diseases representing a high unmet medical need, as there are no approved therapies to treat the severe vision loss associated with these diseases. Patients’ biggest hope for a therapy is to stop disease progression and prevent vision loss, and these findings suggest that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. I look forward to this exciting program advancing into pivotal trial development.”

<strong>Results from the Phase 1/2 trial of QR-421a</strong>

<strong>Safety Data</strong>

QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated at all doses. There were no serious adverse events reported and no inflammation was observed. One patient had worsening of pre-existing cataracts in both the treated and untreated eyes; both were deemed not treatment related by the investigator. One patient had progression of pre-existing cystoid macular edema (CME) that was managed with standard of care. Both cataracts and CME are associated with a high rate of occurrence in the natural history of this disease.

<strong>Efficacy Data</strong>

Given the key differences in baseline characteristics, patients were categorized into “advanced” and “early-moderate” populations based on baseline visual acuity.

In advanced patients, the primary measure of efficacy is BCVA. In early-moderate patients, the primary measure of efficacy is measurement of visual fields by static perimetry. QR-421a-treated patients responded on endpoints consistent with their disease stage in both advanced and early-moderate patient populations after a single injection.

All three doses studied in the <em>Stellar</em> trial were observed to be active as predicted by the pre-clinical data. No differences were observed based on patients being homozygous or heterozygous, or having Usher syndrome or non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa. These findings are consistent with the preclinical data for QR-421a.

Best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, is a measure of central vision, or sharpness of sight, as measured on an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter chart.

Across all treated patients (n=14), a mean benefit of 6.0 letters was observed at week 48 in the treated eyes compared to the untreated (contralateral) eyes after a single injection.

Among advanced disease patients (n=6), a mean benefit of 9.3 letters was observed at week 48 in the treated eyes as compared to the untreated eyes and the benefit was maintained for &gt;12 months. All six advanced patients had a benefit in the treatment eye, whereas none of the patients in the sham group had a benefit in the treatment eye.

<strong>Analysis of early-moderate patients</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>Static perimetry</strong>

Static perimetry assesses visual fields and retinal sensitivity in the peripheral retina.

Across all treated patients, the mean total retinal sensitivity improvement was up to 40dB higher in the treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes, and the benefit was maintained for &gt;6 months after a single injection.

The mean number of retinal locations (loci) that improved by =7db in retinal sensitivity demonstrated a benefit in the treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes, with up to a mean of 9 loci in the treated eyes improving by =7db .

In early-moderate patients (n=8), up to a mean of 13 loci in the treated eyes improved by =7db compared to 7 loci for the untreated eyes at the same timepoint.

Concordant benefits were noted on OCT-based assessment of the Ellipsoid Zone layer, which is an objective evaluation of photoreceptor viability, and other measures of central visual function, such as microperimetry.  Sham treated eyes responded similarly to the untreated eyes across all endpoints.

<strong>Pivotal trials</strong>

On the basis of these findings, the Company plans to conduct two pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trials. Based on initial Regulatory guidance, the Company plans to submit protocols to start two Phase 2/3 trials. Each trial could potentially serve as the sole registration trial depending on the findings. Pending finalization of the study designs with Regulatory authorities, the trials are expected to start before year end 2021. Both trials are expected to be conducted at global centers of excellence.

<strong><em>Sirius</em> trial in advanced population</strong>

The ""<em>Sirius</em>"" trial is a Phase 2/3 study that will focus on advanced patients with baseline BCVA =20/40. The preliminary design for <em>Sirius</em> is a double-masked, randomized, sham-controlled, 24-month, multiple-dose study. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 100 adults with Usher syndrome and nsRP due to <em>USH2A</em> exon 13 mutations, including both homozygous and heterozygous patients. The primary endpoint in this trial will be BCVA at 18 months, with potential for an earlier interim analysis. In this three-arm study, two different doses will be studied that will be administered every 6 months, and a third arm will receive sham treatment.

<em><strong>Celeste</strong></em><strong> trial in early-moderate population</strong>

In parallel to <em>Sirius</em>, the Company plans to start the “<em>Celeste</em>” Phase 2/3 trial in early-moderate patients. The preliminary design for <em>Celeste</em> is a double-masked, randomized, sham-controlled, 24-month, multiple-dose study. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 100 adults with Usher syndrome and nsRP due to <em>USH2A</em> exon 13 mutations. The primary endpoint in this trial will be based on static perimetry at 18 months, with potential for an earlier interim analysis. In this three-arm study, two different doses will be studied that will be administered every 6 months, and a third arm will receive sham treatment.

“There are currently no available treatments for the more than 16,000 patients with Usher syndrome 2A and nsRP due to <em>USH2A </em>exon 13 mutations and we are excited about the potential for QR-421a to address this significant unmet need,” said Benjamin R. Yerxa, PhD, Chief Executive Officer at the Foundation Fighting Blindness. “We are pleased to see QR-421a advancing to pivotal testing and proud to support the work of ProQR as they advance their pipeline of RNA therapies to potentially help children, adults, and families who are affected by blindness caused by <em>USH2A</em> mutations and other rare inherited retinal diseases.”

<strong>Phase 1/2 <em>Stellar</em> trial of QR-421a</strong>

The <em>Stellar</em> trial is a randomized, sham-controlled, single ascending dose, global, multicenter, 24-month study. The study includes a total of 20 patients, of which 14 received a single dose of QR-421a and six received a single sham procedure for masking. The 14 QR-421a-treated patients enrolled (mean age of 46 years) varied in their disease stage and were classified as advanced patients (defined as patients with baseline visual acuity of &lt;70 letters, or equivalent to LogMAR 0.3, or worse than 20/40 on a Snellen chart) or early-moderate patients. Six patients had advanced disease and eight patients had early-moderate disease. Three different dose levels were studied. The population also varied in disease characteristics with both Usher syndrome (n=7) and nsRP (n=7) and genetic background with both homozygous (n= 9) and heterozygous (n=5) subjects for <em>USH2A</em> exon 13 mutations. The majority of the patients were followed for up to 48 weeks, with one patient followed up to 96 weeks.

<strong>About Usher Syndrome Type 2a and Non-Syndromic Retinitis Pigmentosa</strong>

Usher syndrome is the leading cause of combined deafness and blindness. People with Usher syndrome type 2a are usually born with hearing loss and start to have progressive vision loss during adulthood. The vision loss can also occur without hearing loss in a related disease called non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa. Usher syndrome type 2a and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa can be caused by mutations in the <em>USH2A</em> gene. To date, there are no pharmaceutical treatments approved or in clinical development that treat the vision loss associated with mutations in <em>USH2A</em>.

<strong>About QR-421a</strong>

QR-421a is a first-in-class investigational RNA therapy designed to address the underlying cause of vision loss in Usher syndrome type 2a and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to mutations in exon 13 of the <em>USH2A</em> gene. QR-421a is designed to restore functional usherin protein by using an exon skipping approach with the aim to stop or reverse vision loss in patients. QR-421a is intended to be administered through intravitreal injections in the eye and has been granted orphan drug designation in the US and the European Union and received fast-track and rare pediatric disease designations from the FDA.

BASEL, Switzerland and NEW YORK, March 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Myovant Sciences (NYSE: MYOV) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced positive data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study of relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women with uterine fibroids. This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of continued treatment with relugolix combination therapy for up to two years.

“Since many women with uterine fibroids spend years struggling to manage their symptoms, there is a critical need for non-invasive long-term treatment options,” said Ayman Al-Hendy, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Chicago and LIBERTY Program Steering Committee Member. “Data from the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study demonstrate the potential value of continued treatment for women with uterine fibroids, with those receiving relugolix combination therapy in the study experiencing meaningful symptom relief for up to two years.”

The LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study (N = 229) was a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled eligible women who completed the LIBERTY long-term extension study. Eligibility criteria included meeting the responder criteria at one year. Responder criteria were defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of treatment measured using the alkaline hematin method. Women were randomized at Week 52 to once-daily relugolix combination therapy or placebo for a one-year double-blind treatment period. Women on placebo with relapse of heavy menstrual bleeding during the study were offered re-treatment with open-label relugolix combination therapy. This study, together with the LIBERTY 1, LIBERTY 2, and LIBERTY long-term extension studies, was designed to provide data on the safety and efficacy of treatment with relugolix combination therapy for up to two years.

“We are pleased to see the positive data from the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study which support the potential benefit of longer-term treatment with relugolix combination therapy,” said Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc. “We look forward to making the full data available at a future medical congress.”

“Uterine fibroids can affect many women during their lifetime with uncomfortable symptoms, such as heavy menstrual bleeding,” said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine and Hospital, Global Product Development at Pfizer. “We believe that these study results offer encouraging data in support of longer-term efficacy in women suffering from uterine fibroids.”

The LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study met its primary endpoint with 78.4% of women who continued on relugolix combination therapy achieving the sustained responder rate (menstrual blood loss &lt; 80 mL) through Week 76 compared with 15.1% of women who discontinued treatment and initiated placebo at Week 52 (p &lt; 0.0001). All three key secondary endpoints in the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study were also achieved, including sustained responder rate at two years (Week 104), time to relapse of heavy menstrual bleeding, and amenorrhea rate (all p &lt; 0.0001). Through two years, 69.8% of women who continued on relugolix combination therapy remained responders. 88.3% of women who discontinued treatment at Week 52 relapsed with heavy menstrual bleeding, with a median time of return to heavy menstrual bleeding of 5.9 weeks.

Bone mineral density was maintained through two years in the subset of women continuously treated with relugolix combination therapy (N = 31). The incidence of adverse events over one additional year of treatment was consistent with those observed in prior studies, with no new safety signals observed. The most commonly reported adverse event in at least 10% of women treated with relugolix combination therapy was nasopharyngitis.

Relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of women with uterine fibroids, with a decision expected by the June 1, 2021 target action date.

<strong>About the Phase 3 LIBERTY Program in Uterine Fibroids</strong>

The Phase 3 clinical program for uterine fibroids consisted of two multinational, replicate pivotal clinical studies (LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2) of relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids for 24 weeks. Eligible women who completed the LIBERTY 1 or LIBERTY 2 studies were offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment extension study in which all women received relugolix combination therapy for an additional 28-week period for a total treatment period of 52 weeks, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of longer-term treatment. Upon completion of this 52-week total treatment period, eligible women could elect to participate in a second 52-week randomized withdrawal study designed to provide two- year safety and efficacy data on relugolix combination therapy and to evaluate the need for maintenance therapy. Across studies, a response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of treatment measured using the alkaline hematin method.

LIBERTY 1 and 2 met their primary endpoints (p &lt; 0.0001) with 73.4% and 71.2% of women receiving relugolix combination therapy achieving the responder criteria compared with 18.9% and 14.7% of women receiving placebo at 24 weeks, respectively. On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy in both studies experienced an 84.3% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline at Week 24 (p &lt; 0.0001). Bone mineral density was comparable between the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups in LIBERTY 1 and 2. The distribution of the change in bone mineral density, including outliers, was similar for the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups at 24 weeks, as assessed by dual energy x- ray absorptiometry (DXA). The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination and placebo groups was comparable in both studies.

The open-label extension study also met its primary endpoint with relugolix combination therapy demonstrating an 87.7% response rate at one year, showing the durability of the response observed in LIBERTY 1 and 2. In addition, women experienced, on average, an 89.9% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline at Week 52.

Changes in bone mineral density through one year, as assessed by DXA every three months, were consistent with LIBERTY 1 and 2. The incidence of adverse events over one year was consistent with that observed in LIBERTY 1 and 2, with no new safety signals observed.

PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced primary results from the Phase 2/3 RELATIVITY-047 (CA224-047) trial evaluating the fixed-dose combination of relatlimab, an anti-LAG-3 antibody, and <i>Opdivo </i>(nivolumab) versus <i>Opdivo</i> alone in patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma. The trial met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). Follow up for overall survival, a secondary endpoint, is ongoing. The fixed-dose combination was well-tolerated and there were no new safety signals reported in either the relatlimab and <i>Opdivo</i> combination arm or the <i>Opdivo</i> arm. These are the first Phase 3 data to be reported from a trial evaluating an anti-LAG-3 antibody. Relatlimab is the third distinct checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-LAG-3) for Bristol Myers Squibb and, with <i>Opdivo</i>, the first fixed-dose combination to demonstrate a benefit for patients.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination have transformed treatment and improved survival rates for patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma. However, there remain a considerable number of patients who could benefit from a novel combination therapy that leverages potentially complementary pathways to improve anti-tumor activity,” said Jonathan Cheng, senior vice president and head of oncology development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “The results of this study suggest that targeting the LAG-3 pathway in combination with PD-1 inhibition may be a key strategy to enhance the immune response and help improve outcomes for these patients.”

Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is a cell-surface molecule expressed on effector T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). LAG-3 regulates an inhibitory immune checkpoint pathway that limits the activity of T cells, leading to an impaired ability to attack tumor cells. In the chronic presence of diseases like cancer, T cells exhibit progressive exhaustion that is characterized by the upregulation of inhibitory immune checkpoints such as PD-1 and LAG-3. While LAG-3 and PD-1 are distinct immune checkpoint pathways, they may potentially act synergistically on effector T cells leading to T cell exhaustion. Relatlimab is a LAG-3–blocking antibody that binds to LAG-3 on T cells, restoring effector function of exhausted T cells. Relatlimab, in combination with <i>Opdivo</i>, is the first anti-LAG-3 antibody to demonstrate a benefit for patients.

Bristol Myers Squibb will present the results at an upcoming meeting and discuss these results with regulatory authorities.

Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators who were involved in the RELATIVITY-047 clinical trial. The company has several ongoing trials evaluating the use of relatlimab in combination with <i>Opdivo</i> and other therapies for the treatment of additional cancers.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About RELATIVITY-047 (CA224-047)</span></b>

RELATIVITY-047 (CA224-047) is a randomized, double-blind Phase 2/3 study evaluating the fixed-dose combination of relatlimab and <i>Opdivo</i> in patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma versus <i>Opdivo </i>alone. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival (PFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and the secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). A total of 714 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a fixed-dose combination of relatlimab 160 mg and <i>Opdivo</i> 480 mg or <i>Opdivo</i> 480 mg by intravenous infusion every four weeks until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Follow up for the secondary endpoints of OS and ORR is ongoing.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About LAG-3</span></b>

Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is a cell-surface molecule expressed on effector T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and functions to control T cell response, activation and growth. Preclinical studies indicate that inhibition of the LAG-3 pathway may restore effector function of exhausted T cells and potentially promote an anti-tumor response. Early research demonstrates that targeting the LAG-3 pathway in combination with other potentially complementary immune pathways may be a key strategy to more effectively potentiate anti-tumor immune activity.

Bristol Myers Squibb is evaluating relatlimab, its LAG-3-blocking antibody, in clinical trials in combination with other agents in a variety of tumor types.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Melanoma</span></b>

Melanoma is a form of skin cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) located in the skin. Metastatic melanoma is the deadliest form of the disease and occurs when cancer spreads beyond the surface of the skin to other organs. The incidence of melanoma has been increasing steadily for the last 30 years. In the United States, 106,110 new diagnoses of melanoma and about 7,180 related deaths are estimated for 2021. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that by 2035, melanoma incidence will reach 424,102, with 94,308 related deaths. Melanoma is mostly curable when treated in its very early stages; however, survival rates decrease if regional lymph nodes are involved.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>

<b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, they can also occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO or YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of OPDIVO and YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment with OPDIVO and before each dose of YERVOY. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY depending on severity (please see section 2 Dosage and Administration in the accompanying Full Prescribing Information). In general, if OPDIVO or YERVOY interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received OPDIVO monotherapy or OPDIVO in combination with YERVOY or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions: <i>cardiac/vascular:</i> myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; <i>nervous system:</i> meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; <i>ocular:</i> uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur; <i>gastrointestinal:</i> pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; <i>musculoskeletal and connective tissue:</i> myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica; <i>endocrine:</i> hypoparathyroidism; <i>other (hematologic/immune):</i> hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.

In addition to the immune-mediated adverse reactions listed above, across clinical trials of YERVOY monotherapy or in combination with OPDIVO, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in &lt;1% of patients unless otherwise specified: <i>nervous system:</i> autoimmune neuropathy (2%), myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, motor dysfunction; <i>cardiovascular:</i> angiopathy, temporal arteritis; <i>ocular</i>: blepharitis, episcleritis, orbital myositis, scleritis; <i>gastrointestinal:</i> pancreatitis (1.3%); <i>other (hematologic/immune):</i> conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, hypersensitivity vasculitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis.

Some ocular IMAR cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and YERVOY, as this may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause severe infusion-related reactions. Discontinue OPDIVO and YERVOY in patients with severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients. In MPM patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients.

In separate Phase 3 trials of YERVOY 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg monotherapy, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.9% (28/982) of patients.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with OPDIVO or YERVOY. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between OPDIVO or YERVOY and allogeneic HSCT.

Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The effects of YERVOY are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>

In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.

<b>Lactation</b>

There are no data on the presence of OPDIVO or YERVOY in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.

<strong>OSAKA, Japan, and CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts, March 25, 2021 –</strong> Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited <strong>(</strong><strong>TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</strong><strong>)</strong> (“Takeda”) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted the Company’s filing packages for its dengue vaccine candidate (TAK-003) which is being investigated for the prevention of dengue due to any dengue virus serotype in individuals ages four to 60. Takeda intends to submit regulatory filings in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand during 2021.

“Submission of regulatory filings for our dengue vaccine candidate, TAK-003, marks an important development for people who are living in or traveling to communities burdened by the threat of dengue,” said Derek Wallace, VP, Dengue Global Program Leader at Takeda. “Dengue outbreaks, which result in half a million hospitalizations globally each year, can overwhelm communities and governments because of the broad impact on the health care system. With limited options to prevent the disease, there is a pressing need for widely available dengue vaccines. Takeda is committed to working with regulatory authorities and recommending bodies to support evaluation of our submissions and achieve access for TAK-003.”

Takeda is participating in the EMA’s first-ever parallel assessment of a medicinal product for use in the European Union (EU), and through the EU-M4all (previously Article 58) procedure for countries outside of the EU. Along with the scientific opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), national regulators in countries participating in the EU-M4all procedure will conduct their own assessments to determine if national marketing authorizations for TAK-003 are granted. Takeda is also seeking approval of TAK-003 in dengue-endemic countries that are not participating in the EU-M4all procedure.

Regulatory submissions for TAK-003 include long-term safety and efficacy data through 36 months from the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02747927?term=den-301&amp;rank=1"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02747927?term=den-301&amp;rank=1"" data-action=""External"">Tetravalent Immunization against Dengue Efficacy Study (TIDES)</a> trial. Takeda intends to present and publish details of the 36-month data at a scientific meeting and in a peer-reviewed journal this year.

Takeda also intends to submit regulatory filings in the United States, followed by additional countries in Asia and Latin America.
<h5>EU-M4all<sup>1</sup></h5>
EU-M4all (or EU-Medicines for all) is a procedure designed to facilitate patient access to essential medicines or vaccines intended to prevent or treat diseases of major public health interest. Through the EU-M4all procedure (previously known as the Article 58 procedure), the EMA, in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), can provide scientific opinion on medicines and vaccines for public health priority diseases that are intended for markets outside of the EU.
<h5><strong>About TAK-003</strong></h5>
Takeda's tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (TAK-003) is based on a live-attenuated dengue serotype 2 virus, which provides the genetic “backbone” for all four vaccine viruses.<sup>2</sup> Clinical <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02302066"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02302066"" data-action=""External"">Phase 2</a> data in children and adolescents showed that <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30556-0/fulltext"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30556-0/fulltext"" data-action=""External"">TAK-003 induced immune responses</a> against all four dengue serotypes, in both seropositive and seronegative participants, which persisted through 48 months after vaccination, and the vaccine was found to be generally safe and well tolerated.<sup>3</sup> The pivotal Phase 3 TIDES trial met its <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1903869"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1903869"" data-action=""External"">primary endpoint of overall vaccine efficacy</a> (VE) against virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) at 12 months follow-up and all <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30414-1/fulltext"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30414-1/fulltext"" data-action=""External"">secondary endpoints at 18 months follow-up</a> for which there were a sufficient number of dengue cases, including VE against hospitalized dengue and VE in baseline seropositive and baseline seronegative individuals.<sup>4,5</sup> Efficacy varied by serotype. The results demonstrated TAK-003 was generally well tolerated, and there have been no important safety risks observed to date.
<h5>About the Phase 3 TIDES (DEN-301) Trial</h5>
The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 TIDES trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of two doses of TAK-003 in the prevention of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic dengue fever of any severity and due to any of the four dengue virus serotypes in children and adolescents.<sup>4</sup> The TIDES trial is Takeda’s largest interventional clinical trial to date and enrolled over 20,000 healthy children and adolescents ages four to 16 years living in dengue-endemic areas. Study participants were randomly assigned to receive either TAK-003 0.5 mL or placebo by subcutaneous injection on Day 1 and Day 90.<sup>4</sup> The study is comprised of five parts. Part 1 and the primary endpoint analysis evaluated vaccine efficacy (VE) and safety through 15 months after the first dose (12 months after the second dose).<sup>4</sup> Part 2 continued for an additional six months to complete the assessment of the secondary endpoints of VE by serotype, baseline serostatus and disease severity, including VE against hospitalized dengue.<sup>4</sup> Part 3 is evaluating VE and long-term safety by following participants for an additional two and a half to three years.<sup>6</sup> Part 4 will evaluate safety for 13 months following booster vaccination and Part 5 will evaluate long-term safety for one year after completion of Part 4.<sup>6</sup>

The trial is taking place at sites in dengue-endemic areas in Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua) and Asia (Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka) where there are unmet needs in dengue prevention and where severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children.<sup>4</sup> Baseline blood samples were collected from all individuals participating in the trial to allow for evaluation of safety and efficacy based on serostatus. Takeda and an independent Data Monitoring Committee of experts are actively monitoring safety on an ongoing basis.
<h5>About Dengue</h5>
Dengue is the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease and was one of the WHO’s top 10 threats to global health in 2019.<sup>7,8</sup> Dengue is mainly spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. It is caused by any of four dengue virus serotypes, each of which can cause dengue fever or severe dengue. The prevalence of individual serotypes varies across different geographies, countries, regions, seasons and over time.<sup>9</sup> Recovery from infection by one serotype provides lifelong immunity against only that serotype, and later exposure to any of the remaining serotypes is associated with an increased risk of severe disease.

Dengue is pandemic prone, and outbreaks are observed in tropical and sub-tropical areas and have recently caused outbreaks in parts of the continental United States and Europe.<sup>10,11</sup> Approximately half of the world now lives under the threat of dengue, which is estimated to cause 390 million infections and around 20,000 deaths globally each year.<sup>10</sup><sup>,12</sup> The dengue virus can infect people of all ages and is a leading cause of serious illness among children in some countries in Latin America and Asia.<sup>10</sup>
<h5>Takeda’s Commitment to Vaccines</h5>
Vaccines prevent 2 to 3 million deaths each year and have transformed global public health.<sup>13</sup> For the past 70 years, Takeda has supplied vaccines to protect the health of people in Japan. Today, Takeda’s global vaccine business is applying innovation to tackle some of the world’s most challenging infectious diseases, such as dengue, COVID-19, Zika and norovirus. Takeda’s team brings an outstanding track record and a wealth of knowledge in vaccine development, manufacturing and global access to advance a pipeline of vaccines to address some of the world’s most pressing public health needs.

TOKYO &amp; BOTHELL, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Seagen Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced that a marketing authorization application (MAA) for enfortumab vedotin was accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The MAA requests review of enfortumab vedotin for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have received a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and who have received a platinum-containing chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting. If approved, enfortumab vedotin would be the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) available in the European Union for people living with urothelial cancer.
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

Enfortumab vedotin will be reviewed under accelerated assessment, which means the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can reduce the timeframe for evaluation.

The MAA is based on the global phase 3 EV-301 trial, which evaluated enfortumab vedotin versus chemotherapy in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 inhibitor. Results from the trial, which had a primary endpoint of overall survival for patients treated with PADCEV versus chemotherapy, were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i><i>.</i>

“In the European Union, it is estimated that 118,000 people are diagnosed with urothelial cancer each year, and 52,000 die as a result of the disease,” said Andrew Krivoshik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Oncology Therapeutic Area Head, Astellas. “People with advanced urothelial cancer face an urgent need for new treatment options, which is reflected in the CHMP’s decision to grant accelerated assessment. We will continue to work with the CHMP toward our goal of securing marketing authorization as soon as possible.”

<b>About Urothelial Cancer</b>

Urothelial cancer is the most common type of bladder cancer (90 percent of cases), and can also be found in the renal pelvis (where urine collects inside the kidney), ureter (tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder) and urethra.<sup>1</sup> Globally, approximately 549,000 new cases of bladder cancer and 200,000 deaths are reported annually.<sup>2</sup> In Europe, it is estimated that 118,000 patients are diagnosed with this form of cancer and 52,000 deaths are reported annually.<sup>3</sup>

Locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer is an aggressive disease that is associated with poor survival and high healthcare costs.<sup>4</sup> Five-year relative survival rates for metastatic disease are estimated to be approximately 7 percent.<sup>5</sup>

The EV-301 trial (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03474107%3Fterm%3Dev-301%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;esheet=52401786&amp;newsitemid=20210325005903&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT03474107&amp;index=2&amp;md5=ca2c1fa7109d3749fcf1b50de1212f5b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">NCT03474107</a>) is a global, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial designed to evaluate enfortumab vedotin versus physician's choice of chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine) in approximately 600 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and platinum-based therapies. The primary endpoint is overall survival and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall response rate, duration of response and disease control rate, as well as assessment of safety/tolerability and quality-of-life parameters.<sup>6</sup>

<b>About Enfortumab Vedotin</b>

Enfortumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.<sup>7,8</sup> Nonclinical data suggest the anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin is due to its binding to Nectin-4 expressing cells followed by the internalization and release of the anti-tumor agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) into the cell, which result in the cell not reproducing (cell cycle arrest) and in programmed cell death (apoptosis).<sup>8</sup>

<b>PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) U.S. Important Safety Information</b>

<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>

<b>Skin reactions: </b>Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including fatal cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. SJS and TEN occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment but may occur later.

Skin reactions occurred in 54% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials. Twenty-six percent (26%) of patients had maculopapular rash and 30% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 10% of patients and included symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), dermatitis bullous, dermatitis exfoliative, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. In one clinical trial, the median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.8 months (range: 0.2 to 5.3). Of the patients who experienced rash, 65% had complete resolution and 22% had partial improvement.

Monitor patients closely throughout treatment for skin reactions. Consider topical corticosteroids and antihistamines as clinically indicated. Withhold PADCEV and consider referral for specialized care for severe (Grade 3) skin reactions, suspected SJS, or TEN. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients with confirmed SJS or TEN; or Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.

<b>Hyperglycemia </b>occurred in patients treated with PADCEV, including death and diabetic ketoacidosis, in those with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus. The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. In one clinical trial, 8% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C =8% were excluded. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (&gt;250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV.

<b>Peripheral neuropathy (PN), </b>predominantly sensory, occurred in 49% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials; 2% experienced Grade 3 reactions. In one clinical trial, peripheral neuropathy occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without preexisting peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of Grade =2 was 3.8 months (range: 0.6 to 9.2). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients. At the time of their last evaluation, 19% had complete resolution, and 26% had partial improvement. Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when peripheral neuropathy occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade =3 peripheral neuropathy.

<b>Ocular disorders </b>occurred in 46% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included keratitis, blurred vision, limbal stem cell deficiency and other events associated with dry eyes. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 36% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 14% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.9 months (range: 0.3 to 6.2). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders.

<b>Infusion site extravasation: </b>Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 310 patients, 1.3% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. One percent (1%) of patients developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions.

<b>Embryo-fetal toxicity: </b>PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during PADCEV treatment and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose.

<b>Adverse Reactions</b>

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients treated with PADCEV. The most common serious adverse reactions (=3%) were urinary tract infection (6%), cellulitis (5%), febrile neutropenia (4%), diarrhea (4%), sepsis (3%), acute kidney injury (3%), dyspnea (3%), and rash (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, including acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac disorder, and sepsis (each 0.8%).

Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 16% of patients; the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 64% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were peripheral neuropathy (18%), rash (9%) and fatigue (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 34% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction were peripheral neuropathy (12%), rash (6%) and fatigue (4%).

The most common adverse reactions (=20%) were fatigue (56%), peripheral neuropathy (56%), decreased appetite (52%), rash (52%), alopecia (50%), nausea (45%), dysgeusia (42%), diarrhea (42%), dry eye (40%), pruritus (26%) and dry skin (26%). The most common Grade =3 adverse reactions (=5%) were rash (13%), diarrhea (6%) and fatigue (6%).

<b>Lab Abnormalities</b>

In one clinical trial, Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities reported in =5% were: lymphocytes decreased (10%), hemoglobin decreased (10%), phosphate decreased (10%), lipase increased (9%), sodium decreased (8%), glucose increased (8%), urate increased (7%), neutrophils decreased (5%).

<b>Drug Interactions</b>

<b>Effects of other drugs on PADCEV </b>Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase free MMAE exposure, which may increase the incidence or severity of PADCEV toxicities. Closely monitor patients for signs of toxicity when PADCEV is given concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

<b>Specific Populations</b>

<b>Lactation </b>Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.

<b>Hepatic impairment </b>Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE began testing their COVID-19 vaccine in children under 12, with hopes of expanding vaccination to that age range by early 2022, the U.S. drugmaker said on Thursday.</p>
<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">The first volunteers in the early-stage trial were given their first injections on Wednesday, Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo said.</p>
<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized by U.S. regulators in late December for people age 16 and older. Nearly 66 million doses of the vaccine had been administered in the United States as of Wednesday morning, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">The pediatric trial, which will include children as young as 6 months, follows a similar one launched by Moderna Inc last week.</p>
<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">Only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being used in 16- and 17-year-olds in the United States. Moderna’s shot was cleared for those age 18 and older, and no COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized in younger kids yet.</p>
<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">Pfizer and BioNTech plan to initially test the safety of their two-shot vaccine at three different dosages - 10, 20 and 30 micrograms - in a 144-participant Phase I/II trial.</p>
<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">They plan to later expand to a 4,500-participant late-stage trial in which they will test the safety, tolerability and immune response generated by the vaccine, likely by measuring antibody levels in the young subjects.</p>
<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">Castillo said the companies hope to have data from the trial in the second half of 2021.</p>
<p class=""Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"">Meanwhile, Pfizer has been testing the vaccine in children from age 12 to 15. The company expects to have data from that trial in the coming weeks, Castillo said.</p>

“CAR T cell therapies have shown transformational potential for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, and we, with our partners at bluebird bio, are proud to bring the first CAR T cell therapy to appropriate triple-class exposed patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, offering the chance for durable response,” said <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com%2Fabout-us%2Fleadership%2Fleadership-team.html&amp;esheet=52377509&amp;newsitemid=20210326005507&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Samit+Hirawat%2C+M.D.&amp;index=3&amp;md5=0a3b85a1276e74e90df22101ba9272a3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" shape=""rect"">Samit Hirawat, M.D.</a>, chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “Bristol Myers Squibb is now the only company with two approved CAR T cell therapies with distinct targets of CD19 and BCMA. As our second FDA-approved CAR T cell therapy, <i>Abecma </i>underscores our commitment to deliver on the promise of cell therapies for patients who are battling aggressive and advanced blood cancers with limited effective treatment options.”

“Our journey to today’s approval of <i>Abecma</i> started nearly a decade ago with pioneering research at bluebird bio and has been driven ever since by our mission to provide patients with multiple myeloma a new approach to fight this relentless disease. This achievement would not have been possible without all of the patients, caregivers, investigators and healthcare staff who participated in our clinical studies, as well as the tremendous collaboration with the FDA,” said Nick Leschly, chief bluebird, bluebird bio. “Today’s announcement represents an important milestone for bluebird bio, marking both our first approved treatment in oncology and our first approved treatment in the United States.”

Despite advances in treatment, multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease characterized by periods of remission and relapse.<sup>3</sup> Most patients experience relapse following initial therapies, and depth and duration of response as well as survival outcomes decrease with each successive treatment.<sup>4-9</sup> Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma that have been exposed to all three major drug classes (triple-class exposed), including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody, tend to demonstrate poor clinical outcomes with very low response rates (20% to 30%), short duration of response (2 to 4 months) and poor survival.<sup>5,10,11,12</sup>

“In the KarMMa study, ide-cel<i> </i>elicited rapid responses in the majority of patients, and these deep and durable responses were observed in patients with triple-class exposed and refractory multiple myeloma,” said Nikhil C. Munshi, M.D., Associate Director, The Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts. “As a treating physician, I often work with patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are in critical need of new therapies. Now, with the approval of ide-cel<i> </i>as the first anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy, we are excited to finally be able to offer patients a new, effective personalized treatment option that is delivered through a single infusion.”

A network has been created to support rapid and dependable manufacturing of <i>Abecma </i>and ensure capacity to accommodate patient demand. <i>Abecma </i>will be manufactured for each individual patient using the patient’s own T cells at Bristol Myers Squibb’s state-of-the-art cellular immunotherapy manufacturing facility in Summit, New Jersey. The lentiviral vector, which is used to engineer the CAR T cells, was developed by bluebird bio. <i>Abecma</i> patients, caregivers and physician teams can access relevant information, manufacturing updates and patient and caregiver support through Cell Therapy 360, a digital service platform provided to optimize the <i>Abecma </i>patient and physician treatment experience. Various programs and resources will also be offered to help address the needs of patients and caregivers and provide support that allows for access to therapies, including <i>Abecma. </i>Due to the specialized nature of administering cell therapy, <i>Abecma </i>will be available at certified treatment centers throughout the country. A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program will be implemented at certified centers to support appropriate use of <i>Abecma </i>including training on the management of cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities<i>.</i>

<i>Abecma</i> is being jointly developed and commercialized in the U.S. as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">KarMMa Pivotal Trial Results</span></b>

The FDA approval of <i>Abecma </i>is based on data from the pivotal Phase II KarMMa trial of 127 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. The efficacy evaluable population consists of 100 patients who received <i>Abecma </i>within the dose range of 300 to 460 x 10<sup>6 </sup>CAR-positive T cells. Of these patients, 88% received four or more prior lines of therapy and 85% were triple-class refractory.<sup>1</sup>

In the study, the overall response rate (ORR) for the efficacy evaluable population (n=100) was 72% (95% CI: 62-81), and 28% of patients achieved a stringent complete response (sCR; 95% CI: 19-38).<sup>1</sup> Responses were rapid and durable, with a median time to response of 30 days (range: 15 to 88 days) and median duration of response of 11 months (95% CI: 10.3 – 11.4) for all responders and 19 months (95% CI: 11.4 – NE) for those who achieved sCR. Of the 28 patients who achieved sCR, an estimated 65% (95% CI: 42% - 81%) had remission lasting at least 12 months.<sup>1</sup>

In patients treated with <i>Abecma </i>in the KarMMa study, the safety profile was well-established with mostly low-grade occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (NT), and predictable early onset and resolution. CRS of any grade occurred in 85% (108/127) of patients using the Lee grading system.<sup>1,13</sup> Grade <span class=""bwuline"">&gt;</span>3 CRS occurred in 9% (12/127) of patients, with Grade 5 CRS reported in one patient (0.8%). The median time to onset of CRS was one day (range: 1-23 days) and the median duration of CRS was seven days (range: 1-63 days). The most common manifestations of any grade CRS included pyrexia (98%), hypotension (41%), tachycardia (35%), chills (31%), hypoxia (20%), fatigue (12%), and headache (10%). NT of any grade occurred in 28% (36/127) of patients, including Grade =3 events in 4% (5/127) of patients. One patient had ongoing Grade 2 NT at the time of death. The median time to onset of NT was two days (range: 1-42 days). NT resolved in 33 of 36 patients (92%) with a median time to resolution of five days (range: 1-61 days). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), potential complications related to excessive immune activation associated with CAR T cell therapies, occurred in 4% (5/127) of patients, including one patient who developed fatal multi-organ HLH/MAS with CRS and one patient with fatal bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, with HLH/MAS contributing to the fatal outcome. Three cases of Grade 2 HLH/MAS resolved. In the study, 41% (52/127) of patients experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 49% (62/127) of patients experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Three patients underwent stem cell transplant for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged cytopenia. Two of the three patients died from complications of prolonged cytopenia, which occurred in the setting of ongoing or prior severe CRS or HLH/MAS.<sup>1</sup>

The most common (=20%) types of nonlaboratory adverse reactions included CRS, infections, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, hypogammaglobulinemia, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, viral infections, encephalopathy, edema, pyrexia, cough, headache, and decreased appetite. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 67% of patients, with the most common (=5%) being CRS (18%), general physical health deterioration (10%), pneumonia (12%), infections (19%), viral infections (9%), sepsis (7%), and febrile neutropenia (6%). The most common Grade 3 or 4 nonlaboratory adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia (16%) and infections (14%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients.<sup>1</sup>

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Indication</span></b>

ABECMA (idecabtagene vicleucel) is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.

 	<li>ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS.</li>
</ul>
<b>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): </b>CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with ABECMA. CRS occurred in 85% (108/127) of patients receiving ABECMA. Grade 3 or higher CRS (Lee grading system) occurred in 9% (12/127) of patients, with Grade 5 CRS reported in one (0.8%) patient. The median time to onset of CRS, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 - 23 days) and the median duration of CRS was 7 days (range: 1 - 63 days) in all patients including the patient who died. The most common manifestations of CRS included pyrexia (98%), hypotension (41%), tachycardia (35%), chills (31%), hypoxia (20%), fatigue (12%), and headache (10%). Grade 3 or higher events that may be associated with CRS include hypotension, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atrial fibrillation, hepatocellular injury, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and HLH/MAS.

Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS.

Fifty four percent (68/127) of patients received tocilizumab; 35% (45/127) received a single dose while 18% (23/127) received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab. Overall, across the dose levels, 15% (19/127) of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. All patients that received corticosteroids for CRS received tocilizumab.

Overall rate of CRS was 79% and rate of Grade 2 CRS was 23% in patients treated in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort. For patients treated in the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort, the overall rate of CRS was 96% and rate of Grade 2 CRS was 40%. Rate of Grade 3 or higher CRS was similar across the dose range. The median duration of CRS for the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort was 7 days (range: 1-63 days) and for the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort was 6 days (range: 2-28 days). In the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort, 68% (36/53) of patients received tocilizumab and 23% (12/53) received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. In the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort, 44% (31/70) of patients received tocilizumab and 10% (7/70) received corticosteroids. All patients that received corticosteroids for CRS also received tocilizumab. Ensure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of ABECMA.

Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after infusion. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated.

Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time.

<b>Neurologic Toxicities: </b>Neurologic toxicities, which may be severe or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with ABECMA, including concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity occurred in 28% (36/127) of patients receiving ABECMA, including Grade 3 in 4% (5/127) of patients. One patient had ongoing Grade 2 neurotoxicity at the time of death. Two patients had ongoing Grade 1 tremor at the time of data cutoff. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1 - 42 days). CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity resolved in 92% (33/36) of patients with a median duration of neurotoxicity was 5 days (range: 1 - 61 days). The median duration of neurotoxicity was 6 days (range: 1 - 578) in all patients including those with ongoing neurotoxicity at the time of death or data cut off. Thirty-four patients with neurotoxicity had CRS. Neurotoxicity had onset in 3 patients before, 29 patients during, and 2 patients after CRS. The rate of Grade 3 neurotoxicity was 8% in the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort and 1.4% in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort. The most frequently reported (greater than or equal to 5%) manifestations of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity include encephalopathy (20%), tremor (9%), aphasia (7%), and delirium (6%). Grade 4 neurotoxicity and cerebral edema in 1 patient has been reported with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma. Grade 3 myelitis and Grade 3 parkinsonism have been reported after treatment with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma.

Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.

Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicity occur at any time.

<b>Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS): </b>HLH/MAS occurred in 4% (5/127) of patients receiving ABECMA. One patient treated in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort developed fatal multi-organ HLH/MAS with CRS. In another patient with fatal bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, HLH/MAS was contributory to the fatal outcome. Three cases of Grade 2 HLH/MAS resolved. The rate of HLH/MAS was 8% in the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort and 1% in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 10 days of receiving ABECMA with a median onset of 7 days (range: 4-9 days) and occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. Two patients with HLH/MAS had overlapping neurotoxicity. The manifestations of HLH/MAS include hypotension, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and cytopenia. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized early and treated. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional standards.

<b>ABECMA REMS: </b>Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. Further information is available at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.AbecmaREMS.com&amp;esheet=52377509&amp;newsitemid=20210326005507&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.AbecmaREMS.com&amp;index=4&amp;md5=02ee2692fe9205d7f1eb94072230f2b0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" shape=""rect"">www.AbecmaREMS.com</a> or 1-888-423-5436.

<b>Hypersensitivity Reactions: </b>Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of ABECMA. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in ABECMA.

<b>Infections: </b>ABECMA should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections occurred in patients after ABECMA infusion. Infections (all grades) occurred in 70% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 23% of patients. Overall, 4 patients had Grade 5 infections (3%); 2 patients (1.6%) had Grade 5 events of pneumonia, 1 patient (0.8%) had Grade 5 bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and 1 patient (0.8%) had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after ABECMA infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic, preemptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines.

Febrile neutropenia was observed in 16% (20/127) of patients after ABECMA infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.

<i>Viral Reactivation</i>: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulting in pneumonia and death has occurred following ABECMA administration. Monitor and treat for CMV reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against plasma cells. Perform screening for CMV, HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

<b>Prolonged Cytopenias:</b> Patients may exhibit prolonged cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and ABECMA infusion. In the KarMMa study, 41% of patients (52/127) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 49% (62/127) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that had not resolved by Month 1 following ABECMA infusion. Rate of prolonged neutropenia was 49% in the 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort and 34% in the 300 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR+ T cell dose cohort. In 83% (43/52) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia after Month 1, the median time to recovery from ABECMA infusion was 1.9 months. In 65% (40/62) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to recovery was 2.1 months. Median time to cytopenia recovery was similar across the 300 and 450 x 10<sup>6</sup> dose cohort.

Three patients underwent stem cell therapy for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged cytopenia. Two of the three patients died from complications of prolonged cytopenia. Monitor blood counts prior to and after ABECMA infusion. Manage cytopenia with myeloid growth factor and blood product transfusion support according to institutional guidelines.

<b>Hypogammaglobulinemia: </b>Plasma cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with ABECMA. Hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse event in 21% (27/127) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500 mg/dl after infusion in 25% (32/127) of patients treated with ABECMA.

Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with ABECMA and administer IVIG for IgG &lt;400 mg/dl. Manage per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis.

The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following ABECMA treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during ABECMA treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with ABECMA.

<b>Secondary Malignancies: </b>Patients treated with ABECMA may develop secondary malignancies. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. If a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555 to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing of secondary malignancy of T cell origin.

<b>Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: </b>Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving ABECMA are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following ABECMA infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.

<b>Adverse Reactions: </b>The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) include CRS, infections – pathogen unspecified, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, hypogammaglobulinemia, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, viral infections, encephalopathy, edema, pyrexia, cough, headache, and decreased appetite.

GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) today announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the use of intravenous and subcutaneous Benlysta (belimumab) in combination with background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN). The CHMP opinion is one of the final steps in the marketing authorisation procedure prior to approval by the European Commission. If approved, Benlysta would become the first and only biologic approved for both Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and LN in the European Union. This CHMP opinion follows <a title=""FDA approves GSK’s BENLYSTA as the first medicine for adult patients with active lupus nephritis in the US"" href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/fda-approves-gsk-s-benlysta-as-the-first-medicine-for-adult-patients-with-active-lupus-nephritis-in-the-us/"" data-udi=""umb://document/141d2224580b41a9b661d6b707f54d5b"">the recent label expansion by the US Food and Drug Administration</a> to include LN.

<strong>Christopher Corsico, Senior Vice President, Development, GSK</strong>, said: “Active lupus nephritis occurs in more than 1 million patients with systemic lupus erythematosus worldwide. It causes inflammation in the kidneys and can lead to end-stage kidney disease which may require dialysis or a transplant. The CHMP’s positive opinion brings us one step closer to providing physicians and patients in Europe with the first treatment option specifically designed to work in lupus and lupus nephritis.”

The CHMP opinion is based on data from the BLISS-LN (Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab in Adult Patients with Active Lupus Nephritis) study and the unmet need in this patient population. The BLISS-LN study is the largest and longest phase 3 study conducted in active LN, involving 448 adult patients. The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that a statistically significant greater number of patients achieved Primary Efficacy Renal Response at two years (or 104 weeks) when treated with belimumab plus standard therapy compared to placebo plus standard therapy in adults with active LN (43% vs 32%, odds ratio (95% CI) 1.55 (1.04, 2.32), p=0.0311). Statistical significance compared to placebo across all four major secondary endpoints was achieved, including Complete Renal Response at Week 104 and Time to Renal-Related Event or Death. The adverse reactions observed in BLISS-LN were consistent with the known safety profile of Benlysta administered intravenously plus standard therapy in patients with SLE.

<strong>About the BLISS-LN study</strong><strong>
</strong>BLISS-LN is a phase 3, 104-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, post-approval commitment study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy (mycophenolate mofetil for induction and maintenance, or cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance, plus steroids) compared to placebo plus standard therapy in adult patients with active LN. Active LN was confirmed by renal biopsy during screening visit using the 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society criteria within the past 6 months, and clinically active kidney disease requiring induction therapy.<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-receives-chmp-positive-opinion-recommending-approval-of-benlysta-for-adult-patients-with-active-lupus-nephritis/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[1]</sup></a>

<strong>About lupus nephritis</strong>
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common form of lupus, is a chronic, incurable, autoimmune disease associated with a range of symptoms that can fluctuate over time including painful or swollen joints, extreme fatigue, unexplained fever, skin rashes and organ damage. In lupus nephritis (LN), SLE causes inflammation (swelling or scarring) of the small blood vessels that filter wastes in the kidney (glomeruli) and sometimes the kidneys, by attacking them like they would attack a disease.<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-receives-chmp-positive-opinion-recommending-approval-of-benlysta-for-adult-patients-with-active-lupus-nephritis/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[2]</sup></a> LN can lead to end-stage kidney disease, which requires kidney dialysis or a transplant. Despite improvements in both diagnosis and treatment over the last few decades, LN remains an indicator of poor prognosis.<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-receives-chmp-positive-opinion-recommending-approval-of-benlysta-for-adult-patients-with-active-lupus-nephritis/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[3],</sup></a><a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-receives-chmp-positive-opinion-recommending-approval-of-benlysta-for-adult-patients-with-active-lupus-nephritis/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[4]</sup></a> Manifestations of LN include proteinuria, elevations in serum creatinine and the presence of urinary sediment. Approximately 20% of patients with LN progress to end-stage kidney disease within 10 years of diagnosis.<a href=""https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-receives-chmp-positive-opinion-recommending-approval-of-benlysta-for-adult-patients-with-active-lupus-nephritis/#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1""><sup>[5]</sup></a>

<strong>About Benlysta (belimumab)</strong>
Benlysta, a BLyS-specific inhibitor, is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble BLyS. Belimumab does not bind to B cells directly or directly deplete B cell populations. By binding BLyS, belimumab inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.

Belimumab was approved as an IV formulation in July 2011, and as a subcutaneous (SC) formulation in adults in November 2017.

<strong>Benlysta EU Indication</strong>

Benlysta IV is indicated as add-on therapy in patients aged 5 years and older with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus with a high degree of disease activity (e.g., positive anti-dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.

Benlysta SC is indicated in the EU as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus with a high degree of disease activity (e.g., positive anti dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.

For the EU Summary of Product Characteristics for Benlysta, please visit <a href=""http://www.ema.europa.eu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.ema.europa.eu</a>

<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>

The following Important Safety Information is based on a summary of the European Summary of Product Characteristics. Please consult the full Summary of Product Characteristics for all the labelled safety information for Benlysta (belimumab).

<strong>Contraindications:</strong>

Hypersensitivity to belimumab or any excipients.

<strong>Warnings and precautions:</strong>

Not recommended in patients with severe active central nervous system lupus, severe active lupus nephritis, HIV, history of/current hepatitis B or C, hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG &lt;400 mg/dl) or IgA deficiency (IgA &lt;10 mg/dl) and patients with a history of major organ transplant or hematopoietic stem/cell/marrow transplant or renal transplant.

Caution: If Benlysta co-administered with other B cell targeted therapy or cyclophosphamide and patients with history of malignancy or who develop malignancy whilst receiving treatment.

<em>Infusion reactions and hypersensitivity:</em> Administration may result in hypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions which can be severe, and fatal. In the event of a severe reaction, administration must be interrupted and appropriate medical therapy administered. Risk of hypersensitivity reactions is greatest with the first two doses; however the risk should be considered for every dose. Advise patients reactions are possible on day of, or several days after. Delayed-type, non-acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, facial oedema) possible.

Benlysta IV: Infusions should be administered by qualified healthcare professional trained to give infusion therapy. Severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions can occur, possibly after several hours and can recur after initial treatment of symptoms. Administer in an environment where resources for managing reactions are available. Clinical supervision required for several hours after infusion, following at least first 2 infusions. Make patients aware of potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions (day of, or several days after infusion, including signs/symptoms and recurrence) and provide package leaflet each time Benlysta administered.  Premedication: An antihistamine, with/without an antipyretic, may be administered.

Benlysta SC: First subcutaneous (SC) injection should be supervised by a healthcare professional in a setting qualified to manage hypersensitivity reactions. Provide patient education on signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions (day of, or several days after administration) and possibility of recurrence and training in SC technique. Inform patients to seek medical attention if symptoms experienced.

<em>Infections:</em> Increased risk of infections, including opportunistic. Younger children may be at increased risk. Fatal infections (e.g. pneumonia and sepsis) occurred more frequently in patients receiving Benlysta; consider pneumococcal vaccination prior to initiation. Do not initiate with active serious infections (including serious chronic); Exercise caution and assess risk/benefit in patients with history of recurrent infection. Carefully monitor new infections - consider interrupting immunosuppressants including Benlysta until infection resolved.

<em>Depression and suicidality</em>: Before treatment assess risk of depression and suicide in patient; closely monitor during treatment – consider discontinuation if new or worsening psychiatric symptoms.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Monitor for new or worsening signs/symptoms – refer to neurologist if suspected; suspend further dosing until excluded.

<em>Immunisation:</em> Do not give live vaccines 30 days before, or concurrently with Benlysta.

Malignancy: May be increased risk with immunomodulatory medicines including Benlysta

<strong>Pregnancy and lactation:</strong>

Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during Benlysta treatment and for at least 4 months after the last treatment. Limited data on use in pregnant women. Should not to be used unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Not known whether Benlysta is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. Maternal IgG is secreted in breast milk so recommended to either discontinue Benlysta or breast feeding depending on the risk/benefit to mother and child.

<strong>Undesirable effects:</strong>

<em>Very common (=1/10):</em> Bacterial infections (e.g. bronchitis, urinary tract infections), diarrhoea, nausea. <em>Common (=1/100 to &lt;1/10):</em> Gastroenteritis viral, pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, viral upper respiratory tract infection, leucopenia, hypersensitivity reactions, depression, migraine, injection site reactions, pain in extremity, infusion or injection-related systemic reactions, pyrexia. <em>Serious:</em> Anaphylactic reaction, suicidal ideation and behaviour. <em>Paediatric population (IV Benlysta):</em> no new safety signals in =12-year olds.

<span class=""xn-location"">SILVER SPRING, Md.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 26, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of a new device indicated for use as a short-term treatment of gait deficit due to mild to moderate symptoms from multiple sclerosis (MS). The device is intended to be used by prescription only as an adjunct to a supervised therapeutic exercise program in patients 22 years of age and older. The device, called Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS), is a neuromuscular tongue stimulator that consists of a non-implantable apparatus to generate electrical pulses for stimulation of the trigeminal and facial nerves via the tongue to provide treatment of motor deficits.

<b>""MS is one of the most common neurological diseases in young adults. Today's authorization offers a valuable new aid in physical therapy and increases the value of additional therapies for those who live with MS on a daily basis,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Christopher M. Loftus</span>, M.D., acting director of the Office of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.  </b>

MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communications between the brain and other parts of the body. According to the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3110464-1&amp;h=3392393703&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ninds.nih.gov%2FDisorders%2FPatient-Caregiver-Education%2FHope-Through-Research%2FMultiple-Sclerosis-Hope-Through-Research&amp;a=National+Institute+of+Neurological+Disorders+and+Stroke"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</a>, most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40 and the disease occurs more frequently in women than in men. MS is a disease that affects people differently as it causes a variety of symptoms—such as problems with walking and balance—that can interfere with daily activities but can usually be treated or managed. The most common walking problem is unsteady, uncoordinated movements (known as ataxia) due to damage to the areas of the brain that coordinate muscle balance. People with severe ataxia generally benefit from the use of a cane, walker, or other assistive device. Physical therapy can also reduce walking problems.

The PoNS device is a portable, non-implantable device which delivers mild neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the dorsal surface of the patient's tongue. It consists of a controller and a mouthpiece that are connected to each other by a cord. The mouthpiece is held lightly in place by the lips and teeth and the control unit is worn around the neck during a patient's visit with a therapist. The controller sends signals to the mouthpiece placed on the tongue; receptors on the tongue send millions of neural impulses to the brain through natural pathways. Additionally, the therapist can connect the control unit to a computer and view usage data via software developed specifically for the PoNS device. The usage data gives the therapist information on how to improve a patient's execution of therapy by identifying potential areas of missed or shortened sessions.

The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the PoNS device through two clinical studies and a retrospective analysis of real-world data (RWD). In the first study, 20 patients with gait deficits due to MS participated in a randomized, double blind controlled trial where 10 patients used the PoNS device and the remaining 10 patients used a sham control device that did not deliver stimulation. The primary outcome measure was the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) where the clinician scored an index of eight gait tasks. The DGI was assessed for a baseline, at two weeks, six weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks. The results showed that the PoNS group on average achieved improvement in their DGI score of 7.95 at the end of the study, which was statistically significant and clinically significant, while the control group did not.

In the second study, the clinicians investigated the effects of the PoNS device with cognitive rehab and physical rehab in 14 patients with MS, who did not know whether they had the PoNS device or the sham control device, in a randomized controlled trial where seven patients used the PoNS device and the other seven used a sham device. Baseline evaluations included sensory organization tasks (SOT) and DGI scores. The PoNS device group showed a statistically significant improvement in SOT scores at 14 weeks compared to the baseline value. Analysis of DGI scores after 14 weeks showed no significant result.

The sponsor also provided a retrospective analysis of RWD collected with the PoNS device in MS patients in clinical rehabilitation settings. Patients who agreed to treatment were given 1-hr consultation, provided consent, and given baseline assessments of gait function using Functional Gait Assessment. No serious safety adverse events were reported in the clinical studies or retrospective analysis of RWD.

The PoNS device should not be used by patients with penetrating brain injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, oral health problems, chronic infectious diseases, unmanaged hypertension or diabetes, pacemakers and/or a history of seizures. Because the PoNS device delivers electrical stimulation directly to the surface of the tongue, precautions for use are similar to those for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Electrical stimulation should not be used if there is an active or suspected malignant tumor; in areas of recent bleeding or open wounds; or in areas that lack normal sensation. The PoNS device has not been tested on, and thus should not be used by, individuals under the age of 22 or who are pregnant. The PoNS device should not be used if a patient is sensitive to nickel, gold or copper.

Patients should use the PoNS device with caution, and electrical stimulation should only be used after seeking professional medical advice. For a full list of warnings and precautions to consider if using the PoNS device, please consult the device labeling.

The PoNS device was granted <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3110464-1&amp;h=38034321&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedical-devices%2Fhow-study-and-market-your-device%2Fbreakthrough-devices-prograM&A=Breakthrough+Device"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Breakthrough Device</a> designation, which is a process designed to expedite the development and review of devices that may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.

The FDA reviewed the PoNS device through the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3110464-1&amp;h=2773741852&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedical-devices%2Fpremarket-submissions%2Fde-novo-classification-request&amp;a=De+Novo"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">De Novo</a> premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low-to moderate-risk devices of a new type. Along with this authorization, the FDA is establishing special controls for devices of this type, including requirements related to labeling and performance testing. When met, the special controls, along with general controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devices of this type. This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA's 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device.

The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator to Helius Medical, Inc.

<h2>For media and investors only</h2>
<strong>Issued: London, UK and San Francisco, US</strong>

GlaxoSmithKline plc and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. today announced the submission of an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for VIR-7831 (GSK4182136) an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg) with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for progression to hospitalisation or death.

The FDA EUA submission is based on an interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial - Intent to Care Early) trial, which evaluated VIR-7831 as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalisation. Results of the interim analysis, based on data from 583 patients enrolled in the trial, demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalisation or death in those receiving VIR-7831 compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. As a result, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the trial be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy. Data from the registrational COMET-ICE trial also will form the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the FDA.

Preclinical data suggest VIR-7831 targets a highly conserved epitope of the spike protein, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. New in vitro data from pseudotyped virus assays published online in <a href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.434607v1"">bioRxiv</a> in March 2021 support this hypothesis as they demonstrate that VIR-7831 maintains activity against current circulating variants of concern including the UK, South African and Brazilian variants. Based on additional soon to be published preclinical data, VIR-7831 also appears to maintain activity against the California variant.

GSK and Vir will continue discussions with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global regulators to make VIR-7831 available to patients with COVID-19 as soon as possible.

<strong>About COMET-ICE
</strong>The multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled COMET-ICE trial investigated VIR-7831 in adults with mild or moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. The Phase 2 lead-in portion of the trial, which served as the first-in-human assessment, evaluated the safety and tolerability of a single 500 mg intravenous (IV) infusion of VIR-7831 or placebo over a 14-day period in 21 non-hospitalised adults enrolled across the United States. In October 2020, based on a positive evaluation of safety and tolerability data of VIR-7831 from the lead-in part of the trial by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, the trial began enrolling patients in North America and additional sites in South America and Europe in the global Phase 3 portion of the trial.

In March 2021, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the COMET-ICE trial be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy but is continuing to follow study participants for 24 weeks. Additional results, including epidemiology and virology data, will be forthcoming once the trial is completed.

The Phase 3 portion of the trial assessed the safety and efficacy of a single IV infusion of VIR-7831 (500 mg) or placebo in non-hospitalised participants globally. The interim analysis included 291 patients in the treatment arm and 292 patients in the placebo arm. Among those studied, 63% were Hispanic or Latinx and 7% were Black or African American. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who have progression of COVID-19 as defined by the need for hospitalisation for at least 24 hours or death within 29 days of randomisation.

<strong>About the VIR-7831 Clinical Development Programme
</strong>In addition to the COMET-ICE trial, the full COMET clinical development programme for VIR-7831 includes:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>COMET-PEAK</strong>: An ongoing Phase 2 trial with two parts: to compare the safety and viral kinetics of 500 mg intramuscularly (IM) administered VIR-7831 to 500 mg intravenously administered VIR-7831 among low-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 and to evaluate the similarity in pharmacokinetics between VIR-7831 manufactured by different processes.</li>
 	<li><strong>COMET-TAIL:</strong> A Phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021 in high-risk adults to assess whether IM-administered VIR-7831 can reduce hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19.</li>
 	<li><strong>COMET-STAR:</strong> A Phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021 in uninfected adults at high risk to determine whether IM-administered VIR-7831 can prevent symptomatic infection.</li>
</ul>
VIR-7831 is also being evaluated in the outpatient setting in BLAZE-4, a Phase 2 trial sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company, designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Eli Lilly’s bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) alone and bamlanivimab with other neutralising antibodies, including VIR-7831, versus placebo in low-risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. Additionally, VIR-7831, along with VIR-7832 will be evaluated in the Phase 1b/2a National Health Service-supported AGILE trial in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. VIR-7832 is the second monoclonal antibody from the Vir-GSK collaboration to be investigated as a potential COVID-19 treatment.

VIR-7831 and VIR-7832 are investigational compounds, not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other regulatory authority.

<strong>About VIR-7831 / GSK4182136
</strong>VIR-7831 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7831, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ technology, also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life.

<strong>About VIR-7832 / GSK4182137
</strong>VIR-7832 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and an enhanced ability to clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7832, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend and other Fc technologies, has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life. Importantly, VIR-7832 also has been engineered to potentially enhance virus-specific T cell function, which could help treat and/or prevent COVID-19 infection.

<strong>About the Vir and GSK Collaboration
</strong>In April 2020, Vir and GSK entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The collaboration uses Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.

<strong>GSK Commitment to Tackling COVID-19
</strong>GSK’s response to COVID-19 has been one of the broadest in the industry, with three potential treatments in addition to our vaccine candidates in development.

GSK is collaborating with several organisations on COVID-19 vaccines by providing access to our adjuvant technology. In addition to our work with Medicago, a collaboration with Sanofi on an adjuvanted, protein-based vaccine candidate is now in Phase 2. An earlier stage collaboration with SK Bioscience is also ongoing. SK Bioscience receives funding from CEPI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop differentiated, affordable COVID-19 vaccines for supply globally through the COVAX facility. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and contributing to protecting more people.

GSK is also working with mRNA specialist, CureVac, to jointly develop next generation, multi-valent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine. GSK will also support manufacturing of up to 100m doses of CureVac’s first generation COVID-19 vaccine.

GSK is also exploring potential therapeutic or treatment options for COVID-19 patients. We are collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to develop existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19. We recently reported that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial evaluating VIR-7831 as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalisation be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy, based on an interim analysis of data from the trial. We are seeking Emergency Use Authorization in the US and authorisations in other countries. We are also assessing whether an investigational monoclonal antibody, otilimab, can help severely ill COVID-19 patients aged over 70 who experience an overreaction of their immune system.

As restrictions are eased and social distancing measures are reduced, respiratory viral infections are likely to increase. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2, influenza or RSV can be similar. This makes it essential to correctly identify them in order to treat and manage patients accordingly, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic. This polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex test will be an important tool now and in upcoming winter seasons for simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of influenzas A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2 infections within 80 minutes.

QIAGEN launched the <i>NeuMoDx™ Flu A-B/RSV/SARS-CoV-2 Vantage Test </i>in the European Union and other markets that accept CE-IVD in November 2020 and will now begin commercialization of the test in the U.S.

QIAGEN’s new respiratory test takes advantage of the NeuMoDx 96 and NeuMoDx 288 molecular systems’ automated three-step workflow. Coupled with additional system features ­­– like processing capacity, true random access, and continuous loading of samples, reagents and consumables while the system is running – the <i>NeuMoDx™ Flu A-B/RSV/SARS-CoV-2 Vantage</i> <i>Assay</i> will be a powerful diagnostic tool for the flu season and COVID-19 pandemic.

“The authorization of this new test will become a pivotal tool for the detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 from influenza like illnesses, or ILls,” said Jean-Pascal Viola, Senior Vice President, Head of the Molecular Diagnostics Business Area and Corporate Business Development at QIAGEN. “This test will play an important role in differentiating between ILI’s while the burden of COVID-19 continues. With its ease of use and true random access, the NeuMoDx will help laboratories maintain throughput for this increased testing volume while continuing routine testing. Also, with the continued ramp up of our manufacturing capacity, the NeuMoDx will be ready to answer the needs of molecular diagnostic laboratories for 2021 and beyond.”

The new 4-plex test joins a growing menu of assays on the NeuMoDx platform, which includes tests for blood-borne viruses, sexual and reproductive health, transplant and immunocompromised disease areas. More tests are in development and expected to launch in the coming months, including VZV, adenovirus and others.

QIAGEN fully acquired NeuMoDx in September 2020 and made it one of its five growth drivers for the company to continue growing on a standalone basis – the others being Sample Prep, QIAcuity, QFT and QIAstat-Dx. The <i>NeuMoDx™ Flu A-B/RSV/ SARS-CoV-2 Vantage</i> <i>Test</i> strengthens QIAGEN’s footprint in PCR, the gold standard in coronavirus testing.

QIAGEN has a broad portfolio of testing and research solutions for COVID-19, ranging from fast singleplex and multiplex PCR tests to fast syndromic solutions (QIAstat-Dx), providing customers with a broad variety of PCR-based testing options. Furthermore, the portfolio includes RNA extraction kits and instruments as well as testing components and enzymes used by third parties for their own PCR test kits. QIAGEN’s COVID-19 portfolio also includes the QIAreach Antibody and Antigen tests, as well as SARS-CoV-2 T-Cell tests based on the QuantiFERON IGRA technology. In October 2020, the company also launched QIAprep&amp;amp which streamlines PCR workflows by integrating sample preparation and real-time PCR detection into a single kit. QIAGEN also provides NGS solutions for research into mutations of COVID-19, dPCR solutions for wastewater testing and bioinformatics with QDI.

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>Recommendation is based on the Phase III IMpower110 study showing that Tecentriq significantly improved overall survival in people with high PD-L1 expression, compared with chemotherapy</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>If approved, Tecentriq could offer people with a specific type of lung cancer a chemotherapy-free option in the first-line treatment setting

</strong></li>
</ul>
Basel, 26 March 2021 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended the approval of Tecentriq<sup>®</sup> (atezolizumab) as a first-line (initial) treatment for adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have high PD-L1 expression*, with no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumour aberrations. Based on this recommendation, a final decision regarding the approval of Tecentriq in this disease setting, along with the full details of the approved indication, is expected from the European Commission in the near future.

“Today’s CHMP recommendation is a significant step forward in bringing a new chemotherapy-free treatment with flexible treatment schedules to people in Europe with certain types of lung cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We remain committed to providing effective and tailored lung cancer treatment options, and this announcement is an important step toward this goal.”

If approved, Tecentriq would provide a new treatment option, free from chemotherapy-related adverse effects. It will also be the first and only single-agent cancer immunotherapy with three dosing options, allowing administration every two, three or four weeks, giving physicians and patients flexibility to manage their treatment.

The recommendation from the CHMP is based on data from the Phase III IMpower110 study, which showed that Tecentriq monotherapy improved overall survival (OS) by 7.1 months compared with chemotherapy (median OS=20.2 versus 13.1 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.59, 95% CI: 0.40–0.89; p=0.0106) in people with high PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3-wild-type [WT]).<sup>1</sup> Safety for Tecentriq appeared to be consistent with its known safety profile, and no new safety signals were identified. Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 12.9% of people receiving Tecentriq compared with 44.1% of people receiving chemotherapy.<sup>2

</sup>Tecentriq has shown clinically meaningful benefit in various types of lung cancer, with five currently approved indications in markets around the world. It was the first approved cancer immunotherapy for first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (chemotherapy). Tecentriq also has four approved indications in NSCLC as either a single agent or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies.

Furthermore, Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across different lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines, as well as studies in metastatic, adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings across various tumour types.

*High PD-L1 expression in the indication statement is defined as PD-L1 stained =50% of tumour cells [TC] [TC =50%] or PD-L1 stained tumour-infiltrating cells [IC] covering =10% of the tumour area [IC =10%]. PD-L1 staining is the process by which the PD-L1 protein is visualised during testing.

<strong>About the IMpower110 study</strong>
IMpower110 is a Phase III, randomised, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq monotherapy compared with cisplatin or carboplatin and pemetrexed or gemcitabine (chemotherapy) in PD-L1-selected, chemotherapy-naïve participants with Stage IV non-squamous or squamous NSCLC. The study enrolled 572 people, of whom 554 were in the intention-to-treat WT population, which excluded people with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations, and were randomised 1:1 to receive:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Tecentriq monotherapy, until disease progression (or loss of clinical benefit, as assessed by the investigator), unacceptable toxicity or death; or</li>
 	<li>Cisplatin or carboplatin (per investigator discretion) combined with either pemetrexed
(non-squamous) or gemcitabine (squamous), followed by maintenance therapy with pemetrexed alone (non-squamous) or best supportive care (squamous) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death.</li>
</ul>
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS by PD-L1 subgroup (TC3/IC3-WT; TC2,3/IC2,3-WT; and TC1,2,3/IC1,2,3-WT), as determined by the SP142 assay test. Key secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed progression-free survival, objective response rate and duration of response.

At the World Conference on Lung Cancer 2020 (January 2021), an updated, exploratory OS analysis in the PD-L1 high (TC3 or IC3)-WT population showed a continued OS benefit at a median follow-up of 31.3 months (HR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.54–1.09). Median OS in the Tecentriq arm was the same as observed at the previous analysis (20.2 months); in the chemotherapy arm, median OS was 14.7 months.<sup>3</sup> Data from this exploratory OS analysis were also submitted to the CHMP.

PD-L1 is a protein expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating cells, which suppresses the immune response and enables tumour cells to avoid detection by binding to proteins on the surface of immune cells. Immunotherapies such as Tecentriq block PD-L1 from binding to immune cells, allowing the immune system to detect and destroy tumour cells. In IMpower110, patients were classified as PD-L1 high if they had PD-L1 on at least 50% of tumour cells or if PD-L1 expressing tumour-infiltrating cells were covering at least 10% of the tumour area.

<strong>About NSCLC
</strong>Lung cancer is the one of the leading causes of cancer death globally.<sup>4</sup> Each year 1.8 million people die as a result of the disease; this translates into more than 4,900 deaths worldwide every day.<sup>4</sup> Lung cancer can be broadly divided into two major types: NSCLC and SCLC. NSCLC is the most prevalent type, accounting for around 85% of all cases.<sup>5</sup> NSCLC comprises non-squamous and squamous-cell lung cancer, the squamous form of which is characterised by flat cells covering the airway surface when viewed under a microscope.<sup>5

</sup><strong>About Tecentriq</strong>
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of NSCLC, SCLC, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and for hepatocellular carcinoma. In the US, Tecentriq is also approved in combination with Cotellic<sup>®</sup> (cobimetinib) and Zelboraf<sup>®</sup> (vemurafenib) for the treatment of people with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

Basel, 30 March 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients two months of age and older, with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four SMN2 copies. SMA is a leading genetic cause of death in infants and 5q SMA is the most common form of the disease. The condition causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement and significant unmet need remains, particularly in adults living with this condition.

“Today’s approval of Evrysdi, the first and only SMA treatment with proven efficacy that can be taken at home, potentially transforms treatment options for a broad range of people with SMA living in the EU,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph. D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “By avoiding the need for in-hospital administration, Evrysdi can reduce the treatment burden on those living with SMA, their caregivers and healthcare systems. We thank the SMA community for their partnership, the trust they have placed in us and their unyielding commitment to achieve this significant milestone.”

The approval is based on data from two clinical studies, designed to represent a broad spectrum of people living with SMA: FIREFISH in symptomatic Type 1 infants aged 2 to 7 months and SUNFISH in symptomatic Type 2 and 3 children and adults aged 2 to 25 years. SUNFISH is the first and only placebo-controlled trial to include adults with Types 2 and 3 SMA. Evrysdi demonstrated a favourable efficacy and safety profile, with the safety profile established across both trials.

""We welcome today’s approval of Evrysdi for people with SMA in Europe, and are proud of the role we have played in its development and of our partnership with Roche,” said Dr Nicole Gusset, President of SMA Europe. “A recent survey conducted by SMA Europe showed that a large proportion of people with SMA in the EU were not receiving an approved treatment which leaves them feeling helpless and frustrated. It is vital that we work together with health authorities, regulators and industry to ensure we can get this medicine to the patients who need it as soon as possible.’’

Roche is working closely with reimbursement and assessment bodies in European countries to enable broad and rapid access to patients in need. Evrysdi will be accessible to patients in Germany in the coming days and in France from early April through the cohort Temporary Authorization for Use. Reimbursement dossiers have been submitted in many countries in anticipation of today’s decision by the European Commission to minimise any delay in patient access.

The decision from the European Commission follows a positive recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in February 2021. The review was completed under the accelerated assessment pathway for medicines, which is offered to medicines deemed to be of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation. This approval is applicable to all 27 European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. Evrysdi was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation in 2019. Maintenance of Orphan Drug Designation was recently confirmed by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products based on the assumption of Evrysdi’s significant benefit over existing treatments. Evrysdi has been approved in 38 countries and submitted in a further 33 countries.

Roche leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.

<strong>About FIREFISH</strong>
In FIREFISH, 29% (12/41; p&lt;0.0001 compared to natural history) of infants treated with Evrysdi for 12 months were able to sit without support for at least five seconds, as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition. This is a key motor milestone never achieved in the natural history of Type 1 SMA. In addition, 93% of infants were alive and 85% were event-free (alive with no permanent ventilation). Furthermore, 5% (2/41) of infants were able to stand with support, as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination, and 83% were able to feed orally. Ninety per cent (37/41) had a CHOP-INTEND* score increase of at least 4 points, with 56% (23/41) achieving a score above 40; the median increase was 20 points. The median age at enrolment was 5.3 months.

<strong>About SUNFISH</strong>
In SUNFISH, children and adults treated with Evrysdi experienced a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in motor function at 12 months (1.55 point mean difference; p=0.0156) compared to placebo (1.36 points [95% CI: 0.61, 2.11]; -0.19 points [95% CI: -1.22, 0.84], respectively), as measured by a change from baseline in the Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM-32) total score. Children and adults also experienced significant improvement in upper limb function, a key secondary endpoint, at 12 months (1.59 point mean difference; p=0.0469) compared to placebo (1.61 points [95% CI: 1.00, 2.22]; 0.02 points [95% CI: -0.83, 0.87] respectively), as measured by a change from baseline in the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM). The median age at enrolment was nine years. Patients treated with Evrysdi for 2-years overall experienced maintenance of improvement in motor function between month 12 and month 24. The mean change from baseline for MFM32 was 1.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 2.92) and for RULM was 2.79 (95% CI: 1.94, 3.64).

Evrysdi demonstrated a favourable efficacy and safety profile, with the safety profile established across the FIREFISH and SUNFISH trials. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, constipation, rhinitis, diarrhoea, headache, cough and vomiting. There were no treatment-related safety findings leading to withdrawal from either study.

<strong>About Evrysdi™ (risdiplam)</strong>
Evrysdi is a survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.

Evrysdi is designed to treat SMA by increasing and sustaining the production of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement.

Evrysdi is currently being evaluated in four multicentre trials in people with SMA:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants with the primary objective of assessing the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determining the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 2 years, followed by an open-label extension. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using the total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.</li>
 	<li>JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. The study has completed recruitment (n=174).</li>
 	<li>RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.</li>
</ul>
<strong>About SMA</strong>
SMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement. Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","DUBLIN, March 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its Harmony™ Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV), the first minimally invasive therapy created to treat patients with a specific type of congenital heart defect of the right ventricle (RV), one of the four chambers of the heart, which makes it difficult for blood to travel from the heart to the lungs. The Harmony TPV, which is placed inside a patient’s native anatomy during a catheter-based procedure, was designated as a Breakthrough Therapy under FDA’s Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) program, an approval pathway intended to help patients receive more timely access to certain life-saving technologies.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defect in the United States, affecting an estimated 40,000 infants each year1 and about 1.6 million adults currently living with congenital heart disease2.

“The typical congenital heart disease patient will face a multitude of open-heart surgeries over their lifetime, to continually address issues with their pulmonary valve. Furthermore, congenital heart disease patients require lifelong monitoring, preventive care and specialized treatment all the way from childhood to adulthood,” said Matthew J. Gillespie, M.D., attending interventional cardiologist, co-director of the Pediatric Valve Center and director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and principal investigator in the Harmony TPV Clinical Study.

Approximately one in five patients born with CHD have structural malformations that disrupt the connection between the heart and the lungs3, called the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). The standard of care today in the U.S. requires that these patients receive open-heart surgery or other interventions early in life to address these malformations. Some of these patients may become candidates for the Medtronic Melody® TPV later in life, the first transcatheter heart valve shown to effectively delay open-heart surgery. For the 80% of CHD patients who require a native or surgically repaired RVOT at birth, many will need a pulmonary valve replacement later in life, which historically has required another open-heart surgery. The Harmony TPV provides these patients with an alternative to the more invasive open-heart surgical approach; instead, the valve is loaded onto a catheter and delivered via a small incision in the femoral vein or in the neck and placed directly inside the heart.

“The availability of the Harmony TPV will allow a broader range of congenital heart disease patients access to transcatheter technology,” said Nina Goodheart, president of the Structural Heart & Aortic business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. “Harmony TPV’s novel attributes make it the only non-surgical solution designed to adapt to a wide variety of anatomies for this specific patient population living with congenital heart disease.”

The FDA approval is based on clinical data from the Harmony TPV clinical study that showed excellent safety (freedom from mortality) and effectiveness (acceptable hemodynamic function) at 30 days and six months, respectively. Data from the study also showed patients treated with Harmony TPV experienced no significant reinterventions, reoperations or endocarditis at six months.

The Harmony TPV qualified as a proof of concept product for the Harmonization by Doing (HBD) for Children program. The HBD for Children program was established as a partnership among stakeholders of academia, industry and regulatory agencies in Japan and the United States, with a primary focus on the development of pediatric devices as the development of medical devices for pediatric use lags behind that of medical devices for adults in both countries. The Harmony TPV device is available for use in the United States. Outside of the U.S., Harmony TPV is limited to investigational use and not approved for sale or distribution.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","<img class=""alignnone  wp-image-49959"" src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Press-Release-300x161.png"" alt="""" width=""995"" height=""534"" />

Eli Lilly and Company, Vir Biotechnology, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline plc today announced topline data from the expanded Phase 2 BLAZE-4 trial studying low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Results showed that investigational bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700 mg co-administered with VIR-7831 (also known as GSK4182136) 500 mg demonstrated a 70 percent (p&lt;0.001) relative reduction in persistently high viral load (&gt; 5.27; cycle threshold value &lt; 27.5) at day 7 compared to placebo, meeting the primary endpoint.

In addition, bamlanivimab administered with VIR-7831 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction compared to placebo in the key virologic secondary endpoints of mean change from baseline to days 3, 5 and 7 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. There were no events for the secondary endpoint of COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death by day 29 in either study arm. One patient (in the treatment arm) visited the emergency room for COVID-19 related symptoms. No serious adverse events were seen with co-administration of bamlanivimab and VIR-7831.

Bamlanivimab and VIR-7831 bind to different regions of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Preclinical data suggest the administration of these two investigational antibodies together may provide protection against current variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are resistant to bamlanivimab.

<strong>Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly's Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Research Laboratories said:</strong> “The reduction in persistently high viral load is an important virology endpoint that was demonstrated in Lilly’s Phase 2 BLAZE-1 trial, and subsequently validated in the Phase 3 trial, to be strongly correlated with the clinical outcome of COVID-19 related hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients. These virology data support our belief that bamlanivimab and VIR-7831 together could be a promising option for COVID-19 treatment.”

<strong>George Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vir said:</strong> “This virologic evaluation of two antibodies with distinct resistance profiles is an encouraging advance in our fight against the pandemic. VIR-7831 demonstrated positive results in the COMET-ICE trial and recent pre-clinical data suggest that VIR-7831 maintains activity against current circulating variants of concern. Now, with these exciting new data from the BLAZE-4 trial, we believe that VIR-7831 has an important role to play as both monotherapy and in combination with other mAbs. We look forward to continuing conversations with the FDA about VIR-7831 as monotherapy and co-administered with bamlanivimab.”

<strong>Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&amp;D, GSK, said:</strong> “These early data from the BLAZE-4 trial, coupled with the results of the COMET-ICE trial demonstrating an 85 percent reduction in progression to hospitalisation or death using VIR-7831, support our hypothesis that by targeting a highly conserved epitope, VIR-7831 may help deliver benefits to patients. We’re continuing to work with regulators to bring VIR-7831 as a monotherapy and potentially co-administered with other monoclonal antibodies to patients in need.”

VIR-7831 is an investigational compound, not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authority. An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application for VIR-7831 has been submitted to the FDA, based on the results of the COMET-ICE (COVID-19 Monoclonal antibody Efficacy Trial - Intent to Care Early) trial, which stopped enrollment early based on data from an interim analysis demonstrating an 85 percent reduction in hospitalisation or death in patients receiving VIR-7831 as monotherapy compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. GSK and Vir will continue discussions with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global regulators to make VIR-7831 available to patients with COVID-19 as soon as possible. The three companies anticipate engaging with global regulators, including the FDA, regarding the possible co-administration of bamlanivimab and VIR-7831 for the treatment of COVID-19.

<h3><em>Breastfeeding</em></h3>
There are no available data on the presence of bamlanivimab in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.
<h3>About BLAZE-4</h3>
BLAZE-4 (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04634409?term=BLAZE-4&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-anchor=""?term=BLAZE-4&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1"">NCT04634409</a>) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone, and bamlanivimab with other neutralizing antibodies including VIR-7831 (GSK4182136) versus placebo for the treatment of symptomatic low-risk COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Across all treatment arms, the trial will enrol an estimated 1,000 participants in the United States and Puerto Rico.

The primary outcome measure is percentage of participants who have a viral load greater than 5.27 at day 7. Additional endpoints include viral load change from baseline to day 7 in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, percentage of participants who experience COVID-related hospitalization, ER visit or death from baseline through day 29, as well as safety.
<h3>About COMET-ICE</h3>
COMET-ICE is a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial evaluating VIR-7831 in adults with mild or moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease. The trial was stopped for enrolment on March 10, 2021, based on an interim analysis, which demonstrated an 85% (p=0.002) reduction in hospitalisation or death in those receiving VIR-7831 compared to placebo.
<h3>About bamlanivimab</h3>
Bamlanivimab is a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, potentially treating COVID-19. Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly scientists rapidly developed the antibody in less than three months after it was discovered by AbCellera and the scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. It was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Lilly has successfully completed a Phase 1 study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04411628"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NCT04411628</a>). A Phase 2/3 study in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting (BLAZE-1, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04427501"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NCT04427501</a>) is ongoing. A Phase 3 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (BLAZE-2, <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04497987"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">NCT04497987</a>) is ongoing. In addition, bamlanivimab is being tested in the National Institutes of Health-led ACTIV-2 study in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.

Bamlanivimab is authorised in the U.S. for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with a positive COVID-19 test, who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalisation. Bamlanivimab should be administered as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptom onset.
<h3>About VIR-7831 / GSK4182136</h3>
VIR-7831 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7831, which incorporates Xencor’s Xtend™ technology, also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life.
<h3>About the Vir and GSK Coronavirus Collaboration</h3>
In April 2020, Vir and GSK entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The collaboration uses Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.
<h3>About Lilly’s COVID-19 Efforts</h3>
Lilly is bringing the full force of its scientific and medical expertise to attack the coronavirus pandemic around the world. Existing Lilly medicines are being studied to understand their potential in treating complications of COVID-19, and the company is collaborating with partner companies to discover novel antibody treatments for COVID-19. Lilly is testing both single antibody therapy as well as combinations of antibodies as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. <a href=""https://www.lilly.com/disease-areas/covid19"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Visit Lilly’s COVID-19 disease area page</a> for resources related to Lilly's COVID-19 efforts.
<h3>GSK Commitment to Tackling COVID-19</h3>
GSK’s response to COVID-19 has been one of the broadest in the industry, with three potential treatments in addition to our vaccine candidates in development.

GSK is collaborating with several organisations on COVID-19 vaccines by providing access to our adjuvant technology. In addition to our work with Medicago, a collaboration with Sanofi on an adjuvanted, protein-based vaccine candidate is now in Phase 2. An earlier stage collaboration with SK Bioscience is also ongoing. SK Bioscience receives funding from CEPI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop differentiated, affordable COVID-19 vaccines for supply globally through the COVAX facility. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and contributing to protecting more people.

GSK is also working with mRNA specialist, CureVac, to jointly develop next generation, multi-valent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 with the potential to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine. GSK will also support manufacturing of up to 100m doses of CureVac’s first generation COVID-19 vaccine.

GSK is also exploring potential therapeutic or treatment options for COVID-19 patients. We are collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to develop existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for COVID-19. We recently reported that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the Phase 3 COMET-ICE trial evaluating VIR-7831 as monotherapy for the early treatment of COVID-19 in adults at high risk of hospitalization be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy, based on an interim analysis of data from the trial. We are seeking Emergency Use Authorization in the US and authorizations in other countries. We are also assessing whether an investigational monoclonal antibody, otilimab, can help severely ill COVID-19 patients aged over 70 who experience an overreaction of their immune system.

<p align=""justify"">ROCKVILLE, Md., March 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cerecor Inc. (NASDAQ: CERC), a biopharmaceutical company focused on becoming a leader in the development and commercialization of treatments for rare and orphan diseases, today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC (“Cerecor”), has entered into an expanded agreement with Kyowa Kirin Co., for exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize CERC-002, Kyowa Kirin’s first-in-class fully human anti-LIGHT (tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14, TNFSF14) monoclonal antibody for all indications.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“<em>We are pleased to expand our agreement for this promising first-in-class asset with Kyowa Kirin, a global leader in innovative antibody engineering technology</em>,” said Mike Cola, Chief Executive Officer of Cerecor. “<em>We have recently demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant results with CERC-002 in patients with COVID-19 ARDS and will continue to explore the role of LIGHT in additional inflammatory disorders. We believe the expansion of this agreement enables us to potentially develop this innovative therapy to fill a significant unmet medical need for a growing number of patients worldwide.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the agreement, Cerecor will receive exclusive rights for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the antibody for all indications worldwide including the United States, Europe and Japan. Kyowa Kirin has an option to retain the rights in Japan. Kyowa Kirin will receive an up-front payment from Cerecor and is also eligible to receive additional payments based on achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as sales-based royalties and a share of sublicensing income.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>CERC-002 (anti-LIGHT monoclonal antibody)</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">CERC-002 is a fully human anti-LIGHT or tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) monoclonal antibody licensed from Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. It is the only clinical stage anti-LIGHT therapy and has the potential to treat a number of LIGHT-associated immune diseases including cytokine storm-induced COVID-19 ARDS. It is currently in development for pediatric onset Crohn’s disease and cytokine storm induced COVID-19 ARDS. Cerecor has also developed a validated, high sensitivity serum/plasma free LIGHT assay in collaboration with Myriad RBM.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Role of LIGHT in Acute Inflammatory Response</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">LIGHT (homologous to <strong><u>L</u></strong>ymphotoxin, exhibits <strong><u>i</u></strong>nducible expression and competes with HSV <strong><u>g</u></strong>lycoprotein D for binding to <strong><u>h</u></strong>erpesvirus entry mediator, a receptor expressed on <strong><u>T</u></strong> lymphocytes) is a cytokine with inflammatory actions encoded by the TNFSF14 gene. LIGHT plays an important role in regulating immune responses in the lung, gut and skin. It stimulates T Cell and B Cell response as well as induces the release of other cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF and GM-CSF. Therefore, LIGHT potentially plays a key role in immune responses to viral pneumonia and other diseases.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Cerecor</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Cerecor is a biopharmaceutical company focused on becoming a leader in the development and commercialization of treatments for rare and orphan diseases.  The company is advancing its clinical-stage pipeline of innovative therapies that address unmet patient needs within rare and orphan diseases.  The company's rare disease pipeline includes CERC-801, CERC-802 and CERC-803, which are in development for congenital disorders of glycosylation and CERC-006, an oral mTORc1/c2 inhibitor in development for the treatment of complex lymphatic malformations. The company is also developing two monoclonal antibodies, CERC-002, and CERC-007.  CERC-002 targets the cytokine LIGHT (TNFSF14) and is in clinical development for treatment of severe pediatric-onset Crohn's disease, and COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome.  CERC-007 targets the cytokine IL-18 and is in clinical development for the treatment of Still’s disease (adult onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA)), and multiple myeloma (MM). CERC-006, 801, 802 and 803 have all received Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, which makes all four eligible for a priority review voucher upon FDA approval.</p>

<strong>Basel, March 30, 2021</strong> — Novartis announced today that the European Commission has approved Kesimpta<sup>®</sup> (ofatumumab) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that has shown superior efficacy with a similar safety profile compared with teriflunomide, a first-line treatment in MS<sup>2</sup>. Kesimpta is the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered once-monthly at home via the Sensoready<sup>®</sup> autoinjector pen and can be a first-choice treatment option for patients with RMS<sup>3</sup>.

“With more than 1 million people living with MS – an incurable condition so far - in Europe, it is encouraging to see that research continues to develop more treatments.  We welcome the approval from the European Medicines Agency that gives another treatment option for people living with RMS”, said Pedro Carrascal, President of the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform (EMSP).

“Slowing the worsening of disability is one of the main goals when managing RMS and evidence shows that early initiation of a high-efficacy treatment can improve long-term outcomes. Additionally, as RMS progresses, it can substantially increase overall healthcare costs as a result of increased disability,” said Haseeb Ahmad, Global Head of Value &amp; Access, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Kesimpta’s powerful efficacy and favorable safety profile has the potential to become a first-choice treatment to help improve the quality of life of people living with MS, as well as having broader value in potentially reducing medical costs associated with infusion therapies. Kesimpta is a testament to our commitment to reimagine medicine and we remain dedicated to helping to improve the lives of people living with this disease.”

<strong>About Kesimpta</strong><sup><strong>®</strong></sup><strong> (ofatumumab)</strong>
Kesimpta is a targeted, precisely dosed and delivered B-cell therapy that provides the flexibility of self-administration for adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). It is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) self-administered by a once-monthly injection, delivered subcutaneously<sup>2,3</sup>. Initial doses of Kesimpta are at Weeks 0, 1 and 2, with the first injection performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As shown in preclinical studies, Kesimpta is thought to work by binding to a distinct epitope on the CD20 molecule inducing potent B-cell lysis and depletion<sup>5</sup>. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of Kesimpta allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, and preclinical studies have shown that it may preserve the B-cells in the spleen<sup>6</sup>. Once-monthly dosing of Kesimpta differs from other anti-CD20 therapies as it allows faster repletion of B-cells, offering more flexibility in MS management<sup>7</sup>. Ofatumumab was originally developed by Genmab and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline in all indications, including RMS, in December 2015<sup>8</sup>.

Novartis is working closely with all stakeholders to ensure that eligible European patients can start benefitting from this treatment as quickly as possible. In August 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Kesimpta as an injection for subcutaneous use for the treatment of RMS, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. Additionally, Kesimpta has been approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia, Japan, Argentina, United Arab Emirates, Albania, and India.

<strong>Basel, March 30, 2021</strong> — Novartis has obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize therapeutic applications for a library of Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) targeting agents including FAPI-46 and FAPI-74, through an assignment agreement with iTheranostics, Inc., an affiliate of SOFIE Biosciences, Inc. The FAP assets were originally developed at the University of Heidelberg. The agreement also includes co-exclusive rights for Novartis to develop imaging applications for these assets.

Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell-surface protein expressed at low levels in most normal adult tissues, but over-expressed in common cancers, particularly on cancer-associated fibroblasts that form the tumor stroma, which is essential for growth<sup>1</sup><sup>,2</sup><sup>,3</sup><sup>,4</sup>. High FAP expression on cancer-associated fibroblasts is generally associated with worse prognosis in solid tumors due to promotion of tumorigenesis and progression<sup>4</sup><sup>,5</sup><sup>,6</sup><sup>,7</sup>.

“We continue to invest in radioligand therapy as one of the four unique platforms of Novartis Oncology. We believe working across multiple approaches is the key to reimagining cancer care,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President, Novartis Oncology. “FAP is an exciting target and these agents are a great fit with our radioligand therapy pipeline, which we are actively investigating across multiple tumor types. We believe this technology has the potential to transform many patients’ lives.”

Targeted radioligand therapy is a type of precision medicine combining two key elements: a targeting compound, or ligand, and a radioactive isotope, causing DNA damage that inhibits tumor growth and replication. These targeted drugs bind to markers or proteins over-expressed by certain tumors, or tumor-associated tissue, such as stroma. Due to the high-affinity of these agents for specific tumor cells or associated tumor tissue, surrounding healthy tissue is less affected.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">

KENILWORTH, N.J. &amp; MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Alydia Health announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which, after the intended Merck spinoff of Organon, Organon will acquire Alydia Health. Alydia Health is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on preventing maternal morbidity and mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) or abnormal postpartum uterine bleeding. PPH is one of the most common complications of birth, resulting in pharmacologic treatment in up to 10% of mothers and potentially resulting in emergency intervention such as hysterectomy and blood transfusions, and, in some cases, maternal death.<sup>1 </sup>The transaction is expected to close after Organon has spun off from Merck as a standalone publicly traded company.

“The acquisition aligns with Organon’s strategy to become a global leader in women’s health by focusing our product development on her unmet medical needs,” said Kevin Ali, chief executive officer, Organon. “We believe that Organon’s strong global commercial footprint in reproductive health, in conjunction with Alydia’s rapidly growing commercial capabilities in the U.S., will help enable growth of the Jada<sup>®</sup> System, including potential expansion into Europe and other developed countries, as well as in the world’s least developed markets where Organon has significant experience creating affordable access.”

The Jada System is intended to provide control and treatment of abnormal postpartum uterine bleeding or hemorrhage when conservative management is warranted. The safety and effectiveness of the Jada System was evaluated in the PEARLE study, a prospective, single-arm, clinical trial, under an approved investigational device exemption from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

“Alydia Health is thrilled to join Organon as we hold a similar vision to bring technology and therapeutic solutions to market that can improve outcomes for women in need across the globe,” said Rob Binney, chief executive officer, Alydia Health. “Our goal is to help make childbirth safer for more women. With critical gaps in maternal care, we believe this acquisition will potentially accelerate the delivery of the Jada System to more women and communities in need.”

Organon has agreed to acquire Alydia Health for up to $240 million total consideration, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, including $215 million upfront plus a $25 million contingent milestone payment. Fifty million dollars of the upfront payment will be paid prior to the spinoff of Organon; $165 million will be paid by Organon upon the close of the acquisition, and the remainder will be paid by Organon upon achievement of the milestone. Closing will be subject to customary closing conditions and completion of the spinoff of Organon from Merck, currently anticipated late in the second quarter of 2021. Alydia Health was represented by Guggenheim Securities as financial advisor.

<b>About Alydia Health</b>

Founded in 2010 with a vision to make childbirth safer for all mothers, Alydia Health is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on preventing maternal morbidity and mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) or abnormal postpartum uterine bleeding – a challenging condition to manage and a growing problem in the U.S. and globally.

Alydia’s device, the Jada System, is designed to encourage normal contraction of the uterus to stop excessive bleeding after childbirth. Alydia received 510(k) clearance (marketing authorization) from the FDA for the Jada System in August 2020 based on results from the company’s pivotal PEARLE IDE Study. Alydia’s lead institutional investors, the Global Health Investment Fund and AXA IM Alts through its Impact Investing Strategy, are social impact funds that invest in innovative technologies that can generate attractive financial returns while helping to address major public health issues worldwide.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., March 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for atogepant, an investigational orally administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant), for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults who meet criteria for episodic migraine. AbbVie anticipates a regulatory decision in late Q3 2021.

Migraine is a complex, chronic disease with attacks that are often incapacitating and can include headache pain as well as neurologic and autonomic symptoms.3 Migraine symptoms and severity range widely among individuals.

The NDA is supported by data from a robust clinical program evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally administered atogepant in nearly 2,500 patients who experience 4-14 migraine days per month including but not limited to the pivotal Phase 3 ADVANCE study, the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study, and the Phase 3 long-term safety study.

“With the integration of Allergan, AbbVie is now a committed leader in migraine with an almost 25-year history in migraine research. We look forward to potentially adding a new treatment option to our portfolio that will help more people with migraine,” said Michael Gold, MD, vice president, neuroscience development, AbbVie. “We believe atogepant is an advancement with the potential to offer meaningful benefits as a safe, effective oral preventive treatment option. Despite the availability of other migraine treatment options, the medical community and people living with migraine recognize the unmet need of those who face the unpredictable and debilitating realities of this disease.”

In the Phase 3 ADVANCE study, all active treatment arms of atogepant met their primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days over a 12-week treatment period. Also, the 30 and 60 mg doses met all six secondary endpoints with statistical significance. This study followed positive results from the Phase 2b/3 study that met the same primary endpoint across all doses and dosing regimens. The Phase 3 long-term safety study evaluated safety and tolerability of 60 mg oral atogepant administered daily over 52 weeks. The Phase 3 long-term safety study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology 2021 Virtual Annual Meeting. Results from the Phase 2b/3 study and the Phase 3 ADVANCE study were previously announced.1,4

About the Phase 3 ADVANCE Study
The pivotal Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine in those with 4 to 14 migraine days per month. A total of 910 patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups evaluating 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg of atogepant once daily, or placebo. Efficacy analyses were based on the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population of 873 patients.

The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. All atogepant dose groups met the primary endpoint and demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo. Patients treated in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg atogepant arms experienced a decrease of 3.69, 3.86, and 4.2 days, respectively, compared to patients in the placebo arm, who experienced a decrease of 2.48 days (all dose groups vs. placebo, p=<.0001).

A key secondary endpoint measured the proportion of patients that achieved at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. The trial demonstrated that 55.6%, 58.7%, and 60.8% of patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg atogepant arms, respectively, achieved at least a 50% reduction, compared to 29.0% of patients in the placebo arm (all dose groups vs. placebo, p=<.0001).

All doses were well tolerated. The most common adverse events reported with a frequency = 5% in at least one atogepant treatment arm, and greater than placebo, were constipation (6.9-7.7% across all doses vs. 0.5% for placebo), nausea (4.4-6.1% across all doses vs. 1.8% for placebo), and upper respiratory tract infection (3.9-5.7% across all doses vs. 4.5% for placebo). The majority of cases of constipation, nausea and upper respiratory tract infection were mild or moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation.

The study results were announced in a July 2020 press release and presented at the 2020 Virtual Migraine Trust International Symposium.

About the Phase 2b/3 CGP-MD-01 Study
The pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally administered atogepant demonstrated that all active treatment arms met the primary endpoint with a statistically significant reduction from baseline in mean monthly migraine days compared with placebo across the 12-week treatment period in those with 4 to 14 migraine days per month. The results were announced in a June 2018 press release and were also presented at the 2019 American Headache Society Annual Meeting.

About the Phase 3 Long-Term Safety Study
The Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label study evaluated the long-term safety and tolerability of 60 mg oral atogepant administered daily over 52 weeks for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults with 4-14 migraine days per month. Further details on the study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology 2021 Virtual Annual Meeting.

About Migraine
Migraine is a complex, chronic disease with recurrent attacks that are often incapacitating and characterized by headache pain as well as neurologic and autonomic symptoms.2 It is highly prevalent, affecting more than 1 billion people worldwide, including 39 million people in the U.S. alone,2 and is the highest cause of disability worldwide for people under 50 years of age.5,6 Due to the unpredictability and fluctuation of attack frequency and severity, migraine substantially impacts many aspects of an individual’s life both during and between attacks. Daily activities, work, school and personal relationships can be negatively affected, leading to a significant burden on the person with migraine, their family, friends, employers and healthcare systems.

About Atogepant
Atogepant is an investigational orally administered, CGRP receptor antagonist (gepant) specifically developed for the preventive treatment of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. Studies have shown that CGRP levels are elevated during migraine attacks and selective CGRP receptor antagonists confer clinical benefit in migraine.

About AbbVie Leadership in Migraine
AbbVie, a leader in the migraine space, markets BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA), the first FDA-approved, preventive treatment for adults with chronic migraine and UBRELVY® (ubrogepant), the first FDA-approved oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant), which is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.

BOTOX® Indication
BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used:

To prevent headaches in adults with Chronic Migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day in people 18 years or older
It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe and effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

BOTOX® may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX®:

Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months
Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing
There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat chronic migraine.

BOTOX® may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX®. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.

Do not receive BOTOX® if you: are allergic to any of its ingredients in BOTOX® (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.

The dose of BOTOX® is not the same as, or comparable to, any other botulinum toxin product.

Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported, including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® should be discontinued.

Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX®.

Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Cabometyx<sup>®</sup> (cabozantinib) in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo<sup>®</sup> (nivolumab) for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). This decision marks the first approval for Cabometyx in combination with another therapy in Europe and the third indication of Cabometyx in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

“Today’s EC approval for the use of Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo<sup>®</sup> provides an important new first-line treatment option for patients living with advanced renal cell carcinoma,” said Howard Mayer, Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development, Ipsen. “At Ipsen, we’re proud that this, now approved, treatment option not only addresses key efficacy benefits, but also the need to maintain quality of life for patients. We look forward to collaborating with a broad range of European stakeholders to bring this unique combination to eligible patients living with advanced renal cell carcinoma.”

The EC approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase III CheckMate -9ER trial, presented during a Presidential Symposium at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 and <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2026982&amp;esheet=52404321&amp;newsitemid=20210330006135&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=published&amp;index=1&amp;md5=52e342a468ea23e46da932c4bb814c23"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">published</a> in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine </i>(NEJM) on 3 March 2021. In the trial, Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo<sup>®</sup> demonstrated significant improvements across all efficacy endpoints. In patients receiving the combination, median progression-free survival (PFS), the trial’s primary endpoint, was doubled compared to those receiving sunitinib alone: 16.6 months vs. 8.3 months respectively (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41–0.64; p&lt;0.0001).1 Overall survival (OS) also demonstrated statistically significant improvements, reducing the risk of death by 40% versus sunitinib (HR: 0.60 [98.89% CI: 0.40-0.89]; p=0.001; median OS not reached in either arm).<sup>1</sup> In addition, Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo<sup>®</sup> demonstrated a superior objective response rate (ORR), with twice as many patients responding compared to sunitinib (55.7% vs. 27.1%; p&lt;0.0001) and 8.0% vs. 4.6% achieved a complete response respectively.<sup>1</sup> Key efficacy results were consistent across the pre-specified International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk and PD-L1 subgroups.<sup>1</sup> The combination was well tolerated and reflected the known safety profiles of the immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor components in first-line aRCC.<sup>1</sup>

Additional data from the CheckMate -9ER trial were also presented in February at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology 2021 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU). These data highlighted sustained superior efficacy of Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo<sup>®</sup> versus sunitinib for the first-line treatment of aRCC with a median follow-up of 23.5 months, as well as data suggesting significantly improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes for the combination versus sunitinib.<sup>2,3</sup> These HRQoL data, also included as part of the recently published NEJM publication, demonstrated that the combination was associated with a lower treatment burden, a decline in the risk of confirmed deterioration in HRQoL and a reduction of disease-related symptoms compared to sunitinib.<sup>1,3</sup>

“The combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib pairs two proven agents for advanced renal cell carcinoma that together have shown superior efficacy across key endpoints and subgroups of patients compared to sunitinib in the CheckMate -9ER trial. Additionally, the combination’s safety profile was manageable with known protocols, leading to a low rate of treatment-related discontinuations,” said Marc- Oliver Grimm, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Urology Department Head, Jena University Hospital. “With today’s approval, clinicians in the EU will be able to offer patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma an additional combination therapy that may help them achieve early control of their disease and improve survival outcomes.”

This approval allows for the marketing of Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo<sup>®</sup> in this indication in all 27 member states of the European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The U.S. Food and Drug administration approved Cabometyx for patients with aRCC as a first-line treatment in combination with Opdivo<sup>®</sup> in January 2021.

Ipsen thanks the patients and investigators involved in the CheckMate -9ER clinical trial.

<b>About renal cell carcinoma
</b>There are over 400,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed worldwide each year.<sup>4</sup> Of these, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of cases.<sup>5,6</sup> It is twice as common in men, and male patients account for over two thirds of deaths.<sup>4</sup> If detected in the early stages, the five-year survival rate is high, but for patients with advanced or late- stage metastatic RCC the survival rate is much lower, around 12%, with no identified cure for this disease.<sup>7,8</sup>

<b>About the CheckMate -9ER trial
</b>CheckMate -9ER is an open-label, randomized, multi-national Phase III trial evaluating patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. A total of 651 patients (23% favorable risk, 58% intermediate risk, 20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 =1%) were randomized to Cabometyx plus Opdivo<sup>®</sup> (n= 323) versus sunitinib (n= 328). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). The primary efficacy analysis is comparing the doublet combination versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co and co-funded by Exelixis, Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

<b>About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)
</b>Cabometyx is currently approved in 57 countries, including in the European Union, the U.K., Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, South Korea, Canada, Brazil, Taiwan, Hong- Kong, Singapore, Macau, Jordan, Lebanon, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Israel, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Panama, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Thailand for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior VEGF-targeted therapy; in the European Union, the U.K., Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Lebanon, Jordan, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Panama, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Thailand for previously untreated intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC; and in the European Union, the U.K., Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Israel, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Jordan, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, Peru, Panama, Guatemala, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Thailand for HCC in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.

<b>Ipsen—Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
</b>The forward-looking statements, objectives and targets contained herein are based on the Group’s management strategy, current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect the Group’s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes"", ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including the Group’s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by the Group. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, the Group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward- looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the Group's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the Group’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the Group’s activities and financial results. The Group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of the Group’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on the Group’s business, financial position or performance. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law. The Group’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to the Group’s 2018 Registration Document available on its website (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipsen.com%2F&amp;esheet=52404321&amp;newsitemid=20210330006135&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.ipsen.com&amp;index=5&amp;md5=9392303bc92a3b71b608d43bc136ab3d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.ipsen.com</a>).

<span class=""xn-location"">THOUSAND OAKS</span>, Calif. and <span class=""xn-location"">SEATTLE</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 30, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Rodeo Therapeutics Corporation (Rodeo) today announced an agreement under which Amgen will acquire Rodeo, a privately held biopharmaceutical company based in <span class=""xn-location"">Seattle</span> that develops small-molecule therapies designed to promote regeneration and repair of multiple tissues. Rodeo's 15-PGDH program is a strong strategic fit with Amgen's inflammation portfolio and efforts to develop first-in-class therapeutics for patients.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Under terms of the agreement, Amgen will acquire all outstanding shares of Rodeo in exchange for a <span class=""xn-money"">$55 million</span> upfront payment as well as future contingent milestone payments potentially worth up to an additional <span class=""xn-money"">$666 million</span> in cash. The transaction has been approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Rodeo.

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

Rodeo is focused on developing first-in-class, orally available modulators of prostaglandin biology that play an important role in tissue regeneration and repair. Rodeo's lead 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) modulators have generated compelling data in extensive preclinical studies and have clinical potential in multiple indications.

""The enzyme 15-PGDH plays a key role in many disease-relevant processes such as stem cell self-renewal and epithelial barrier repair. Given the encouraging preclinical data to date, we are excited about the opportunity to develop a novel therapy with potential in a range of important inflammatory disease indications,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Raymond Deshaies</span>, Ph.D., senior vice president of Global Research at Amgen.

Thong Q. Le, president and chief executive officer of Rodeo commented, ""We are thrilled that Amgen recognizes the potential value and differentiated profile of our 15-PGDH inhibitor program.  With decades of experience in developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative therapies for patients suffering from a broad range of immunologic diseases and conditions, Amgen is ideally positioned to rapidly advance our program into the clinic.""

<b>About Rodeo Therapeutics</b><br class=""dnr"" />Rodeo Therapeutics (Rodeo) was founded in <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2017</span> by Accelerator Life Science Partners (ALSP), a venture capital firm that catalyzes the creation of high-quality, cutting edge life science companies.  Rodeo focuses on developing small-molecule therapies that increase tissue levels of prostaglandin PGE2.  Preclinical studies have shown that increasing PGE2 through modulation of a prostaglandin-degrading enzyme (15-PGDH) protects against colitis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), accelerates hematopoietic stem cell reconstitution following bone marrow transplant, and promotes liver regeneration in a variety of animal models.  Since its founding, Rodeo has been exclusively managed by ALSP, validating the firm's ability to identify, nurture, and efficiently manage ground-breaking start-up companies that address unmet medical needs and advance patient care and outcomes.  For more information, please visit: <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3113896-1&amp;h=2274897424&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcts.businesswire.com%2Fct%2FCT%3Fid%3Dsmartlink%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.rodeotherapeutics.com%26esheet%3D52275903%26newsitemid%3D20200831005502%26lan%3Den-US%26anchor%3Dwww.rodeotherapeutics.com%26index%3D1%26md5%3Df89a3418263c90a2c85d258ae3e8d1a0&amp;a=www.rodeotherapeutics.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.rodeotherapeutics.com</a> and <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3113896-1&amp;h=1658784157&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acceleratorlsp.com%2F&amp;a=www.acceleratorlsp.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.acceleratorlsp.com</a>.

<b>Amgen Forward-Looking Statements</b><br class=""dnr"" />This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the integration of Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) into our business (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), or the Rodeo Therapeutics acquisition, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Amgen's business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.

Amgen's results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen's products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen's research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen's business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen's business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for Amgen's manufacturing activities, the distribution of Amgen's products, the commercialization of Amgen's product candidates, and Amgen's clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen's product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen's products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen's distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen's products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen's efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen's systems and Amgen's data. Amgen's stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect Amgen's business. Amgen's business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

The scientific information discussed in this news release related to Amgen's product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for Amgen's products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

Basel, 31 March 2021 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Elecsys® EBV panel has launched in countries accepting the CE Mark. Roche will file for approval with the FDA in the future. The Elecsys® EBV panel consists of three immunoassays: Elecsys EBV IgM, Elecsys EBV VCA IgG, and Elecsys EBV EBNA IgG, that detect antibodies specific to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), at different stages of infection. When used in combination, the three tests can help to define how far the infection has progressed in a patient.

Epstein-Barr Virus is one of the most common viruses in humans, infecting more than 90% of the global population by adulthood.<sup>1-2</sup> It is mainly transmitted by saliva, or via organ or cell transplants. After the first infection, EBV remains in a dormant state for life. Clinical symptoms vary according to the immune status of the patients and people with weakened immune systems may develop more severe symptoms.

“The launch of the Elecsys EBV panel is an important step for the diagnosis of infections in transplant patients as it gives clear and accurate results from a single sample”, said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “The tests help to provide the information clinicians need to diagnose and treat their patients quickly, effectively reducing the need for further confirmatory testing.”

EBV testing with immunoassays, from a blood sample, has a number of clinical uses. EBV is used to confirm the diagnosis of glandular fever in people with clinical signs and symptoms and to rule out other acute diseases with a similar clinical picture, such as certain infections in pregnant women that may cause congenital disorders. Knowing the EBV status of donors and recipients of organ and cell transplants is important, as recipients typically have a weaker immune system and may be at risk of complications.<sup>3-5</sup>

Routine EBV testing and result interpretation can be challenging, and additional testing is required for EBV infection stages in as many as 5-10% of normal samples, where the stage of infections is not clear.<sup>6-10</sup> The Elecsys EBV panel correctly classifies a high percentage of routine samples, when determining the stage of EBV infection. This means that less confirmatory testing is required, saving time and resources for the laboratory, as well as potentially leading to more effective patient management.

<strong>About Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Testing</strong>
While there is no international serological standard or consensus algorithm defined for EBV serology testing, there are different ways of conducting the EBV blood tests. Often the three immunoassays used to determine the stage of EBV infection are run in parallel. However, in an immunocompetent, adult population, the number of tests per sample can be reduced up to 50%, by using the “EBNA-first” sequential algorithm. Approximately, 70-80% of routine samples for EBV testing indicate past infections, and only 2.4% are acute infections.<sup>3</sup> Therefore, by determining the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) results first, a positive result will rule out all past infections, meaning that only EBNA-1 negative samples will have to be further tested for the presence of IgM and VCA IgG antibodies to determine the final EBV infection stage. This further reduces costs and increases the efficiency of the laboratory testing. The high specificity and sensitivity of the Elecsys EBV EBNA IgG, in combination with clearly defined results, makes this assay very well suited for the implementation of the “EBNA-first” algorithm and thus brings greater value to laboratories and patients through more cost effective and efficient testing.<sup>11</sup>

<strong>About the Elecsys EBV immunoassay panel</strong>
The Elecsys® EBV panel consists of three immunoassays to detect antibodies specific to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The three assays, Elecsys® EBV IgM, Elecsys® EBV VCA IgG, and Elecsys® EBV EBNA IgG are used in combination to accurately determine the patient's EBV infection stage. The immunoassays have excellent clinical sensitivity and specificity, and a short time to result of only 18 minutes. The tests require a small sample volume of between 6 µL to 35 µL, depending on the assay and analyzer. The addition of the EBV panel isd an important addition to the routine infectious diseases testing panel for Roche’s immunoassay portfolio.

This further addition to the Roche EBV testing portfolio follows on from the announcement of the CE Mark and FDA authorisation for the first Epstein-Barr virus quantitative test on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems to improve care for transplant patients.
