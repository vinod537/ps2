<span class=""xn-location"">TARRYTOWN, N.Y.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">July 6, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regeneron-announces-start-of-regn-cov2-phase-3-covid-19-prevention-trial-in-collaboration-with-national-institute-of-allergy-and-infectious-diseases-niaid-301088202.html#financial-modal"">REGN</a>) today announced the initiation of late-stage clinical trials evaluating REGN-COV2, Regeneron's investigational double antibody cocktail for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. <span id=""spanHghltbd38"">A</span> Phase 3 trial will evaluate REGN-COV2's ability to prevent infection among uninfected people who have had close exposure to a COVID-19 patient (such as the patient's housemate), and is being run jointly with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious <span id=""spanHghlt158e"">Diseases</span> (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). REGN-COV2 has also moved into the Phase 2/3 portion of two adaptive Phase 1/2/3 trials testing the cocktail's ability to treat hospitalized and non-hospitalized (or ""ambulatory"") patients with COVID-19.

This clinical progress follows a positive review from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee of REGN-COV2 Phase 1 safety results in an initial cohort of 30 hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

<span id=""spanHghlte882"">The Phase 3 prevention trial is being conducted at approximately 100 sites and is expected to enroll 2,000 patients in the U.S.; the trial will assess SARS-CoV-2 infection status. The two Phase 2/3 treatment trials in hospitalized (estimated enrollment =1,850) and non-hospitalized (estimated enrollment =1,050) patients are planned to be conducted at approximately 150 sites in the U.S., <span class=""xn-location"">Brazil</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Mexico</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Chile</span>, and will evaluate virologic and clinical endpoints, with preliminary data expected later this summer. All trials are adaptively-designed, and the ultimate numbers of patients enrolled will depend on trial progress and insights from Phase 2 studies.</span>

""We are running simultaneous adaptive trials in order to move as quickly as possible to provide a potential solution to prevent and treat COVID-19 infections, even in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. ""We are pleased to collaborate with NIAID to study REGN-COV2 in our quest to further prevent the spread of the virus with an anti-viral antibody cocktail that could be available much sooner than a vaccine.""

<b>About REGN-COV2<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company's proprietary <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies isolated from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. They selected the two most potent, non-competing and virus-neutralizing antibodies to create REGN-COV2 and have scaled up this dual-antibody cocktail for clinical use with the company's in-house <i>VelociMab</i><sup>®</sup> and manufacturing capabilities. REGN-COV2's two antibodies bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus's spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2848754-1&amp;h=2942288575&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftwo-science-publications-highlight-potential-regn-cov2-anti&amp;a=recent+Science+publications"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">recent <i>Science</i> publications</a>.

<span class=""xn-location"">GENEVA</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">July 6, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <a href=""https://esperare.org/en/node/13"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">EspeRare</a>, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to accelerating the development of treatments for rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to investigational <a href=""https://esperare.org/en/er-004"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">ER-004</a> protein replacement therapy for the treatment for the prenatal treatment of <a href=""https://omim.org/entry/305100?search=xlinked%20hypohidrotic%20ectodermal%20dysplaia&amp;highlight=xlinked%20hypohidrotic%20ectodermal%20dysplaia"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">XLHED</a>, a life-threatening rare genetic condition.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation was granted following the promising results from three XLHED subjects who were treated by Professor Holm Schneider with a course of ER-004 intra-amniotic injections during the third trimester of pregnancy. These results, demonstrating that this prenatal treatment has a profound and life-changing effect on these infants, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1714322"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><sup>1</sup></a>.

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

The FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation intends to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. To be granted, it requires preliminary clinical evidence demonstrating that the drug may result in substantial improvement on at least one clinically-significant endpoint compared to available therapy. This Designation allows a program to benefit from all of the FDA's fast-track program features, including proactive FDA guidance on an optimal drug development plan, organizational commitment involving FDA senior managers, and eligibility for rolling and priority reviews<a href=""https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/food-and-drug-administration-safety-and-innovation-act-fdasia/frequently-asked-questions-breakthrough-therapies"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><sup>2</sup></a>.

""Rare diseases such as XLHED often don't receive the attention and research investments that patients and their families deserve. The FDA's decision to grant Breakthrough Therapy Designation to ER-004 for the prenatal treatment of XLHED represents a significant milestone for patients and EspeRare alike in highlighting the severity of this disease and the importance of offering a potential first therapeutic option to this underserved patient population,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Caroline Kant</span>, EspeRare's Executive Director, and added, ""This innovative treatment approach has the potential to fundamentally change the lives of these patients and may also pave the way for other prenatal treatments to correct genetic diseases before birth. We look forwards continuing to working closely with the FDA and the XLHED patient community towards these goals.""

Mary Fete, Executive Director of NFED (<a href=""https://www.nfed.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias</a>), commented: ""This is extraordinary news for our Ectodermal Dysplasias community in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and around the world. The NFED led the effort for three decades to develop a treatment for XLHED. Having the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation means scientists can aspire starting a clinical trial to confirm the findings for ER-004 and ultimately, if successful, make this treatment an option for families. It brings us closer to an amazing time when children born with XLHED could have working sweat glands! We are honored to work with EspeRare to make this happen.""

In the second half of 2021, EspeRare anticipates to start enrolling patients into a pivotal study. In <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> this program also benefits from Fast Track and Orphan Drug Designation. In <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, the program receives support from the EMA's PRIME (Priority Medicines) and also the Orphan Drug Designation. With these multiple regulatory incentives, the program can aim at a streamlined worldwide development.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Emergent will provide contract development and manufacturing services beginning in 2021 to produce drug substance at large scale for commercial manufacturing with first two years valued at approximately $480 million
For the remaining three years beginning in 2023, Emergent will provide a flexible capacity deployment model to support annual dose requirements
GAITHERSBURG, Md., July 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (NYSE:EBS) today announced a five-year manufacturing services agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, for large-scale drug substance manufacturing for Johnson & Johnson’s investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Ad26.COV2-S, recombinant based on the AdVac® technology. Emergent will provide contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services to produce drug substance at large scale over five years, valued at approximately $480 million for the first two years.

“We are proud to deploy our manufacturing strength to address the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Robert G. Kramer Sr., president and chief executive officer of Emergent BioSolutions. “Advancing this collaboration is one of the ways we live our mission – to protect and enhance life.”

Under the agreement, Emergent will begin providing large-scale drug substance manufacturing for Johnson & Johnson’s adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine in 2021, upon successful completion of the activities under the previously executed Technology Transfer Agreement. For the subsequent years beginning 2023, Emergent will provide a flexible capacity deployment model to support additional drug substance batches annually.

“Over the next five years, we are committing our leading CDMO services to advance this important vaccine candidate,” said Syed T. Husain, senior vice president and CDMO business unit head at Emergent. “We have the expertise and capabilities to meet the long-term needs of our customers and provide ongoing commercial manufacturing to benefit patients.”

This long-term large-scale manufacturing agreement follows and is incremental to the contract announced in April for drug substance manufacturing technology transfer services and for reserving certain large-scale manufacturing capacity to pave the way for commercial drug substance manufacturing for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

Activities will be performed at Emergent’s Baltimore Bayview facility, a designated Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), designed for rapid manufacturing of large quantities of vaccines and treatments during public health emergencies.

Emergent’s Bayview facility has unique capabilities across four independent suites to produce at clinical scale to get candidates rapidly into the clinic, while at the same time scaling up to enable large-scale manufacturing to up to 4000L to prepare for production of commercial volumes to meet customer demand. The CIADM has the capacity to produce tens to hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine on an annual basis, based upon the platform technology being used.

Financial Considerations
The company will provide an update to its 2020 financial outlook incorporating expectations related to this agreement and any other relevant information when it reports its second quarter financial results.

Emergent’s Response to COVID-19
Emergent BioSolutions is deploying its decades of experience in vaccine and hyperimmune development and manufacturing, as well as its molecule-to-market contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services to provide comprehensive medical countermeasure solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using its established hyperimmune platforms, Emergent is developing two investigational plasma-based treatments – COVID-Human Immune Globulin (COVID-HIG) and COVID-Equine Immune Globulin (COVID-EIG). COVID-HIG is being developed as a human plasma-derived therapy candidate with $14.5 million in HHS funding and will be evaluated in two studies of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, for potential treatment of COVID-19 in severe hospitalized and high-risk patients. COVID-EIG is being developed as an equine plasma-derived therapy candidate for potential treatment of severe disease in humans. Both candidates are anticipated to be in Phase 2 clinical studies in 2020. These investigational products are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and their safety and effectiveness have not been established.

Emergent is deploying its CDMO capabilities, capacities, and expertise to support the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed to pave the way for innovators to advance COVID-19 programs. The company is working with four innovators to develop and manufacture COVID-19 vaccine candidates. For the COVID-19 vaccine response, Emergent’s integrated CDMO network provides development services from its Gaithersburg facility, drug substance manufacturing at its Baltimore Bayview facility, and drug product manufacturing at its Baltimore Camden and Rockville facilities, all in Maryland.

For 22 years Emergent has focused on advancing public health, and its multi-pronged approach to tackling COVID-19 demonstrates its commitment to its mission – to protect and enhance life.

<div class=""xn-content"">

FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J., July 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a rapid, point-of-care, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test for use with its broadly available BD Veritor™ Plus System. The launch of this new assay that delivers results in 15 minutes on an easy-to-use, highly portable instrument is critical for improving access to COVID-19 diagnostics because it enables real-time results and decision making while the patient is still onsite.
<div id=""DivAssetPlaceHolder1"" class=""PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference""></div>
The BD Veritor™ System, which is slightly larger than a cell phone, is currently in use at more than 25,000 hospitals, clinician offices, urgent care centers and retail pharmacies in all 50 U.S. states. Its one-button functionality, workflow flexibility, and ease-of-use make it an ideal solution for settings without laboratory personnel. It also offers customers real-time reporting capabilities through the BD Synapsys™ informatics solution providing them with the ability to easily report data for disease monitoring and surveillance purposes.

BD is leveraging its global manufacturing network and scale and expects to increase capacity to be able to produce 2 million tests per week by the end of September. The company already expects to produce up to 10 million tests from July through September.

""This will be a game-changer for frontline health care workers and their patients to be able to access a quick diagnostic test for COVID-19, offering results in real-time at convenient locations like retail pharmacies, urgent care centers and doctors' offices,"" said Dave Hickey, president of Integrated Diagnostic Solutions for BD. ""Such tests will also help communities be more informed and better prepared to help prevent new spikes and additional waves of COVID-19 by enabling public health workers to quickly identify infectious individuals and trace their contacts. The highly portable, easy-to-use, point-of-care format of this test, large quantity of test kits available and existing, expansive footprint of BD Veritor™ Plus instruments will help bring widespread access to COVID-19 testing in the United States and around the world as additional country-specific regulatory requirements are met.""

The launch of the BD Veritor™ Plus System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Assay is the latest effort in the company's comprehensive response to address critical health needs related to the global pandemic. The new immunoassay test joins a portfolio of three molecular solutions for COVID-19 testing that have been registered for use with the BD MAX™ Molecular System, including two with EUAs and two with CE mark. So far this year, the company has provided health care providers globally with approximately 48 million swabs for flu and COVID-19 testing, more than 2.85 million COVID-19 rapid molecular diagnostic tests on the BD MAX™ System, and millions of products used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, including infusion pumps, infusion sets and catheters.

All BD COVID-19 diagnostic products have regulatory authorizations in the markets where they are sold. BD intends to pursue 510(k) clearance for the BD Veritor™ Plus SARS-CoV-2 assay from the FDA at a later time. U.S. customers interested in BD diagnostic solutions for COVID-19 should contact <a href=""mailto:IDS.COVIDtests@bd.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">IDS.COVIDtests@bd.com</a>.

<b>About the BD Veritor™ SARS-CoV-2 Assay</b>
The BD Veritor™ Plus System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Assay is deemed to be a CLIA-waived immunoassay designed to be used in health care settings to provide an aid to rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic individuals. BD clinical studies performed at more than 20 sites across the U.S. demonstrated that the test is capable of achieving 84% sensitivity and 100% specificity, which is in line with the performance from similar immunoassay tests for Flu A/B, RSV and Strep A on the BD Veritor™ Plus System — all of which are widely-used, highly relevant and clinically valid. Similar to all immunoassay tests, FDA recommends that negative test results be confirmed by a molecular method to confirm the result, if necessary, for patient management.

The BD point-of-care test has not been cleared or approved by FDA. The test has been authorized by FDA under an EUA only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens to aid in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. It has not been authorized for use to detect any other viruses or pathogens. The test is authorized in the United States for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">July 6, 2020</span> /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company's next-generation Gallant™ implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices. The devices bring new benefits to patients with heart rhythm disorders, including a patient-preferred design without compromising battery longevity and MRI compatibility.  In addition, the new devices offer Bluetooth technology and a new patient smartphone app for improved remote monitoring, allowing for increased patient/physician engagement and streamlined communications.

It is estimated that as many as 6.1 million people in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> battle cardiac arrhythmias, or abnormal heart rhythms,<sup>1</sup> and ICDs are used to help reduce the risks of life-threatening arrhythmias. For patients with heart failure or in situations when the heart's chambers beat out of sync, CRT-Ds can be used to restore the heart's natural pattern of beating.

""We are focused on developing and delivering life-changing technologies that impact patient care in a meaningful way,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Randel Woodgrift</span>, senior vice president, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Abbott. ""The Gallant devices are the latest example of how Abbott is driving innovation to meet changing healthcare needs and helping to improve connectivity and engagement between patients and their doctors.""

The new Gallant system pairs with Abbott's secure myMerlinPulse™, an iOS- and Android™- compatible mobile smartphone app that helps streamline communication between doctors and their patients. The app provides people with access to data, device performance, and transmission history, which helps them take an active role in their healthcare. Through the myMerlinPulse app, physicians can continuously monitor their patients remotely allowing for identification of asymptomatic episodes as well as patient-triggered transmissions, which can lead to earlier intervention and reduce clinical burden.

""The ability for patients to stay connected to their doctors via their implanted device and a smartphone app has the potential to change how healthcare providers and patients communicate with each other,"" said Raffaele Corbisiero, M.D., FACC, director of electrophysiology and pacing at Deborah Heart and Lung Center, <span class=""xn-location"">Browns Mills, N.J.</span> ""The FDA's approval of Abbott's Gallant devices enables doctors to provide a more collaborative approach to treatment plans and the increased bond between a patient and provider will lead to better outcomes for all.""

The Gallant system received <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2847582-1&amp;h=2856887539&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fabbott.mediaroom.com%2F2020-02-18-Abbott-Introduces-Next-Generation-Heart-Rhythm-Management-Devices-in-Europe-Featuring-State-of-the-Art-Patient-App-and-Bluetooth-Connectivity&amp;a=CE+Mark"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">CE Mark</a> for use across <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> earlier this year.

Optional digital companion with sensor and app that provide inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data to better support therapeutic decisions also covered by EC approval
Approval based on robust efficacy and safety data from the Phase III IRIDIUM study, in which once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler was superior to once-daily Atectura® Breezhaler® (IND/MF) in improving the lung function of patients whose asthma is uncontrolled with LABA/ICS standard-of-care treatment2
Asthma affects an estimated 358 million people worldwide and can cause a significant personal, health and financial burden when not adequately controlled3,4
Basel, July 7, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Enerzair® Breezhaler® (QVM149; indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate [IND/GLY/MF]) as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a high-dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. Once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler is the first LABA/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/ICS fixed-dose combination available in the EU for these patients. The approval also includes an optional digital companion with sensor and app that provides inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data to better support therapeutic decisions. The EC decision is applicable to all 27 European Union member states as well as the UK, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

“Novartis is working to reimagine medicine for people with uncontrolled asthma, who find it a challenge to achieve effective symptom and exacerbation control,” said Rod Wooten, Head of Global Marketing, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “The approval of Enerzair Breezhaler with sensor and app in the EU is an example of our commitment to utilize data and digital offerings to make asthma control an achievable goal for patients and physicians.”

Enerzair Breezhaler is provided in a transparent capsule that allows patients to see that they have taken their medication and will be administered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device, which enables once-daily inhalation using a single inhaler. The digital companion includes a sensor that attaches to the Breezhaler device and can be linked to the Propeller Health smartphone app, providing patients with inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data that can be shared with their physician in order to help them make better therapeutic decisions.

“Today, over 45% of asthma patients at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled, demonstrating the need for new treatments, delivery approaches and patient support to ensure that medication is taken correctly and treatment goals are reached,” said Professor David Price, Chair of Primary Care Respiratory Medicine, University of Aberdeen. “Once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler plus a digital companion could help to facilitate greater collaborative disease management between physicians and patients in the EU whose asthma remains uncontrolled, despite LABA/ICS treatment.”

The EC approval is based on robust efficacy and safety data from over 3,000 asthma patients in the Phase III IRIDIUM study, in which once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler was superior to once-daily Atectura® Breezhaler® (QMF149; IND/MF) in improving the lung function of patients whose asthma is uncontrolled with LABA/ICS standard-of-care treatment2. In the IRIDIUM study, the key secondary endpoint was improvement in the Asthma Control Questionnaire score (ACQ-7) for Enerzair Breezhaler versus Atectura Breezhaler2. Both treatments delivered clinically meaningful improvements in this measure of symptoms from baseline at Week 26, but the key secondary endpoint was not met2. Among other secondary analyses, IRIDIUM explored asthma exacerbation rates, where statistically significant reductions were observed in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates with Enerzair Breezhaler compared with an established LABA/ICS standard-of-care (twice-daily salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate [Sal/Flu])2. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of the monocomponents2.

Once-daily Enerzair Breezhaler has been approved in Japan and Canada. Once-daily Atectura Breezhaler has been approved in the EU as a maintenance treatment of asthma for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older not adequately controlled with ICS and inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA)5, and in Canada and Japan. Further regulatory reviews for Enerzair Breezhaler and Atectura Breezhaler are currently underway in multiple countries including Switzerland.

In keeping with the Novartis commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our asthma combinations, Enerzair Breezhaler and Atectura Breezhaler will both be available in the hydrofluoroalkane/chlorofluorocarbon (HFA/CFC)-free Breezhaler device. Novartis aims to drive sustainability and has set ambitious targets to minimize its impact on climate, waste and water, including targets to become carbon neutral in company operations by 2025.

About Uncontrolled Asthma
Asthma affects an estimated 358 million people worldwide and can cause a significant personal, health and financial burden when not adequately controlled3,4. Despite current therapy, over 40% of patients with asthma at Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 3, and over 45% at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled6,7. Patients with uncontrolled asthma may downplay or underestimate the severity of their disease and are at a higher risk of exacerbation, hospitalization or death8-10. Barriers, such as less than optimal adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, treatment mismatch, safety issues with oral corticosteroids and ineligibility for biologics, have created an unmet medical need in asthma11-14.

*About Enerzair Breezhaler (IND/GLY/MF) in the EU
The EC approved high-dose Enerzair Breezhaler (IND/GLY/MF) 150/50/160 µg once-daily as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a high-dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year1. This formulation combines the bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA) and glycopyrronium bromide (a LAMA) with mometasone furoate (ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler device. Glycopyrronium bromide certain use and formulation intellectual property were exclusively licensed to Novartis in April 2005 by Sosei Heptares and Vectura. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in IND/GLY/MF (worldwide excluding the US).

Novartis developed the optional digital companion in collaboration with Propeller Health, which includes the Propeller Health app and sensor custom-built for the Breezhaler device.  The sensor is a CE marked Medical Device, designed and licensed to Novartis for use with the Breezhaler inhaler worldwide. The sensor includes a microchip, a microphone, Bluetooth capabilities, an antenna and a battery. The sensor does not alter the drug delivery characteristics of the Breezhaler inhaler itself but produces a recording of each administered dose. Based on the patient’s recorded medication usage, personalized content is presented within the app to help the patient better self-manage their asthma.

About the PLATINUM Clinical Development Program
The PLATINUM program, having enrolled over 7,500 patients worldwide, is the Novartis Phase III/IIIb clinical development program supporting the development of Enerzair Breezhaler (IND/GLY/MF) and Atectura Breezhaler (IND/MF). It includes four studies: the QUARTZ study, which compared a low-dose of Atectura Breezhaler with MF alone; the PALLADIUM study, which compared Atectura Breezhaler with MF and salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu); the IRIDIUM study, which compared Enerzair Breezhaler with Atectura Breezhaler and Sal/Flu; and the ARGON study, which compared Enerzair Breezhaler with a free combination of Sal/Flu plus tiotropium (Tio).

About the IRIDIUM study2
IRIDIUM was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Enerzair Breezhaler (IND/GLY/MF) with Atectura Breezhaler (IND/MF) in patients with asthma.

The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of Enerzair Breezhaler (high: 150/50/160 µg and medium:150/50/80 µg), versus two corresponding Atectura Breezhaler doses (high: 150/320 µg and medium: 150/160 µg) in patients with uncontrolled asthma, as determined by pulmonary function testing and effects on asthma control.

All patients were required to be symptomatic at screening and to have one or more exacerbations in the previous year, despite being on treatment with medium or high stable doses of LABA/ICS. Approximately 3,092 male and female adult patients with asthma were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 (approximately 618 patients in each of the treatment groups) to receive either:

Enerzair Breezhaler 150/50/80 µg (once-daily)
Enerzair Breezhaler 150/50/160 µg (once-daily)
Atectura Breezhaler 150/160 µg (once-daily)
Atectura Breezhaler 150/320 µg (once-daily)
Sal/Flu 50/500 µg (twice-daily)
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate superiority of both high-dose Enerzair Breezhaler versus high-dose Atectura Breezhaler and medium-dose Enerzair Breezhaler versus medium-dose Atectura Breezhaler, all delivered once-daily, in improving trough FEV1 (volume of air that can be forced out in the first second of expiration approximately 24 hours post-administration of study drug) after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.

The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of both doses of Enerzair Breezhaler versus respective doses of Atectura Breezhaler, in improving Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma. Other secondary analyses also included reduction of exacerbation rate, comparing high-dose Enerzair Breezhaler with high-dose Atectura Breezhaler and medium-dose Enerzair Breezhaler with medium-dose Atectura Breezhaler. Secondary analyses included efficacy comparisons for both doses of Enerzair Breezhaler compared with Sal/Flu (50/500 µg).

<strong>Tokyo and Munich - (July 6, 2020)</strong> – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for trastuzumab deruxtecan, a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens. Trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted accelerated assessment by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

&nbsp;

Validation confirms that the application is complete and commences the scientific review process by the EMA’s CHMP. Accelerated assessment is granted by the CHMP to products expected to be of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation and can significantly reduce the review timelines.

&nbsp;

“The accelerated assessment highlights the significant unmet need for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer that trastuzumab deruxtecan aims at addressing,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&amp;D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Trastuzumab deruxtecan is already available for patients in the U.S. and Japan, and we look forward to working with the EMA to bring this important new medicine to patients in the EU as quickly as possible.”

&nbsp;

The MAA is based on the positive results from the pivotal phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who had received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens. The results of the DESTINY-Breast01 trial are published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1914510"">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>.

<strong>About HER2</strong>

HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.<a title="""" href=""/Users/watancp6/Music/Trastuzumab%20Deruxtecan%20EU%20MAA%20Validation%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.docx#_edn1"">[1]</a>

&nbsp;

<strong>About HER2 Positive Breast Cancer</strong>

Approximately one in five breast cancers are HER2 positive.<a title="""" href=""/Users/watancp6/Music/Trastuzumab%20Deruxtecan%20EU%20MAA%20Validation%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.docx#_edn2"">[2]</a>,<a title="""" href=""/Users/watancp6/Music/Trastuzumab%20Deruxtecan%20EU%20MAA%20Validation%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.docx#_edn3"">[3]</a> Despite recent improvements and approvals of new medicines, there remain significant clinical needs for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.<a title="""" href=""/Users/watancp6/Music/Trastuzumab%20Deruxtecan%20EU%20MAA%20Validation%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.docx#_edn4"">[4]</a>,<a title="""" href=""/Users/watancp6/Music/Trastuzumab%20Deruxtecan%20EU%20MAA%20Validation%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.docx#_edn5"">[5]</a> This disease remains incurable with patients eventually progressing after available treatment.5

&nbsp;

<strong>About Trastuzumab Deruxtecan</strong>

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.

&nbsp;

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.

&nbsp;

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial.

&nbsp;

Trastuzumab deruxtecan has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the U.S., for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications.

&nbsp;

<strong>About the Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program</strong>

A comprehensive development program for trastuzumab deruxtecan is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy across multiple HER2 cancers including breast, gastric, and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.

&nbsp;

In May 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan received <a href=""https://www.daiichisankyo.com/media_investors/media_relations/press_releases/detail/007129.html"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation</a> from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab, and <a href=""https://www.daiichisankyo.com/media_investors/media_relations/press_releases/detail/007134.html"">Orphan Drug Designation</a> for gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer. In March 2018, trastuzumab deruxtecan received a SAKIGAKE designation for potential use in the same HER2positive patient population and a <a href=""https://www.daiichisankyo.com/media_investors/media_relations/press_releases/detail/007125.html"">supplemental New Drug Application </a>was submitted to the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for approval in April 2020.

&nbsp;

In May 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan also received <a href=""https://www.daiichisankyo.com/media_investors/media_relations/press_releases/detail/007131.html"">Breakthrough Therapy Designation</a> for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.

&nbsp;

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., July 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that, as part of Operation Warp Speed, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense have awarded Regeneron a $450 million contract to manufacture and supply REGN-COV2. REGN-COV2 is Regeneron's investigational double antibody cocktail that is currently in two Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and in a <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2849984-1&amp;h=560759439&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fregeneron-announces-start-regn-cov2-phase-3-covid-19-prevention&amp;a=Phase+3+trial"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Phase 3 trial</a> for the prevention of COVID-19 infection.

Regeneron began scaling up manufacturing of REGN-COV2 at business risk in spring of 2020. This agreement supports continued manufacturing so that the product could be made available immediately in the United States if clinical trials are successful and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or product approval. The agreement covers a fixed number of bulk lots that are intended to be completed in the fall of 2020, as well as fill/finish and storage activities. The ongoing REGN-COV2 clinical program is evaluating multiple dosages and will help establish the exact number of potential treatment doses (estimated range of 70,000 to 300,000) or prevention doses (estimated range of 420,000 to 1,300,000) available from these lots in total. Initial doses may be ready as early as end of summer. If EUA or product approval is granted, the government has committed to making doses from these lots available to the American people at no cost and would be responsible for their distribution.

""Regeneron's thirty years of investment in our innovative <i>VelociSuite<sup>®</sup> </i>antibody<i> </i>discovery and development<i> </i>technologies and our large-scale manufacturing facilities, coupled with the expertise and passion of our people, has enabled us to move the REGN-COV2 program forward at remarkable speed,"" said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. ""We made the decision early on to begin large-scale manufacturing at our own risk in order to ensure that product would be available immediately if our clinical trials prove successful and an Emergency Use Authorization is granted. This manufacturing and supply agreement with BARDA and the Department of Defense could help REGN-COV2 reach many people quickly, hopefully helping to change the course of this deadly and still-raging pandemic.""

Regeneron continues to work to maximize manufacturing capacity of REGN-COV2 within Regeneron and with potential partners.

<b>About REGN-COV2
</b>Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company's proprietary <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from COVID-19. They selected the two most potent, non-competing and virus-neutralizing antibodies to create REGN-COV2 and have scaled up this dual-antibody cocktail with the company's in-house <i>VelociMab</i><sup>®</sup> and manufacturing capabilities. REGN-COV2's two antibodies bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus's spike protein, which diminishes the ability of mutant viruses to escape treatment and protects against spike variants that have arisen in the human population, as detailed in <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2849984-1&amp;h=1444490903&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ftwo-science-publications-highlight-potential-regn-cov2-anti&amp;a=recent+Science+publications"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">recent <i>Science</i> publications</a>.

<strong>• Collaboration combines innovative plant-based and adjuvant technologies to develop and produce a COVID-19 candidate vaccine.</strong>

<strong>• Phase 1 clinical testing scheduled to begin mid-July</strong>

<strong>• Collaboration to explore vaccine development opportunities for other infectious diseases</strong>

GSK and Medicago today announced a collaboration to develop and evaluate a COVID-19 candidate vaccine combining Medicago’s recombinant Coronavirus Virus-Like Particles (CoVLP) with GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system. CoVLPs mimic the structure of the virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, allowing them to be recognised by the immune system. Use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic situation as it may boost the immune response and reduce the amount of antigen required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protect more people.

Pre-clinical results with Medicago’s CoVLP vaccine candidate demonstrated a high level of neutralizing antibodies following a single dose when administered with adjuvant.

Phase 1 clinical testing is planned to start in mid-July and will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three different dose levels of antigen combined with GSKs pandemic adjuvant and in parallel with an adjuvant from another company, administered on a one- and two-dose vaccination schedule, given 21 days apart.

Subject to successful clinical development and regulatory considerations, the companies aim to complete development and make the vaccine available, in the first half of 2021. Both companies will also evaluate expanding their collaboration to develop a post-pandemic vaccine COVID-19 candidate, should the need arise based on the further development of COVID-19 after the pandemic, and other infectious diseases.

The companies will use Medicago’s plant-based production platform to manufacture the COVID-19 vaccine antigen. This innovative technology uses the leaves of a plant as bioreactors to produce the S-spike protein which self-assemble into VLPs for use in the CoVLP vaccine candidate. It is highly scalable and can support the production of large amounts of vaccine in a significantly shortened timeline. Using this technology combined with GSKs proprietary adjuvant system, the companies expect to be able to manufacture approximately 100m doses by the end of 2021. By the end of 2023, a large-scale facility under construction in Quebec City, Canada, is expected to deliver up to 1 billion doses annually. The manufacturing platform has been used to produce a seasonal VLP flu vaccine and the license application is under review with the Canadian regulatory authority.

<strong>Dr Thomas Breuer, Chief Medical Officer, GSK Vaccines, said</strong>: “This agreement paves the way for an innovative vaccine option combining a scalable plant-based antigen technology with an adjuvant which has pandemic dose sparing capability. If successful, it will be a meaningful contributor in the fight against COVID-19. We strongly believe that multiple vaccines are needed, including post-pandemic vaccines. This plant-based technology also shows promise beyond COVID-19 and has the potential to help prevent other infectious diseases.”

<strong>Dr Bruce Clark, President and CEO of Medicago, said:</strong> “We are about to begin clinical trials with our CoVLP vaccine candidate harnessing GSKs pandemic adjuvant technology against the virus that causes COVID-19. This collaboration with GSK gives us access to a proven adjuvant which could enhance the effectiveness of our candidate vaccine, and also to a depth of scientific experience to support our development efforts.”

GSK and Medicago have entered into a binding agreement to develop and manufacture an adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine. Medicago is a privately held company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma (MTPC) and Philip Morris International (PMI), with a shareholding ratio of 67:33, respectively. PMI has signalled that it is willing to evaluate offers for its shareholding from parties that may be better suited to help Medicago on the next phase of its journey and has initiated preliminary review to determine the optimal shareholding and governance structure for Medicago’s future success.

<p align=""left"">SAN FRANCISCO, July 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Angion Biomedica Corp. (Angion), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases,  announced it has initiated in Brazil a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of ANG-3777 plus standard of care in patients with acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>
“Given the potential of ANG-3777 to broadly address acute organ injury, we believe it is important to investigate its ability to mitigate or prevent acute lung injury in patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia,” commented John Neylan, M.D., Angion’s Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. “We are commencing this study in Brazil, which continues to be tremendously impacted by COVID-19 and where we are conducting another clinical trial of ANG-3777 in patients with acute kidney injury involving cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.”

The Phase 2 trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess safety and efficacy of ANG-3777 in patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The primary endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients alive, without the need for mechanical ventilation and free of the need for renal replacement therapy (on an ongoing basis) at day 28. Angion expects to enroll approximately 100 patients in the trial. Patients will be randomized at a ratio of one-to-one to receive four intravenous doses of 2.0 mg/kg of ANG-3777 plus standard of care versus placebo plus standard of care. This ANG-3777 dosing regimen was previously approved for investigational use in Brazil, allowing for a quicker initiation of this trial for a population in need. If the Phase 2 trial is successful in patients with acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, we intend to submit an investigational new drug application (IND) in the United States

“While anti-viral therapies are most welcome in our effort to help patients with COVID-19, front-line physicians need additional tools to address the acute lung injury often seen in these patients,” commented Gregory P. Downey, MD, a pulmonologist at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado and a member of Angion's Scientific Advisory Board. “I’m hopeful data from this trial will show ANG-3777 can be another tool to help address the needs of patients impacted by this pandemic.”

The clinical rationale for this Phase 2 clinical trial of ANG-3777 in patients with acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 pneumonia is rooted in the compelling activity ANG-3777 has shown in several preclinical <em>in vivo</em> models of acute lung injury such as radiation-induced lung injury, chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>)-induced acute lung injury, bleomycin-induced pulmonary edema, TGFß1-induced mortality and lung fibrosis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock, and lung ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Following the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of ANG-3777, Angion is currently conducting a Phase 3 registration trial of ANG-3777 to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of transplant-associated acute kidney injury, also known as delayed graft function, in patients showing evidence of early kidney dysfunction and in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass.

Additional details on the Phase 2 clinical trial can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT #04459676)

<strong>About ANG-3777</strong>
ANG-3777 is a small molecule designed to mimic the biological activity of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which activates the c-Met cascade of pathways involved in tissue repair and organ repair. ANG-3777 has a substantially longer half-life than HGF and we believe ANG-3777 has the potential to be a first-in-class therapeutic addressing acute organ injury. The ongoing clinical trials of ANG-3777 include a placebo-controlled Phase 3 registration trial in transplant-associated acute kidney injury, also known as delayed graft function, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, and a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 pneumonia.

<strong>About Angion Biomedica Corp.</strong>
Angion Biomedica Corp. is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases. Angion’s lead product candidate, ANG-3777, is a small molecule designed to mimic the biological activity of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which activates the HGF/c-Met pathway, which has a central role in tissue repair and organ recovery. ANG-3777 is currently in clinical trials investigating its impact on acute organ injury, including two forms of acute kidney injury and in acute lung injury. Angion is also developing ANG-3070, an orally-bioavailable small molecule, as a potential treatment for fibrotic diseases using a precision-medicine approach.

SAN DIEGO and SHANGHAI, July 07, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turning Point Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TPTX), a precision oncology company developing next-generation therapies that target genetic drivers of cancer, and Zai Lab (NASDAQ: ZLAB), an innovative commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of Turning Point’s lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, in Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

Under the terms of the agreement, Zai Lab will obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize repotrectinib in Greater China and Turning Point Therapeutics will receive a $25 million upfront payment, with potential to receive up to an additional $151 million in development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments. Turning Point will also be eligible to receive mid-to-high teen royalties based on annual net sales of repotrectinib in Greater China.

“With more than 700,000 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients every year in Greater China, and the development and commercialization capabilities Zai Lab have shown over time in the region, we view Zai Lab as the ideal partner to help expand the potential reach of repotrectinib,” said Athena Countouriotis, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Turning Point Therapeutics. “Our collaboration with Zai Lab is a strategic step to potentially accelerate the development of repotrectinib in Greater China.”

Zai Lab anticipates opening additional sites for the TRIDENT-1 Phase 2 registrational clinical study of repotrectinib. The ongoing study is currently active in 11 countries globally and enrolling patients with <em>ROS1</em>-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and <em>NTRK</em>-positive solid tumors.

“We are very pleased to enter into this agreement with Turning Point Therapeutics. Repotrectinib is highly synergistic with Zai’s existing pipeline and further strengthens our disease area strongholds across most common tumor types in China, particularly in lung cancer. We are looking forward to bringing this potential best-in-class agent in the front-line setting and for patients previously treated with an approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) where there are no approved targeted therapies,” said Samantha Du, Ph.D., Founder, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of Zai Lab.

“In China, there is only one approved targeted therapy for patients with advanced <em>ROS1</em>-positive lung cancer and despite its efficacy, most patients eventually acquire resistance,” said Dr. Lu Shun, Director of Chinese Lung Cancer Association. “The unmet need in the <em>ROS1</em>-positive lung cancer patient population is significant. The preliminary clinical activity and safety data generated to date for repotrectinib represent a promising clinical profile. If approved, repotrectinib has the potential to be the standard of care for <em>ROS1</em>-positive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in China.”

<strong>About Repotrectinib</strong>
Repotrectinib is an investigational next-generation TKI designed to effectively target ROS1 and TRK A/B/C with potential to treat TKI-naïve or -pretreated patients. <em>ROS1</em> rearrangement is estimated to be an oncogenic driver in approximately 2 to 3 percent of patients with advanced NSCLC in China, and NTRK is estimated to be an oncogenic driver in approximately 0.5 percent of patients with other advanced solid tumors in China.

Utilizing a 22 July 2019 data cut-off, data from the Phase 1 portion of TRIDENT-1 demonstrated the potential for repotrectinib to be best-in-class for the treatment of <em>ROS1</em>-positive advanced NSCLC in patients who were not previously treated with a TKI, with a 91 percent overall response rate by blinded independent central review, a median duration of response of 23.1 months, a median progression-free survival of 24.6 months, and a generally well-tolerated adverse-event profile.

<h3><b><i>Only PARP inhibitor approved in this disease
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that <i>Lynparza </i>(olaparib) has been approved in the European Union (EU) for patients with germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is a rare, life-threatening disease with the lowest survival rate among the most common cancers.<sup>1</sup> Approximately 5-7% of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer have a germline BRCA mutation.<sup>2</sup>

The approval by the European Commission was based on results from the Phase III POLO trial, which were published in <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1903387"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a><i>. </i>It follows the <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/lynparza-recommended-for-approval-in-eu-by-chmp-for-brca-mutated-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer.html"">recommendation for approval</a> by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency.

Hedy L. Kindler, Co-Principal Investigator of the POLO trial and Professor of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, said: “Today’s approval opens the door to a new era of biomarker-led care for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in the EU, which has the highest incidence of any region globally. <i>Lynparza</i> now provides clinicians with a targeted, well-tolerated treatment option for patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer.”

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer historically have faced poor outcomes due to the aggressive nature of the disease and few treatment advances have been made over the last few decades. In the POLO trial, <i>Lynparza </i>nearly doubled median progression-free survival versus placebo after 1st-line chemotherapy for patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. This approval underscores the importance of testing all patients for germline BRCA mutations at the time of diagnosis, as it will help inform personalised treatment options for patients in the EU.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “MSD and AstraZeneca are committed to advancing research into the treatment of patients with challenging types of cancer, including those with metastatic pancreatic cancer. <i>Lynparza </i>is now the only approved PARP inhibitor in biomarker-selected patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. We look forward to making this targeted treatment option available for patients across the EU as quickly as possible.”

The POLO trial demonstrated that <i>Lynparza </i>nearly doubled the time patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death to a median of 7.4 months versus 3.8 months on placebo. The safety and tolerability profile of <i>Lynparza</i> in the trial was consistent with previous trials.

<i>Lynparza</i> is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations who have metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and have not progressed after a minimum of 16 weeks of platinum treatment within a 1st-line chemotherapy regimen.

<i>Lynparza</i> is <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/lynparza-approved-in-the-us-as-a-1st-line-maintenance-treatment-of-germline-brca-mutated-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer-30122019.html"">approved in the US</a> and several other countries as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the Phase III POLO trial, with ongoing regulatory reviews in other regions.

<b>Pancreatic cancer</b>

Pancreatic cancer is a deadly cancer with a high unmet medical need. Globally, pancreatic cancer is the 11th-most commonly occurring cancer and the seventh leading cause of cancer death.<sup>3,4 </sup>There were approximately 460,000 new cases worldwide in 2018.<sup>1 </sup>As there are often no symptoms, or symptoms may be non-specific in the early stages, it is most commonly diagnosed at an incurable stage.<sup>5,6</sup>

Around 80% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed when the disease has metastasised, at which point average survival is less than a year.<sup>7 </sup>Despite advances, few improvements have been made in diagnosis and treatment in the past few decades.<sup>8</sup> Current treatment is surgery (for which approximately only 10-20% of patients are eligible), chemotherapy and radiotherapy, highlighting a critical unmet medical need for more effective treatment options.<sup>9</sup>

<b>POLO</b>

POLO is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase III trial of <i>Lynparza</i> tablets (300mg twice daily) as maintenance monotherapy versus placebo. The trial randomised 154 patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed on 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomised (3:2) to receive <i>Lynparza</i> or placebo until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and key secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to second disease progression, overall response rate and health-related quality of life.

<b>BRCA mutations</b>

BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role in maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.

<b><i>Lynparza</i></b>

<i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with <i>Lynparza</i> leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. <i>Lynparza</i> is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

<i>Lynparza </i>is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for patients with homologous recombination deficiency positive advanced ovarian cancer. <i>Lynparza</i> is approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for gBRCAm, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. It is also approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer. <i>Lynparza </i>is approved in the US for homologous recombination repair gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in several regions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Foghorn<sup>®</sup> Therapeutics Inc., a company advancing an unprecedented class of therapeutics targeting the chromatin regulatory system in oncology, announced that it has entered into a strategic collaboration with Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada. The collaboration will apply Foghorn’s proprietary Gene Traffic Control™ product platform to discover and develop novel therapeutics against a transcription factor target believed to be relevant to a broad range of cancer patients.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“Our ability to systematically drug transcription factors using our proprietary product platform opens vast potential to discover and develop novel cancer treatments.”</p>

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200708005229/en/Foghorn%C2%AE-Therapeutics-Announces-Collaboration-Merck-Discover-Develop#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
The target is one of Foghorn’s growing number of programs emerging from the company’s product platform focused on chromatin dysregulation. The chromatin system regulates which genes a cell expresses and when it expresses them. Dysregulation of the chromatin system is implicated in up to half of all cancers.

Under the collaboration agreement, Foghorn will grant Merck exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize drugs that target dysregulation of a single transcription factor. Under the terms of the agreement, Foghorn will receive an upfront payment and research milestones and will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestones potentially totaling up to $425 million as well as royalties on sales of any approved product from the collaboration.

“We’re excited to partner with Merck given their world-renowned capabilities in cancer research and development,” said Adrian Gottschalk, president and chief executive officer of Foghorn. “Our ability to systematically drug transcription factors using our proprietary product platform opens vast potential to discover and develop novel cancer treatments.”

“There is broad evidence for the role of dysregulated transcription factors in multiple cancer types, but these have been difficult targets to drug,” said Dr. Nick Haining, vice president, Discovery Oncology &amp; Immunology, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to working with Foghorn and applying their platform to identify novel candidates to drug transcription factors in cancer.”

<b>About the Chromatin Regulatory System</b>

The chromatin regulatory system regulates gene expression by directing the movement of molecules that turn genes on and off. Disease dependencies associated with the chromatin regulatory system are estimated to impact over 2.5 million cancer patients across the United States, Europe and Japan. This system is further implicated in neurological, autoimmune, and other serious diseases.

<b>About Foghorn Therapeutics</b>

Foghorn<sup>®</sup> Therapeutics is discovering and developing a novel class of precision medicine therapeutics targeting the chromatin regulatory system in oncology. Through its scalable Gene Traffic Control™ product platform, Foghorn is systematically interrogating and drugging the chromatin regulatory system. The Company, currently in pre-clinical stage, is advancing over 10 small molecule and protein degrader programs across a wide range of cancers. The company expects to file an IND for its first program later this year.

 	<li><em>If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment with the potential to meaningfully change the course of Alzheimer’s disease</em></li>
</ul>
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and TOKYO, July 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) today announced that Biogen has completed the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the approval of aducanumab, an investigational treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The completed submission followed ongoing collaboration with the FDA and includes clinical data from the Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE studies, as well as the Phase 1b PRIME study. As part of the completed submission, Biogen has requested Priority Review. If approved, aducanumab would become the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer’s disease and would also be the first therapy to demonstrate that removing amyloid beta resulted in better clinical outcomes.

“Alzheimer’s disease remains one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. It robs memories, independence and eventually the ability to perform basic tasks from the people we love,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “The aducanumab BLA is the first filing for FDA approval of a treatment that addresses the clinical decline associated with this devastating condition, as well as the pathology of the disease. We are committed to driving progress for the Alzheimer’s disease community and look forward to the FDA’s review of our filing.”

“People living with Alzheimer’s, their families, caregivers and so many others in the community are fighting this disease every day, and the global social burden of the disease is expected to grow as the population ages,” said Dr. Haruo Naito, Chief Executive Officer at Eisai Co., Ltd. “The BLA submission is an important step in the fight against this disease, for which pathophysiological progression currently cannot be stopped, delayed or prevented.”

The aducanumab clinical development program included two Phase 3 trials, EMERGE and ENGAGE, in patients with early stage Alzheimer’s disease (enrolled patients had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 24-30). In EMERGE, patients who received aducanumab experienced significant slowing of decline on measures of cognition and function such as memory, orientation and language. Patients also experienced slowing of decline on activities of daily living including conducting personal finances, performing household chores, such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry, and independently traveling out of the home.

EMERGE (n=1,638) met its pre-specified primary endpoint, with patients treated with high dose aducanumab showing a statistically significant reduction of clinical decline from baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores at 78 weeks (22% versus placebo, P=0.01). In EMERGE, patients treated with high dose aducanumab also showed a consistent reduction of clinical decline as measured by the pre-specified secondary endpoints: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 18% versus placebo, P=0.05), the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 Items (ADAS-Cog 13; 27% versus placebo, P=0.01) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory Mild Cognitive Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-MCI; 40% versus placebo, P=0.001). Imaging of amyloid plaque deposition in EMERGE demonstrated that amyloid plaque burden was reduced with low and high dose aducanumab compared to placebo at 26 and 78 weeks (P&lt;0.001). While ENGAGE (n=1,647) did not meet its primary endpoint, Biogen believes a subset of data from ENGAGE are supportive of the outcome in EMERGE.

The aducanumab clinical program also included the Phase 1b PRIME study and its long-term extension (LTE) in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (enrolled patients had prodromal Alzheimer’s disease or mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia with MMSE scores of 20-30). The results of this study indicated that aducanumab reduced amyloid beta plaque in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, and analyses of exploratory clinical endpoints showed a reduction of clinical decline (CDR-SB and MMSE, nominally statistically significant for the 10 mg/kg dose at 12 months), which continued out to 48 months in the LTE.

“For many people living with the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, maintaining independence for as long as possible is the ultimate goal,” said Stephen Salloway, M.D., M.S., Director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program at Brown University. “If we can help slow the progression from one stage to the next, this could preserve independence, which, in turn, could have truly meaningful benefits for people living with the disease and their loved ones. Aducanumab represents a potential breakthrough that we hope will provide a treatment foothold in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease.”

The completion of the BLA submission followed a planned pre-BLA meeting with the FDA. The FDA now has up to 60 days to decide whether to accept the application for review, at which point, if accepted, Biogen expects the FDA will also inform the Company whether the BLA has been granted Priority Review designation. The BLA will then be subject to review by the FDA to make a determination on the potential approval of aducanumab.

In addition to submitting the BLA to the FDA, Biogen has continued to engage in dialogue with regulatory authorities in other markets, including Europe and Japan, working diligently toward the goal of submitting applications in these markets.

<strong>About Aducanumab</strong>

Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational human monoclonal antibody studied for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Based on clinical data, aducanumab has the potential to impact underlying disease pathophysiology, slow cognitive and functional decline and provide benefits on patients’ ability to perform activities of daily living, including conducting personal finances, performing household chores, such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry, and independently traveling out of the home. If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment to meaningfully change the course of the disease for individuals living with Alzheimer’s.

Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative development and license agreement. Since October 2017 Biogen and Eisai have collaborated on the development and commercialization of aducanumab globally.

EMERGE and ENGAGE were Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab. The primary objective of the studies was to evaluate the efficacy of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared with placebo in reducing cognitive and functional impairment as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared to placebo on clinical decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 Items (ADAS-Cog 13) and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory Mild Cognitive Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-MCI).

<strong>About Alzheimer’s Disease</strong>

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that impairs thinking, memory and independence, leading to premature death. The disease currently cannot be stopped, delayed or prevented and is a growing global health crisis, affecting those living with the disease and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tens of millions of people worldwide live with Alzheimer’s disease, and the number will grow in the years ahead, outpacing the healthcare resources needed to manage it and costing billions of dollars.

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by changes in the brain, including the abnormal accumulation of toxic amyloid beta plaque, which begins approximately 20 years before patients exhibit symptoms of the disease. Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease is one of the earliest stages of the disease when symptoms start to be more visible and can be detected and diagnosed. Current research efforts are focused on catching and treating patients as early as possible for the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

<h3><b><i>Brilinta in combination with aspirin could be the first FDA-approved dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the rate of stroke in these high-risk patients
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">

AstraZeneca today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and granted Priority Review for <i>Brilinta </i>(ticagrelor) for the reduction of subsequent stroke in patients who experienced an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for this supplemental application, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2020.

The sNDA was based on results from the Phase III THALES trial, which showed aspirin plus <i>Brilinta </i>90mg used twice daily for 30 days resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death, compared to aspirin alone.<sup>1</sup> <sup> </sup>The results were in line with the known safety profile of <i>Brilinta</i>.<sup>1</sup>

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “Patients who have had an acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at high risk of experiencing a subsequent stroke, which may be disabling or fatal. Today’s Priority Review reflects <i>Brilinta</i>’s potential as a much-needed treatment option to reduce the rate of subsequent stroke for these patients and we look forward to working with the FDA to make <i>Brilinta</i> available as soon as possible.”

The data from the THALES trial will be published in a peer reviewed journal and presented at an forthcoming medical congress.

<i>Brilinta</i> is approved in more than 110 countries for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in more than 70 countries for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among high-risk patients who have experienced a heart attack. In May 2020, the FDA approved a <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/brilinta-approved-in-the-us-to-reduce-the-risk-of-a-first-heart-attack-or-stroke-in-high-risk-patients-with-coronary-artery-disease.html"">label update</a> for <i>Brilinta</i> in the US to include the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

<b>Stroke</b>

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with 6.2 million stroke-related deaths in 2017, of which 2.7 million were due to ischaemic stroke.<sup>2</sup> Patients who experience an acute ischaemic stroke or TIA are at high risk of developing subsequent ischaemic events, with particularly high risk within 30 days after the initial event and the highest risk period being the first 24 hours after the initial event.<sup>3</sup>

<b>THALES</b>

THALES is an AstraZeneca sponsored, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, international, multicentre, event-driven trial involving more than 11,000 patients from 28 countries. It tested the hypothesis whether aspirin plus <i>Brilinta</i> is superior to aspirin alone in preventing the composite of stroke and death in patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA. Patients were randomised within 24 hours of onset of acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA symptoms and followed-up for 30 days of treatment. Trial treatments were <i>Brilinta</i> 180mg loading dose on day 1 as soon as possible after randomisation, followed by 90mg twice daily on days 2-30, or matching placebo. All patients received open-label aspirin 300-325mg on day 1, followed by 75-100mg once daily on days 2-30. The primary efficacy outcome was the time to the composite endpoint of stroke and death at 30 days. The primary safety outcome is time to first severe bleeding event according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definition, which includes fatal bleedings, intracranial haemorrhage; and bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention. Patients were followed for an additional 30 days on standard of care.

<b><i>Brilinta</i></b>

<i>Brilinta</i> (ticagrelor) is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. <i>Brilinta</i>, together with aspirin, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death), in patients with ACS or a history of myocardial infarction (MI, heart attack).

<i>Brilinta</i>, co-administered with aspirin, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS, or for patients with a history of MI and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","BRUSSELS (Reuters) – The European Commission has struck deals with drugmakers Roche and Merck KGaA to secure supplies of experimental treatments for COVID-19, a Commission source told Reuters on Wednesday.

The deals cover Roche’s arthritis drug RoActemra and Merck’s multiple sclerosis drug Rebif – both seen as potential COVID-19 therapies – and will secure supplies for any of the 27 European Union member states wanting to buy them, the source said.

The deals follow requests from EU states in May to acquire the two drugs and come as governments around the world jostle for access to potential COVID-19 therapies and vaccines, even before their efficacy is proven.

The source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic, did not disclose the terms of the deals.

Later on Wednesday, Merck said it had been asked by the Commission to be prepared to supply Rebif to EU states “upon request if and when the indication for COVID-19 treatment is adjudicated.”

Roche also confirmed talks with the EU.

“In ongoing discussions with the European Commission, Roche has committed to meeting the supply needs for eligible patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia in the EU, and around the globe, in an equitable and sustainable manner,” the Swiss company said in a statement.

A Commission spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.

Roche is doing a late-stage, 330-patient trial of RoActemra, known as Actemra in some markets, in COVID-19 patents after the anti-inflammatory drug used against rheumatoid arthritis was deployed in China in patients suffering from a severe immune system reaction. Roche said it would share data as soon as possible.

The medicine is also being tested on COVID-19 patients in combination with Gilead’s antiviral remdesivir, the only drug so far authorised by the EU for use against COVID-19. Patients are still being recruited, Roche said.

in early June, an Italian trial of Actemra in patients with early-stage COVID-19 showed it failed to help them.

Rebif was developed by Swiss biotech firm Serono before Merck bought the company.

Both drugs target proteins in the body associated with inflammation, and there is some hope they may help severely ill COVID-19 patients suffering from a so-called cytokine storm, an immune system reaction that in can lead to organ failure.

The companies said in letters to the Commission that they could meet demand from EU countries, the source said, declining to name the EU states that had expressed interest in the drugs.

EU countries will now have to agree with the companies on the supplies needed, the source added.

Brussels is also in talks with Gilead to obtain doses of remdesivir for member states and boost its production capacity. It also wants to reserve supplies of vaccines being developed by Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi.

In June, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands said they had secured 400 million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed by Britain’s AstraZeneca.

Concerns over remdesivir’s availability were ignited after Gilead pledged almost all its output to the United States.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/roche-7.jpg,Biotech|COVID-19,Merck|Roche,RoActemra|Remdesivir|Rebif ,COVID-19|Biotech|Agreement|Therapies|EU|European Commission|Signs|Supply,publish,9-7-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

In accordance with its patent license agreement with AbbVie, Mylan will be able to launch Hulio in the U.S. during <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2023</span>.

The approval of Hulio was based on a comprehensive analytical, preclinical and clinical program. The Phase 3 clinical study, ARABESC, conducted by Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics, demonstrated no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, efficacy and immunogenicity compared with the reference product, Humira, in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

Mylan and Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics entered into a partnership in 2018 for the commercialization of Hulio in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> and Mylan has commercialized the product in several countries across the region. In 2019, Mylan and Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics expanded the partnership globally. Recently, Hulio (Brand name in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>: Adalimumab BS ""FKB"") received regulatory approval in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>. These approvals and launches form part of Mylan's commitment to patients by offering one of the industry's largest and most diverse global biosimilars franchises focused on the areas of oncology, immunology, endocrinology, ophthalmology and dermatology.

Humira had brand sales of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$14.9 billion</span> in the U.S. for the 12 months ending <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2019</span>, according to AbbVie's 2019 annual report.

Hulio carries a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, such as tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections and infections due to opportunistic pathogens. Hulio should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Test for latent TB and if positive, begin TB treatment before initiating Hulio. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if the initial TB test is negative. Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including Hulio. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred in young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including Hulio.

<span class=""xn-location"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">July 9, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Kymera Therapeutics Inc. today announced the company has entered into a multi-program strategic collaboration with Sanofi (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kymera-therapeutics-and-sanofi-enter-into-strategic-partnership-to-advance-novel-protein-degrader-therapies-to-patients-301090453.html#financial-modal"">SNY</a>) to develop and commercialize first-in-class protein degrader therapies targeting IRAK4 in patients with immune-inflammatory diseases. The companies will also partner on a second earlier stage program. Kymera will receive <span class=""xn-money"">$150 million</span> in cash upfront and may receive more than <span class=""xn-money"">$2 billion</span> in potential development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as significant royalty payments. Kymera retains the option to participate in US development and commercialization for both programs. This includes the ability to participate equally in the costs, profits and losses after opt-in, and to co-promote partnered products in the US.

""This is an important collaboration for both companies and for the field of targeted protein degradation,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Nello Mainolfi</span>, Ph.D., co-founder, President and CEO of Kymera Therapeutics. ""Kymera is becoming a fully integrated biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of novel therapies with the potential to transform treatment paradigms. We are excited to partner with Sanofi, an organization with world-class  drug development and commercialization capabilities, to ensure maximal patient impact from two of our programs across multiple disease indications, while enabling Kymera to invest in key strategic areas to realize the broad potential of protein degrader therapies.""

Under terms of the collaboration, Sanofi will make an upfront payment of <span class=""xn-money"">$150 million</span> in cash to Kymera for global rights to develop its small molecule IRAK4 protein degraders in inflammation and immunology indications, and a second earlier stage undisclosed program. IRAK4 is believed to play a key role in multiple immune-inflammatory diseases, including hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Kymera will advance the IRAK4 program through Phase 1 clinical trials; Sanofi will assume clinical development and commercialization responsibilities thereafter. Sanofi will lead all clinical development activities for the second program. Kymera will have the option to participate in the development of both programs in the US during clinical development. Kymera will retain global rights to its IRAK4 program in oncology indications.

IRAK4 is a key protein involved in inflammation mediated by the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). While TLR and IL-1R signaling via IRAK4 is involved in the normal immune response, aberrant activation of these pathways is the underlying cause of multiple immune-inflammatory conditions. In pre-clinical studies, Kymera has shown oral daily administration of an IRAK4 degrader can lead to complete knockdown of IRAK4 in skin and immune cells in higher species and is well tolerated. Data presented at the most recent annual meetings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation showed potent anti-inflammatory activity in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo </i>preclinical models.

""Targeted protein degradation is an exciting modality. Kymera has developed an incredible drug discovery engine producing protein degraders with compelling and differentiated pharmacology against targets that, to date, have not been optimally addressed with other therapeutic modalities,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John Reed</span>, Global Head of Research &amp; Development at Sanofi. ""We are excited to partner with the Kymera team to advance a new generation of first-in-class therapies with the potential to eliminate underlying drivers of disease.""

Aquilo Partners, L.P. acted as financial advisor to Kymera on this transaction.

WHIPPANY, N.J.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Bayer today announced the Phase III study FIDELIO-DKD, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of finerenone versus placebo when added to standard of care for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), has met its primary endpoint. The results show that the investigational drug finerenone delayed the progression of CKD by reducing the combined risk of time to first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 40 percent from baseline over a period of at least four weeks, or renal death. Finerenone also reduced the risk of the key secondary endpoint, a composite of time to first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or heart failure hospitalization. The clinical data from FIDELIO-DKD will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">@BayerUS today announced its investigational kidney drug meets primary endpoint in Phase III FIDELIO-DKD renal outcomes study in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes</p>

The FIDELIO-DKD study is part of the largest Phase III clinical trial program to date in CKD, which enrolled 13,000 patients across a broad range of disease severity, including those with early kidney damage and more advanced stages of kidney disease. FIDELIO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, event-driven Phase III study investigating finerenone versus placebo in patients with CKD and T2D. The study included approximately 5,700 patients from more than 1,000 sites across 48 countries worldwide. Patients were randomized to receive either finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily or placebo when added to standard of care, including blood glucose lowering therapies and maximum tolerated dose of renin–angiotensin system (RAS)-blocking therapy, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).

There has been a recent uptick of both federal initiatives and public-private partnerships encouraging innovation to improve kidney health in America. In 2019, the United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services announced Advancing American Kidney Health, an executive order focused on improving the prevention, detection and treatment of kidney disease.<sup>3</sup>

<b>About Finerenone</b>

Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is an investigational, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that has been shown to reduce the harmful effects of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation.<sup>4</sup> Mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation is a major driver of kidney and heart damage.

The finerenone Phase III clinical program is comprised of two studies which randomized more than 13,000 patients with CKD and T2D from around the world to evaluate the effect of finerenone versus placebo on top of standard of care on both renal and CV outcomes. FIDELIO-DKD (<b><span class=""bwuline"">FI</span></b>nerenone in reducing ki<b><span class=""bwuline"">D</span></b>n<b><span class=""bwuline"">E</span></b>y fai<b><span class=""bwuline"">L</span></b>ure and d<b><span class=""bwuline"">I</span></b>sease pr<b><span class=""bwuline"">O</span></b>gression in <b><span class=""bwuline"">D</span></b>iabetic <b><span class=""bwuline"">K</span></b>idney <b><span class=""bwuline"">D</span></b>isease) investigated the efficacy and safety of finerenone in comparison to placebo in addition to standard of care on the reduction of kidney failure and kidney disease progression in approximately 5,700 patients with CKD and T2D.

Bayer also recently announced the initiation of the FINEARTS-HF study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study which will investigate finerenone compared to placebo in more than 5,500 symptomatic heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class II-IV) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 40 percent. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of finerenone over placebo in reducing the rate of the composite endpoint of CV death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) events (defined as hospitalizations for HF or urgent HF visits).

Chronic kidney disease is one of the most frequent complications arising from diabetes and is also an independent risk factor of CV.<sup>5</sup> Approximately 40 percent of all patients with T2D develop CKD.<sup>2</sup> Chronic kidney disease in T2D is the main cause of end stage kidney disease and kidney failure and at advanced stages, patients may need dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive.<sup>6,7</sup> Over a 10-year period, patients with CKD in T2D were three times more likely to die of CV-related causes than patients with T2D alone.<sup>8</sup> Mineralocorticoid receptor over-activation is known to trigger detrimental processes (e.g., inflammation and fibrosis) in the kidneys and heart in patients with CKD and T2D.<sup>9</sup> Chronic kidney disease in T2D is the most common cause of kidney failure worldwide.<sup>10</sup>

TORONTO--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--ProteinQure, a leader in computational protein drug discovery, announces a collaboration with the global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to apply structure-based design to the creation of therapeutic libraries with the aim of accelerating the research and development of peptide therapeutics.

Peptide therapeutics have unique properties that make them highly effective against some disease targets outside the scope of traditional small molecule and antibody modalities. However, due to the number of peptide variations, very few of these potential therapeutics have been studied. Integrating high-accuracy biophysical models and machine learning, it is possible to explore this vast therapeutic space and design peptide libraries with broad applicability in drug discovery.

The collaboration will leverage ProteinQure's expertise in computational methods and structure-based drug design. AstraZeneca will conduct experimental validation, drawing on the company’s extensive expertise in biologics.

""We are excited to collaborate with AstraZeneca to demonstrate the application of our technology on a large scale. By combining ProteinQure's proprietary computational tools with AstraZeneca’s ability to refine and validate millions of therapeutic candidates in high-throughput, we can rapidly determine therapeutic leads outside the scope of conventional synthetic antibody libraries. State-of-the-art computational tools have not been fully explored in biologics R&amp;D and we are excited to partner with AstraZeneca with the aim of discovering novel therapeutic leads for some of the most challenging drug targets faced by the industry,"" said Chris Ing, CSO, ProteinQure.

""The combination of designed peptide libraries, based on ProteinQure’s computational methods, with our advanced capabilities in display technologies will help us harness the potential of this therapeutic class. AstraZeneca continues to collaborate with cutting-edge companies in our ambition to discover novel treatments and increase the speed at which we can bring treatments to patients,"" said Tristan Vaughan, Vice President Antibody Discovery &amp; Protein Engineering, R&amp;D, AstraZeneca.

<span class=""p-body-copy-02""> </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">Remote patient monitoring and telehealth-enabled clinical programs offer care teams a sustainable and scalable way to manage patient populations with chronic or complex conditions at home, and plays a key role in supporting care for COVID-19 patients who do not require hospitalization. By regularly transmitting patient data that can provide critical insights into a patient’s condition, the collaboration will empower care teams in the U.S. with a more holistic patient view and the ability to intervene earlier before adverse events occur.  With single-use sensors and patient-owned technology supporting remote monitoring, care teams can also help reduce the need for clinicians and patients to interact in person. </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">The BioSticker is a single-use, FDA-cleared 510k class II wearable medical device to enable at-home continuous passive monitoring with minute level data across a broad set of vital signs, physiological biometrics and symptomatic events (skin temperature, resting heart rate, resting respiratory rate, body position, activity levels, cough frequency) on a single device for thirty-days. Symptoms, including those directly associated with COVID-19 such as temperature and respiratory rate, can be remotely monitored in confirmed cases of Coronavirus and also for those patients not sick enough to be hospitalized, or those suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to COVID-19, the BioSticker device will help transform the way clinicians monitor and manage patients living with chronic conditions from the home.  </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02""> </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">“Multi-parameter sensors are the natural next phase for remote monitoring, especially at a time when more patients are engaging with their physicians from home,” said James Mault, MD, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of BioIntelliSense. “Clinicians need medical grade monitoring and algorithmic clinical insights for COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and management. Accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis, the practice of medicine has been irreversibly enlightened as to the safety and efficacy of virtual care. Philips is a demonstrated leader in remote patient monitoring, and we look forward to BioIntelliSense’s technology  playing an integral role in simplifying and enhancing outcomes for patients and their doctors.”</span>

BALLERUP, Denmark, &amp; MADISON, N.J.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--LEO Pharma A/S, a global leader in medical dermatology, today announced that the Biologics License Application (BLA) for tralokinumab for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) has been accepted for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The acceptance of the BLA is the beginning of the formal review procedure for this potential new treatment by the FDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has set a target action date in the second quarter of 2021.

Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes the interleukin-13 (IL-13) cytokine which is a key driver of the underlying inflammation in atopic dermatitis.<sup>1,2</sup> The BLA submission is based on data from the pivotal ECZTRA 1, 2 and ECZTRA 3 Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of tralokinumab.<sup>3,4,5</sup> The safety and efficacy of tralokinumab have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

“There is a significant unmet medical need for people whose moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis remains uncontrolled,” said Kim Kjøller, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, LEO Pharma. “If approved, tralokinumab could become the first biologic available to specifically neutralize the IL-13 cytokine and, most importantly, offer a more targeted approach for adults living with this debilitating disease. We will continue to work closely with the FDA as they review this application.”

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently accepted the marketing authorization application (MAA) for tralokinumab and regulatory review is underway by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).
<p class=""bwalignc"">###</p>
<b>About tralokinumab</b>

Tralokinumab is an investigational, fully human, immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that works by neutralizing the IL-13 cytokine.<sup>1</sup> IL-13 plays a key role in driving the underlying chronic inflammation in AD.<sup>2,6</sup> By specifically binding to the IL-13 cytokine with high affinity, tralokinumab prevents its interaction with the receptor and the subsequent downstream IL-13 signalling.<sup>1</sup>

<b>About the pivotal ECZTRA 1, 2 and ECZTRA 3 Phase 3 studies</b>

<b>ECZTRA 1</b> and <b>ECZTRA 2</b> (ECZema TRAlokinumab trials Nos. 1 and 2) were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, 52-week trials, which included 802 and 794 patients, respectively, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tralokinumab (300 mg subcutaneous) as monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy.<sup>3,4</sup>

<b>ECZTRA 3 </b>(ECZema TRAlokinumab trial No. 3) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational 32-week study, which included 380 patients, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tralokinumab (300 mg subcutaneous) in combination with topical corticosteroid (TCS) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy.<sup>5</sup>

<b>About atopic dermatitis</b>

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory, heterogeneous skin disease characterized by intense itch and eczematous lesions.<sup>7</sup><b> </b>AD is the result of skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation, leading to chronic inflammation.<sup>8</sup> Type-2 cytokines, including IL-13, play a central role in the key aspects of AD pathophysiology.<sup>2,6</sup>

<b>Bengaluru, Karnataka, India – July 11, 2020</b>

<strong>Biocon Ltd.</strong> (BSE code: 532523, NSE: BIOCON), an innovation-led global biopharmaceuticals company, announced today that it has received the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI) approval to market <strong>Itolizumab </strong> (ALZUMAb<sup>®</sup>) Injection 25mg/5mL solution for emergency use in India for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe  ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) patients due to COVID-19.

<strong>Itolizumab</strong> is the first novel biologic therapy to be approved anywhere in the world for treating patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 complications. Biocon has repurposed Itolizumab, an anti-CD6 IgG1 monoclonal antibody launched in India in 2013 as ALZUMAb<sup>®</sup> for treating chronic plaque psoriasis, for the treatment of CRS in moderate to severe ARDS patients due to COVID-19.

<strong>Itolizumab</strong> will be manufactured and formulated as an intravenous injection at Biocon’s bio-manufacturing facility at Biocon Park, Bengaluru.

The <strong>SARS-CoV-2 virus</strong> has been observed to induce an overreaction of the immune system, generating a large number of cytokines that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, multi-organ failure and even death.

The approval of <strong>Itolizumab,</strong> from the DCGI is based on the results from the successful conclusion of a randomized, controlled clinical trial at multiple hospitals in Mumbai and New Delhi.  The study focussed on the <strong>safety</strong> and <strong>efficacy</strong> of Itolizumab in preventing CRS in moderate to severe ARDS patients due to COVID-19. The primary endpoints for reduction in mortality rate were met and other key secondary endpoints for efficacy and biomarkers were also achieved.

<strong>Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Executive Chairperson, Biocon, </strong>said: <em>“As an innovation-led biopharmaceuticals company, I am proud of the successful outcome of the pivotal study we conducted with our novel immuno-modulating anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody, Itolizumab, which has proven to be an efficacious intervention in treating the serious hyper immune response seen with COVID-19. The data is compelling and I am confident that this ‘first-in-class’ biologic will save lives and help reduce the mortality rate in our country. </em>

<em>“This positions India amongst the leading global innovators in their effort to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. The randomized control trial indicated that all the patients treated with Itolizumab (ALZUMAb<sup>®</sup>) responded positively and recovered. The control arm that did not receive Itolizumab unfortunately had deaths. Itolizumab is now approved for the treatment of CRS in patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19. We plan to take this therapy to other parts of the world impacted by the pandemic. </em>

<em>“Itolizumab’s unique mechanism of action made it an ideal candidate for treating the ‘cytokine storm’, which is a leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients. I am pleased that our R&amp;D and clinical teams delivered on this promising hypothesis in such a short period of time. It is a proud moment for all of us at Biocon and we would like more and more patients to benefit from this therapy. I also thank the investigators and the regulators for the sense of urgency that they displayed in this study. </em>

<em>“<strong>ALZUMAb</strong></em><strong><sup>®</sup></strong><em>  has a seven-year proven track record of safety as doctors in India have been prescribing this biologic to treat acute psoriasis and ensure a better quality of life for patients and now we will be able to save many critically ill COVID-19 patients with our drug.”</em>

<strong>Dr Suresh Kumar, Medical Director, Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi</strong> said: <em>“At the time of this COVID-19 pandemic, we do not have any specific treatment for patients who are losing the fight against the disease in spite of best supportive care. Lok Nayak Hospital was one of the sites of the Itolizumab study wherein we used Itolizumab to treat eight patients. These patients did extremely well even with a single dose of Itolizumab. Patients who were with initial oxygen saturation of less than 80% and would have  been put on ventilator support with little chance of survival, recovered completely when treated with Itolizumab and got discharged. I sincerely believe Itolizumab will not only help in reducing morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients but will also help us in judiciously managing healthcare resources like ICUs and ventilators for critically ill patients.”</em>

<strong>Dr Mohan Joshi, Dean, BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai,</strong> said:<em> “In our hospital, we have tried Itolizumab in many COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS and found significant improvement in clinical, radiological and inflammatory markers after administering Itolizumab. These outcomes were quite evident with one dose of Itolizumab when administered before the ‘cytokine storm’ set in. Most of the patients have well tolerated the drug. Given the growing surge of COVID-19 cases, I would recommend use of Itolizumab in moderate to severe complications in COVID-19.”</em>

<strong>Dr Sandeep Athalye, Chief Medical Officer, Biocon Biologics, said</strong><em>: “We are delighted with the results of the clinical trial for Itolizumab in India. Itolizumab demonstrated statistically significant advantage over the control arm, in one month mortality rate. Key efficacy parameters such as PaO2 and SpO2 (oxygen saturation) improvement without increasing FiO2 (oxygen flow) also showed statistically significant advantage for Itolizumab arm over the control arm. All the patients on Itolizumab arm were weaned off oxygen by Day 30, and none needed ventilator support unlike the control arm. Key secondary endpoints of clinical markers of inflammation such as IL-6, TNF-a, serum ferritin, d-dimer, LDH and CRP showed clinically significant suppression post dose and correlated well with clinical improvement in symptoms and chest x-ray images. Itolizumab was overall well tolerated and was found to be safe. Itolizumab when administered to patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19, prevents morbidity and mortality due to cytokine storm.</em>

<strong>India</strong> currently has more than 283,400* documented active coronavirus infections and over 22,100* deaths.

<strong>Itolizumab’s unique mechanism of action</strong> of immunomodulation involves binding to the CD6 receptor and blocking the activation of T lymphocytes, which in turn suppresses the pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus reducing the cytokine storm and deadly inflammatory response.

Biocon launched <strong>ALZUMAb</strong><strong><sup>®</sup></strong> (Itolizumab) in India in 2013 for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Many patients have benefitted from this novel therapy.

Basel, 13 July 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the Phase III IMagyn050 study showed that the addition of Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) to Avastin® (bevacizumab), paclitaxel and carboplatin did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) for the front-line treatment of women with newly diagnosed advanced stage ovarian cancer. Topline safety data indicate that safety for Tecentriq in combination with Avastin, paclitaxel and carboplatin was consistent with the known safety profile of the combination.


“Ovarian cancer remains one of the most aggressive cancers and is difficult to treat in its advanced stages,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “While we are disappointed by these results, we remain committed to improving outcomes for women living with this disease and are pleased that Avastin remains a key component in the treatment of front-line ovarian cancer.”

Data for the overall survival (OS) co-primary endpoint are currently immature and follow-up will continue until the next planned analysis. Results from IMagyn050 will be further evaluated in order to inform the Tecentriq gynaecologic development programme. The Tecentriq programme in ovarian cancer and cervical cancers builds on the combination with Avastin, which has helped women with newly diagnosed, advanced or relapsed ovarian and cervical cancers live without their disease getting worse, as demonstrated in results across seven pivotal Phase III trials that involved more than 5,000 women.

Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

<strong>About the IMagyn050 study</strong>
IMagyn050 is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with Avastin, paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with placebo plus Avastin, paclitaxel and carboplatin in women with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer who are undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Patients were randomised 1:1 either before or after tumour reductive surgery. The co-primary endpoints are investigator-determined PFS and OS, both in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and PD-L1-positive subpopulation. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate, safety and tolerability, as well as patient-reported improvement in abdominal pain and bloating.

The IMagyn050 study is being conducted in collaboration with The GOG Foundation, Inc. (GOG Foundation) [GOG-3015] and the European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT) [ENGOT OV-39].

<strong>About ovarian cancer</strong>
Ovarian cancer is the 8th most commonly occurring cancer in women worldwide, with nearly 300,000 new cases diagnosed each year.1,2 Ovarian cancer remains the leading cause of death from any gynaecologic malignancy, due to the fact that the majority of patients are not diagnosed until they present with already advanced stage disease, resulting in a 5-year survival rate of less than30%.3,4

<strong>About Tecentriq</strong>
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In the US, Tecentriq in combination with Avastin is approved for people with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

<strong>About Avastin</strong>
Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumour to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumour blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumour blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumour’s ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasise).

Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of new drugs and vaccines that are intended to treat or prevent serious conditions that have the potential to address an unmet medical need.<sup>i</sup> This designation was granted based on preliminary data from Phase 1/2 studies that are currently ongoing in the United States and Germany as well as animal immunogenicity studies. The companies released early data from the ongoing U.S. Phase 1/2 study for the product candidate BNT162b1 on July 1, 2020. The manuscript is available on the online preprint server <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medrxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.06.30.20142570v1&amp;esheet=52248749&amp;newsitemid=20200713005168&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=medRxiv&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f846110a3989acfe6b3e9318d1bd8c37"" rel=""nofollow"">medRxiv</a> and is concurrently undergoing scientific peer-review for potential publication. Early data from the German trial of BNT162b1 are expected to be released in July.

The BNT162 program is evaluating at least four experimental vaccines, each of which represent a unique combination of messenger RNA (mRNA) format and target antigen. BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 are both nucleoside modified RNAs, formulated in lipid nanoparticles. BNT162b1 encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen, while BNT162b2 encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein antigen.

“The FDA’s decision to grant these two COVID-19 vaccine candidates Fast Track designation signifies an important milestone in the efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2,” said <b>Peter Honig, Senior Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs, Pfizer</b>. “We look forward to continue working closely with the FDA throughout the clinical development of this program, Project Lightspeed, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these vaccine candidates.”

“We are pleased to have received Fast Track designation from the FDA for two of our vaccine candidates and look forward to working closely with the FDA, along with our partner Pfizer, to expedite the clinical development path forward,” said <b>Özlem Türeci, Chief Medical Officer</b><b>at BioNTech</b>.

The Project Lightspeed vaccine development program is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA-based technology platforms and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development capabilities. The BNT162 vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical studies and are not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. Pfizer and BioNTech are committed to developing these novel vaccines with pre-clinical and clinical data at the forefront of all decision-making of both companies. Subject to regulatory approval, the companies are expecting to start a Phase 2b/3 trial as soon as later this month and are anticipating enrolling up to 30,000 subjects. If the ongoing studies are successful, and the vaccine candidate receives regulatory approval, the companies currently expect to manufacture up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1.2 billion doses by the end of 2021.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has granted provisional approval to remdesivir (“Veklury”, Gilead Sciences Pty Ltd) as the first treatment option for COVID-19. It has received provisional approval for use in adults and adolescent patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms who have been hospitalised.

Remdesivir is the most promising treatment option so far to reduce hospitalisation time for those suffering from severe coronavirus infections. Remdesivir offers the potential to reduce the strain on Australia’s health care system. By reducing recovery times patients will be able to leave hospital earlier, freeing beds for those in need. Remdesivir will not be available to Australians unless they are severely unwell, requiring oxygen or high level support to breathe, and in hospital care.

While this is a major milestone in Australia’s struggle against the pandemic, it is important to emphasise that the product has not been shown to prevent coronavirus infection or relieve milder cases of infection.

Australia is the one of the first regulators to authorise the use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, following on from recent approvals in European Union, Japan, and Singapore. International regulatory cooperation played a significant role, as the European Medicines Agency and the Singapore Health Sciences Authority generously shared their review reports with TGA at an early stage.

TGA’s approval was able to be made within 2 weeks of the receipt of the submission with a large multidisciplinary review team at TGA working around the clock.

Provisional approval, which is limited to a maximum of six years, was made on the basis of preliminary clinical data, as there is the potential for substantial benefit to Australian patients. The sponsor, Gilead Sciences Pty Ltd may apply for full registration when additional clinical data required by the TGA to confirm the safety and efficacy of the medicine are available.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gilead-20.jpg,COVID-19|Regulatory,Gilead,Veklury|remdesivir,COVID-19|Regulatory|Adolescent|Adults|approval|receives|Severe|the TGA|Treat,publish,13-7-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

<strong> </strong>
Basel, 14 July 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) and Blueprint Medicines Corporation (NASDAQ:<a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=BPMC&amp;exchange=2"">BPMC</a>), today announced the signing of a licensing and collaboration agreement providing exclusive rights to Roche for global co-development and commercialisation outside the United States (US), excluding Greater China*. In the US, Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, will obtain co-commercialisation rights to pralsetinib, Blueprint Medicine’s investigational, once-daily oral precision therapy for the treatment of people with RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and other types of thyroid cancer, as well as other solid tumours. In addition, pralsetinib has demonstrated tumour-agnostic potential. The companies also plan to expand development of pralsetinib in multiple treatment settings and explore development of a next-generation RET inhibitor under the collaboration.

RET-activating fusions and mutations are key disease drivers in many cancer types, including NSCLC and MTC, and treatment options that selectively target these genetic alterations are limited. With the ongoing need for more targeted therapies that may offer clinical benefit to people with these types of cancers, this collaboration reflects Roche's strategy of providing treatments tailored specifically to a patient’s individual tumour profile and delivering truly personalised healthcare.

In lung cancer, pralsetinib will complement Roche’s broad portfolio of already approved medicines, alongside Alecensa, Rozlytrek, Tecentriq, Avastin and Tarceva and will further support our focus on understanding driver mutations in lung cancer through personalised treatment approaches. Beyond lung cancer, pralsetinib’s tumour-agnostic potential further expands Roche's ongoing commitment to finding new approaches to treat cancer in a more personalised way based on the genetic mutation of the disease, irrespective of the tumour site of origin.

“We are very excited to enter into this collaboration with Blueprint Medicines, a partner we have already been working with for four years, with the goal of bringing a potentially transformative treatment option to patients with rare RET-altered cancers as quickly as possible,” said James Sabry, Head of Roche Pharma Partnering. “In bringing pralsetinib to patients, we will leverage our global reach and expertise in oncology, as well as our capabilities in diagnostics and the use of real-world data toward our aim of providing personalised treatments for patients.""

“With Roche’s global reach and unparalleled expertise in personalised healthcare, this collaboration will accelerate our ability to bring pralsetinib to patients with significant medical needs around the world and expand development of pralsetinib across multiple treatment settings where there is potential to benefit even broader patient populations,” said Jeff Albers, Chief Executive Officer of Blueprint Medicines.

Blueprint Medicines has submitted a new drug application (NDA) for pralsetinib to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a marketing authorisation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of RET fusion-positive NSCLC. The FDA granted priority review with an expected decision date of 23 November 2020. Blueprint Medicines has also submitted an NDA to the US FDA for RET mutation-positive MTC and RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer. The FDA has accepted the MTC application for its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot programme, which aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible.

Under the terms of the agreement, Blueprint Medicines will receive an upfront cash payment of $675 million and a $100 million equity investment in Blueprint Medicines’ common stock. In addition, Blueprint Medicines is eligible to receive up to $927 million in contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, and royalties on net product sales outside the US. Roche and Blueprint Medicines will share global development expenses based on pre-specified cost-sharing percentages and equally share profits and losses in the US.

The closing of a minority portion of the equity investment is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions.

<strong>About RET-Altered Solid Tumours</strong>
RET activating fusions and mutations are key disease drivers in many cancer types, including NSCLC and multiple types of thyroid cancer. RET fusions are implicated in approximately 1 to 2 percent of patients with NSCLC and approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients with papillary thyroid cancer, while RET mutations are implicated in approximately 90 percent of patients with advanced MTC. In addition, oncogenic RET alterations are observed at low frequencies in colorectal, breast, pancreatic and other cancers, and RET fusions have been observed in patients with treatment-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

<strong>About Pralsetinib</strong>
Pralsetinib is an investigational, once-daily oral precision therapy designed to selectively target RET alterations, including fusions and mutations, regardless of the tissue of origin. Preclinical data have shown that pralsetinib potently inhibits primary RET fusions and mutations that cause cancer in subsets of patients, as well as secondary RET mutations predicted to drive resistance to treatment. Blueprint Medicines is developing pralsetinib for the treatment of patients with RET-altered NSCLC, various types of thyroid cancer and other solid tumours.

</ul>
Basel, 14 July 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that its investigational CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific mosunetuzumab has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.

“We are pleased that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to mosunetuzumab, recognising the promising early efficacy data for this molecule and the remaining unmet need in follicular lymphoma,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Indeed, we are excited by the potential of both our CD20xCD3 bispecific antibodies – mosunetuzumab and glofitamab – in development for difficult-to-treat lymphomas, and remain committed to developing innovative therapies to improve outcomes for patients.”

This designation was granted based on encouraging efficacy results observed in the phase I/Ib GO29781 study [<u><a title=""NCT02500407"" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tNVzmea7VNfCpLMcxs6Bfl0FaO8olKYqV_IvZZ1NU9GLURcBNAvxTh4fZsD7dYYJV3uEQhZaOoof0NiPleA1m78vJVA0EIQM8PzwnbVl28X6mjsVJyIUva7HuuwJbVMm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">NCT02500407</a></u>] investigating mosunetuzumab in R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The safety profile of this T-cell engaging bispecific was consistent with its mechanism of action. Results from this study were previously presented at the American Society of Hematology 2019 Annual Meeting.

BTD is designed to accelerate the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. This is the 34th BTD for Roche’s portfolio of medicines, and the 10th designation for its haematology portfolio.

A robust clinical development programme for mosunetuzumab is ongoing across a number of lymphoma indications and earlier lines of treatment, investigating the molecule alone and in combination to identify where mosunetuzumab may be able to provide benefit over current treatment options. This includes further investigation of mosunetuzumab in combination with Roche’s Polivy® (polatuzumab vedotin) and Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) as well as with chemotherapy regimens and non-Roche molecules.

<strong>About mosunetuzumab
</strong>Mosunetuzumab is an investigational CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific designed to target CD20 on the surface of B-cells and CD3 on the surface of T-cells. This dual targeting activates and redirects a patient’s existing T-cells to engage and eliminate target B-cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the B-cells. Mosunetuzumab has a structure similar to that of a natural human antibody in that it has two ‘Fab’ regions, but is different from naturally-occurring antibodies in that one ‘Fab’ region targets CD20 and the other ‘Fab’ region targets CD3. A robust clinical development programme for mosunetuzumab is ongoing, investigating the molecule as a monotherapy and in combination with other medicines, for the treatment of people with CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and other blood cancers.
<strong>

<p align=""justify"">“Given that Trodelvy can cause tumor-cell death with possible neoantigen release, combining it with an immune-stimulating agent, such as atezolizumab, could potentially create a synergistic effect, which can lead to a promising therapeutic option,” said Dr. Loretta M. Itri, Chief Medical Officer of Immunomedics.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the extension, Roche will be conducting two open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 1b/2 studies using its MORPHEUS platform. The MORPHEUS-mUC study will randomize CPI-naïve mUC patients who have failed platinum-containing chemotherapy to receive the Tecentriq plus Trodelvy combination or Tecentriq alone. The second study, Morpheus-Lung, will enroll CPI-experienced mNSCLC patients after failure with platinum-based regimen to receive either Tecentriq and Trodelvy or docetaxel alone.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are pleased to be expanding our partnership with Roche, a global leader in cancer therapy,” commented Dr. Behzad Aghazadeh, Executive Chairman of Immunomedics. “We believe these combination studies will build a strong foundation for early-line cancer treatment developments.”</p>

Though condensates have been visible through the microscope for more than a century, new research has only recently revealed them to be key players in a wide range of normal biological functions and disease processes, including viral infection.

While drug discovery has traditionally treated the cell’s molecular activity largely as a black box, or focused on individual molecular targets, Dewpoint’s high-throughput condensate platform provides the ability to see and understand the complex interactions of biomolecular communities—and to find drugs that intervene in entirely new ways. By targeting both individual molecules and interacting groups of molecules within condensate communities, Dewpoint aims to create new treatments for diseases that were previously untreatable or incurable.

Such is the case with HIV. “Dewpoint and Merck will leverage Dewpoint’s expertise in condensates to develop an HIV drug candidate with a unique mechanism that may provide the potential to cure rather than suppress the infection,” said <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdewpointx.com%2Fteam%2Fann-kwong%2F&amp;esheet=52248642&amp;newsitemid=20200713005079&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Ann+Kwong&amp;index=4&amp;md5=fa0cd5e3a504c33e5dc3689eb35262f4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Ann Kwong</a>, Dewpoint Executive Vice President, R&amp;D.

“For me, it’s really exciting and inspiring to be partnering with Merck, a leader in the HIV treatment field,” said Kwong. “I’m thrilled that we have the chance to work together to try to develop the first HIV curative treatment.”

“At Merck we remain committed to advancing new treatment options for patients with HIV, including exploring novel ways toward a potential cure,” said Daria Hazuda, vice president Infectious Diseases Discovery, Merck Research Laboratories and Chief Scientific Officer, Merck Exploratory Science Center. “We look forward to working with the Dewpoint team.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Dewpoint will receive up to $305 million in upfront and milestone payments, as well as royalties on sales of any approved product resulting from the collaboration.

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"">BACKGROUND</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and spread globally, prompting an international effort to accelerate development of a vaccine. The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"">METHODS</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 µg, 100 µg, or 250 µg. There were 15 participants in each dose group.</p>

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"">RESULTS</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti–S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-µg group, 109,209 in the 100-µg group, and 213,526 in the 250-µg group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). After the second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants evaluated, with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose, and three participants (21%) in the 250-µg dose group reported one or more severe adverse events.</p>

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"">CONCLUSIONS</h2>

<p class=""f-body f-body--w-dropcap"">The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and spread globally, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).<sup><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home#"" data-behavior=""ShowPopupTip"" data-popup-content-ids=""ref1"">1</a></sup> The urgent need for vaccines prompted an international response, with more than 120 candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development within the first 5 months of 2020.<sup><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home#"" data-behavior=""ShowPopupTip"" data-popup-content-ids=""ref2"">2</a></sup> The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated, nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)–based vaccine that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein stabilized in its prefusion conformation.

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"" data-collapsible-trigger="""">TRIAL DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label clinical trial designed to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273. Eligible participants were healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age who received two injections of trial vaccine 28 days apart at a dose of 25 µg, 100 µg, or 250 µg. On the basis of the results obtained in patients at these dose levels, additional groups were added to the protocol; those results will be reported in a subsequent publication. Participants were not screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by serology or polymerase chain reaction before enrollment. The trial was conducted at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle and at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. The <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483/suppl_file/nejmoa2022483_protocol.pdf"" data-interactiontype=""multimedia_download"" data-download-format=""PDF"" data-behavior=""trackDownloadEvent"" data-download-filetype=""PDF"" data-download-type=""Supplementary Protocol"">protocol</a>, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, permitted interim analyses to inform decisions regarding vaccine strategy and public health; this interim analysis reports findings through day 57. Full details of the trial design, conduct, oversight, and analyses can be found in the protocol and statistical analysis plan (available at NEJM.org).</p>
<p class=""f-body"">The trial was reviewed and approved by the Advarra institutional review board, which functioned as a single board and was overseen by an independent safety monitoring committee. All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. The trial was conducted under an Investigational New Drug application submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine was codeveloped by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID, the trial sponsor) and at Moderna (Cambridge, MA). Moderna was involved in discussions of the trial design, provided the vaccine candidate, and, as part of the writing group, contributed to drafting the manuscript. The Emmes Company, as a subcontractor to the NIAID, served as the statistical and data coordinating center, developed the statistical analysis plan, and performed the analyses. The manuscript was written entirely by the authors, with the first author as the overall lead author, the fourth author as the lead NIAID author, and the last two authors as senior authors (details are provided in the <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483/suppl_file/nejmoa2022483_appendix.pdf"" data-interactiontype=""multimedia_download"" data-download-format=""PDF"" data-behavior=""trackDownloadEvent"" data-download-filetype=""PDF"" data-download-type=""Supplementary Appendix"">Supplementary Appendix</a>, available at NEJM.org). The authors had full access to the data reports, which were prepared from the raw data by the statistical and data coordinating center, and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.</p>

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"" data-collapsible-trigger="""">VACCINE</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate, manufactured by Moderna, encodes the S-2P antigen, consisting of the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein with a transmembrane anchor and an intact S1–S2 cleavage site. S-2P is stabilized in its prefusion conformation by two consecutive proline substitutions at amino acid positions 986 and 987, at the top of the central helix in the S2 subunit.<sup><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home#"" data-behavior=""ShowPopupTip"" data-popup-content-ids=""ref8"">8</a></sup> The lipid nanoparticle capsule composed of four lipids was formulated in a fixed ratio of mRNA and lipid. The mRNA-1273 vaccine was provided as a sterile liquid for injection at a concentration of 0.5 mg per milliliter. Normal saline was used as a diluent to prepare the doses administered.</p>

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"" data-collapsible-trigger="""">TRIAL PROCEDURES</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">The vaccine was administered as a 0.5-ml injection in the deltoid muscle on days 1 and 29; follow-up visits were scheduled for 7 and 14 days after each vaccination and on days 57, 119, 209, and 394. The dose-escalation plan specified enrollment of four sentinel participants in the 25-µg group, followed by four sentinel participants in the 100-µg group, followed by full enrollment of those two dose groups. If no halting rules were met after all participants in those two dose groups completed day 8, four sentinel participants in the 250-µg group were enrolled, followed by the remainder of that dose group.</p>
<p class=""f-body"">Participants recorded local and systemic reactions, using a memory aid, for 7 days after each vaccination. Participants were not instructed to routinely use acetaminophen or other analgesics or antipyretics before or after the vaccinations but were asked to record any new medications taken. Adverse events were graded according to a standard toxicity grading scale (Table S1 in the <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483/suppl_file/nejmoa2022483_appendix.pdf"" data-interactiontype=""multimedia_download"" data-download-format=""PDF"" data-behavior=""trackDownloadEvent"" data-download-filetype=""PDF"" data-download-type=""Supplementary Appendix"">Supplementary Appendix</a>).<sup><a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home#"" data-behavior=""ShowPopupTip"" data-popup-content-ids=""ref9"">9</a></sup></p>

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"" data-collapsible-trigger="""">ASSESSMENT OF SARS-COV-2 BINDING ANTIBODY AND NEUTRALIZING RESPONSES</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">Binding antibody responses against S-2P and the isolated receptor-binding domain, located in the S1 subunit, were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vaccine-induced neutralizing activity was assessed by a pseudotyped lentivirus reporter single-round-of-infection neutralization assay (PsVNA) and by live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 plaque-reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) assay. ELISA and PsVNA were performed on specimens collected from all participants on days 1, 15, 29, 36, 43, and 57. Because of the time-intensive nature of the PRNT assay, for this report of the interim analysis, results were available only for the day 1 and day 43 time points in the 25-µg and 100-µg dose groups.</p>
<p class=""f-body"">For comparison of the participants’ immune responses with those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41 convalescent serum specimens were also tested. The assays were performed at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center (ELISA and PsVNA) and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (PRNT).</p>

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"" data-collapsible-trigger="""">ASSESSMENT OF SARS-COV-2 T-CELL RESPONSES</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">T-cell responses against the spike protein were assessed by an intracellular cytokine–staining assay, performed on specimens collected at days 1, 29, and 43. For this report of the interim analysis, results were available only for the 25-µg and 100-µg dose groups. These assays were performed at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center.

<h2 class=""a-article-h2 f-h12"" data-collapsible-trigger="""">STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</h2>
<p class=""f-body"">Results of immunogenicity testing of the 45 enrolled participants excluded findings for day 36, day 43, and day 57 for 3 participants who did not receive the second vaccination and for time points at which specimens were not collected (in the 100-µg group: 1 participant at day 43 and day 57; in the 250-µg group: 1 participant at day 29 and 1 at day 57). Confidence intervals of the geometric means were calculated with the Student’s t distribution on log-transformed data. Seroconversion as measured by ELISA was defined as an increase by a factor of 4 or more in antibody titer over baseline.</p>

ST. PAUL, Minn.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--To help the world respond to COVID-19, 3M and researchers at MIT are testing a new rapid test that detects the virus. Accelerated research is underway to learn if a simple-to-use, diagnostic device can produce highly accurate results within minutes and is feasible to mass manufacture.

The U.S. National Institute of Health selected the rapid COVID-19 test for accelerated development and commercialization support, after rigorous review by an expert panel. The test is in the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Tech (RADx Tech) program, an aggressively-paced COVID-19 diagnostics initiative from the NIH’s National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

“We are excited to collaborate with Professor Hadley Sikes and the team at MIT. Our approach is ambitious, but our collective expertise can make a difference for people around the world, so we owe it to ourselves and society to give it our best effort,” said John Banovetz, 3M Senior Vice President for Innovation and Stewardship and Chief Technology Officer. “This is another step demonstrating 3M’s leadership in the fight against COVID-19. We are seeking to improve the speed, accessibility and affordability of testing for the virus, a major step in helping to prevent its spread.”

The test would detect viral antigens and deliver highly accurate results within minutes via a paper-based device. The test could be administered at the point-of-care and would not need to be sent to labs for testing.

This effort draws on 3M’s deep technological expertise in biomaterials and bioprocessing along with the company’s expertise in global medical device manufacturing. The 3M team is led by scientists, manufacturing and regulatory experts from its corporate research laboratories and health care business group.

The research team at MIT is led by Professor Hadley Sikes at the Institute’s Department of Chemical Engineering. The Sikes lab specializes in the creation and development of molecular technologies to improve the performance of rapid, cellulose-based protein tests.

“There is a pressing need for a highly scalable rapid test,” Sikes said. “We are working with our colleagues at 3M to overcome the challenges to move this research from lab to impact, and find an innovative path forward to manufacture it at scale. Joining forces with 3M and the NIH has greatly enhanced our collective efforts toward swift detection of the virus, and a potential tool to help mitigate and contain this public health crisis.”

The teams at 3M and MIT believe a diagnostic test can be deployed once validated. Manufacturing equipment can be scaled to produce millions of units per day.

The team is prepared to collaborate with the government’s RADx Tech program to demonstrate the test’s capability and to deploy it as quickly as possible. RADx Tech’s phased innovation funnel is initially supporting a four-week period of intense research to demonstrate the test concept works and can be commercialized on a large scale. The project received $500,000 in validation funding from RADx Tech and is eligible for further investment in later stages of the development funnel.

<span class=""xn-location"">LONDON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">July 14, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gsk-announces-fda-advisory-committee-votes-in-favour-of-positive-benefitrisk-profile-for-belantamab-mafodotin-for-patients-with-relapsedrefractory-multiple-myeloma-301093492.html#financial-modal"">GSK</a>) today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 12-0 in favour of the demonstrated benefit of monotherapy treatment with belantamab mafodotin outweighing the risks for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. Two committee members could not participate in the final vote.

Dr <span class=""xn-person"">Axel Hoos</span>, Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology R&amp;D, GSK said: ""We are pleased the committee recognised the potential for belantamab mafodotin to help patients who have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, an incurable disease with limited treatment options. We look forward to working with the FDA as they complete their review of our Biologics License Application.""

The recommendation was based on data from the DREAMM (DRiving Excellence in Approaches to Multiple Myeloma) clinical trial programme, including the pivotal DREAMM-2 study which enrolled heavily pre-treated patients who had actively progressing multiple myeloma that had worsened despite current standard of care.<sup>i </sup>The six-month primary results from the study were published in <i>The Lancet Oncology </i>in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2019</span> and serve as the basis for the Biologics License Application (BLA).

The FDA will consider the recommendation of the committee but is not obligated to follow it. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to belantamab mafodotin in 2017 and priority review designation for the BLA earlier this year. A Marketing Authorisation Application for belantamab mafodotin also is under accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency.

Belantamab mafodotin is not currently approved for use anywhere in the world.

<b>About belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Belantamab mafodotin is an investigational antibody drug conjugate comprising a humanised anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) monoclonal antibody conjugated to the cytotoxic agent auristatin F via non-cleavable linker. The drug linker technology is licensed from Seattle Genetics; monoclonal antibody is produced using POTELLIGENT Technology licensed from BioWa.

<b>About DREAMM-2<br class=""dnr"" /></b>DREAMM-2 is an open label study of belantamab mafodotin. Patients in the trial had actively progressing multiple myeloma that had worsened despite current standard of care and were randomised to two arms to receive either 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg belantamab mafodotin every three weeks. Overall, patients in DREAMM-2 had more advanced disease, poorer prognosis and performance status and also had a greater number of prior lines of therapy in comparison with patients in DREAMM-1, the first time in human study of belantamab mafodotin.

<b>About multiple myeloma<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer in the US and is generally considered treatable, but not curable.<sup>ii</sup> Research into new therapies is needed as multiple myeloma commonly becomes refractory to available treatments.<sup>iii</sup>

<b>About B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>The normal function of BCMA is to promote plasma cell survival by transduction of signals from two known ligands, BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand). This pathway has been shown to be important for myeloma cell growth and survival. BCMA expression is limited to B cells at later stages of development. BCMA is expressed at varying levels in myeloma patients and BCMA membrane expression is universally detected in myeloma cell lines.<sup>iii</sup>

<b>GSK in Oncology<br class=""dnr"" /></b>GSK is focused on maximising patient survival through transformational medicines. GSK's pipeline is focused on immuno-oncology, cell therapy, cancer epigenetics, and synthetic lethality. Our goal is to achieve a sustainable flow of new treatments based on a diversified portfolio of investigational medicines utilising modalities such as small molecules, antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and cells, either alone or in combination.

DUBLIN &amp; LYON, France--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), a global leader in medical technology, and Medicrea (Euronext Growth Paris: FR0004178572 – ALMED Medicrea; OTCQX Best Market – MRNTF), a pioneer in the transformation of spinal surgery through artificial intelligence, predictive modeling and patient specific implants, today announced that they have entered into a tender offer agreement for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Medicrea. The friendly voluntary all-cash tender offer will be at a price of €7.00 per Medicrea share (the “Tender Offer”). The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“Spine surgery is one of the more complex procedures in healthcare because of the high number of different parameters to take into consideration. It is impossible for the human brain to compute all of them for one single patient”</p>

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200714006115/en/Medtronic-Acquire-Medicrea#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
This acquisition would strengthen Medtronic’s position as a global innovator in enabling technologies and solutions for spine surgery.

“Combining Medtronic’s innovative portfolio of spine implants, robotics, navigation, and 3D imaging technology with Medicrea’s capabilities and solutions in data analytics, artificial intelligence and personalized implants, would enhance Medtronic’s fully-integrated procedural solution for surgical planning and delivery. This marks another important step in furthering our commitment to improving outcomes in spine care,” said Jacob Paul, senior vice president and president of the Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies division, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group at Medtronic. “Medtronic will become the first company to be able to offer an integrated solution including artificial intelligence driven surgical planning, personalized spinal implants and robotic assisted surgical delivery, which will significantly benefit our customers and their patients.”

Medicrea’s product portfolio includes MEDICREA® UNiD® ASI (Adaptive Spine Intelligence) designed to support surgeon workflow in pre-operative planning and create personalized implant solutions for surgery. The Medicrea solution is powered by predictive modeling and sophisticated algorithms that measure and digitally reconstruct the spine to its optimal profile.

“Spine surgery is one of the more complex procedures in healthcare because of the high number of different parameters to take into consideration. It is impossible for the human brain to compute all of them for one single patient,” said Denys Sournac, founder, chairman and CEO of Medicrea. “The medical world has been waiting for the arrival of customization in spinal surgery. With scientific progress in understanding sagittal balance and spinal injury, combined with the advent of new digital technologies, it is now possible to offer spinal patients entirely customized implants. We are thrilled to be joining forces with Medtronic because we share a similar mission to restore the long-term quality of life for patients. Now, together, we can help more patients in more places benefit from consistently high-quality surgical care.”

<b><span class=""bwuline"">Key Terms of the Transaction</span></b>

The Tender Offer price of €7.00 per share represents a premium of:

- 22% over the closing price of Medicrea shares on 14 July 2020

- 33% over the 1-month volume weighted average price of Medicrea shares as of 14 July 2020

- 56% over the 3-month volume weighted average price of Medicrea shares as of 14 July 2020

The Tender Offer will target all the outstanding shares of Medicrea as well as the shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants subject to their exercise prior to the closing of the Tender Offer.

Medicrea’s largest shareholders, including founder, president and CEO Denys Sournac as well as certain other key managers, employees and directors of Medicrea, have entered into commitments to tender their shares (including shares to be issued upon exercise of warrants, but excluding, in the case of Denys Sournac and managers, free shares under lock-up period) in the Tender Offer.

These commitments remain revocable in case of a higher competing public tender offer in accordance with applicable French financial markets regulations.

With the above-mentioned commitments to tender, Medtronic has entered into agreements with Medicrea shareholders totalling approximatively 44.4% of Medicrea’s current outstanding share capital (adjusted for new shares to be issued upon exercise of warrants).

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including obtaining regulatory clearance from the French Markets Authority (the “AMF”), applicable foreign investment clearance in France, and applicable merger control clearance in the United States.

The completion of the Tender Offer will be subject, in addition to the mandatory minimum acceptance condition set out in Article 231-9, I 1° of the AMF Regulation, to a minimum acceptance condition that Medtronic obtains a number of Medicrea shares representing at least 66.67% of the share capital and voting rights.

The Board of Medicrea will issue in due course a reasoned opinion on the merits of the Tender Offer for Medicrea, its shareholders and its employees following receipt of the fairness opinion issued by the independent expert appointed in accordance with Article 261-1, I &amp; III of the AMF Regulation by the ad hoc? committee to be created by the Board of Medicrea.

It is expected that the Tender Offer will be filed with the AMF in September 2020. The Tender Offer will be opened once the foreign investment approval in France is obtained, and the Tender Offer would still remain subject to the merger control clearance in the United States.

Assuming receipt of regulatory and other clearances and satisfaction of other closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to close by the end of calendar year 2020. The transaction is expected to be immaterial to Medtronic’s adjusted earnings per share in the first two fiscal years before turning accretive in fiscal year 2023. In addition, it is expected to meet Medtronic's long-term financial metrics for acquisitions.

 	<li><em>Portfolio will be sold at zero-profit to governments in up to 79<sup>1</sup> eligible countries during the pandemic and until a vaccine or curative treatment is available</em></li>
 	<li><em>Early access to treatment for managing  COVID-19 symptoms is critical to preventing healthcare system overload</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Basel, July 16, 2020</strong> — Today, Novartis announced a new initiative to help patients in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LIC; LMIC) access affordable medicines to treat the major symptoms of COVID-19 – a critical need in the absence of a vaccine or curative treatment. Inflammation and respiratory problems linked to COVID-19 can cause severe medical complications and can lead to death in some people, putting immense strain on fragile healthcare systems.

The Novartis COVID-19 portfolio includes 15 medicines from its Sandoz division for gastro-intestinal illness, acute respiratory symptoms, pneumonia as well as septic shock. The medicines were chosen based on clinical relevance and availability to ensure demand can be met globally.

The medicines will be made available to governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and other institutional customers in up to 79 eligible countries at zero-profit to support financially-strained healthcare systems. Countries will have the flexibility to select the medicines in the portfolio that meet their healthcare needs. Eligible countries must be included on the World Bank’s list of LICs &amp; LMICs<sup>1</sup>.

“Access to medicine can be a challenge for patients in low- and lower-middle-income countries and the situation has worsened during COVID-19. With our COVID-19 portfolio, we wish to help address the additional healthcare demands of the pandemic in the countries we are targeting,” said Dr Lutz Hegemann, Chief Operating Officer for Global Health at Novartis.

“This initiative builds on our earlier global commitment to keep prices stable for a basket of essential drugs used to treating COVID-19 patients,” said Sandoz CEO Richard Saynor. “The COVID-19 Response Portfolio for low-income and lower-middle-income countries is designed to support governments in treating COVID-19 symptoms before they lead to complications in patients.”

The following medicines are included in the Novartis COVID-19 Response Portfolio:
Amoxicillin, Ceftriaxone, Clarithromycin, Colchicine, Dexamethasone, Dobutamine, Fluconazole, Heparin, Levofloxacin, Loperamide, Pantoprazole, Prednisone, Prednisolone, Salbutamol, Vancomycin.

The portfolio will be offered in addition to the Novartis Access portfolio (on- and off-patent medicines against key non-communicable diseases) via the local Novartis or Sandoz affiliate.

This global pandemic has placed extreme pressure on healthcare systems in low- and lower-income countries. The pandemic response portfolio complements the previously launched Novartis COVID-19 Response Fund to support healthcare workers and communities in over 50 projects around the world.

The COVID-19 medicines portfolio is Novartis latest contribution to the global effort to combat the pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis has been active in two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership organized by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis continues to provide hydroxychloroquine for ongoing investigator-initiated trials (IITs) and upon government requests, as appropriate. The company is also separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. To support access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines.  Furthermore, AveXis, Novartis gene therapy unit, entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID.  More information about the Novartis response to COVID-19 is available on <strong><a title="""" href=""https://www.novartis.com/coronavirus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">https://www.novartis.com/coronavirus</a> </strong>

TOR, JUL 16, 2020 08:03 CETDetailed results from the positive Phase III THALES trial showed AstraZeneca’s <em>Brilinta</em> (ticagrelor) 90mg used twice daily and taken with daily aspirin for 30 days, reduced the rate of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death by 17% (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.71, 0.96], p=0.02), compared to aspirin alone in patients who had an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).<sup>1</sup>

This was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction. Furthermore, aspirin plus <em>Brilinta </em>significantly<em> </em>reduced the rate of the first secondary endpoint of ischaemic stroke by 21%, compared to aspirin alone up to day 30.<sup>1</sup> The risk for severe bleeding events was 0.5% in the aspirin plus <em>Brilinta </em>group and 0.1% in the aspirin group. The results were in line with the known safety profile of <em>Brilinta</em>.<sup>1</sup>

Dr. Clay Johnston, lead investigator for the THALES trial and Dean of the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas in Austin, US, said: “About one in four stroke survivors go on to experience a second stroke, and the risk is particularly high within the first month after the initial event. Early treatment is important to prevent a subsequent stroke that may be disabling or fatal. It is also expected to improve long-term outcomes.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “Patients who had an acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischemic attack may experience a subsequent, potentially avoidable stroke. Results from the Phase III THALES trial confirm that aspirin plus <em>Brilinta</em> has the potential to be a new effective treatment option for these high-risk patients and we look forward to continuing discussions with regulatory authorities.”

This month, AstraZeneca announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and granted <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/brilinta-granted-fda-priority-review-for-the-reduction-of-subsequent-stroke-in-patients-who-had-an-acute-ischemic-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Priority Review</a> for <em>Brilinta</em> for the reduction of subsequent stroke in patients who experienced an acute ischemic stroke or TIA based on the Phase III THALES trial. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for this supplemental application, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2020.

<em>Brilinta</em> is approved in more than 110 countries for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in more than 70 countries for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among high-risk patients who have experienced a heart attack. In May 2020, the FDA approved a <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/brilinta-approved-in-the-us-to-reduce-the-risk-of-a-first-heart-attack-or-stroke-in-high-risk-patients-with-coronary-artery-disease.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">label update</a> for <em>Brilinta</em> in the US to include the reduction of the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

<strong>Stroke</strong>

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with 6.2 million stroke-related deaths in 2017, from which 2.7 million were due to ischaemic stroke.<sup>2</sup> Patients who experience an acute ischaemic stroke or TIA are at high risk of developing subsequent ischaemic events, with particularly high risk within 30 days after the initial event and the highest risk period being the first 24 hours after the initial event.<sup>3</sup>

<strong>THALES</strong>

THALES is an AstraZeneca-sponsored, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, international, multicentre, event-driven trial involving more than 11,000 patients from 28 countries. It tested the hypothesis whether aspirin plus <em>Brilinta</em> is superior to aspirin alone in preventing the composite of stroke and death in patients with non-cardioembolic acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA. Patients were randomised within 24 hours of onset of acute ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA symptoms and followed-up for 30 days of treatment. Study treatments were <em>Brilinta</em> 180mg loading dose on day 1 as soon as possible after randomisation, followed by 90mg twice daily on days 2–30, or matching placebo. All patients received open-label aspirin 300–325mg on day 1, followed by 75–100mg once daily on days 2–30. The primary efficacy outcome was the time to the composite endpoint of stroke and death at 30 days. The primary safety outcome is time to first severe bleeding event according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definition, which includes fatal bleedings, intracranial haemorrhage; and bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention. Patients were followed for an additional 30 days on standard of care.

<strong><em>Brilinta</em></strong>

<em>Brilinta</em> is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. <em>Brilinta</em>, together with aspirin, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (heart attack, stroke or CV death), in patients with ACS or a history of heart attack.

<em>Brilinta</em>, co-administered with aspirin, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS, or for patients with a history of MI and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.

Begins Adaptive Phase I/ II human clinical trials of its plasmid DNA vaccine, ZyCoV-D
• ZyCoV-D was found to be safe, immunogenic, well tolerated in the pre-clinical toxicity studies.
• The vaccine was able to elicit high level of neutralizing antibodies in animal studies.
Ahmedabad, July 15, 2020
Zydus, an innovation driven global healthcare company, today announced that the Adaptive Phase
I/ II human clinical trials of its plasmid DNA vaccine, ZyCoV-D commenced today with the first human
dosing. The Adaptive Phase I/II dose escalation, multi-centric study will assess the safety, tolerability
and immunogenicity of the vaccine. The human dosing of the vaccine marks a key milestone since the
launching of the accelerated vaccine development programme for COVID-19 in February 2020.
Speaking on the development, Chairman, Zydus Cadila, Mr. Pankaj R. Patel said, “This is an all important
step in our fight against COVID-19. We acknowledge the support of National Biopharma Mission,
BIRAC, Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India and regulatory agencies ICMR and DCGI in the
development of ZyCoV-D vaccine candidate. We look forward to the Adaptive Phase I/IIclinical studies
and gathering important data on ZyCoV-D in the months ahead.”
In the Adaptive Phase I/ II clinical trials, Zydus will be enrolling over 1000 subjects across multiple
clinical study sites in India. The Company has already manufactured clinical GMP batches of the vaccine
candidate for the clinical trials.
About ZyCoV-D
In the pre-clinical phase, the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response in multiple animal
species like mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. The antibodies produced by the vaccine were able to
neutralize the wild type virus in virus neutralization assay indicating the protective potential of the vaccine
candidate. No safety concerns were observed for the vaccine candidate in repeat dose toxicology studies
by both intramuscular and intradermal routes of administration. In rabbits, up to three times the intended
human dose was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic.
With ZyCoV-D, the Company has successfully established the DNA vaccine platform in the country using
non-replicating and non-integrating plasmid carrying the gene of interest making it very safe. Further, no
vector response and with absence of any infectious agent, the platform provides ease of manufacturing
the vaccine with minimal biosafety requirements (BSL-1). The platform is also known to show much
improved vaccine stability and lower cold chain requirements making it easy for transportation to remotest

ST. HELIER, Jersey–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Novocure (NASDAQ: NVCR) today announced it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with MSD (a tradename of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.), through a subsidiary, to develop Tumor Treating Fields together with MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Novocure’s Tumor Treating Fields use electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth and causing cancer cells to die.

The two companies plan to conduct a phase 2 pilot study of Tumor Treating Fields concomitant with KEYTRUDA for first-line treatment of intrathoracic advanced or metastatic, PD-L1 positive NSCLC. The study is designed to enroll approximately 66 patients in the United States and is expected to begin in the second half of 2020. Objective response rate (ORR) is the primary endpoint of the study. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, progression free survival (PFS), PFS at six months, one-year survival rate, duration of response, disease control rate at 18 weeks and safety.

“We are very pleased to collaborate with MSD, a global leader in oncology, in this important combination study as we strive to extend survival in some of the most aggressive forms of cancer through the development and commercialization of Tumor Treating Fields,” said William Doyle, Novocure’s Executive Chairman. “Multiple preclinical studies suggest that the use of Tumor Treating Fields together with anti-PD-1 therapy can potentially augment the immune response resulting in improved tumor control. We look forward to generating clinical data demonstrating the effect of Tumor Treating Fields concurrent with KEYTRUDA in first-line NSCLC.”

<b>About Lung Cancer</b>

Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Each year, more people die from lung cancer than from colon and breast cancers combined. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85 percent of all cases. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the U.S. with NSCLC is approximately 24 percent.

<b>About Tumor Treating Fields</b>

Tumor Treating Fields is a cancer therapy that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth and causing cancer cells to die. Tumor Treating Fields does not stimulate or heat tissue and targets dividing cancer cells of a specific size. Tumor Treating Fields causes minimal damage to healthy cells. Mild to moderate skin irritation is the most common side effect reported. Tumor Treating Fields is approved in certain countries for the treatment of adults with glioblastoma and in the U.S. for mesothelioma, two of the most difficult cancer types to treat. The therapy shows promise in multiple solid tumor types – including some of the most aggressive forms of cancer.

Use of Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of NSCLC is investigational only.

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Application Based on First Contemporary Outcomes Study Focused Exclusively on Chronic Heart Failure Patient Population Following a Worsening Event</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review the New Drug Application (NDA) for vericiguat, an orally administered soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization following a worsening heart failure event in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), in combination with other heart failure therapies. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, of Jan. 20, 2021. Vericiguat is being jointly developed with Bayer AG.

“This submission builds on Merck’s commitment to patients with cardiovascular disease and long legacy of advancing cardiovascular research to meet unmet medical needs,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to working with the FDA as they review this New Drug Application for vericiguat.”

The application is based on results from the Phase 3 VICTORIA trial, which is the first contemporary outcomes study focused exclusively on a population with worsening chronic heart failure who are at high risk for cardiovascular mortality and repeated heart failure hospitalizations. Data from VICTORIA were presented at the virtual American College of Cardiology’s 69<sup>th</sup> Annual Scientific Session together with World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.20/WCC) and published in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine.</i>

<b>About the VICTORIA Trial</b>

VICTORIA (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02861534%3Fterm%3DA%2BStudy%2Bof%2BVericiguat%2Bin%2BParticipants%2BWith%2BHeart%2BFailure%2BWith%2BReduced%2BEjection%2BFraction%2B%2528HFrEF%2529%2B%2528MK-1242-001%2529%2B%2528VICTORIA%2529%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;esheet=52250876&amp;newsitemid=20200716005203&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT02861534&amp;index=1&amp;md5=2a9e6fbf5a9a00d20f95ba03f47db32a"" rel=""nofollow"">NCT02861534</a>) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, double-blind, Phase 3 study of vericiguat versus placebo when given in combination with available heart failure therapies in patients with worsening chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV), a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;45% within 12 months prior to randomization following a decompensation event. The primary endpoint of the study was the composite of time to first occurrence of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death. Secondary endpoints included time to occurrence of cardiovascular death, time to first occurrence of heart failure hospitalization, time to total heart failure hospitalizations (including first and recurrent events), time to the composite of all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization, and time to all-cause mortality.

The study enrolled a total of 5,050 patients who were randomly selected to receive either vericiguat once daily (titrated up to 10 mg) or placebo when given in combination with available heart failure therapies. The study was co-sponsored by Merck and Bayer, conducted under the scientific oversight of the Canadian VIGOUR Centre and the Duke Clinical Research Institute, and executed by Merck in more than 600 centers in 42 countries including in Europe, Japan, China and the U.S.

<b>About Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction</b>

HFrEF, formerly known as systolic heart failure, is characterized by the compromised ability of the heart to eject blood sufficiently during its contraction phase. In the U.S., 6.5 million people have heart failure, and approximately 40-50% of these patients have HFrEF. Annually, approximately 30% of patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure will experience worsening of the disease, which is marked by progressive symptoms and/or a recent heart failure event. Approximately half of patients with worsening chronic HFrEF are rehospitalized within 30 days of a worsening event, and an estimated one in five patients with worsening chronic HFrEF will die within two years.

<b>About the Worldwide Collaboration Between Bayer and Merck</b>

Since October 2014, Bayer and Merck (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada) have pursued a worldwide collaboration in the field of sGC modulators. The collaboration brings together two leading companies that have stated their intent to fully evaluate this therapeutic class in areas of unmet medical need. The vericiguat program is being co-developed by Bayer and Merck.

<em>Strengthens Kronos’ clinical development pipeline and long-term commitment to leverage transcriptional regulatory networks to unlock historically undruggable targets in oncology</em>

<em>Includes two clinical stage SYK inhibitors (entospletinib and lanraplenib) with initial development planned in biomarker defined subset of acute myelogenous leukemia</em>

<div class=""bw-release-body"">
<div class=""bw-release-notes"">
<div>SAN MATEO, Calif. &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)– Kronos Bio, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of novel cancer therapeutics designed to transform patient outcomes by targeting dysregulated transcription, today announced that it has entered into an asset purchase agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. to acquire Gilead’s spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor portfolio. The portfolio includes the clinical stage compounds entospletinib, which has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in oncology patients, and lanraplenib, which has been evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with autoimmune diseases.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bw-release-story"">

“Kronos is uniquely positioned to advance these differentiated and selective SYK inhibitors by leveraging our expertise in oncology and transcriptional regulatory networks,” said Norbert Bischofberger, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Kronos. “We believe the acquisition of these compounds not only propels us more quickly into clinical development but also brings us closer to our goal of transforming patient outcomes.”

Kronos intends to initially focus on developing the SYK inhibitor program in a biomarker-defined subset of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). SYK is a critical node in AML overexpressing the HOXA9 and MEIS1 transcription factors. HOXA9 and MEIS1 become dysregulated as a result of recurring mutations found in up to one half of AML patients.

“Despite recent advancements in AML, there remains a substantial need for targeted therapies that can extend life,” said John Byrd, M.D., D. Warren Brown Chair of Leukemia Research, and Distinguished University Professor of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and Chief Medical Officer of The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society Beat AML Trial. “SYK inhibition has demonstrated promising activity in clinical trials of AML patients who have high HOXA9/MEIS1 expression and is an optimal target for further clinical research to understand how HOXA9/MEIS1 dysregulation drives AML in these patients. The Beat AML Trial directed by The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society has partnered closely with Gilead and looks forward to continued close collaboration with Kronos Bio.”

Entospletinib has produced promising early clinical data in a biomarker-defined subset of AML patients (Liu, et al. EHA poster abstract PF246, 2018). Entospletinib has been investigated in over 500 patients across six Gilead sponsored studies in a variety of hematologic malignancies, including AML, demonstrating activity as a single-agent and in combination with standard-of-care.

Lanraplenib has been investigated in over 250 patients across seven Gilead sponsored studies in various autoimmune diseases. Its pharmaceutical properties may make it a commercially attractive next generation product candidate.

Under the terms of the agreement, Gilead will receive an upfront cash payment and a note convertible into Kronos equity, and will be eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestones and royalties on future sales of products arising from the acquired programs.

HAMILTON, Bermuda, July 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uWo5s6lBEoBp7yWW6LtPwEzk4Ma-ZUzLyEre1RjczQSuADHm75OHqBDU2UxrR7yNnxL-cCri3OQAQnIUUH-yUtW2GQc8LHxNm-VRe-FyABc="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.</a> (Nasdaq: KNSA) (“Kiniksa”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing therapeutic medicines for patients with significant unmet medical need, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation for rilonacept for the treatment of pericarditis, which includes recurrent pericarditis. Rilonacept is a weekly, subcutaneously-injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß) signaling.

“Orphan Drug designation for rilonacept for the treatment of pericarditis, along with the Breakthrough Therapy designation for recurrent pericarditis and the recent highly statistically significant pivotal Phase 3 data, represent important advances toward bringing a potential treatment solution to patients suffering from this debilitating autoinflammatory disease,” said Sanj K. Patel, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Kiniksa. “We look forward to submitting an sBLA in recurrent pericarditis to the FDA later this year and are actively preparing for commercialization.”

Kiniksa recently reported positive data from RHAPSODY, a pivotal Phase 3 trial of rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis. RHAPSODY met its prespecified primary and all major secondary efficacy endpoints, showing that rilonacept improved clinically-meaningful outcomes associated with the unmet medical need in recurrent pericarditis.

Rilonacept was discovered and developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) and is approved by the FDA under the brand name ARCALYST® for the treatment of for Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). Kiniksa licensed rilonacept from Regeneron in 2017 for evaluation in diseases believed to be mediated by both IL-1a and IL-1ß, including recurrent pericarditis. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to rilonacept for recurrent pericarditis in 2019. Based on the Phase 3 RHAPSODY data, the Biologic License Application (BLA) for CAPS will transfer to Kiniksa, and the company plans to submit a supplemental Biologic License Application (sBLA) in recurrent pericarditis to the FDA later this year. Upon receipt of FDA approval for rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis, Kiniksa would assume the sales and distribution of rilonacept for the approved indications in the United States and would evenly split profits on sales with Regeneron.

<strong>About Orphan Drug Designation</strong>
The FDA grants Orphan Drug designation status to products that treat rare diseases, providing incentives to sponsors developing drugs or biologics. The FDA defines rare diseases as those affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. at the time of designation. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances. Additionally, orphan drug designation waives the requirement to conduct pediatric studies for the product in the disease it is designated.

<strong>About Recurrent Pericarditis</strong>
Recurrent pericarditis is a painful and debilitating autoinflammatory cardiovascular disease that typically presents with chest pain and is often associated with changes in electrical conduction and sometimes buildup of fluid around the heart, called pericardial effusion. Patients with pericarditis are deemed recurrent if they have an additional episode after a symptom-free period of 4-6 weeks and chronic if symptoms from any one episode last longer than three months. Recurrent pericarditis symptoms impair qualify of life, limit physical activities, and lead to frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for recurrent pericarditis.

<strong>About RHAPSODY</strong>
RHAPSODY is the global, randomized withdrawal design, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis. Eligible patients presented at screening with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain of = 4 on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) value = 1 mg/dL within the 7-day period prior to first study drug administration. Patients could have been receiving concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or colchicine and/or oral corticosteroid treatment in any combination. The study was comprised of 4 periods: a screening period; a single-blind run-in period during which patients received a loading dose of rilonacept 320 mg injected subcutaneously (SC) followed by 160 mg SC weekly while background pericarditis medications were tapered and discontinued; a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal period during which clinical responders to rilonacept were randomized 1:1 and received 160 mg SC weekly rilonacept or placebo; and a long-term extension treatment period with up to 24 months of open-label rilonacept 160 mg SC weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint was time-to-first pericarditis-recurrence in the randomized withdrawal period.

<strong>About Rilonacept</strong>
Rilonacept is a weekly, subcutaneously-injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL-1a and IL-1ß signaling. Rilonacept was discovered and developed by Regeneron and is approved by the FDA under the brand name ARCALYST<sup>®</sup> for the treatment of CAPS, specifically Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome. Rilonacept for the treatment of deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) is currently pending FDA approval following the submission of an sBLA in June 2020. Rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis is an investigational drug. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to rilonacept for recurrent pericarditis in 2019 and Orphan Drug designation to rilonacept for pericarditis in 2020.

<strong>Important information about ARCALYST® (rilonacept) Injection</strong>
IL-1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections. Serious, life-threatening infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST. ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Taking ARCALYST with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections.

Patients should not receive a live vaccine while taking ARCALYST. It is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. In the initial development program for ARCALYST, six serious adverse reactions were reported by four patients: Mycobacterium intracellular infection, gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis, sinusitis and bronchitis and Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with ARCALYST were injection site reaction and upper respiratory tract infection. Patients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if warranted. Treatment with immunosuppressants, including ARCALYST, may result in an increase in risk of malignancies. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration in clinical studies have been rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of ARCALYST should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated.

<span class=""xn-location"">WALTHAM, Mass.</span> and VENLO, <span class=""xn-location"">The Netherlands</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">July 16, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thermo-fisher-scientific-and-qiagen-nv-agree-on-amended-terms-to-acquisition-agreement-301094817.html#financial-modal"">TMO</a>), the world leader in serving science, and QIAGEN N.V.

The amendment provides for an increase from the original offer price of €39.00 to a new price of €43.00 per QIAGEN share in cash, which represents a premium of approximately 35% to the closing price of QIAGEN's ordinary shares on the Frankfurt Prime Standard on <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2, 2020</span>, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the acquisition agreement and <span class=""xn-person"">Thermo Fisher's</span> intention to commence the offer.

We remain confident that this transaction will create shareholder value and, importantly, provide meaningful benefits to our customers and society by combining our capabilities to combat infectious diseases and other healthcare issues. We continue to look forward to completing the transaction in the first half of 2021.""

""After carefully considering the updated offer by <span class=""xn-person"">Thermo Fisher</span>, QIAGEN's Supervisory Board and Managing Board both unanimously recommend that shareholders accept this offer given that it reflects the improvements in our business performance and future prospects as a result of the coronavirus pandemic,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Thierry Bernard</span>, chief executive officer of QIAGEN N.V. ""The rationale for this strategic step is stronger than ever, especially as the value of molecular testing becomes ever more evident.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","– Mirikizumab met the primary and all key secondary endpoints versus placebo at Week 16 and all key secondary endpoints versus Cosentyx® (secukinumab) at Week 16 and Week 52, including superiority in skin clearance at Week 52 – Lilly will submit data from OASIS-1 and 2 to regulatory authorities around the world

INDIANAPOLIS, July 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) announced today that mirikizumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19-subunit of IL23, met the primary and all key secondary endpoints versus placebo at Week 16 (superiority) and all key secondary endpoints versus Cosentyx (secukinumab) at Week 16 (non-inferiority) and Week 52 (superiority) in the OASIS-2 study. OASIS-2 is a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of mirikizumab to placebo and Cosentyx in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

PASI 100	1.8% | 36.6% | 37.7%	42.9% | 53.9%; 58.8%
p< 0.001 for all comparisons including non-inferiority with Cosentyx at Week 16; mirikizumab comparison with Cosentyx at Week 16 for PASI 100 not adjusted for multiplicity.
† Primary endpoints versus placebo at Week 16.
The safety profile was consistent with previously disclosed results for mirikizumab and known safety findings of other drugs in the IL23p19 class.

“The results from this study are promising to people around the world who are burdened by psoriasis and Lilly is grateful to the patients, providers and investigators for advancing science to benefit patients with immunologic conditions,” said Patrik Jonsson, senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. “We look forward to bringing mirikizumab to market to provide patients with an additional treatment option that has the potential to provide near complete or complete skin clearance as measured by PASI 90 and PASI 100, with sustained results at 52 weeks.”

The OASIS program demonstrates Lilly’s continued commitment to developing new treatment options in dermatology. In addition to mirikizumab in psoriasis, Lilly is studying other treatments for atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata, a disease without an FDA-approved medicine.

“We are pleased with the positive results observed in the mirikizumab psoriasis development program (OASIS). Mirikizumab has the potential to be a meaningful treatment option for people living with psoriasis,” said Andrew Blauvelt, M.D., M.B.A., president of Oregon Medical Research Center and a lead investigator in the OASIS program. “The data builds on our understanding of IL-23 inhibition in psoriasis and possible future applications.”

In OASIS-2, the primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a Static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) of (0,1) with at least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) at Week 16 compared to placebo. Similar endpoints were evaluated at Week 16 as key secondary endpoints compared to Cosentyx. Other key secondary endpoints compared to placebo at Week 16 include the proportion of patients with at least a 75 and 100 percent improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75/PASI 100).

Key secondary endpoints at Week 52 compared to Cosentyx included the proportion of patients with a Static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) of (0,1) with at least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with at least a 90 and 100 percent improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90/PASI 100).

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (=5%) during the induction period (up to Week 16) were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory infections and during the combined induction and maintenance treatment periods (up to Week 52) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, headache, back pain, and arthralgia. The frequency of serious adverse events was comparable across treatment arms during the induction period (<2.5%) and combined induction and maintenance periods up to 52 weeks (<6%).

The full OASIS-2 study results will be disclosed at future congresses. Phase 3 clinical trials are ongoing for mirikizumab in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, an area where there are limited treatment options and patients are currently underserved. After pausing enrollment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these studies have resumed enrolling patients. Lilly expects topline results for the Phase 3 induction data in ulcerative colitis in the spring of 2021 and for the Phase 3 Crohn’s data in 2022.

&nbsp;

<strong>CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 16, 2020</strong> – Oncorus, Inc., a viral immunotherapies company focused on driving innovation to transform outcomes for cancer patients, today announced that it has initiated a Phase 1 study of its lead product candidate, ONCR-177, an intratumorally administered oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) viral immunotherapy being developed for multiple solid tumor indications. The Phase 1 open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose as well as preliminary anti-tumor activity of ONCR-177 alone and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD1-1, KEYTRUDA<em>®</em> (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced and/or refractory cutaneous, subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors.

“Initiating our first-in-human study of ONCR-177 is a significant milestone, bringing us a major step closer to delivering on our mission to realize the full promise of viral immunotherapy for cancer patients across multiple indications, including some of the most notoriously difficult-to-treat types of cancer,” said Theodore (Ted) A. Ashburn, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Oncorus. “Our oHSV Platform represents a potential breakthrough for the viral immunotherapy class due to the multiple proprietary innovations our team has developed to activate multiple arms of the immune system to enhance potency while balancing safety.”

Dr. Ashburn continued, “A huge thank you to our team and collaborators for their tremendous effort preparing for this study amidst the unprecedented challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m proud and honored to work with such a bright, dedicated and patient-driven group of people.”

“While we have seen great success with immuno-oncology as an approach in some patients, these therapies have not benefited all patients with cancer and new strategies are needed,” said Shiraj Sen, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Director, Drug Development Unit, Sarah Cannon Research Institute at HealthONE in Denver, Colorado. “Given its differentiated profile, ONCR-177 has the potential to enable more patients to respond to, and realize the benefits of, immuno-oncology treatment. We are pleased to be part of this important first-in-human study of this next-generation viral immunotherapy.” Dr. Sen is a site investigator for the ONCR-177 Phase 1 study, and his site enrolled and dosed the first patient in this trial.

John Goldberg, M.D., Senior Vice President of Clinical Development at Oncorus, commented, “We are privileged to be working with preeminent cancer research institutions and leading researchers on the execution of this study. We are also thrilled to enter a clinical collaboration with Merck to study ONCR-177 in combination with KEYTRUDA, which is a key component of the trial. Above all, we are humbled to now be in a study in patients with ONCR-177 and believe in its potential to become a foundational component of oncologists’ anti-tumor arsenal. Our team is motivated by the courage of cancer patients and driven to enable every patient to win their war against this disease.”

Oncorus has designed its proprietary oHSV Platform to develop improved intratumorally administered viral immunotherapies that have the potential to enhance potency without sacrificing safety, a challenge that has been encountered by earlier generation programs in this class. ONCR-177 is designed to mount a powerful, multidimensional attack on cancer; it induces immunogenic cancer cell death and ignites innate and adaptive immunity to drive a lasting and systemic anti-tumor response. In addition to its oncolytic activity, ONCR-177 is armed with five immunomodulatory transgenes: IL-12, CCL4, FLT3LG, and antagonists of clinically proven immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4. This represents a greater payload capacity than viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development.

In preclinical studies, ONCR-177 was shown to stimulate multiples arms of the immune system, drive abscopal activity and prolong survival while limiting systemic exposure to transgene products, such as IL-12, that generally cannot be safely dosed systemically due to toxicities.

ONCR-177 retains full replication competency to enable potent tumor cell killing. It also incorporates two highly innovative approaches — the use of microRNA target sequences and a proprietary mutation engineered in an HSV-1 protein, known as UL37 — to allow for tumor-specific replication, which restricts viral activity to tumor cells while sparing normal tissues.

<strong>About the Phase 1 ONCR-177 Study</strong>

The first part of the study involves a monotherapy dose escalation of ONCR-177 and will enroll approximately 21 cancer patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom surgical resection or locoregional therapy is not indicated, and who are refractory to, ineligible for, relapsed from and/or intolerant of standard of care treatment or have a disease for which no standard of care exists. The Phase 1 trial will escalate the dose of ONCR-177 until the recommended phase 2 dose is determined.

Upon determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, the study will then enroll patients to histology- specific expansion cohorts to demonstrate safety and initial efficacy of ONCR-177 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA, in addition to enabling biomarker exploration. The expansion cohorts will enroll patients with solid tumors who are refractory to, ineligible for, relapsed from and/or intolerant of standard of care treatment or have a disease for which no standard of care exists, including patients with breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and melanoma.

INCHEON, Korea--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Celltrion Group today announced the launch of its Phase I human clinical trial investigating a potential antiviral antibody treatment for patients with COVID-19. The in-human study follows positive pre-clinical results for the treatment candidate and subsequent approval of the Investigational New Drug application by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). The potential treatment will also be investigated for use as a preventative measure.

The Phase I clinical trial aims to enroll 32 healthy volunteers in collaboration with Chungnam National University Hospital. The study will evaluate the safety of the antiviral antibody treatment candidate in healthy participants who have not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The trial’s completion is expected by Q3 of this year.

Celltrion is set to conduct a further in-human Phase I clinical trial of the antiviral treatment candidate in mild COVID-19 patients across Europe, including the UK, which will be followed by global Phase II/III trials in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19. Celltrion anticipates promising preliminary results from pivotal studies by the end of the year.

In addition, a clinical trial investigating the use of the potential antiviral antibody treatment as a preventative measure, by enrolling people in close contact with COVID-19 patients globally, is also planned. The topline data for this trial is anticipated in Q1 of 2021.

Furthermore, Celltrion has previously demonstrated its antiviral antibody treatment to be effective in neutralising the mutated G-variant strain (D614G variant),<sup>1</sup> which is associated with the increased viral transmission and wide spread of COVID-19.<sup>2</sup>

“The initiation of this in-human clinical trial is a key milestone in the development of our antiviral antibody treatment,” said Dr. Sang Joon Lee, Senior Executive Vice President of Celltrion. “We were encouraged by the positive safety and efficacy results in our pre-clinical studies, and we are now ready to move into in-human clinical trials as we originally planned. We remain committed to carrying out local and global clinical studies with the goal of commencing mass production of the therapeutic antibody treatment in the latter half of this year.”

<b>About COVID-19<sup>3,4</sup></b>

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that lead to illnesses from the common cold to severe diseases. Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the disease COVID-19, this new strain, discovered in 2019, is behind the ongoing pandemic outbreak.

The most common signs of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough and tiredness; however, people may also experience other symptoms including shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Most people infected with the virus will exhibit mild to moderate symptoms however older people, and those with existing underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are more likely to develop a more severe form of COVID-19.

There are currently no specific vaccines or treatments approved for COVID-19.

<ul>
 	<li>Companies to collaborate on mRNA vaccine and monoclonal antibody research programmes in infectious diseases</li>
 	<li>GSK to make equity investment of £130m (€150m) in CureVac, and an upfront payment of £104m (€120m)</li>
</ul>
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and CureVac today announced the signing of a strategic collaboration agreement for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialisation of up to five mRNA-based vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting infectious disease pathogens. The collaboration complements GSK’s existing mRNA capabilities with CureVac’s integrated mRNA platform.

mRNA (messenger RNA) technology is a rapidly progressing, cutting-edge platform for the development of new vaccines and medicines, potentially expanding the range of diseases which can be prevented or treated, while also promising to significantly speed up development and manufacturing. mRNA enables protein synthesis in the human body, carrying the genetic code required for cells to manufacture and express proteins. By using mRNA technology in vaccines and medicines, specific proteins, or antigens, can be produced by the body’s own cells, enabling the human immune system to prevent or fight disease.

CureVac’s leadership in mRNA technology, along with its mRNA manufacturing capability, complements GSK's existing scientific leadership in vaccines, including GSK's own self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccine technology platform, and further builds on GSK's growing capability in mAbs innovation, aligned to its R&amp;D focus on the science of immunology. Advancing mRNA-based vaccine and treatment technologies is also expected to play a role in further improving response against future pandemics.

<strong>Roger Connor, President GSK Vaccines</strong>, said: “GSK’s self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccine technology has shown us the potential of mRNA technology to advance the science of vaccine development, and CureVac’s experience complements our own expertise. Through the application of mRNA technology, including SAM, we hope to be able to develop and scale up advanced vaccines and therapies to treat and prevent infectious diseases quicker than ever before.”

<strong>Dr. Franz-Werner Haas</strong>, acting Chief Executive Officer of CureVac, added: “We are delighted to partner with GSK.  With this collaboration, we are gaining a world-class partner whose expertise and global footprint will allow us to further develop and translate the value of our platform into potential products for the world.”

The companies will combine their mRNA expertise on development opportunities across a range of infectious disease pathogens, selected with the potential to best leverage the advantages of this platform technology, while addressing significant unmet medical need and economic burden.  CureVac’s existing COVID-19 mRNA and rabies vaccines research programmes are not included in the collaboration announced today.

Under the terms of the deal, GSK will make an equity investment in CureVac of £130m (€150m), representing close to a 10% stake, an upfront cash payment of £104m (€120m) and a one-time reimbursable payment of £26m (€30m) for manufacturing capacity reservation, upon certification of CureVac’s commercial scale manufacturing facility currently under construction in Germany.

CureVac will be eligible to receive development and regulatory milestone payments of up to £277m (€320m), commercial milestone payments of up to £329m (€380m) and tiered royalties on product sales.

GSK will fund R&amp;D activities at CureVac related to the development projects covered by the collaboration. CureVac will be responsible for the preclinical- and clinical-development through Phase 1 trials of these projects, after which GSK will be responsible for further development and commercialisation. CureVac will be responsible for the GMP manufacturing of the product candidates, including for commercialisation, and will retain commercialisation rights for selected countries for all product candidates.

In the partnership with Roche and Genentech, the companies are working together to generate insights that can be used to advance the development of treatments for better patient outcomes. Following initial efforts focused on multiple sclerosis (MS), PicnicHealth, Roche and Genentech recently expanded their collaboration to support Huntington’s disease (HD), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and hemophilia.

In MS, for example, the companies are working together in a multi-year collaboration that combines over seven years of retrospective medical record data with five years of prospective data for 5,000 patients. The multi-modal data set combines real-world clinical outcomes with MRI images in MS, and allows a deeper understanding of the natural history and progression of such a complex, heterogeneous disease. The data brings together patients' experiences across all sites of care and will help facilitate a better understanding of MS treatment patterns and therapeutic outcomes in the real world.

“At PicnicHealth we are proud to work together with patients to unlock the important information from medical records that is usually stored in disparate and disorganized systems, and leveraging it to advance research,” said Noga Leviner, CEO PicnicHealth. “We’re excited to connect our deep understanding of patient data with the scientific expertise of Roche and Genentech in a joint quest to create personalized treatments for patients.”

James Sabry, Head of Roche Pharma Partnering stated, “Our strategic partnership with PicnicHealth will allow us to better understand serious diseases and accelerate development of effective treatments tailored to the individual needs of patients. By combining PicnicHealth’s uniquely built and curated real-world data sets with groundbreaking science we are aiming to make personalized healthcare a reality across multiple therapeutic areas. ”

<i>Advancing Medical Research with Machine Learning</i>

PicnicHealth uses advanced human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITL ML) to structure medical record data including typical EMR fields, like labs and diagnoses, and also disease-specific elements abstracted from doctors’ notes and reports. As part of the collaboration, data is enriched with unique additions including MRI images, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and linkage to data outside of the medical records. The approach of working directly with patients, who go through an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent process and get access to PicincHealth’s medical record management platform as a benefit of participation, allows PicnicHealth to get records from every site of care for each individual patient. The HITL technology platform, which combines PicnicHealth’s proprietary algorithms with human curation, enables PicnicHealth to ingest and make meaningful use of records from any medical facility in the US, in any format, regardless of hospital system or what electronic medical record system they use.

<b>About PicnicHealth</b>

In pooling, specimens must still be collected into individual vials, but then are combined into small batches or pools by the laboratory. A negative result for a batch means that all patients in that pool are considered negative (If a positive result occurs for the batch, each specimen is retested individually). The technique is an efficient way to evaluate patients in regions or populations with low rates of disease. Pooling is used routinely in blood banking to screen donated blood for a variety of viruses, among other applications.

</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">

With the new pooling EUA, the Quest Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RNA (""Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR"") test* may be used with pooled upper respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal, mid-turbinate, anterior nares or oropharyngeal swabs). **In clinical data presented by Quest to the FDA, none of 3,091 total specimens from a population with a prevalence rate of 1-10 percent, if pooled, would have been incorrectly determined to be negative (95%CI 0.0-0.1%).

The company expects to deploy the technique at its laboratories in <span class=""xn-location"">Chantilly, VA</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Marlborough, Mass.</span>, by the end of next week with additional laboratories to follow.

""As COVID-19 continues to spread around the country, access to timely, quality laboratory testing is critical to patients and an effective public health response,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Steve Rusckowski</span>, Chairman, CEO and President, Quest Diagnostics. ""Pooled specimen testing is a proven technique that will help us to optimize testing capacity at this critical time for our country.""

""We applaud FDA for taking this important step to empower Quest to increase capacity across our national laboratory network,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jay G. Wohlgemuth</span>, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Quest Diagnostics. ""Pooling will help expand testing capacity but it is not a magic bullet, and testing times will continue to be strained as long as soaring COVID-19 test demand outpaces capacity. Each of us can practice behaviors that will reduce COVID-19 infections in our communities, so our national healthcare system can better respond to this crisis.""

On <span class=""xn-chron"">July 13, 2020</span>, Quest issued a <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2860261-1&amp;h=1215234630&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.questdiagnostics.com%2FCOVIDTestingUpdates&amp;a=statement"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">statement</a> that soaring demand for COVID-19 molecular diagnostics is slowing turnaround times to report results.

<u>FDA EUAs for Telemedicine Self-Collection<br class=""dnr"" /></u>Yesterday, the FDA also granted three emergency use authorizations to Quest Diagnostics for the use of its Quest Diagnostics Self-Collection Kit with the Hologic Panther Fusion, Hologic Aptima and Roche cobas molecular platforms. The new EUAs expand the use of the self-collection kit beyond the EUA, granted on <span class=""xn-chron"">May 27th</span>, for the use of the kit on the Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test. The company expects the new EUAs will allow it to use self-collection more broadly on behalf of clients and patients in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. Self-collected specimens that were not observed by a healthcare professional are not eligible for pooling.

<u>New FDA EUAs Follows EUAs for Other Quest Innovations<br class=""dnr"" /></u>Quest Diagnostics is a leader in infectious disease testing services, with a broad menu of molecular, antibody, and other test services to aid diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. The new FDA EUAs follow several others received by the company for its COVID-19 test innovations.

In <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2020</span>, Quest received FDA EUA for The Quest Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Qualitative Real-Time RT-PCR (""Quest SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR""), a real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens collected from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2020</span>, the company received an FDA EUA to use the test nasal swab specimens that are self-collected at home or in a healthcare setting by individuals using an authorized home-collection kit when determined to be appropriate by a healthcare provider.

*The Quest Diagnostics molecular test and self-collection kit have not been FDA cleared or approved, have been authorized by FDA under an EUA, and have been authorized only for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens. The test and self-collection kit are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

**The Quest Diagnostics molecular test is also for use with pooled samples containing up to four individual upper respiratory swab specimens  (nasopharyngeal, mid-turbinate, anterior nares or oropharyngeal swabs) collected under observation in individual vials containing transport media from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Negative results from pooled testing should not be treated as definitive.  If patient's clinical signs and symptoms are inconsistent with a negative result or results are necessary for patient management, then the patient should be considered for individual testing. Specimens included in pools with a positive, inconclusive, or invalid result must be tested individually prior to reporting a result. Specimens with low viral loads may not be detected in sample pools due to the decreased sensitivity of pooled testing.

High levels of neutralising antibodies have been demonstrated in individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, emerging data suggest that a T-cell response could play an important role in mitigation of the disease. Some individuals who have been infected with the virus but remained asymptomatic, have developed a robust T-cell response with an absence of detectable antibodies. Rapid induction of antibodies and T-cells against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be important in protection against COVID-19.</p>

It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.</p>

<p align=""justify"">The preliminary clinical results are for the most advanced investigational vaccine candidate in Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine program against SARS-CoV-2, BNT162b1. This vaccine candidate is a lipid nanoparticle formulated, nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antigen. Overall, the new preliminary data from this German study support and expand upon the recently disclosed <a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3_M6DVpv68gRYTMvrJRX6m9M2RmeV2D1OnVdyETjFNR0UUh57NUyiI1w6agwF6wXd__aYA5nH-rVfjp1Hcsal9JvnLY1JNQVWMxfGw68RlEMWQhQfMfMdD_-b5DuAa31B80n0JNVjzoYVgjDxvMBS3fLbGzTvXP7jTUVJZU41_R3XHe59bLm3unV3YLZX_aCMIwo1As7YzchjgheqPTyh1YCIRNOen5yvrqcUhYd3At63T7x59idT9o8Nv_FlPTIeCr1GdKwPt6elhoS1ympsg=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>early </u><u>results </u><u>from the corresponding U.S. trial</u></a> with BNT162b1.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Preliminary data for BNT162b1 in the German Phase 1/2 trial were evaluated with a total of 60 healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age enrolled in the study. Of these 60 participants, 12 subjects per dose level (1 µg, 10 µg, 30 µg, and 50 µg; 48 participants in total) were vaccinated with BNT162b1 on day 1 and day 22 (n=12 per prime-boost cohort, except n=11 for the 10 µg and 50 µg cohorts from day 22 on). Furthermore, 12 participants received a single injection of 60 µg.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The vaccine elicited high, dose level-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing titers and RBD-binding IgG concentrations after the second dose. Day 43 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing geometric mean titers were in the range of 0.7-fold (1 µg) to 3.2-fold (50 µg) compared to that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 infection convalescent human sera. Furthermore, sera of vaccinated subjects displayed broadly neutralizing activity in pseudovirus neutralization assays across a panel of sixteen SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants represented in publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences and against the newly dominant D614G strain.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In addition, the initial German trial results demonstrate, for the first time for the BNT62b1 candidate, a concurrent induction of high level CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The strength of T cell responses varied between subjects. There was no clear dose level dependency of the T cell response between 1 µg to 50 µg, indicating that stimulation and robust expansion of T cells might be accomplished at low mRNA dose levels.</p>
<p align=""justify"">All subjects in the prime-boost cohorts, except for two at the lowest dose level, had CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Cytokine profiling of the RBD-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrated a T<sub>H</sub>1-dominant profile for these cells. 29 of the 36 tested subjects also mounted an RBD-specific functional, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response that was comparable to memory responses observed against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and influenza virus.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Overall, the data suggested that BNT162b1 could potentially be administered safely, with a manageable tolerability profile. Local reactions and systemic events after injection with BNT162b1 at all dose levels were transient, generally mild to moderate, with occasional severe events (Grade 3) of flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions. All adverse events resolved spontaneously and were managed with simple measures. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported, and there were no withdrawals due to adverse events related to the vaccine.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“It is encouraging that the data on BNT162b1 from the German study cohort are very much in line with what we have seen in the U.S. study cohort. The preliminary data indicate that our mRNA-based vaccine was able to stimulate antibody as well as T-cell responses at remarkably low dose levels. We believe both may play an important role in achieving effective clearance of a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2,” said <strong>Özlem Türeci, M.D., CMO and Co-founder of BioNTech.</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">“These interim results from the German study, combined with initial data from the U.S. study, highlight the potential of this mRNA-based vaccine approach and represent an important step forward in our development efforts for the BNT162 program,” said <strong>Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research &amp; Development, Pfizer.</strong> “We remain dedicated to developing an effective vaccine to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, with safety at the forefront and look forward to sharing additional data as the program progresses.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Preliminary data from both the German and U.S. Phase 1/2 studies, together with additional preclinical and clinical data being generated, will be used by the two companies to determine a dose level and select among multiple vaccine candidates to seek to progress to an anticipated large, global Phase 2b/3 safety and efficacy trial. That trial may involve up to 30,000 healthy participants and is anticipated to begin in late July 2020, if regulatory approval is received.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The BNT162b1 candidate remains under clinical study and is not currently approved for distribution anywhere in the world. If the ongoing studies are successful and the vaccine candidate receives regulatory approval, the companies expect to manufacture up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. In that event, BioNTech and Pfizer would work jointly to distribute the potential COVID-19 vaccine worldwide (excluding China, where BioNTech has a collaboration with Fosun Pharma for BNT162 for both clinical development and commercialization).</p>
