AHP is an ultra-rare condition in which patients can experience debilitating attacks of severe abdominal pain, vomiting and seizures, which can be life-threatening due to the possibility of paralysis and respiratory arrest during attacks. Many patients also experience chronic symptoms, including pain, which continue to be present between attacks.

<p id=""pull-quote"">“We are committed to bringing GIVLAARI to patients in Europe as rapidly as possible, and plan to build on our experience in the U.S. by proactively engaging with national authorities in Europe around a value-based agreement framework which we hope will accelerate patient and provider access to GIVLAARI”</p>
<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200303005205/en/Alnylam-Announces-Approval-GIVLAARI%C2%AE-givosiran-European-Union#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
“Today’s approval of GIVLAARI marks a historic moment for patients and families living with this devastating genetic disease, as there are currently no approved medicines in Europe proven to decrease the frequency of attacks and reduce the chronic pain that many patients suffer,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “We are proud to bring GIVLAARI, our second RNAi medicine to be approved in the last 18 months, to patients in Europe and we want to thank the patients, families, investigators and study staff whose support and involvement have made this achievement possible.”
“The fear of not knowing when an attack will strike, combined with ongoing symptoms between attacks, affects every aspect of patients’ lives, limiting their ability to work and maintain a social life,” said Dr Eliane Sardh, Head of the Porphyria Centre Sweden, Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden. “In our experience, life is very different for patients since they have been treated with givosiran. In addition to a reduction in the number of porphyria attacks which require hospitalization and urgent healthcare visits, we have seen improvements in how patients report their overall health status and quality of life, so this approval is truly meaningful for patients, their families and the healthcare professionals who treat them. Some of our patients have been able to achieve significant personal and professional milestones that would not have been possible before.”
“We are committed to bringing GIVLAARI to patients in Europe as rapidly as possible, and plan to build on our experience in the U.S. by proactively engaging with national authorities in Europe around a value-based agreement framework which we hope will accelerate patient and provider access to GIVLAARI,” said Barry Greene, President, Alnylam. “While every country has its own process for measuring the value of new medicines, we believe this framework will appeal in many countries as it combines payment based on performance with additional financial mechanisms to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the treatment of all AHP patients in line with the authorized indication of GIVLAARI.”
GIVLAARI (givosiran) was granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as well as Orphan Designation in the European Union. GIVLAARI was also granted an accelerated assessment, which is awarded to medicines deemed to be of major public health interest and therapeutic innovation, and the award is designed to bring new treatments to patients more quickly. This EC approval follows the recent approval of GIVLAARI by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November 2019. Givosiran is also awaiting approval in Brazil where it is under priority review.
<b><i>About ENVISION Phase 3 Study
</i></b>The marketing authorization was based on positive data from the ENVISION Phase 3 trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of givosiran in patients with a documented diagnosis of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). The primary endpoint was reduction relative to placebo in the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks, defined as those requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous hemin administration at home, in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP, the most common subtype of AHP) over six months. The trial enrolled 94 patients with AHP, at 36 study sites in 18 countries around the world and is the largest ever interventional study conducted in AHP. Patients were randomized 1:1 to givosiran or placebo, with givosiran administered subcutaneously at 2.5 mg/kg monthly. Upon completion of dosing in the double-blind period, all eligible patients (99%) enrolled in the ENVISION open-label extension (OLE) to receive givosiran on an ongoing basis.
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>In the study, givosiran demonstrated a 74% reduction in the annualized composite rate of porphyria attacks in AIP patients relative to placebo.</li>
 	<li>50% of patients on givosiran were attack-free during the six-month treatment period as compared to 16.3% of placebo-treated patients.</li>
 	<li>Patient-reported daily worst pain was significantly improved with givosiran vs placebo in patients with AIP (p&lt;0.05).</li>
 	<li>Givosiran reduced use of hemin, as well as urinary aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and urinary porphobilinogen (PBG).</li>
 	<li>A greater proportion of patients on givosiran reported improvements in their overall health, pain, daily functioning, compared to placebo.</li>
</ul>
The most frequently occurring adverse reactions reported in patients treated with givosiran are injection site reactions (36%), nausea (32.4%) and fatigue (22.5%). Other adverse reactions seen in givosiran treated patients (occurring =10% more frequently than placebo) include transaminase elevations, rash and glomerular filtration rate decrease.
<b><i>About GIVLAARI<sup>®</sup> (givosiran)
</i></b>GIVLAARI is an RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) for the treatment of adults and adolescents with acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). In the pivotal study, givosiran was shown to significantly reduce the rate of porphyria attacks that required hospitalizations, urgent healthcare visits or intravenous hemin administration at home compared to placebo. GIVLAARI is Alnylam’s first commercially available therapeutic based on its Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology to increase potency and durability. GIVLAARI is administered via subcutaneous injection once monthly at a dose based on actual body weight and should be administered by a healthcare professional. GIVLAARI works by specifically reducing elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to reduction of toxins associated with attacks and other disease manifestations of AHP.
<b><i>About Acute Hepatic Porphyria
</i></b>Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) refers to a family of ultra-rare, genetic diseases characterized by debilitating, potentially life-threatening attacks and, for some patients, chronic manifestations that negatively impact daily functioning and quality of life. AHP is comprised of four subtypes: acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and ALA dehydratase-deficiency porphyria (ADP). Each type of AHP results from a genetic defect leading to a lack of certain enzymes needed to produce heme in the liver, which leads to an accumulation of porphyrins in the body to toxic amounts. AHP disproportionately impacts women of working and childbearing age, and symptoms of the disease vary widely. Severe, unexplained abdominal pain is the most common symptom, which can be accompanied by limb, back, or chest pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, seizures, weak limbs, constipation, diarrhea, or dark or reddish urine. AHP is life-threatening due to the possibility of paralysis and respiratory arrest during attacks. The nonspecific nature of AHP signs and symptoms can often lead to misdiagnoses of other more common conditions such as gynecological disorders, viral gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and appendicitis. Consequently, on a global perspective, patients with AHP can wait up to 15 years for a confirmed diagnosis, with the risk of addiction problems. In addition, long-term complications and comorbidities of AHP can include hypertension, chronic kidney disease or liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma.
<b><i>About RNAi
</i></b>RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.
<b><i>About Alnylam
</i></b>Alnylam (Nasdaq: ALNY) is leading the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare genetic, cardio-metabolic, hepatic infectious, and central nervous system (CNS)/ocular diseases. Based on Nobel Prize-winning science, RNAi therapeutics represent a powerful, clinically validated approach for the treatment of a wide range of severe and debilitating diseases.

<i>Researchers will utilize Iktos’ generative modeling AI technology with SRI’s SynFini synthetic chemistry platform to discover new compounds against multiple viruses, including the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19)</i>
<i>
</i><strong>PARIS and MENLO PARK, Calif., March 3, 2020 – </strong>Iktos, a company specialized in artificial intelligence (AI) for novel drug design and SRI International (SRI), a research center headquartered in Menlo Park, California, today announced that the companies have entered into a collaboration agreement designed to accelerate discovery and development of novel anti-viral therapies. Under the collaboration, Iktos’ generative modeling technology will be combined with SRI’s SynFini™, a fully automated end-to-end synthetic chemistry system, to design novel, optimized compounds and accelerate the identification of drug candidates to treat multiple viruses, including influenza and the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).
Iktos’ AI technology, based on deep generative models, helps bring speed and efficiency to the drug discovery process by automatically designing virtual novel molecules that have all of the desirable characteristics of a novel drug candidate. This tackles one of the key challenges in drug design: rapid and iterative identification of molecules which simultaneously validate multiple bioactive attributes and drug-like criteria for clinical testing.
“Iktos generative AI technology has proven its value and potential to accelerate drug discovery programs in multiple collaborations with renowned pharmaceutical companies. We are eager to apply it to SRI’s endonuclease program and hope our collaboration can make a difference and speed up the identification of promising new therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19,” said Yann Gaston-Mathé, co-founder and CEO of Iktos. “We are excited at the prospect of combining our automated compound design technology with SRI’s SynFini platform and the potential this has to further accelerate drug discovery.”
SRI’s SynFini platform is designed to accelerate chemical discovery and development, and thereby bring new drugs to the clinic more quickly and affordably. The closed loop SynFini platform automates the design, reaction screening and optimization (RSO), and production of target molecules. SynFini comprises three components that work seamlessly together: a software platform (SynRoute™), a reaction screening platform (SynJet™), and a multi-step flow chemistry automation and development platform (AutoSyn™).
SRI has an ongoing program focused on discovering drugs to block endonuclease enzymes that are common to many viruses. These enzymes are involved in viral replication and blocking of host resistance to infection. Sequence analysis of COVID-19 indicates that this virus has an endonuclease that it is genetically about 97 percent similar to the SARS virus. Recent studies show that blocking the SARS virus endonuclease inhibits the infection’s pathogenesis, leading to a 100 percent survival rate in preclinical models. This suggests that the COVID-19 endonuclease is a good therapeutic target.
“The SynFini system has the potential to dramatically expedite small molecule drug discovery,” said Nathan Collins, Ph.D., Chief Strategy Officer of SRI’s Biosciences Division and Head of the SynFini program. “We look forward to exploring how the integration of Iktos’ AI-driven generative molecule combined with SynFini supports the rapid and efficient discovery of new drugs to treat emerging infectious diseases.”
By combining platforms for the accelerated molecular design and automated production of target molecules with established high-throughput biology, Iktos and SRI hope to demonstrate a new paradigm in extremely rapid drug discovery against high-value pharmaceutical targets.

TITUSVILLE, NEW JERSEY, March 4, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) announced today the submission of
a marketing authorisation application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval for ponesimod for the treatment of adult patients with
relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).
Ponesimod is a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator that inhibits S1P protein activity and in so doing is believed to reduce the number of circulating lymphocytes that can cross the blood-brain barrier.i In patients with MS the movement of immune cells into the brain damages myelin, the protective sheath that insulates nerve cells. Damage to myelin slows or halts nerve conduction, producing the neurologic signs and symptoms of MS.ii
“More than 2.3 million people worldwide live with MSiii – including 700,000 in Europe aloneiv – and of this population, approximately 85 percent are initially  diagnosed with relapsing MS.v Despite continuous advancements in the treatment landscape, a number of unmet needs remain,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “This submission is an important milestone as we work to bring a new treatment option to those living with relapsing forms of MS.”
The MAA is based on the head-to-head OPTIMUM Phase 3 study, which showed superior efficacy of ponesimod 20 mg on the primary endpoint of reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR), as well as most secondary endpoints compared to teriflunomide 14 mg in adults with relapsing MS. At week 108, a highly statistically significant reduction of 30.5 percent on ARR
was observed with ponesimod when compared to teriflunomide. Additionally, a statistically significant reduction of fatigue symptoms and a 56 percent reduction on combined unique active lesions (CUALs) in the brain was observed with ponesimod compared to teriflunomide. The safety profile observed for ponesimod was consistent with previous studies of ponesimod and the known safety profile for other S1P receptor modulators. The most common treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the ponesimod 20 mg study arm were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, nasopharyngitis, headache and upper respiratory tract infections.vi
“Fatigue remains a challenging, yet invisible, symptom among those living with MS. We are encouraged by the results ponesimod shows in alleviating this symptom, as well as the reduction in new inflammatory lesions and disability accumulation,” said Husseini Manji, M.D., F.R.C.P.C., Global Therapeutic Area Head for Neuroscience at Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “We look forward to collaborating closely with the EMA as the application process progresses.”
The clinical study data that supports this filing was presented in September 2019 at the 35th Congress of The European Committee for Treatment and Research in
Multiple Sclerosis Conference (ECTRIMS) in Stockholm, Sweden. More information
may be found here.
About Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
MS is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system affecting 2.3 million people worldwide, with females more impacted than males.vii The disease is characterized by demyelinationiii and axonal loss leading to neurological impairment and severe disability.viii Relapsing forms of MS, which make up 85 percent of all MS cases include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS.ix In addition to the debilitating neurological symptoms of the disease, patients often also suffer from “hidden symptoms,” namely fatigue and depression, both of which are major contributors to the reduced quality of life.x Relapses are defined as new, worsening or recurrent neurological symptoms that last for more than 24 hours with the absence of fever or infections. Relapses may be fully resolved over days or weeks or lead to persistent residual deficits and accumulation of disability.xi

<p class=""bwalignc""> — <em>Recent Alnylam advances in lung delivery technology suggest possible utility of siRNAs in targeting SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses</em></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><em>— Vir to lead development of potential coronavirus RNAi therapeutic candidates, with Alnylam retaining an option for 50-50 participation</em></p>
SAN FRANCISCO &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY) today announced an expansion of their existing collaboration to include the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19. Under the agreement, the companies will utilize Alnylam’s recent advances in lung delivery of novel conjugates of siRNA – the molecules that mediate RNAi – together with Vir’s infectious disease expertise and established capabilities, to bring forward one or more siRNAs to treat SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other coronaviruses as well. The collaboration will focus on development of siRNAs that Alnylam recently identified that target highly conserved regions of coronavirus RNAs.
Alnylam has designed and synthesized over 350 siRNAs targeting all available SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes, which will be screened in <em>in vitro</em> potency assays. Potent siRNA lead candidates will be further evaluated by scientists at Vir for <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> anti-viral activity, leading to the selection of a development candidate (DC).
Vir will lead all development and commercialization of any selected DCs. At clinical proof of concept, Alnylam will have an option to share equally in the profits and losses associated with the development and commercialization of the coronavirus program. Alternatively, Alnylammay elect to earn development and commercialization milestones and royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration in amounts agreed upon for the coronavirus program. This new program expands the companies’ existing licensing agreement announced in 2017 to now develop up to six novel siRNAs to treat infectious diseases.
“Given the scope and speed of the COVID-19 outbreak, Vir is seeking multiple approaches that combine our expertise in infectious disease with that of current and new partners to respond rapidly,” said George Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vir Biotechnology. “Alnylam has been an excellent partner, and our complementary capabilities made this a compelling opportunity to address this growing public health crisis.”
<em>“</em>RNAi is a powerful, natural cellular mechanism that can be harnessed to develop a broad range of innovative medicines, including anti-viral therapies. Our recent pre-clinical progress in extra-hepatic delivery of siRNAs has now been extended to the lung, and we’re encouraged that these results could potentially translate to humans,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. “We believe RNAi therapeutics represent a promising approach for targeting coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. As the leader in RNAi therapeutics, we at Alnylam are committed to doing our part in joining other biopharmaceutical companies, like Vir, to address this emerging outbreak.”
The companies are currently collaborating on VIR-2218 (ALN-HBV02), a novel, investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the first program to enter the clinic as a part of the infectious disease collaboration. The safety and efficacy of VIR-2218 are currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 study.
<strong>About RNAi</strong>
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

<strong>About AGN-151587 (EDIT-101)</strong>
AGN-151587 (EDIT-101) is a CRISPR-based experimental medicine under investigation for the treatment of Leber congenital amaurosis 10 (LCA10). AGN-151587 is administered via a subretinal injection to deliver the gene editing machinery directly to photoreceptor cells.
<strong>About Leber Congenital Amaurosis</strong>
Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA, is a group of inherited retinal degenerative disorders caused by mutations in at least 18 different genes. It is the most common cause of inherited childhood blindness, with an incidence of two to three per 100,000 live births worldwide. Symptoms of LCA appear within the first years of life, resulting in significant vision loss and potentially blindness. The most common form of the disease, LCA10, is a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene and is the cause of disease in approximately 20-30 percent of all LCA patients.
<strong>About the Editas Medicine-Allergan Alliance</strong>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission today signed a <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/134864/download"">joint statement</a> regarding enhanced collaboration in support of a robust marketplace for biological products, including the critical adoption of bio-similars and interchangeable products. This joint statement describes key steps the agencies will take to address false or misleading promotion about biosimilars within their respective authorities and deter anti-competitive behavior in this space.
<strong>“Competition is key for helping American patients have access to affordable medicines. While these therapies are critical for patients, biological products contribute significantly to drug costs, as they are often far more complex to develop than other drugs” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Strengthening efforts to curtail and discourage anti-competitive behavior is key for facilitating robust competition for patients in the biologics marketplace, including through biosimilars, bringing down the costs of these crucial products for patients.”</strong>
<strong>“Biologics are essential to the treatment of many serious illnesses. Practices in biologics markets are delaying the availability of biosimilar products, thereby depriving patients of the benefits of competition, including lower prices and increased innovation,” said FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. “The FTC is committed to continuing to enforce the antitrust laws in healthcare markets, including those for biologics and biosimilars.”</strong>
Biological products are a diverse category of products which may be produced through biotechnology in a living system, such as a microorganism, plant cell, or animal cell, and are used to diagnose, prevent, treat, and cure diseases and medical conditions. <a title=""Biosimilar and Interchangeable Products"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/drugs/biosimilars/biosimilar-and-interchangeable-products"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""2c6ef3e1-78e6-4e13-9eee-9ffc69dc03de"">Biosimilars</a> are biological products that are highly similar to and have no clinically meaningful differences from existing FDA-approved “reference” products. Reference products are FDA-approved biological products against which proposed biosimilar products are compared.
Biosimilar and interchangeable products have the potential to greatly reduce health care costs, similar to what has been seen with increased generic drug offerings. The 1984 Hatch Waxman Act, which created an abbreviated path to market for generic versions of small molecule drugs, has <a href=""https://accessiblemeds.org/resources/blog/2019-generic-drug-and-biosimilars-access-savings-us-report"">saved patients roughly $2 trillion</a><a class=""ext-disclaimer"" href=""http://www.fda.gov/about-fda/website-policies/website-disclaimer""><span class=""sr-only"">External Link Disclaimer</span></a> over the past decade. While the U.S. market for biosimilar versions of biological products is still maturing, the FDA’s research suggests that after market entry, biosimilars have the potential to offer significant savings. Biosimilars marketed in the U.S. typically have launched with initial list prices 15 to 35% lower than comparative list prices of the reference products.
However, anti-competitive practices, such as making false or misleading statements comparing biological reference products and biosimilars, may be slowing progress and hampering uptake of these important therapies. The FDA and the FTC have serious concerns about such statements and their negative impact on public health, including their potential to create negative misperceptions about the safety or effectiveness of approved biosimilars. The agencies intend to take appropriate steps to address companies making false or misleading communications about biologics, including biosimilars and interchangeable products, which will help deter anti-competitive behavior in the biologics market and can help lead to the use of all available biological products.
As detailed in the joint statement, the agencies will also collaborate on future public outreach efforts, including bringing together participants from industry, academia and government agencies to discuss issues relating to competition in the biologics market. To this end, today we’re also announcing that the FDA and FTC will hold a public workshop, “<a title=""Public Workshop: FDA/FTC Workshop on a Competitive Marketplace for Biosimilars - 03/09/2020 - 03/09/2020"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/public-workshop-fdaftc-workshop-competitive-marketplace-biosimilars-03092020-03092020"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""e71b9cc7-1b96-4a67-80a3-01d0806003c2"">FDA/FTC Workshop on a Competitive Marketplace for Biosimilars</a>” on March 9 at the FDA’s White Oak Campus in Silver Spring, Md.
The agencies will exchange information, when appropriate, about best practices to prevent activities that impede access to samples of the reference product that the prospective biosimilar applicant needs for testing. Additionally, the FTC intends to review patent settlement agreements involving biosimilars, to prevent antitrust violations.
Another key to ensuring that public information surrounding biosimilars and their reference products is communicated in a truthful and non-misleading manner is the FDA’s regulation of industry’s promotional materials for all prescription drugs, including biosimilar and reference products. Therefore, the FDA is publishing a <a title=""Promotional Labeling and Advertising Considerations for Prescription Biological Reference and Biosimilar Products Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/promotional-labeling-and-advertising-considerations-prescription-biological-reference-and-biosimilar"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""ba9ab28e-69dd-4418-bfa5-feecf6f5d3a7"">draft guidance</a> outlining its current thinking on presenting data and information in a truthful and non-misleading way about biosimilars and reference products in FDA-regulated promotional materials. It addresses questions companies may have when developing these kinds of materials and provides examples that can help with specific situations biosimilar and reference product companies may encounter.
Availability of this new draft guidance and ongoing collaboration with the FTC is part of the FDA’s continuing work to help ensure truthful and non-misleading prescription drug promotion and serves as another example of the FDA’s commitment to public health by addressing anti-competitive tactics that aim to undermine confidence in the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biosimilar products.
Today’s announcements are key deliverables in the FDA’s <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/114574/download"">Biosimilars Action Plan (BAP)</a> that outlines four key strategies to accelerate biosimilar competition, including supporting market competition and providing clearer direction to industry on the development of promotional materials for medical products. The FDA is <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/02/04/2020-02100/guidance-promotional-labeling-and-advertising-considerations-for-prescription-biological-reference"">accepting comments</a> from the public on the draft guidance from Feb. 4 to April 6.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FDA16120529002343.jpg,Biosimilars,US FDA|US FTC,Biologics,Biosimilars|2020|Agreement|BAP|Competitive Marketplace|Development|FTC|Sign|Support|the US FDA,publish,3-2-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

7 This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug
8 Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not
9 binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the

15 I. INTRODUCTION
16
17 This guidance provides recommendations to applicants seeking licensure under section 351(k) of
18 the Public Health Service (PHS) Act of a proposed biosimilar or proposed interchangeable
19 biosimilar2
for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use. This
20 guidance also provides recommendations on the submission of a supplement to a licensed 351(k)
21 biologics license application (BLA) seeking to add a condition of use that previously has been
22 licensed3
for the reference product to the labeling4
of a licensed biosimilar or interchangeable
23 product, including considerations related to the timing of such submissions.
24
25 This guidance includes recommendations regarding the following specific issues:
26
27 ? Submission of an application seeking licensure of a proposed biosimilar or proposed
28 interchangeable biosimilar for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of
29 use.
1 This draft guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency). 2 In this draft guidance, the following terms are used to describe biological products licensed under section 351(k) of
the PHS Act: (1) biosimilar or biosimilar product refers to a product that FDA has determined to be biosimilar to
the reference product (see sections 351(i)(2) and 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act); and (2) interchangeable,
interchangeable biosimilar, or interchangeable product refers to a biosimilar product that FDA has also determined
to be interchangeable with the reference product (see sections 351(i)(3) and 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act).
Biosimilarity, interchangeability, and related issues are discussed in more detail in section II of this draft guidance.
3
As stated in FDA’s guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference
Product (May 2019), FDA expects that applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and
information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same
clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use. We update
guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents. 4
Unless otherwise specified, the terms biosimilar product labeling and labeling as used in this guidance address
only the prescribing information as described in 21 CFR 201.56 and 201.57.

Draft—Not for Implementation
30 ? Development of proposed labeling when the applicant seeks licensure of a proposed
31 biosimilar or proposed interchangeable product for fewer than all of the reference product’s
32 licensed conditions of use.
33 ? Submission of a supplement to an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar
34 to seek licensure for a condition of use previously licensed for the reference product. This
35 may occur, for example, when (1) the biosimilar or interchangeable product was initially
36 licensed for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use, or (2) the
37 reference product is licensed for a new condition of use after licensure of the biosimilar or
38 interchangeable product.
39 ? Timing for the submission of a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a licensed 351(k) BLA
40 described above with the goal of obtaining licensure of a condition of use for a biosimilar or
41 interchangeable product as soon as possible after the expiration of any relevant exclusivity or
42 patents.
43
44 This guidance is one in a series of guidances that FDA is developing to implement the Biologics
45 Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) and includes references to
46 information from other FDA guidances, where appropriate.
47
48 In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
49 Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
50 as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
51 the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
52 not required.

54
55 II. BACKGROUND
56
57 A. The Biosimilar Pathway
58
59 Section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the
60 requirements for the licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar. Section 351(i)
61 defines biosimilarity to mean “that the biological product is highly similar to the reference
62 product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components” and that “there are
63 no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in
64 terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product” (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A
65 BLA submitted under section 351(k) (a “351(k) BLA”) must contain, among other things,
66 information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based
67 upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies,5
and a clinical study or studies, unless
68 FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) BLA (see
69 section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act).
70
5
We support the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We
encourage sponsors to consult with us if it they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable,
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency
to an animal test method.
2
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Draft—Not for Implementation
71 To meet the standard for “interchangeability,” an applicant must provide sufficient information
72 to demonstrate biosimilarity to the reference product and also to demonstrate that the biological
73 product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given
74 patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in
75 terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the
76 biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference
77 product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act).
78 Interchangeable biosimilars may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention
79 of the prescribing healthcare provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).
80
81 B. Licensure of a Biosimilar or Interchangeable Biosimilar for Fewer Than All of the
82 Reference Product’s Licensed Conditions of Use
83
84 A biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar may be licensed only for conditions of use that have
85 been previously licensed for the reference product.6
An applicant generally may obtain licensure
86 of a biosimilar or interchangeable for fewer than all of the conditions of use for which the
87 reference product is licensed.7
However, FDA recommends that an applicant seeking licensure
88 for a proposed interchangeable product seek licensure for all of the reference product’s licensed
89 conditions of use when possible.8
90
91 A variety of circumstances may lead an applicant to seek licensure of a proposed biosimilar or
92 proposed interchangeable product for fewer than all of the conditions of use for which the
93 reference product is licensed. Examples of these circumstances are described below.
94
95 Orphan-drug Exclusivity
96
97 The reference product may be licensed for one or more indications that are protected by orphan98 drug exclusivity. In such cases, until the applicable exclusivity expires, FDA will not be able to
99 license a biosimilar or interchangeable product for the protected indications. However, assuming
100 that the requirements for licensure are met, FDA may be able to license a biosimilar or
101 interchangeable product for one or more indications of the reference product that are not
102 protected by orphan-drug exclusivity. In such circumstances, an applicant may choose to seek
103 licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable product for such indications.
104
105 After the applicable orphan-drug exclusivity expires, the applicant may, in a supplement to the
106 licensed 351(k) BLA, seek licensure of the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for a
6
Section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act.
7 Notably, section 351(k)(4)(A) of the PHS Act provides, among other things, that an application for an
interchangeable product must include information sufficient to show that the proposed interchangeable product “can
be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient.” FDA expects that
applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and information to support a showing that the
proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all
of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use. Guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating
Interchangeability With a Reference Product (May 2019).

107 previously protected indication, and FDA may license the biosimilar or interchangeable
108 biosimilar for this indication if the requirements for licensure are met.9
109
110 Circumstances Other Than Exclusivity
111
112 ? Patent(s) covering a licensed condition of use of the reference product: An applicant may
113 conclude that a licensed condition of use of the reference product is protected by one or more
114 patent(s). As a result, the applicant may decide not to seek licensure of a proposed biosimilar
115 or proposed interchangeable product for conditions of use that are protected by patent,
116 according to the applicant’s own assessment.
117
118 ? Other reasons: Reasons other than patents or exclusivity may lead an applicant to choose to
119 seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed.
120
121 III. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APPLICANTS SEEKING LICENSURE OF A
122 BIOSIMILAR OR INTERCHANGEABLE BIOSIMILAR FOR FEWER THAN
123 ALL OF THE REFERENCE PRODUCT’S LICENSED CONDITIONS OF USE
124
125 A. Submission of Original 351(k) BLA or Supplement to a 351(k) BLA
126
127 1. Submission of an Original 351(k) BLA for Licensure for Fewer Than All of the
128 Reference Product’s Licensed Conditions of Use
129
130 As part of an original 351(k) BLA, an applicant is expected to submit draft labeling that includes
131 the conditions of use for which the applicant is seeking licensure of the proposed biosimilar or
132 proposed interchangeable product.10, 11 Additional considerations regarding draft labeling are
133 described in section III.B in this guidance. Applicants may contact the appropriate review
134 division in FDA for more information about submitting a 351(k) BLA for licensure of a
135 proposed biosimilar or proposed interchangeable biosimilar for fewer than all of the reference
136 product’s licensed conditions of use.
137

Similarly, as provided by section 351(m) of the PHS Act, an additional six-month period of exclusivity will attach
to certain applicable periods of exclusivity if the sponsor conducts pediatric studies that meet the requirements for
pediatric exclusivity pursuant to section 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act). As with
orphan-drug exclusivity, during the applicable period of pediatric exclusivity FDA may be able to license a
biosimilar or interchangeable product for one or more indications of the reference product that are not protected by
such exclusivity, and FDA may license the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for a previously protected
indication after the applicable pediatric exclusivity expires.
10 FDA has issued draft guidance regarding the submission of data and information to support approval of a
proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for an indication for which the reference product has unexpired
exclusivity. See Q.I.24 in the draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Q&amp;As on Biosimilar Development
and the BPCI Act (Revision 2) (December 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA’s current
thinking on this topic.
11 See section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act, which requires that a 351(k) application include information
demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling
proposed for the biological product have been previously approved for the reference product.

138 2. Submission of a Supplement to a 351(k) BLA Seeking Licensure of a Biosimilar or
139 Interchangeable Biosimilar for an Additional Condition of Use Previously Licensed
140 for the Reference Product
141
142 The holder of a licensed 351(k) BLA may, in a supplement to the 351(k) BLA, seek licensure of
143 its biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for an additional condition of use that has been
144 previously licensed for the reference product and for which the applicant did not originally seek
145 licensure. A 351(k) BLA holder seeking licensure for an additional condition of use must submit
146 a supplement in accordance with 21 CFR 601.12 seeking licensure of the proposed change. See
147 section III.C.
148
149 A supplement to a 351(k) BLA seeking licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar
150 for an additional condition of use should contain all the data and information needed to support
151 licensure of the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for the proposed condition of use, which
152 may include reference to data and information previously submitted to the 351(k) BLA with
153 appropriate scientific justification. Applicants may contact the appropriate clinical review
154 division at FDA for more information about licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable
155 biosimilar in such circumstances.
156
157 B. Development of Draft Labeling for a Proposed Biosimilar or Interchangeable
158 Product for Fewer Than All of the Reference Product’s Licensed Conditions of Use
159 FDA’s guidance for industry Labeling for Biosimilar Products (“Biosimilar Labeling
160 Guidance”), provides general recommendations on the development of draft labeling for
161 proposed biosimilar products for submission in a 351(k) BLA.12 In the Biosimilar Labeling
162 Guidance, FDA recommends that labeling for a biosimilar product incorporate relevant data and
163 information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications. The Biosimilar
164 Labeling Guidance also explains that determining which data and information from the reference
165 product labeling should be incorporated into the proposed labeling for a biosimilar will depend
166 on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all—or fewer than all—of the conditions of use
167 licensed for the reference product.
168
169 1. Content of Draft Labeling
170
171 The applicant should develop draft labeling for the proposed biosimilar or proposed
172 interchangeable biosimilar that includes information from the reference product labeling that is
173 relevant to the proposed conditions of use for the proposed biosimilar or interchangeable, with
174 appropriate modifications. In preparing such draft labeling, the applicant should carefully
175 scrutinize the content of all sections of the labeling to ensure that relevant information is
12 See guidance for industry Labeling for Biosimilar Products (July 2018), which states that it does not provide
specific labeling recommendations for interchangeable products and that any specific recommendations for
interchangeable products will be provided in future guidance.

Draft—Not for Implementation
176 included, based on the proposed conditions of use for the proposed biosimilar or interchangeable
177 product.13
178
179 FDA will evaluate the labeling to determine whether it complies with applicable requirements.14
180 For example, the labeling must summarize the essential scientific information needed for the safe
181 and effective use of the product.15 FDA regulations also require that prescription drug labeling
182 contain:
183
184 “adequate information … including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods,
185 and frequency and duration of administration and any relevant warnings, hazards,
186 contraindications, side effects, and precautions, under which practitioners licensed
187 by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the purposes for
188 which it is intended …”16
189
190 2. Information to Support Draft Labeling for a Biosimilar or Interchangeable Product
191 for Fewer Than All of the Reference Product’s Licensed Conditions of Use
192
193 In general, FDA does not expect an applicant to submit a justification for the applicant’s decision
194 not to seek licensure of a biosimilar for all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use.
195 FDA does not consider the applicability of patents to a proposed biosimilar product (e.g., the
196 validity or enforceability of patents or potential infringement) in its review of a 351(k) BLA or
197 supplement to a 351(k) BLA.17 An applicant seeking licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable
198 biosimilar for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use may, in a
199 351(k) BLA or a supplement to a 351(k) BLA, submit information that is intended to inform
200 FDA’s review of the draft labeling. For example, an applicant may submit a justification as to
201 why, in the applicant’s view, the draft labeling meets the requirements for approval, considering
202 the conditions of use for which the applicant is seeking licensure.
203
204 C. Timing Considerations for Submission of a 351(k) BLA or Supplement to a 351(k)
205 BLA
206
207 The recommendations in this section are intended to facilitate submission of a 351(k) BLA or
208 supplement to a licensed 351(k) BLA with the goal of obtaining licensure of a biosimilar or
209 interchangeable biosimilar soon after expiration of any relevant exclusivity or expiration of a
13 For example, as noted in the guidance for industry Labeling for Biosimilar Products (July 2018), “in certain
circumstances it may be necessary to include information in the biosimilar product labeling relating to an
indication(s) for which the biosimilar product is not licensed, in order to help ensure safe use …” Additionally,
although biosimilar labeling need not be identical to reference product labeling, deviations should be carefully
considered to ensure that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the draft
labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product (see section
351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).
14 See, e.g., 21 CFR 201.56 and 21 CFR 201.57.
15 See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).
16 See 21 CFR 201.100(d)(1) (emphasis added).
17 For more information about the exchange of confidential information for purposes of determining whether a claim
of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted against a 351(k) applicant, refer to section 351(l) of the PHS Act
(42 U.S.C. 262(l)).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Draft—Not for Implementation
210 patent that, in the 351(k) applicant’s assessment, protects a licensed condition of use of the
211 reference product. These recommendations also are applicable to a supplement to a licensed
212 351(k) BLA that seeks licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for an additional
213 condition of use for which the applicant did not originally seek licensure but that has since been
214 licensed for the reference product.
215
216 1. Targeted Timelines for Review
217
218
219
220
Original 351(k) BLA
As described in the Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA) II Goals Letter, FDA is committed to
reviewing and acting on original 351(k) BLAs within 10 months of the 60-day filing date.18
221
222
223
224
Supplements to a Licensed 351(k) BLA
In the BsUFA II Goals Letter, FDA also committed to reviewing and acting on original 351(k)
BLA supplements with clinical data within 10 months of receipt.19 In light of the anticipated
225 FDA review burden (among other considerations), FDA anticipates that it will review and act on
226 many supplements seeking licensure for additional conditions of use for a licensed biosimilar or
227 interchangeable product before the BsUFA goal date. To the extent practicable, FDA intends
228 that a supplement to a licensed 351(k) BLA seeking licensure of the biosimilar or
229 interchangeable product for an additional condition of use that has been previously licensed for
230 the reference product will be reviewed and acted upon in a 6-month timeframe, without regard to
231 whether the biosimilar or interchangeable product was initially licensed for fewer than all of the
232 reference product’s licensed conditions of use or the reference product is licensed for a new
233 condition of use after licensure of the biosimilar or interchangeable product.
234
235 FDA recognizes that targeting a 6-month timeline for such supplements may surpass, in many
236 cases, the performance goal commitment FDA made in the BsUFA II Goals Letter. Supplements
237 seeking licensure for additional conditions of use for a licensed biosimilar or interchangeable
238 product likely will include clinical data or reference clinical data submitted previously to the
239 351(k) BLA. As noted, the BsUFA II Goals Letter describes a 10-month goal date for original
240 351(k) BLA supplements with clinical data. However, at this time, FDA believes that a review
241 timeframe of 6 months will generally be appropriate for a supplement to a licensed 351(k) BLA
242 seeking licensure of the biosimilar or interchangeable product for an additional condition of use
243 that has been previously licensed for the reference product, assuming the supplement does not
244 raise novel review issues. Among other considerations, this is based on the anticipated FDA
245 review burden associated with these types of supplements. FDA intends to notify applicants in
246 an acknowledgement letter if it believes that the 10-month review timeline described in the
247 BsUFA II Goals Letter is more appropriate for any such supplement.

Draft—Not for Implementation
250 2. Unexpired Exclusivity
251
252
253
The Agency cannot license a biosimilar or interchangeable product for an indication protected by
orphan-drug exclusivity or pediatric exclusivity until the expiration of that exclusivity.20 If an
254 applicant’s proposed labeling includes conditions of use that are protected by unexpired orphan255
256
drug exclusivity or unexpired pediatric exclusivity, the Agency may communicate this issue to
the applicant in the Day 74 letter.21 In these circumstances, an applicant may seek to time the
257 submission of a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA with the goal of obtaining licensure
258 after a specific date, such as the expiration of orphan-drug or pediatric exclusivity.
259
260 3. Circumstances Other Than Exclusivity, Including Patents
261
262 As described above, an applicant may choose to seek licensure of a proposed biosimilar or
263 interchangeable biosimilar for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use
264 based on an assessment by the applicant that one or more of the reference product’s licensed
265 conditions of use is protected by patent. In these circumstances, an applicant may seek to time
266 the submission of a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA with the goal of obtaining
267 licensure after a specific date, such as the expiration of a patent. Other nonpatent reasons may
268 also lead an applicant to take this approach.
269
270 In contrast to orphan-drug and pediatric exclusivity, the BPCI Act does not limit FDA’s ability to
271 license a 351(k) BLA or a supplement to a 351(k) BLA where a biosimilar seeks licensure for a
272 condition of use which may be subject to one or more patents. FDA may therefore license the
273 product for such condition of use if FDA determines that the requirements for licensure have
274 been met.
275
276
277
Applicants should be aware that FDA may review and act on (i.e., license or issue a complete
response letter to)22 a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA before any applicable BsUFA
278 goal date or 6-month targeted review timeline. If an applicant does not want FDA to take action
279 on a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA before a specified date, the applicant should
280 request that the Agency refrain from acting on the BLA or supplement before the specified date,
281 so long as that date falls on or before the applicable BsUFA goal date.
282
283 To request that FDA not take action on a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA before a
284 specified date, the applicant should include the following language on the cover letter of their
285 BLA or supplement, in bold typeface and prominently placed above the body of the cover letter:
286
287
288
351(k) BLA action timing request: [Applicant Name] requests that FDA not
take action on this [application/supplement] before [specified date].
289
290 If the applicant requests that FDA refrain from taking action on the 351(k) BLA or a supplement
291 to a 351(k) BLA until a specified date that is on or before any applicable BsUFA goal date, the
20 See section 527 of the FD&amp;C Act; section 351(m) of the PHS Act; 21 CFR 316.31. 21 See BsUFA II Goals Letter, p. 10. 22 See BsUFA II Goals Letter, p. 32 (defining “review and act on” to mean “the issuance of a complete action letter
after complete review of a filed complete application”).

292 Agency intends to honor the applicant’s request, where appropriate. Applicants should take
293 BsUFA goal dates into consideration before making such requests. If the requested date extends
294 beyond any applicable BsUFA goal date, the Agency does not intend to honor the applicant’s
295 request.
296
297 Upon receipt of the 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA containing a request not to act
298 before any applicable BsUFA goal date (or another specified date prior to a BsUFA goal date),

<span class=""xn-location"">CONCORD, Mass.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 4, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Alopexx Oncology, LLC announced today that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Beijing Shenogen Pharma Group to develop and commercialize DI-<span class=""xn-money"">Leu16</span>-IL2 in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>and other parts of Asia.  Alopexx will receive an upfront payment, various development and commercial milestones and royalties on sales.
DI-<span class=""xn-money"">LEU16</span>-IL2 is a novel antibody-cytokine fusion protein (or immunocytokine) targeting the B cell antigen, CD20.  The CD20 antibody recognizes the same target on B cells as Rituxan and maintains the activities of both the antibody and cytokine components.  In addition, it  is also involved in tumor targeting, engagement of the immune system, and induction of an anti-cancer vaccine effect.
In a Phase I study of DI-<span class=""xn-money"">LEU16</span>-IL2 conducted in the 3 US centers, fifteen of 18 patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell CD20 positive lymphoma who received 2 or more cycles of therapy had tumor regression or stabilization including 3 complete and 2 partial responses. The durations of response were over 12 months in many cases. The durability of those responses was maintained in patients months after stopping treatment suggesting a vaccine effect had occurred. These study results are similar to a previous investigator sponsored Phase 1 study conducted at the City of Hope by Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Andrew Raubitschek</span>.
""We believe that DI-<span class=""xn-money"">Leu16</span>-IL2 will significantly help individuals with B-cell malignancies<span id=""spanHghlt25f9"">,""</span> said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Daniel Vlock</span>, founder and CEO of Alopexx Enterprises.  ""We are delighted to be working with Shenogen to advance the <span id=""spanHghlt55a0"">development</span> of this promising therapeutic<span id=""spanHghltf749"">.""</span>
Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Kun Meng</span>, Chairman of Shenogen Pharma Group, commented, ""<span id=""spanHghltd5f3"">We</span> are very excited with this exclusive in-license opportunity of DI-<span class=""xn-money"">Leu16</span>-IL2 antibody-cytokine fusion protein from Alopexx, which opens the door for us to get into the B-cell lymphoma space of immunotherapy<span id=""spanHghlt59c7"">.""</span> Given the advantage of combining the benefits of anti-CD20 and IL2, two targets with approved anti-cancer drugs, Dr. Meng said,  ""We believe DI-<span class=""xn-money"">Leu16</span>-IL2 can offer superior efficacy and better serve the unmet medical needs of patients with B-cell lymphomas, especially with the relapsed and refractory forms of diseases<span id=""spanHghlt8017"">.""</span> Shenogen plans to develop this drug as a potential single agent, or as combination therapy with other drugs<span id=""spanHghlt1e1d"">.</span>
<b>About DI-<span class=""xn-money"">Leu16</span>-IL2</b>
CD20 is a protein frequently expressed on cancer cells associated with NHL. Pre-clinical studies have shown that DI-<span class=""xn-money"">Leu16</span>-IL2, which has activities of both the anti-CD20 antibody and cytokine components, targets the tumor cells, engages the immune system and has the potential to produce an anti-cancer vaccine effect. As a result of this vaccine-like effect, long- term anti-cancer activity should continue and future cancer cells could be destroyed even without the need for re-dosing.
""The fusion of the anti-CD20 antibody and the cytokine IL2 creates an effect that is far more powerful than administering those therapeutics individually or in combination,"" explained <span class=""xn-person"">Stephen Gillies</span>, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Alopexx Oncology. ""In this therapeutic approach the drug elicits a T-cell response and also activates the innate immunity to kill tumor cells, and that is a very important distinction between this and other treatments.""
<b>About Alopexx Oncology/Alopexx Enterprises</b>
Alopexx Oncology, LLC, a portfolio company of Alopexx Enterprises, licensed the rights to develop and commercialize its lead drug candidate DI-<span class=""xn-money"">Leu16</span>-IL2 from Provenance Biopharmaceuticals Corp. in 2011.  This molecule was originally developed by Merck KGaA (now Merck Healthcare KGaA). In 2009 Merck KGaA license the global rights of DI-<span class=""xn-money"">Leu16</span>-IL2 to Provenance Biopharmaceuticals Corp.

&nbsp;
BEIJING/ZURICH, March 4 (Reuters) - China has approved the use of Swiss drugmaker Roche's <span id=""x1"">ROG.S</span> anti-inflammation drug Actemra for patients who develop severe complications from the coronavirus as it urgently hunts for new ways to combat the deadly infection that is spreading worldwide.
China is hoping that some older drugs could stop severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), or cytokine storms, an overreaction of the immune system which is considered a major factor behind catastrophic organ failure and death in some coronavirus patients.
Actemra, a biologic drug approved in 2010 in the United States for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inhibits high Interleukin 6 (IL-6) protein levels that drive some inflammatory diseases.
China's National Health Commission said in treatment guidelines published online on Wednesday that Actemra can now be used to treat coronavirus patients with serious lung damage and high IL-6 levels.

</div>
</div>
Separately, researchers in the country are testing Actemra, known generically as tocilizumab, in a clinical trial expected to include 188 coronavirus patients and running until May 10.
Roche, which donated 14 million yuan ($2.02 million) worth of Actemra during February, said the trial was initiated independently by a third party with the aim of exploring the efficacy and safety of the drug in coronavirus patients with CRS.
It added that there was currently no published clinical trial data on the drug's safety or efficacy against the virus.
More than 3,000 people have died and 93,000 have been infected by the novel coronavirus thought to have originated in Wuhan, China, before spreading to around 90 countries including the United States, Italy, Switzerland, France and Germany.

</div>
</div>
The Swiss company, for which China is its No. 2 market behind the United States, also makes diagnostic gear to detect the coronavirus.
Since Actemra's approval a decade ago, it has become a go-to drug against other inflammatory conditions, including cytokine storms in cancer patients receiving cell therapies from Novartis <span id=""x2"">NOVN.S</span> and Gilead Sciences <span id=""x3"">GILD.O</span>.
In 2012 it helped save the life of a young U.S. girl, the first child to be treated for leukaemia with Novatis' Kymriah, from a post-treatment rush of IL-6.
Priced at between $20-30,000 annually for RA according to SSR Health, Roche's medicine is also used for rare juvenile arthritis and giant cell arteritis, or inflammation of the blood vessels.

The laboratory mAbxience, which is part of Insud Pharma, has inaugurated a new biosimilar monoclonal antibody plant in Garín, Buenos Aires (Argentina). These drugs are used in the treatment of oncological and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
With this new plant, the company now has three biosimilar plants, two in Argentina and one in Spain (León).
The project involved a 40 million dollar investment and represents a significant milestone in the Latin American biopharmaceutical industry. Thanks to the commissioning of the new plant, mAbxience has doubled its production capacity, and will be equipped to meet Argentinian and international demand for the next 10 years. The company exports biosimilars from Argentina to Central America, South America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
The entry of biosimilars into the market has cut healthcare expenditure by 40%, supporting the sustainability of healthcare systems and allowing for increased patient access to treatment for complex diseases. “mAbxience has saved in Argentina the equivalent of 400 million dollars since it started marketing biosimilar monoclonal antibodies, and its presence in the market has forced the country’s only seller of imported products to lower its prices,” said Hugo Sigman, founder of the Insud Group.
The plant currently has 162 employees. Its commissioning allowed for the immediate creation of 50 new jobs and it is expected to generate another 50 positions over the coming years. mAbxience’s team of biotechnologists, biochemists, biologists, pharmacists and technicians undertake all operations in accordance with the strictest global Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).
Since the company’s inception, more than 35,000 patients have been treated with these drugs in Latin America, all of whom have been monitored under a comprehensive pharmacovigilance programme. The additional output generated at the new plant will allow more patients to access treatment in Argentina and worldwide. In Argentina, marketing of Rituximab and Bevacizumab is undertaken by the laboratory ELEA.

</div>
Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is informing patients, health care providers and manufacturers about a set of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, referred to as “SweynTooth,” that – if exploited - may introduce risks for certain medical devices. SweynTooth affects the wireless communication technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE allows two devices to “pair” and exchange information to perform their intended functions while preserving battery life and can be found in medical devices as well as other devices, such as consumer wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These cybersecurity vulnerabilities may allow an unauthorized user to wirelessly crash the device, stop it from working, or access device functions normally only available to the authorized user.
To date, the FDA is not aware of any confirmed adverse events related to these vulnerabilities. However, software to exploit these vulnerabilities in certain situations is publicly available. Today, the FDA is providing additional information regarding the source of these vulnerabilities and recommendations for reducing or avoiding risks the vulnerabilities may pose to a variety of medical devices, such as pacemakers, glucose monitors, and ultrasound devices.
<strong>“Medical devices are becoming increasingly connected, and connected devices have inherent risks, which make them vulnerable to security breaches. These breaches potentially impact the safety and effectiveness of the device and, if not remedied, may lead to patient harm,” </strong>said Suzanne Schwartz, M.D., MBA, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships and Technology Innovation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. <strong>“The FDA recommends that medical device manufacturers stay alert for cybersecurity vulnerabilities and proactively address them by participating in coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities as well as providing mitigation strategies. An essential part of the FDA’s strategy is working with manufacturers, health care delivery organizations, security researchers, other government agencies and patients to address cybersecurity concerns that affect medical devices in order to keep patients safe.”</strong>
The FDA is currently aware of several microchip manufacturers that are affected by these vulnerabilities: Texas Instruments, NXP, Cypress, Dialog Semiconductors, Microchip, STMicroelectronics and Telink Semiconductor. Their microchips may be in a variety of medical devices, such as those that are implanted in or worn by a patient (such as pacemakers, stimulators, blood glucose monitors and insulin pumps) or larger devices that are in health care facilities (such as electrocardiograms, monitors and diagnostic devices like ultrasound devices).
Medical device manufacturers are already assessing which devices may be affected by SweynTooth and are identifying risk and remediation actions. In addition, several microchip manufacturers have already released patches. For more information about SweynTooth cybersecurity vulnerabilities – including a list of affected devices, see <a href=""https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ics-alert-20-063-01"">ICS-ALERT-20-063-01 SweynTooth Vulnerabilities, Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Advisory</a>.
The agency is asking medical device manufacturers to communicate to health care providers and patients which medical devices could be affected by SweynTooth and ways to reduce associated risk. Patients should talk to their health care providers to determine if their medical device could be affected and to seek help right away if they think their medical device is not working as expected.
The FDA takes reports of vulnerabilities in medical devices very seriously and today’s safety communication includes recommendations to manufacturers for continued monitoring, reporting and remediation of medical device cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The FDA is recommending that manufacturers conduct a risk assessment, as described in the FDA’s <a title=""Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/95862/download"" data-entity-substitution=""media_download"" data-entity-type=""media"" data-entity-uuid=""24fc2ea0-0d1b-474c-92d3-87e58182c84b"">cybersecurity postmarket guidance</a>, to evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities on medical devices they manufacture and develop risk mitigation plans. Medical device manufacturers should work with the microchip manufacturers to identify available patches and other recommended mitigation methods, work with health care providers to determine any medical devices that could potentially be affected, and discuss ways to reduce associated risks.
The FDA will continue to assess new information concerning the SweynTooth vulnerabilities and will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.
Further, the FDA will continue its ongoing work with manufacturers and health care delivery organizations—as well as security researchers and other government agencies—to help develop and implement solutions to address cybersecurity issues throughout a device's total product lifecycle.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

<strong><i>Heat's gp96 vaccine platform activates CD8 T cells, antigen presenting cells and natural killer cells, and induces mucosal immunity which could make it an ideal vaccine for COVID-19</i></strong>
<strong><i>Vaccine designed to induce a multi-epitope specific CD8 T-cell response, which is crucial for protection against potential future mutations of COVID-19</i></strong>
<strong>DURHAM, NC / ACCESSWIRE / March 5, 2020 / </strong>Heat Biologics, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTBX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specialized in the development of therapeutic vaccines, announced today a strategic collaboration with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine to support the development of a vaccine leveraging Heat's proprietary gp96 platform designed to target the <i>SARS-CoV-2 </i>coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that Heat's gp96-based vaccines may be utilized to target COVID-19. Heat has treated more than 300 patients to date with its gp96-based therapeutic vaccines. Results from these studies together with positive outcomes in NIH and DOD-funded mouse and primate studies against SIV/HIV 1-2, malaria and zika, demonstrate that gp96 vaccines express a broad range of antigens and stimulate a robust systemic immune response, culminating in humoral and cell mediated responses in different organs including the gut, reproductive tract, liver and lungs.
Heat's COVID-19 vaccine will utilize Heat's gp96 platform to generate open docking sites for the insertion of multiple <i>SARS-CoV-2</i> antigens. Heat anticipates that its novel approach should activate a potent immune response, without the disadvantages of possible genomic integration of foreign DNA or viral vector instability possible with attenuated viral vaccines. This approach is designed to induce a multi-epitope specific memory CD8 T-cell response that protects against multiple, distinct coronavirus strains across diverse human populations and against potential future mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus.
Heat's COVID-19 program emerged from the same laboratory that originally developed Heat's gp96 platform technology, and will be developed at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine under the direction of Natasa Strbo, M.D., D.Sc., research assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, who has spent many years advancing the gp96 platform as a vaccine against HIV, malaria, zika and other infectious diseases.
Mucosal immunity and airway memory T-cell responses are crucial in the protection against respiratory viruses such as <i>SARS-CoV-2</i>, since these areas are the first to encounter the virus. Importantly, Heat's gp96-based vaccines have demonstrated effectiveness in the induction of mucosal immunity. Dr. Strbo and her team have developed a gp96 vaccine against SIV (the primate equivalent of HIV) that has been shown to induce a dramatic antigen-specific immune response in the mucous membranes. Treated primates (rheusus macaques) were 73 percent less likely to acquire a particularly virulent form of the SIV virus*. These data support broader use of the vaccine platform against other viruses attacking the mucosal tissues, such as COVID-19 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594107"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594107</a>).
""T-cell immune responses play a crucial role in protection against coronaviruses and facilitation of coronavirus clearance. It is noteworthy to mention that not antibodies, but only SARS-CoV-specific memory T-cells persisted up to 11 years post-recovery,"" said Dr. Strbo. ""Therefore, an effective coronavirus vaccine should induce neutralizing antibodies and elicit specific memory CD8 T cell responses. Currently, gp96 is the most efficient agent known to mediate antigen cross-presentation at femto-molar concentrations of antigen. Heat's gp96 vaccine platform has unique properties that enable it to activate antigen presenting cells, natural killer cells and T cells, which could make it an ideal vaccine for <i>SARS-CoV-2</i>.""
Heat's wholly-owned subsidiary, Zolovax, Inc., will focus on the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. Under the terms of the research collaboration, University of Miami will develop and test one or more vaccine constructs utilizing Heat's gp-96 vaccine backbone to express antigens associated with COVID-19.
""We are excited about our collaboration with the University of Miami to develop a gp96-based vaccine designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" said Jeff Wolf, CEO of Heat. ""gp96 is a powerful vaccine platform that has been shown to induce a potent immune response, which may protect against COVID-19 and other highly-virulent infectious diseases. We look forward to advancing this important program""
* Novel vaccination modality provides significant protection against mucosal infection by highly pathogenic SIV, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=23401588"">J Immunol. 2013 Mar 15; 190(6): 2495-2499.</a>
<i>Additional published studies (Strbo et al 2013 Cutting Edge J Immunol Selinger et al 2014, Vaccari et al Nature Medicine 2016 and 2018) support the feasibility of the gp96-Ig cell secreted-based vaccine platform.</i>
<b>About Heat's gp96-based therapeutic platform</b>
Heat shock protein gp96 is a chaperone protein found in all human cells. It is a potent immune adjuvant that has the role of ""molecular warning system"" or more specifically, gp96 has demonstrated a clinical ability to induce immunity against antigens from the cell it came from. gp96 is naturally tethered to the cell and is normally released only during necrosis or cell death.
Heat's proprietary gp96 vaccine platform reprograms live cells to continually secrete antigens of interest bound to the gp96, thus activating a robust T-cell response against those antigens. Heat's gp96 platform was developed by Dr. Eckhard Podack at the University of Miami and has undergone rigorous testing in numerous NIH and DOD-funded mice and primate trials as a vaccine against HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases, and has been tested on over 300 patients in numerous NIH and Heat-funded oncology trials.
<b>About Heat Biologics, Inc.</b>
Heat Biologics is a biopharmaceutical company developing immunotherapies designed to activate a patient's immune system against cancer and other diseases using its proprietary gp96 platform to activate CD8+ ""Killer"" T-cells. Heat has completed enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical trial for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with its gp96-based HS-110 therapeutic vaccine. HS-110 is the company's first biologic product candidate in a series of proprietary immunotherapies designed to stimulate a patient's own T-cells. Heat also has numerous pre-clinical programs at various stages of development. For more information, please visit <a href=""http://pr.report/TU7OZc8V"">www.heatbio.com</a>.

<span class=""xn-location"">FORT MYERS, Fla.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 28, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Baysient<sup>®</sup> LLC's founder, <span class=""xn-person"">Diane Mould</span>, announces the release of the iDose<sup>®</sup> software technology platform version 1.0 for infliximab (an anti-inflammatory biologic drug), just before presenting <u>Biologics and Precision Medicine in IBD</u> at Canadian Digestive Disease Week (CDDW), <span class=""xn-chron"">February 28</span> – <span class=""xn-chron"">March 1</span>. The presentation will include results from a 12-month clinical validation study (NCT02453776) demonstrating (p = 0.017) the potential to reduce ""switching"" from lower cost infliximab to more expensive biologics by 66%. Similar studies are ongoing in 9 countries on 3 continents (&gt; 300 patients).
The results to be presented in <span class=""xn-location"">Montreal</span> were originally presented by the investigators at European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO, <span class=""xn-location"">Copenhagen</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2019</span>) and Digestive Disease Week (DDW, <span class=""xn-location"">San Diego</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2019</span>). Approximately 30% of all patients treated with anti-inflammatory biologics need to switch drugs within the first year. Typical switching from infliximab (biosimilar) to another biologic (not infliximab, not biosimilar) increases drug cost by <span class=""xn-money"">$11,000</span> per patient per year (U.S. average retail costs, <span class=""xn-chron"">January 9, 2020</span>). Healthcare professionals using the iDose software's clinical decision support (CDS) information have the potential to reduce drug costs in this typical scenario by <span class=""xn-money"">$726,000</span> per 100 patients failing therapy. Clinical Decision Support (CDS) information from the iDose software keeps 66 of these patients on average from failing and having to switch. The relatively low cost of the iDose software was not subtracted from the savings in this scenario. The Baysient pipeline includes CDS for 25 other FDA approved anti-inflammatory biologics.
The iDose algorithm combines scientifically appropriate pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling with statistically sound Bayesian learning (non-AI machine learning) and forecasting. Information from the iDose software helps physicians understand how to keep the amount of drug in a patient's body from falling below the physician-selected target therapeutic level.
Reimbursement codes (ICD and CPT) for therapeutic drug monitoring, other long term (current) drug therapy, or chronic care management may be applicable.
Patented iDose functionality is offered as a business-to-business, cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) and is HIPAA-compliant and compatible with electronic medical records (EMRs). It is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada.
When used by, or under the supervision of healthcare professionals, the iDose software is exempted from FDA clearance requirements. Drug companies must meet FDA requirements prior to associating the iDose software with their products. Healthcare payor firms may use information obtained from the iDose software as healthcare economic information (HCEI) after internal review.
Baysient LLC is a privately held <span class=""xn-location"">Delaware</span> company. Baysient develops SaaS, cloud-based software that provides medical providers and/or payors with a full line of CDS products to facilitate individualized and improved treatment outcomes for inflammatory diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Crohn's Disease (CD), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), etc. Baysient's software uses individual patient routine lab results and demographic information to allow physicians to individualize dosing to a specific target trough level.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">
BOSTON &amp; GHENT, Belgium--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Orionis Biosciences is today debuting with the announcement of a major drug discovery collaboration with Novartis. Orionis has developed innovative technologies in genome-scale drug discovery and tunable molecular design of novel therapeutic drug modalities to tackle the industry’s most intractable disease targets.
The goal of the four-year collaboration with Novartis is to discover and design novel small molecule therapeutics, such as protein degraders, across various therapeutic areas, by broadly leveraging Orionis’ Allo-Glue™ technology platform. The terms of the collaboration include research funding, a convertible note investment, royalties and potential clinical milestones.
“Our collaboration with Novartis provides tremendous validation of the work we have accomplished over the past several years to develop innovative tools to unlock challenging drug targets for new therapeutic modalities,” commented Niko Kley, CEO of Orionis. “There are many disease-related targets that have eluded scientists and drug discoverers for decades, with new ones being identified every day. Our proprietary genome-wide discovery and drug design technologies may enable identification and development of small molecules and biologics with high specificity and selectivity against targets at a scale, speed and efficiency that is unique in the industry.”
Orionis was originally founded by drug discovery and technology pioneers Niko Kley, PhD, CEO, Jan Tavernier, PhD, CTO and Professor at VIB-Ghent University (Belgium), and VIB. Riccardo Sabatini, PhD, CDS, joined the company as architect and leader of Orionis’ computational science platform.
Dr. Jay Bradner, MD, PhD, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research commented, “We are excited to be working with the Orionis team to combine our expertise in drug discovery and development with their innovative technologies for rapidly identifying and prioritizing new targets at a genome-wide scale. Our hope is that through this collaboration, we will be able to reach historically elusive targets as we strive to bring new therapies to patients more quickly.”
Riccardo Sabatini commented further, “It is incredibly exciting to see how mapping of genome-scale fingerprints of drug action is opening new possibilities and dimensions in applications of numerical methods and machine learning to support drug design.”
“The opportunity behind the forming of Orionis was that the existing pharmacopeia of approved drugs reflects relatively few disease targets being addressed with too many similar drugs. We have been steadily executing on our mission to bring together an array of technological innovations to enable discovery of a diversity of new drug candidates that act with high therapeutic target-focused precision,” commented Prof. Jan Tavernier.
Orionis Biosciences, named for the Orion star system, is a unique constellation of people, technology platforms and drug modalities. “We have quietly built and evolved our core science capabilities, portfolio of intellectual property and an exciting emerging pipeline of drug candidates, which we are advancing to unlock major value for the pharmaceutical industry and new treatment options for patients in need,” commented CEO Niko Kley.
<b>About Allo-Glue™ Technology
</b>Allo-Glue™ molecules are a unique class of allosterically acting small molecules that enable access to targets previously thought unapproachable. They act to alter the form and function of, and thereby reprogram, intracellular proteins to engage in molecular interactions that modulate disease target proteins, including promoting their degradation by a cell’s natural protein disposal machinery.
<b>About Orionis Biosciences
</b>Orionis Biosciences is a life sciences company pioneering technological innovation in genome-scale drug discovery and tunable molecular design of novel therapeutic drug modalities. Our technologies and pipeline include proprietary A-Kine™ biologics and Allo-Glue™ small molecule platforms with broad, innovative applications to the reprogramming of disease states.

Ahmedabad, India, March 05, 2020
• Saroglitazar, approved by DCGI becomes the first ever drug anywhere in the world for
treatment of Non-Cirrhotic Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH)
• NASH ranks as one of the major causes of cirrhosis, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver
disease and is a leading cause of liver transplant
Zydus Cadila, an innovation-driven global pharmaceutical company today announced that the
Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved its New Drug Application (NDA) for
Saroglitazar for the treatment of Non-Cirrhotic Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH) in
India.
NASH is a progressive disease of the liver, which starts with fat accumulation in the liver
known as Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). This condition could progress to
cirrhosis and liver failure. It is a large unmet medical need as there is currently no approved
drug for the treatment of NASH anywhere in the world, a disease that is highly prevalent with
10% to 30% of the global population being affected by it. The prevalence of NASH in India
is estimated to be nearly 25% of the population. NASH ranks as one of the major causes of
cirrhosis, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only
option for managing advanced cirrhosis with liver failure.
Speaking about the development, Pankaj Patel, Chairman, Zydus Group mentioned, “We are
happy that our efforts to discover and develop a novel drug for patients living with NASH, an
unmet healthcare need globally have been successful. Saroglitazar will provide hope and new
lease of life for millions of patients in India suffering from NASH.”
Saroglitazar was launched in India in September 2013, for the treatment of diabetic
dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with type-2 diabetes not controlled by
statins alone. In January this year, Saroglitazar received an approval for the treatment of Type
2 Diabetes Mellitus. In the last seven years, over a million patients have benefitted from this
drug.
Saroglitazar is uniquely poised with its dual PPAR alpha and gamma properties – reducing
the comorbidities (dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus) and causing NASH
resolution. Zydus achieved positive results in EVIDENCES II trial, a Phase 3 liver biopsy
trial of Saroglitazar 4 mg versus Placebo in Indian patients with NASH. The trial evaluated
histological improvement of NASH using liver biopsy at the end of 52 weeks and
successfully met primary and secondary endpoints. Saroglitazar 4 mg demonstrated a
significant reduction in liver fat, liver enzymes and disease activity.
In EVIDENCES I, which was a Phase 2 clinical trial, Saroglitazar demonstrated improvement
in liver enzymes and lipids in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). On
the global front, a Phase 2 trial (EVIDENCES IV) of Saroglitazar Mg in patients with NASH
in the US met primary and secondary endpoints. The results were presented at The Liver
Meeting® 2019, the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases (AASLD) held at Boston.
Additionally, 15 investigator initiated clinical studies of Saroglitazar have been presented and
published in leading scientific journals and conferences.

""Today's FDA approval marks a breakthrough milestone for the glaucoma community and provides a much-needed option for patients challenged with topical drops or needing alternative options,"" said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer, Allergan. ""At Allergan, our mission is to contribute meaningful strategies that help preserve people's vision, while ensuring that therapies are mindful of the realities of administration and compliance. As a commitment to the ongoing development of this innovation, Allergan has five ongoing Phase 3 studies with DURYSTA<em>™</em> to support further potential FDA label enhancement and rest of the world approvals.""
The FDA approval is based on results from the two 20-month (including 8-month extended follow up) Phase 3 ARTEMIS studies evaluating 1,122 subjects on the efficacy and safety of DURYSTA<em>™</em> versus twice daily topical timolol drops, an FDA accepted comparator for registrational clinical trials, in patients with OAG or OHT. In the two Phase 3 ARTEMIS studies, DURYSTA<em>™</em> reduced IOP by approximately 30 percent from baseline over the 12-week primary efficacy period, meeting the predefined criteria for non-inferiority to the study comparator.
""Millions of people are living with glaucoma, one of the leading causes of vision loss; however, new treatment options are needed to help doctors and patients better manage this disease,"" said Felipe Medeiros , M.D., Ph.D., Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Vice-Chair for Technology, Director Clinical Research Unit, Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University. ""The ARTEMIS trials demonstrated that DURYSTA<em>™</em> lowered IOP in patients by approximately 30 percent and demonstrated a duration of effect through the 12-week primary efficacy period. As the first FDA-approved intracameral, biodegradable sustained-release implant providing continuous drug delivery, DURYSTA™ has the potential to significantly shift the paradigm for treating glaucoma.""
With the launch of DURYSTA™, Allergan proudly expands availability of Allergan EyeCue<sup>®</sup>, a proven reimbursement service for eye care professionals to facilitate patient benefit verification, savings program enrollment for eligible patients, and prior authorization (PA) assistance for Allergan Eye Care products.
<strong>About DURYSTA™
</strong>DURYSTA™ is a prostaglandin analog indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with OAG or OHT.
DURYSTA<em>™</em> is an ophthalmic drug delivery system for a single intracameral administration of a biodegradable implant containing 10 mcg bimatoprost. DURYSTA<em>™ </em>should not be re-administered to an eye that received a prior DURYSTA<em>™.</em> DURYSTA<em>™</em> is preloaded into a single-use applicator to facilitate the administration of the biodegradable implant directly into the anterior chamber of the eye.
<strong>INDICATIONS AND USAGE
</strong>DURYSTA™ (bimatoprost implant) is indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).
<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
</strong><strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS
</strong>DURYSTA™ is contraindicated in patients with: active or suspected ocular or periocular infections; corneal endothelial cell dystrophy (e.g., Fuchs' Dystrophy); prior corneal transplantation or endothelial cell transplants (e.g., Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty [DSAEK]); absent or ruptured posterior lens capsule, due to the risk of implant migration into the posterior segment; hypersensitivity to bimatoprost or to any other components of the product.
<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
</strong>The presence of DURYSTA™ implants has been associated with corneal adverse reactions and increased risk of corneal endothelial cell loss. Administration of DURYSTA™ should be limited to a single implant per eye without retreatment. Caution should be used when prescribing DURYSTA™ in patients with limited corneal endothelial cell reserve.
DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in patients with narrow iridocorneal angles (Shaffer grade ? 3) or anatomical obstruction (e.g., scarring) that may prohibit settling in the inferior angle.
Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with ophthalmic bimatoprost, including DURYSTA™ intracameral implant. DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.
Prostaglandin analogs, including DURYSTA™, have been reported to cause intraocular inflammation. DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.
Ophthalmic bimatoprost, including DURYSTA™ intracameral implant, has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues, such as increased pigmentation of the iris. Pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. While treatment with DURYSTA™ can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly.
Intraocular surgical procedures and injections have been associated with endophthalmitis. Proper aseptic technique must always be used with administering DURYSTA™, and patients should be monitored following the administration.
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</strong>In controlled studies, the most common ocular adverse reaction reported by 27% of patients was conjunctival hyperemia. Other common adverse reactions reported in 5%-10% of patients were foreign body sensation, eye pain, photophobia, conjunctival hemorrhage, dry eye, eye irritation, intraocular pressure increased, corneal endothelial cell loss, vision blurred, iritis, and headache.

<strong>About Glaucoma
</strong>Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. An estimated 70 million people globally are living with glaucoma. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated IOP. Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only proven way to slow the progression of vision loss associated with glaucoma.
Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are a standard first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, the most common form, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Poor adherence to glaucoma medication could result in disease progression and vision loss.

The Phase III DANUBE trial for <i>Imfinzi </i>(durvalumab) and <i>Imfinzi </i>plus tremelimumab in unresectable, Stage IV (metastatic) bladder cancer did not meet the primary endpoints of improving overall survival (OS) versus standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapy for <i>Imfinzi </i>monotherapy in patients whose tumour cells and/or tumour-infiltrating immune cells express high levels (=25%) of PD-L1, or for <i>Imfinzi</i> plus tremelimumab in patients regardless of their PD-L1 expression.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “AstraZeneca remains committed to addressing unmet needs in bladder cancer and the potential for immunotherapy to improve outcomes for these patients. The results from this trial will inform our comprehensive Phase III development programme in bladder cancer. We look forward to the results of the Phase III NILE trial also in the 1st-line metastatic setting, and we continue to advance clinical trials for patients at earlier stages of the disease.”
The safety and tolerability profiles for <i>Imfinzi</i> and the combination with tremelimumab were consistent with previous trials. The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
<i>Imfinzi</i> is being<b> </b>developed in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer in the Phase III NILE trial either in combination with chemotherapy or with chemotherapy and tremelimumab. <i>Imfinzi</i> is also being tested in earlier stages of bladder cancer in the Phase III NIAGARA trial in combination with chemotherapy, and in the Phase III POTOMAC trial in combination with SoC Bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy.
<i>Imfinzi</i> is approved for patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy in 15 countries, including the US.
<b>Bladder cancer</b>
In 2018, approximately 550,000 people were diagnosed with bladder cancer around the world and 200,000 died from the disease.<sup>1</sup> Locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer remains an area of unmet medical need and typically only one in seven patients are alive five years after diagnosis.<sup>2</sup> Urothelial cancer (UC) is the most common form of bladder cancer.<sup>3</sup> UC is the 10th most common cancer worldwide and the 13th most common cause of cancer death.<sup>1,4</sup> PD-L1 is widely expressed in tumour and immune cells in patients with bladder cancer and helps tumours evade detection from the immune system.<sup>5</sup>
<b>DANUBE</b>
DANUBE is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of both cisplatin eligible and ineligible patients with unresectable, Stage IV (metastatic) UC. The trial compared <i>Imfinzi </i>monotherapy or <i>Imfinzi</i> plus tremelimumab versus cisplatin and gemcitabine or carboplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. The trial was conducted in more than 220 centres across 24 countries, including centres in the US, Canada, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.
Eligible patients included those with transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium, including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. High PD-L1 was defined as =25% of tumour cells (TC) or tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) expressing membrane PD-L1 if ICs involved &gt;1% of the tumour area, or TC=25% or IC=100% if ICs involved =1% of the tumour area.
The primary endpoints of the trial were OS in high PD-L1 patients treated with <i>Imfinzi</i> monotherapy, and OS in patients treated with <i>Imfinzi</i> plus tremelimumab regardless of their PD-L1 status. The DANUBE trial addresses a post-approval commitment in agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration from the May 2017 accelerated US approval of <i>Imfinzi</i>in previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer.
<b><i>Imfinzi</i></b>
<i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.
<i>Imfinzi </i>is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after chemoradiation therapy in 61 countries, including the US, Japan, China and across the EU, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. <i>Imfinzi</i> recently received its first global approval for the 1st-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in combination with SoC chemotherapy in Singapore.
As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combinations including with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.
<b>Tremelimumab<u></u></b>
Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death. Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with <i>Imfinzi</i> in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and liver cancer.
<b>AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)</b>
Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca believes that IO-based therapies offer the potential for life-changing cancer treatments for the clear majority of patients.
The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.
<b>AstraZeneca in Oncology</b>
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients' lives and the Company's future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca's main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.
<b>AstraZeneca</b>

NEW YORK &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; ROTTERDAM, Netherlands &amp; SUZHOU, China--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Mount Sinai Health System and Harbour BioMed (HBM) have entered into a multi-year, multifaceted collaboration to develop novel, fully human antibodies for the treatment and prevention of various diseases including oncology and immunology.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">Mount Sinai and Harbour BioMed enter collaboration to advance novel biotherapies for the treatment of cancer and coronavirus COVID-19</p>
<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200306005051/en/#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
The collaboration will also utilize the H2L2 Harbour Mice<sup>® </sup>platform to generate monoclonal antibodies against the coronavirus SARS CoV 2 – COVID-19 (commonly known as COVID-19). These fully human monoclonal antibodies could be used therapeutically for people who have been exposed to the virus, or prophylactically for individuals with a high risk of exposure, such as healthcare workers. The antibodies have the potential to prevent spread of the virus by blocking infection of cells.
“We are pleased to be able to collaborate with HBM at this time and leverage our experience in therapeutic antibody generation as well as the viral expertise of the Microbiology Department with the unique human antibody producing mice from Harbour,” said Professor Thomas Moran, PhD, Director, Center for Therapeutic Antibody Development (CTAD) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“This is a unique collaboration that will give HBM access to Mount Sinai’s innovative research driven from its clinical practices. The agreement demonstrates HBM’s commitment to develop novel medicines and foster fast-track innovative research. We will push the boundaries of science and the development of new medicines that will ultimately translate into better treatments for patients,” said Jingsong Wang, MD, PhD, Founder, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer of HBM.
“The relationship with HBM is yet another opportunity for Mount Sinai to develop new treatments for significant diseases and conditions,” said Erik Lium, PhD, President, Mount Sinai Innovation Partners. “This work will bring Mount Sinai’s innovation ecosystem one step closer to the drug development process.”

Tetra Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel treatments for patients with cognitive impairment and memory loss, today announced it has entered into an expanded strategic alliance with Shionogi. The two companies will work together to develop and commercialize BPN14770 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, Fragile X syndrome and other indications marked by cognitive and memory deficits.
Under the terms of the expanded alliance, Shionogi has increased its equity investment in the company to 50% and has the option to complete a structured buyout of the remaining equity if certain closing conditions are met based on the topline results of the company’s clinical Phase 2 PICASSO AD trial in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease expected to read out later this month.
Tetra is developing BPN14770 for the treatment of brain disorders marked by cognitive and memory impairment including Alzheimer’s disease and Fragile X syndrome. In addition, Tetra has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 study of BPN14770 in adults with Fragile X syndrome, an indication for which BPN14770 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
“This expanded alliance with Shionogi further validates our platform and the potential for BPN14770 to provide a new treatment option for patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease,” said Mark Gurney, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tetra Therapeutics. “We are delighted to be expanding our collaboration with Shionogi and thank them for their continued conviction in our mission. We look forward to announcing topline results from our Phase 2 PICASSO AD trial in Alzheimer’s disease later this month.”
“We are pleased to strengthen our strategic alliance with Tetra. With the aging of our society, cognitive disorders are becoming a serious social issue. We believe BPN14770 has the potential to become an innovative new treatment to help solve for this issue. This new collaboration with Tetra reinforces our steadfast commitment to advancing cutting-edge science in central nervous system (CNS) disorders including Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Isao Teshirogi, President and Chief Executive Officer, Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd.
Cooley LLP, Honigman LLP and Nomura Securities International, Inc., provided advisory services for the transaction.
<strong>About BPN14770</strong>
BPN14770 is a novel therapeutic agent that selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D) to enhance memory formation in children and older adults. This unique mechanism of action has the potential to improve cognitive and memory function in devastating CNS disorders, including Fragile X syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, learning/developmental disabilities and schizophrenia. Preclinical animal models show that BPN14770 has the potential to promote the maturation of connections between neurons, which is impaired in patients with Fragile X Syndrome, and to protect connections between neurons which otherwise are lost in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
Tetra has completed Phase 1 double blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging studies of the safety and pharmacokinetics of BPN14770 in healthy volunteers. Evidence of cognitive benefit was found in elderly subjects. Tetra is conducting the PICASSO AD trial, a Phase 2 study of BPN14770 in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and an investigational Phase 2 study of BPN14770 in adults with Fragile X syndrome, an indication for which BPN14770 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA.)

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Isturisa (osilodrostat) oral tablets for adults with Cushing’s disease who either cannot undergo pituitary gland surgery or have undergone the surgery but still have the disease. Cushing’s disease is a rare disease in which the adrenal glands make too much of the cortisol hormone. Isturisa is the first FDA-approved drug to directly address this cortisol overproduction by blocking the enzyme known as 11-beta-hydroxylase and preventing cortisol synthesis.
<strong>“The FDA supports the development of safe and effective treatments for rare diseases, and this new therapy can help people with Cushing’s disease, a rare condition where excessive cortisol production puts them at risk for other medical issues,” said Mary Thanh Hai, M.D., acting director of the Office of Drug Evaluation II in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “By helping patients achieve normal cortisol levels, this medication is an important treatment option for adults with Cushing’s disease.”</strong>
Cushing’s disease is caused by a pituitary tumor that releases too much of a hormone called adrenocorticotropin, which stimulates the adrenal gland to produce an excessive amount of cortisol. The disease is most common among adults between the ages of 30 to 50, and it affects women three times more often than men. Cushing’s disease can cause significant health issues, such as high blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes, blood clots in the legs and lungs, bone loss and fractures, a weakened immune system and depression. Patients may have thin arms and legs, a round red full face, increased fat around the neck, easy bruising, striae (purple stretch marks) and weak muscles.
Isturisa’s safety and effectiveness for treating Cushing’s disease among adults was evaluated in a study of 137 adult patients (about three-quarters women) with a mean age of 41 years. The majority of patients either had undergone pituitary surgery that did not cure Cushing’s disease or were not surgical candidates. In the 24-week, single-arm, open-label period, all patients received a starting dose of 2 milligrams (mg) of Isturisa twice a day that could be increased every two weeks up to 30 mg twice a day. At the end of this 24-week period, about half of patients had cortisol levels within normal limits. After this point, 71 patients who did not need further dose increases and tolerated the drug for the last 12 weeks entered an eight-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal study where they either received Isturisa or a placebo (inactive treatment). At the end of this withdrawal period, 86% of patients receiving Isturisa maintained cortisol levels within normal limits compared to 30% of patients taking the placebo.
The most common side effects reported in the clinical trial for Isturisa were adrenal insufficiency, headache, vomiting, nausea, fatigue and edema (swelling caused by fluid retention). Hypocortisolism (low cortisol levels), QTc prolongation (a heart rhythm condition) and elevations in adrenal hormone precursors (inactive substance converted into a hormone) and androgens (hormone that regulates male characteristics) may also occur in people taking Isturisa.
Isturisa is taken by mouth twice a day, in the morning and evening as directed by a health care provider. After treatment has started, a provider may re-evaluate dosage, depending upon the patient’s response.
Isturisa received <a title=""Designating an Orphan Product: Drugs and Biological Products"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/industry/developing-products-rare-diseases-conditions/designating-orphan-product-drugs-and-biological-products"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""4dc4e3dd-7f1e-42b4-a888-865c628ad491"">Orphan Drug Designation</a>, which is a special status granted to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition.
The FDA granted the approval of Isturisa to Novartis.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Novartis-28.jpg,Regulatory,Novartis,Isturisa|osilodrostat,Cushing's Disease|Regulatory|approval|FDA|receives|US,publish,9-3-2020,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 6, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the European Commission has approved a change to the marketing authorization for MAVIRET<sup>®</sup> (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic hepatitis C (HCV) patients with genotype (GT) 3 infection. MAVIRET was already indicated as an 8-week, pan-genotypic (GT1-6), once-daily regimen for treatment-naïve HCV patients without cirrhosis, and as an 8-week, once-daily regimen for treatment-naïve GT 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis.<sup><sup class=""first-child last-child"">1</sup></sup><sup class=""last-child"">*</sup>
""A shorter treatment duration means that more patients with HCV can be treated with an 8-week course of MAVIRET in the absence of initial tests to determine their genotype or degree of fibrosis or cirrhosis,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Janet Hammond M.D</span>., Ph.D., vice president, general medicine and virology therapeutic area, AbbVie. ""The ability to streamline pre-treatment assessment for people with HCV represents a paradigm shift in the way the disease is treated, potentially accelerating the care cascade and allowing us to make greater strides towards achieving the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating HCV by 2030.""
The EC approval is supported by data from the Phase <span class=""xn-money first-child"">3b</span> EXPEDITION-8 study. The Phase <span class=""xn-money"">3b</span> EXPEDITION-8 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of MAVIRET in treatment-naïve chronic HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis across all major genotypes (GT1-6). The results have been reported for GT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (n=343) patients<sup>2</sup> and showed that with 8 weeks of MAVIRET, 97.7 percent (n=335/343) of GT1- 6 patients achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR<sub>12</sub>) (ITT). For patients with GT3, the SVR<sub class=""last-child"">12</sub> rate was 95.2% (n= 60/63) (ITT).**
To date, one virologic failure has been reported and no patients have discontinued treatment due to adverse events. In the study, most patients that did not achieve SVR<sub class=""first-child"">12</sub>** were lost to follow up versus experiencing treatment failure, and no new safety signals were identified.<sup class=""last-child"">2</sup>
""Despite hepatitis C now being curable, there are millions of people in <span class=""xn-location first-child"">Europe</span> who are chronically infected with the virus. Many of these patients have never received treatment, often because they have been unable to navigate the practical and clinical complexities of the treatment journey,"" said Stefan Zeuzem, M.D., chief of the department of medicine at the J.W. Goethe University Hospital in Frankfurt, <span class=""xn-location last-child"">Germany</span>. ""A shorter-duration therapeutic option and simplified pre-treatment approach can eliminate the need for extra tests and help significantly more people overcome their very real treatment barriers.""
In the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region, 14 million people are estimated to be chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus and many of them are unaware that they are infected.<sup class=""first-child"">3</sup> Each year 112,500 people die from hepatitis C-related liver disease.<sup class=""last-child"">3</sup>
<b class=""first-child"">About the EXPEDITION-8 Study</b><b class=""last-child""><sup class=""first-child last-child"">2<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></sup></b>EXPEDITION-8 is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 3b study in treatment-naïve, GT1-6 chronic HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis (n=343) who received MAVIRET for 8 weeks.
The primary efficacy endpoints were SVR<sub class=""first-child"">12</sub>** in patients with GT1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in a per-protocol (PP) and intent-to-treat (ITT) population versus historical SVR<sub>12</sub>** rates based on the efficacy of MAVIRET for 12 weeks in treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis. The key secondary efficacy endpoints were the percentages of GT1-6 patients achieving SVR<sub class=""last-child"">12</sub>** in a PP and ITT population.

<p align=""justify"">AHMEDABAD, India and EMERYVILLE, Calif., March 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zydus Cadila, an innovation-driven global pharmaceutical company, and XOMA Corporation (Nasdaq: XOMA) today announced they have entered into a licensing agreement to advance an IL-2-based immuno-oncology (IO) drug candidate that combines Zydus’ IL-2 with XOMA’s novel anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody.</p>
<p align=""justify"">As part of the agreement, Zydus will advance the new IO candidate through formal clinical trials. Zydus has been granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the therapy in India, Brazil, Mexico and other emerging markets, and XOMA has the potential to receive single-to double-digit royalties on commercial sales in those territories.  XOMA retains rights in all other territories (i.e., XOMA territory). Through this collaboration, Zydus will develop the new IO drug candidate through human proof-of-concept and each company has the potential to receive pre-defined shares of future proceeds that may arise from licensing and commercialization activities.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Speaking about the development, Managing Director of the Zydus group, Dr. Sharvil Patel said, “IL-2 will be the backbone of IO-based therapies for cancer treatment in the future. In this win-win agreement, we see a great strategic fit between our IL-2 and XOMA’s anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody as together they have the potential to provide a safe and efficacious medicine to address the unmet needs of patients living with cancer.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Jim Neal, Chief Executive Officer at XOMA commented, “IL-2 has long been recognized as an effective anti-tumor agent, but its utility has been limited by its toxicity. XOMA has developed unique, fully human antibodies that promote IL-2 action specifically to the cytotoxic effector immune cell populations relevant for anti-tumor activity while simultaneously limiting the unwanted stimulation of immunosuppressive T cells, thereby minimizing its undesired side effects. This IL-2 and monoclonal antibody combination has the potential to turn the immune system against the cancer cells, and Zydus is an ideal partner to advance this combination through clinical development.”</p>

PRINCETON, N.J.--(<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com&amp;esheet=52185567&amp;newsitemid=20200309005181&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bristol+Myers+Squibb+Company&amp;index=1&amp;md5=22ff9ca3e87b24dc56d88f5dcfd6e56e"" rel=""nofollow"">Bristol Myers Squibb Company</a> (NYSE: BMY) today announced topline results from ELOQUENT-1, a Phase 3, randomized, open-label trial evaluating the combination of <i>Empliciti</i> (elotuzumab) plus <i>Revlimid</i>(lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (ERd), versus <i>Revlimid </i>and dexamethasone alone (Rd), in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible. Both treatments were administered continuously until disease progression. At final analysis, the addition of <i>Empliciti </i>did not show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), the study’s primary endpoint. The safety profile of ERd was generally consistent with the known profile of <i>Empliciti</i> plus <i>Revlimid</i> and dexamethasone. The company will complete a full evaluation of the ELOQUENT-1 data and work with investigators to present the results at a future medical meeting.
“While we are disappointed that the ELOQUENT-1 trial did not meet its primary endpoint in these previously untreated, transplant ineligible patients, the <i>Empliciti</i>, <i>Revlimid </i>and dexamethasone combination remains a standard treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, providing the potential for improved survival in this population of patients who are in need of additional treatment options,” said Noah Berkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, Global Clinical Development, Hematology, Bristol Myers Squibb.
“Multiple myeloma is an aggressive disease characterized by relapse and the likelihood to be refractory to several therapies,” said Meletios A. Dimopoulos, M.D., professor and chairman of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics at Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine. “While the elotuzumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination was unable to show a benefit in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma at this time, it remains an important treatment option in the relapsed/refractory setting.”
Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie are co-developing <i>Empliciti</i>, with Bristol Myers Squibb solely responsible for commercial activities.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About ELOQUENT-1</span></b>
ELOQUENT-1 is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label trial evaluating <i>Revlimid</i> and dexamethasone with or without <i>Empliciti</i> in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple myeloma. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the addition of <i>Empliciti</i> to <i>Revlimid</i> and low-dose dexamethasone would improve PFS, the study’s primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate and overall survival.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">Bristol Myers Squibb: Advancing Cancer Research</span></b>
At Bristol Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The goal of our cancer research is to increase quality, long-term survival and make cure a possibility. We harness our deep scientific experience, cutting-edge technologies and discovery platforms to discover, develop and deliver novel treatments for patients.
Building upon our transformative work and legacy in hematology and Immuno-Oncology that has changed survival expectations for many cancers, our researchers are advancing a deep and diverse pipeline across multiple modalities. In the field of immune cell therapy, this includes registrational CAR T-cell agents for numerous diseases, and a growing early-stage pipeline that expands cell and gene therapy targets, and technologies. We are developing cancer treatments directed at key biological pathways using our protein homeostasis platform, a research capability that has been the basis of our approved therapies for multiple myeloma and several promising compounds in early- to mid-stage development. Our scientists are targeting different immune system pathways to address interactions between tumors, the microenvironment and the immune system to further expand upon the progress we have made and help more patients respond to treatment. Combining these approaches is key to delivering new options for the treatment of cancer and addressing the growing issue of resistance to immunotherapy. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines a reality for patients.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Empliciti</i></span></b>
<i>Empliciti</i> is an immunostimulatory antibody that specifically targets Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule Family member 7 (SLAMF7), a cell-surface glycoprotein. SLAMF7 is expressed on myeloma cells independent of cytogenetic abnormalities. SLAMF7 also is expressed on Natural Killer cells, plasma cells and at lower levels on specific immune cell subsets of differentiated cells within the hematopoietic lineage.
<i>Empliciti</i> has a dual mechanism-of-action. It directly activates the immune system through Natural Killer cells via the SLAMF7 pathway. <i>Empliciti</i> also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells, tagging these malignant cells for Natural Killer cell-mediated destruction via antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
<i>Empliciti</i> was initially approved by the FDA in 2015 in combination with <i>Revlimid</i> and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies. In 2018, Empliciti was approved by the FDA in a new combination, with <i>Pomalyst/Imnovid</i> (pomalidomide) and dexamethasone (EPd), for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. The ELd and EPd indications were subsequently approved by the European Commission in 2016 and 2019, respectively.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">U.S. FDA-APPROVED INDICATIONS FOR EMPLICITI<sup>®</sup></span></b>
EMPLICITI<sup>®</sup> (elotuzumab) is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies.
EMPLICITI<sup>®</sup> (elotuzumab) is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>Infusion Reactions</b>
Infusion reactions were reported in 10% of patients treated with EMPLICITI in the ELOQUENT-2 trial [EMPLICITI + lenalidomide + dexamethasone (ERd) vs lenalidomide + dexamethasone (Rd)] and 3.3% in the ELOQUENT-3 trial [EMPLICITI + pomalidomide + dexamethasone (EPd) vs pomalidomide + dexamethasone (Pd)].
In the ELOQUENT-2 trial, all infusion reactions were Grade 3 or lower, with Grade 3 infusion reactions occurring in 1% of patients. The most common symptoms included fever, chills, and hypertension. Bradycardia and hypotension also developed during infusions. In the trial, 5% of patients required interruption of the administration of EMPLICITI for a median of 25 minutes due to infusion reactions, and 1% of patients discontinued due to infusion reactions. Of the patients who experienced an infusion reaction, 70% (23/33) had them during the first dose.
In the ELOQUENT-3 trial, the only infusion reaction symptom was chest discomfort (2%), which was Grade 1. All the patients who experienced an infusion reaction had them during the first treatment cycle.
If a Grade 2 or higher infusion reaction occurs, interrupt the EMPLICITI infusion and institute appropriate medical and supportive measures. If the infusion reaction recurs, stop the EMPLICITI infusion and do not restart it on that day. Severe infusion reactions may require permanent discontinuation of EMPLICITI therapy and emergency treatment.
Premedicate with dexamethasone, H1 blocker, H2 blocker, and acetaminophen prior to EMPLICITI infusion.
<b>Infections</b>
In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), infections were reported in 81% of patients in the ERd arm and 74% in the Rd arm. Grade 3-4 infections were 28% (ERd) and 24% (Rd). Discontinuations due to infections were 3.5% (ERd) and 4.1% (Rd). Fatal infections were 2.5% (ERd) and 2.2% (Rd). Opportunistic infections were reported in 22% (ERd) and 13% (Rd). Fungal infections were 10% (ERd) and 5% (Rd). Herpes zoster was 14% (ERd) and 7% (Rd).
In the ELOQUENT-3 trial (N=115), infections were reported in 65% of patients in both the EPd arm and the Pd arm. Grade 3-4 infections were reported in 13% (EPd) and 22% (Pd). Discontinuations due to infections were 7% (EPd) and 5% (Pd). Fatal infections were 5% (EPd) and 3.6% (Pd). Opportunistic infections were reported in 10% (EPd) and 9% (Pd). Herpes zoster was reported in 5% (EPd) and 1.8% (Pd).
Monitor patients for development of infections and treat promptly.
<b>Second Primary Malignancies</b>
In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), invasive second primary malignancies (SPM) were 9% (ERd) and 6% (Rd). The rate of hematologic malignancies was the same between ERd and Rd treatment arms (1.6%). Solid tumors were reported in 3.5% (ERd) and 2.2% (Rd). Skin cancer was reported in 4.4% (ERd) and 2.8% (Rd).
In the ELOQUENT-3 trial (N=115), invasive SPMs were 0% (EPd) and 1.8% (Pd).
Monitor patients for the development of SPMs.
<b>Hepatotoxicity</b>
In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), AST/ALT &gt;3X the upper limit, total bilirubin &gt;2X the upper limit, and alkaline phosphatase &lt;2X the upper limit were 2.5% (ERd) vs 0.6% (Rd). Of 8 patients experiencing hepatotoxicity, 2 patients discontinued treatment while 6 patients had resolution and continued. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop EMPLICITI upon =Grade 3 elevation of liver enzymes. Continuation of treatment may be considered after return to baseline values.
<b>Interference with Determination of Complete Response</b>
EMPLICITI is a humanized IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and possibly relapse from complete response in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
<b>Pregnancy/Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</b>
There are no available data on EMPLICITI use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage.
There is a risk of fetal harm, including severe life-threatening human birth defects, associated with lenalidomide and pomalidomide, and they are contraindicated for use in pregnancy.

<b>Important Safety Information</b>
<b>WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY, HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, and VENOUS and ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM</b>
<b><span class=""bwuline"">Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</span></b>
<b>Do not use REVLIMID during pregnancy. Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe life-threatening human birth defects. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo-fetal death. In females of reproductive potential, obtain 2 negative pregnancy tests before starting REVLIMID treatment. Females of reproductive potential must use 2 forms of contraception or continuously abstain from heterosexual sex during and for 4 weeks after REVLIMID treatment. To avoid embryo-fetal exposure to lenalidomide, REVLIMID is only available through a restricted distribution program, the REVLIMID REMS<sup>®</sup> program.</b>
<b>Information about the REVLIMID REMS program is available at <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celgeneriskmanagement.com&amp;esheet=52185567&amp;newsitemid=20200309005181&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.celgeneriskmanagement.com&amp;index=3&amp;md5=fe7881f3b3f1911e98d28de38698e1ea"" rel=""nofollow"">www.celgeneriskmanagement.com</a> or by calling the manufacturer’s toll-free number 1-888-423-5436.</b>
<b><span class=""bwuline"">Hematologic Toxicity (Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia)</span></b>
<b>REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Eighty percent of patients with del 5q MDS had to have a dose delay/reduction during the major study. Thirty-four percent of patients had to have a second dose delay/reduction. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80% of patients enrolled in the study. Patients on therapy for del 5q MDS should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or reduction. Patients may require use of blood product support and/or growth factors.</b>
<b><span class=""bwuline"">Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism</span></b>
<b>REVLIMID has demonstrated a significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with MM who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy. Monitor for and advise patients about signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the choice of regimen should be based on an assessment of the patient’s underlying risks.</b>
<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b>
<b>Pregnancy: </b>REVLIMID can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus.
<b>Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions:</b> REVLIMID is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to lenalidomide.
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: See Boxed WARNINGS.</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><span class=""bwuline"">Females of Reproductive Potential</span>: <b>See Boxed WARNINGS.</b></li>
 	<li><span class=""bwuline"">Males</span>: Lenalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking REVLIMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing REVLIMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking REVLIMID must not donate sperm.</li>
 	<li><span class=""bwuline"">Blood Donation</span>: Patients must not donate blood during treatment with REVLIMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to REVLIMID.</li>
</ul>
<b>REVLIMID REMS<sup>®</sup> Program: See Boxed WARNINGS.</b> Prescribers and pharmacies must be certified with the REVLIMID REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements; pharmacies must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive REVLIMID. Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with REMS requirements; female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements and males must comply with contraception requirements.
<b>Hematologic Toxicity: </b>REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.<b> </b>Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising, especially with use of concomitant medications that may increase risk of bleeding. Patients may require a dose interruption and/or dose reduction. <b><span class=""bwuline"">MM</span>: </b>Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) in patients taking REVLIMID + dexamethasone or REVLIMID as maintenance therapy, every 7 days for the first 2 cycles, on days 1 and 15 of cycle 3, and every 28 days thereafter. <b><span class=""bwuline"">MDS</span>: </b>Monitor CBC in<b> </b>patients on therapy for del 5q MDS, weekly for the first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. <b>See Boxed WARNINGS</b> for further information. <b><span class=""bwuline"">MCL</span>:</b> Monitor CBC in patients taking REVLIMID for MCL weekly for the first cycle (28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles 2-4, and then monthly thereafter. <b><span class=""bwuline"">FL/MZL</span>:</b> Monitor CBC in patients taking REVLIMID for FL or MZL weekly for the first 3 weeks of Cycle 1 (28 days), every 2 weeks during Cycles 2-4, and then monthly thereafter.
<b>Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism: See Boxed WARNINGS.</b> Venous thromboembolic events (DVT and PE) and arterial thromboses (MI and CVA) are increased in patients treated with REVLIMID. Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the regimen should be based on the patient’s underlying risks. ESAs and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their use should be based on a benefit-risk decision.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With CLL: </b>In a clinical trial in the first-line treatment of patients with CLL, single-agent REVLIMID therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single-agent chlorambucil. Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure, occurred more frequently in the REVLIMID arm. REVLIMID is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials.
<b>Second Primary Malignancies (SPM):</b> In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving REVLIMID and in patients with FL or MZL receiving REVLIMID + rituximab therapy, an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor SPM, notably AML, have been observed. In patients with MM, MDS was also observed. Monitor patients for the development of SPM. Take into account both the potential benefit of REVLIMID and risk of SPM when considering treatment.
<b>Increased Mortality With Pembrolizumab:</b> In clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
<b>Hepatotoxicity: </b>Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with REVLIMID + dexamethasone. Pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may be risk factors. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop REVLIMID upon elevation of liver enzymes. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered.
<b>Severe Cutaneous Reactions: </b>Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. These events can be fatal. Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive REVLIMID. Consider REVLIMID interruption or discontinuation for Grade 2-3 skin rash. Permanently discontinue REVLIMID for Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS, TEN, or DRESS.
<b>Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):</b> Fatal instances of TLS have been reported during treatment with REVLIMID. The patients at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Closely monitor patients at risk and take appropriate preventive approaches.
<b>Tumor Flare Reaction (TFR): </b>TFR has occurred during investigational use of REVLIMID for CLL and lymphoma. Monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended in patients with MCL, FL, or MZL. Tumor flare may mimic the progression of disease (PD). In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, it is recommended to withhold treatment with REVLIMID until TFR resolves to =Grade 1. REVLIMID may be continued in patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR without interruption or modification, at the physician’s discretion.
<b>Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization:</b> A decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment (&gt;4 cycles) with REVLIMID has been reported. Consider early referral to transplant center to optimize timing of the stem cell collection.
<b>Thyroid Disorders: </b>Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported. Measure thyroid function before starting REVLIMID treatment and during therapy.
<b>Early Mortality in Patients With MCL: </b>In another MCL study, there was an increase in early deaths (within 20 weeks); 12.9% in the REVLIMID arm versus 7.1% in the control arm. Risk factors for early deaths include high tumor burden, MIPI score at diagnosis, and high WBC at baseline (=10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L).
<b>Hypersensitivity:</b> Hypersensitivity, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic reactions to REVLIMID has been reported. Permanently discontinue REVLIMID for angioedema and anaphylaxis.

</ul>
<b>DRUG INTERACTIONS</b>
Periodically monitor digoxin plasma levels due to increased C<sub>max </sub>and AUC with concomitant REVLIMID therapy. Patients taking concomitant therapies such as erythropoietin-stimulating agents or estrogen-containing therapies may have an increased risk of thrombosis. It is not known whether there is an interaction between dexamethasone and warfarin. Close monitoring of PT and INR is recommended in patients with MM taking concomitant warfarin.
<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Pregnancy: See Boxed WARNINGS: </b>If pregnancy does occur during treatment, immediately discontinue the drug and refer patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. There is a REVLIMID pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to REVLIMID during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to REVLIMID. This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure to REVLIMID to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to Celgene Corporation at 1-888-423-5436.</li>
 	<li><b>Lactation: </b>There is no information regarding the presence of lenalidomide in human milk, the effects of REVLIMID on the breastfed infant, or the effects of REVLIMID on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from REVLIMID, advise female patients not to breastfeed during treatment with REVLIMID.</li>
 	<li><b>Renal Impairment: </b>Adjust the starting dose of REVLIMID based on the creatinine clearance value and for patients on dialysis.</li>

<td align=""left"" valign=""top""><strong><em>BENGALURU, India and HERTFORDSHIRE, England, PITTSBURGH - March 9, 2020</em></strong>
<strong>Biocon</strong> Ltd.<strong> </strong>(BSE code: 532523, NSE: BIOCON) and <strong><a href=""http://www.mylan.com/"">Mylan N.V.</a></strong>(NASDAQ: MYL) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted Mylan’s <strong>Biologics License Application </strong>(BLA) for MYL-1402O, a proposed biosimilar to Avastin® (bevacizumab), for review under the 351(k) pathway.
The BLA seeks approval of bevacizumab for first-line and second-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy; first-line use for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer; recurrent glioblastoma; metastatic renal cell carcinoma in combination with interferon alfa; and persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.
The FDA goal date set under the Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA) is Dec. 27, 2020.
Biocon and Mylan’s proposed biosimilar bevacizumab is expected to be the third biosimilar from the partnered portfolio for the cancer patients in the U.S. It is currently available in India and other developing markets.
<strong>Dr Christiane Hamacher, CEO, Biocon Biologics,</strong> said: <em>“The US FDA’s acceptance of our BLA for a proposed biosimilar bevacizumab co-developed by Biocon Biologics and Mylan is an important milepost in our journey of enabling access to affordable cancer therapies for patients. Once approved, our proposed biosimilar bevacizumab will provide an affordable alternative to the branded biologic for the approved indications. Biocon Biologics’ strong R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to offer two key biosimilars to cancer patients in the U.S. and bevacizumab will further expand our oncology portfolio.”</em>
<strong>Mylan President <a href=""https://www.mylan.com/en/about-mylan/leadership/president-rajiv-malik"">Rajiv Malik</a>  </strong>commented: <em>“As we continue toward our goal of expanding access to cancer treatments for oncology patients, the FDA acceptance of our application for proposed biosimilar bevacizumab is another important step forward to increase competition, drive health system savings and expand our growing oncology portfolio to provide a broad range of offerings. We’re encouraged by the results of our scientific program to date and look forward to advancing the review of our application.”</em>
The BLA is supported by a global randomized, controlled phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of proposed biosimilar bevacizumab versus Avastin.
The study included patients diagnosed with stage 4 non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Eligible patients were randomised to receive either the proposed biosimilar bevacizumab or Avastin along with carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to six cycles (18 weeks). After which the patients continued to receive monotherapy until week 42. Additionally, patients benefitting from the treatment continued on bevacizumab monotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall response at week 18, using RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included safety, progression free survival and overall survival at week 18 and 42.
A total of 671 patients were randomized. At week 18, the study met the primary endpoint and the 90% confidence interval for the best ORR (objective response rate) ratio was within the pre-specified equivalence margin. The safety which included immunogenicity was found to be similar to Avastin.

Celltrion said Monday that it applied for the European Medicine Agency’s commercialization approval of CT-P17, a Humira (adalimumab) biosimilar.
CT-P17 is a highly potent biosimilar of AbbVie’s autoimmune disease treatment Humira, a blockbuster original that recorded $19.1 billion global revenue in 2019.
If approved, the CT-P17 will be a meaningful addition to Celltrion’s portfolio for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease treatment, alongside the company’s Remicade (infliximab) biosimilar Remsima. The TNF-alpha inhibitor market these drugs set out to target is estimated to be 50 trillion won ($41.7 billion) in size, globally.
Celltrion expects to introduce CT-P17 to the European market in about a year’s time, which is how long the EMA typically takes to review.
“We believe the CT-P17 has differentiated value from existing Humira biosimilars, with high market expectations. We will do our best for an early market release of the pipeline,” Celltrion said.
Due to its high potency, CT-P17 can have its targeted effect with less amount of injection than the original. The drug is citrate-free, meaning it causes less pain upon injection.
Celltrion had previously vowed for an annual of output of minimum one biosimilar up to year 2030.
Apart from CT-P17, Celltrion is also carrying out phase 3 clinical trial of Genetech’s Avastin (bevacizumab) biosimilar CT-P16 for metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer indications.
For Novartis’ asthma and rash treatment Xolair (omalizumab) biosimilar, CT-P39, the company is in the research phase.

<strong>Issued: London, UK</strong>
ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a leading global public research university with significant expertise in HIV basic and clinical research, today announced a five-year, $20 million renewal of a unique, public-private research partnership solely focused on discovering a cure for HIV.
Since its inception in 2015, this collaboration, the first-of-its-kind in the field of HIV cure, has brought together the skills of academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers to create a deeper understanding of how HIV works and develop a new approach to eradicating HIV that could be tested in humans for the first time in the next few years.
Deborah Waterhouse, CEO of ViiV Healthcare, said: “Five years ago when we announced this innovative collaboration, we were inspired by the possibility that with the right resources and research teams, we would be able to make a meaningful impact towards a cure for HIV. Although there is still much left to do, this public-private partnership is making a difference. We are excited to continue this partnership with UNC-Chapel Hill for another five years and look forward to the contribution our unique skills and shared commitment could make to finding a cure for HIV.”
Under the terms of the agreement, ViiV Healthcare and UNC-Chapel Hill scientists will continue to work side by side at the HIV Cure Center, which was created at the start of the collaboration five years ago and located on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus. ViiV Healthcare and UNC-Chapel Hill will also continue to jointly own Qura Therapeutics, the company created in 2015 to manage the intellectual property, commercialization, manufacturing and governance needs of the collaboration.
Kevin Guskiewicz, Chancellor at UNC-Chapel Hill, said: ""This groundbreaking venture has flourished thanks to the talent and dedication of top scientists and researchers from Carolina and ViiV Healthcare. I am thrilled that this innovative partnership will continue making discoveries and advancing a cure for HIV, one of the most pressing challenges of our times.""
Research currently underway through the HIV Cure Center and Qura Therapeutics is centered on the concept of “induce and reduce.” This strategy is first focused on identifying the copies of HIV that may be hiding in human immune cells while the virus is suppressed through antiretroviral therapy. Once identified, the virus is driven out of hiding (induce) so that it can be eliminated (reduce). This therapeutic approach strives to specifically affect the virus while minimizing the impact on the body beyond the hidden infected cells.
The pioneering research of Qura Therapeutics on the induce strategy was most recently <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1951-3?draft=marketing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">published in the journal <em>Nature</em></a>.<sup>[1]</sup> The paper describes how, using a class of drugs new to the HIV field, a signalling pathway in cells was activated that could robustly induce the hidden HIV to reactivate and become visible. Bringing the virus out of hiding is often seen as the greatest obstacle to curing HIV infection as these hidden, HIV-infected cells can persist despite decades of antiretroviral treatment, and these findings mark significant progress towards a cure for HIV.<sup>[1]</sup>
“Without the Qura partnership we would not have been able to get this far, this fast,” said David Margolis, MD, Director of the UNC HIV Cure Center and Sarah Graham Kenan Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Microbiology &amp; Immunology, and Epidemiology at the UNC School of Medicine. “We have accomplished a great deal in less than five years and hope to accomplish a good deal more in the years to come to help people living with HIV around the world.”
<h2>About Qura Therapeutics</h2>
Qura Therapeutics was formed in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and ViiV Healthcare and is focused on finding a cure for HIV. This unique public-private partnership is redefining the traditional way of conducting research and is creating a new model to seek the breakthroughs needed to tackle an extraordinarily challenging global health issue. Worldwide, 37 million people are living with HIV. While highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has offered the opportunity for most but not all infected individuals to achieve relatively normal life expectancies, there is, as yet, no cure and the search for one remains a top priority of health organizations worldwide.
Qura Therapeutics is providing financial and material support to the UNC HIV Cure Center to discover a cure for HIV and Qura Therapeutics will also assist in the development of therapies that emerge from the research.
<h2><strong>About ViiV Healthcare</strong></h2>

<strong>Ridgefield, Conn., March 9, 2020</strong> – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ofev<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup> (nintedanib) as the first treatment for people with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype. Unclassifiable ILDs, autoimmune ILDs, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, myositis, sjogren’s syndrome, coal workers pneumoconiosis and idiopathic forms of interstitial pneumonias such as idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia are among the diseases that may develop a progressive form of chronic fibrosing ILD.
Ofev, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits key pathways involved in lung fibrosis in ILDs, is currently approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD), two types of ILDs. Ofev received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. FDA for chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype in October 2019. This new approval now makes Ofev available for patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs in which lung fibrosis continues to worsen.
The FDA approval is based on the INBUILD<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup> trial, the first Phase III clinical trial in the field of ILDs to group patients based on the clinical behavior of their disease rather than the primary clinical diagnosis. In this trial, the safety and tolerability profile of Ofev was consistent with what was previously seen in IPF studies. The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to five percent in Ofev-treated patients compared to placebo were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, liver enzyme elevation, decreased appetite, weight decreased, headache, hypertension, nasopharygitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infections, fatigue and back pain. Please see additional Important Safety Information included below.
“Chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype lead to respiratory symptoms and worsening lung function,” said Kevin Flaherty, M.D., professor of medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and lead investigator of the INBUILD trial. “This approval provides a therapeutic option for many patients who did not have an approved treatment until today.”
Interstitial lung diseases encompass more than 200 disorders, which are classified as rare diseases, that can lead to pulmonary fibrosis – an irreversible scarring of lung tissue that negatively impacts lung function. Chronic fibrosing ILDs in which lung fibrosis continues to worsen are estimated to occur in 18 to 32 percent of patients with ILDs.
“As a leader in the field of ILD research, we are fully committed to better understanding how to treat these devastating diseases,” said Thomas Seck, M.D., senior vice president, Medicine &amp; Regulatory Affairs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “Today’s approval marks a major advancement in ILD research and is an important milestone just six months after the approval of Ofev to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-ILD.”
“Patients with a progressive form of chronic fibrosing ILDs may have symptoms that are similar to other respiratory illnesses and that may delay getting an accurate diagnosis for patients,” said Greg Cosgrove, M.D., chief medical officer, Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation. “The new indication for nintedanib provides a therapeutic option for physicians and their patients as there is now a treatment option that can help slow the decline in lung function.”

The INBUILD trial, which was published in the <a href=""https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.us/press-release/inbuild-meets-primary-endpoint-study-evaluated-ofev-patients-across-range"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></a>, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial conducted at 153 sites in 15 countries that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Ofev (150 mg, twice-daily) over 52 weeks in patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype. A total of 663 patients were evaluated, of whom 412 (62.1 percent) had a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like pattern on high-resolution CT (HRCT). Randomization of patients was based on the fibrotic patterns as detected through HRCT. Lung function was assessed by the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC), which is an established measurement of lung function.
Results showed that Ofev slowed the loss of pulmonary function by 57 percent (107 mL/year) across a range of patients relative to placebo. In patients with UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT, results showed that treatment with Ofev-versus placebo slowed the loss of pulmonary function by 61 percent (128.2mL/year).
In this trial, the safety and tolerability profile of Ofev was consistent with what was previously seen in IPF studies, with the most common adverse reaction being diarrhea.
<strong>About Ofev</strong>
Ofev is already approved in the U.S. and more than 75 countries for the treatment of patients living with IPF. In September 2019, Ofev was approved in the U.S. as the first and only therapy to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-ILD.
<strong>Ofev patient support</strong>
To support people who are prescribed Ofev, Boehringer Ingelheim has developed OPEN DOORS<sup class=""footnote"">®</sup> – a comprehensive patient support program that provides a broad range of nursing, social resources, and financial support services. Accessible through <a class=""inline-disclaimer-link"" href=""https://www.ofev.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.ofev.com</a> and at 1-866-673-6366, OPEN DOORS services and resources include:
<ul>
 	<li>Access to nurse support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week</li>
 	<li>Social resource services to identify local resources, such as support groups and transportation to doctor appointments</li>
 	<li>Assistance in finding financial resources to support access to Ofev</li>
 	<li>Access to educational information on IPF, SSc-ILD and chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype</li>
</ul>
<strong>What is OFEV?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>OFEV is a prescription medicine used:
<ul>
 	<li>to treat people with a lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
?
or</li>
 	<li>to treat people with a chronic (long lasting) interstitial lung disease in which lung fibrosis continues to worsen (progress).
?
or</li>
 	<li>to slow the rate of decline in lung function in people with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) (also known as scleroderma-associated ILD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>It is not known if OFEV is safe and effective in children.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Important Safety Information</strong>
<strong>What is the most important information I should know about OFEV (nintedanib)?</strong>
OFEV can cause harm, birth defects, or death to an unborn baby. Women should not become pregnant while taking OFEV. Women who are able to become pregnant should have a pregnancy test before starting treatment and should use highly effective birth control during and for at least 3 months after your last dose. Talk with your doctor about what birth control method is right for you during this time. Women using hormonal birth control should also use a barrier method of birth control (such as male condoms or spermicide). If you become pregnant or think you are pregnant while taking OFEV, tell your doctor right away.
<strong>What should I tell my doctor before using OFEV?</strong>
<strong>Before you take OFEV, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you have:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>liver problems.</li>
 	<li>heart problems.</li>
 	<li>a history of blood clots.</li>
 	<li>a bleeding problem or a family history of a bleeding problem.</li>
 	<li>had recent surgery in your stomach (abdominal) area.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Tell your doctor if you:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</li>
 	<li>are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if OFEV passes into your breast milk. You <strong>should not</strong>breastfeed while taking OFEV.</li>
 	<li>are a smoker. You should stop smoking prior to taking OFEV and avoid smoking during treatment.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take,</strong> including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements such as St. John’s wort.
<strong>What are the possible side effects of OFEV?</strong>
<strong>OFEV may cause serious side effects.</strong>
<strong>TELL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY if you are experiencing any side effects, including:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Liver problems.</strong> Unexplained symptoms may include yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, pain on the upper right side of your stomach area (abdomen), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal, feeling tired, or loss of appetite. Your doctor will do blood tests to check how well your liver is working before starting and during your treatment with OFEV.</li>
 	<li><strong>Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.</strong> Your doctor may recommend that you drink fluids or take medicine to treat these side effects. Tell your doctor if you have these symptoms, if they do not go away, or get worse, and if you are taking over-the-counter laxatives, stool softeners, and other medicines or dietary supplements.</li>
 	<li><strong>Heart attack.</strong> Symptoms of a heart problem may include chest pain or pressure, pain in your arms, back, neck, or jaw, or shortness of breath.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stroke.</strong> Symptoms of a stroke may include numbness or weakness on one side of your body, trouble talking, headache, or dizziness.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bleeding problems.</strong> OFEV may increase your chances of having bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, wounds that do not heal, and/or if you are taking a blood thinner, including prescription blood thinners and over-the-counter aspirin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tear in your stomach or intestinal wall (perforation).</strong> OFEV may increase your chances of having a tear in your stomach or intestinal wall. Tell your doctor if you have pain or swelling in your stomach area.</li>
</ul>
The most common side effects of OFEV are diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, liver problems, decreased appetite, headache, weight loss, and high blood pressure.

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases among children and youth.<sup>2</sup> Managing diabetes can be challenging for parents and caregivers given it is hard to know exactly how much or how quickly their children will eat, making mealtime insulin dosing difficult.<sup>3,4,5 </sup> Missed meals, illness and increased physical activity without a corresponding reduction in insulin or increase in carbohydrate consumption can lead to significant diabetes management complications for children.<sup>6</sup>
</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">
""Children living with diabetes face significant challenges in managing their disease.  Just being a kid and factoring common daily events like mealtime, school, travel, activities, play and sick days can dramatically impact hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Karen McAssey</span>, Pediatric Endocrinologist at McMaster Children's Hospital.  ""As a clinician who treats pediatric diabetes patients daily, it's essential to have effective, fast-acting mealtime insulin options to support optimal disease management and care.""
<b>Fiasp<sup>® </sup>for adult and pediatric type one and type two diabetes management -</b> First approved by Health Canada in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2017</span> for the treatment of adult patients, Fiasp<sup>®</sup> is absorbed faster than conventional insulin aspart (e.g. NovoRapid<sup>®</sup>) appearing twice as fast in the bloodstream after injection,<sup>7</sup> which leads to improved glycemic control after a meal.<sup>8,9 </sup> Fiasp<sup>®</sup> is now indicated for treatment of adult and pediatric patients (&gt;2 years old) with diabetes mellitus who require mealtime insulin for the control of hyperglycemia.<sup>10</sup>
<b>Fiasp® pump use -</b> Fiasp<sup>®</sup> (10 mL vials) may now be used for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in pump systems that are licensed in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> for insulin infusion. An insulin pump may provide greater lifestyle flexibility and convenience particularly with regards to meal schedules and travel.  Both CSII and multiple daily insulin injection therapy are effective means of implementing intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normal levels of blood glucose and improved lifestyle flexibility. Use Fiasp<sup>®</sup> in accordance with the insulin infusion pumps' instructions for use.  Patients should be trained on using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy and to administer insulin by injection with alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure. Refer to the insulin infusion pump manufacturers' user manual to see if Fiasp<sup>®</sup> can be used.<sup>11</sup>
""We welcome the pediatric approval of Fiasp<sup>®</sup> for younger Canadians, providing greater choice for effective disease management to support easier, healthier and safer lives for young people with type 1 diabetes,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Dave Prowten</span>, President and CEO of JDRF Canada<b>.</b>
The approval of Fiasp<sup>®</sup> in pediatric patients is based on Health Canada's review of data from the onset 7 clinical trial, which confirmed the efficacy and safety of Fiasp<sup>®</sup> in children.<sup>12</sup> <sup> </sup>The label change for use in insulin infusion pumps is based on Health Canada's review of data from the onset 5 clinical trial, which confirmed the efficacy and safety of Fiasp<sup>®</sup>when used in insulin infusion pumps in adults with diabetes.  The pump should be programed based on guidance from healthcare providers and the pump maker's instructions.<sup>13</sup>
""At Novo Nordisk, we are continuously researching innovative solutions to improve diabetes management and address critical unmet needs,"" said Vicky Chan, Vice President, Clinical Development, Medical and Regulatory Affairs, Novo Nordisk Canada Inc. ""We are pleased to offer Fiasp<sup>® </sup>– a trusted and effective mealtime glucose control treatment – to the pediatric diabetes community in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> allowing for choice and convenience in supporting diabetes management goals.""
<b>About Fiasp<sup>®<br class=""dnr"" /></sup></b>Fiasp<sup>®</sup> is a rapid acting mealtime insulin, developed by Novo Nordisk with the objective of achieving a faster initial absorption, to improve glycemic control after a meal, in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.<sup>14</sup> Fiasp<sup>®</sup> is insulin aspart, a molecule with more than 20 years of clinical experience,<sup>15</sup> in an innovative formulation, in which two excipients have been added, Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) to increase the speed of absorption, and a naturally occurring Amino Acid (L-Arginine) for stability.<sup>16</sup>
Low blood sugar is the most common adverse effect of insulin products, including Fiasp<sup>®</sup>. If low blood sugar or high blood sugar reactions are not treated, they can cause loss of consciousness, coma or even death. Blood sugar levels should be monitored for all patients with diabetes.<sup>17 </sup>

<strong>OSLO, NORWAY, March 10, 2020</strong> – CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, today announced the expansion of its COVID-19 vaccine portfolio. CEPI will be investing a further $4.4 million in partnering agreements with Novavax, Inc. and The University of Oxford to rapidly develop vaccine candidates against COVID-19. This brings CEPI’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine R&amp;D to $23.7 million.
CEPI will provide initial funding to Novavax to enable preparations for phase 1 trials. Funding for The University of Oxford project will support the manufacture of vaccine materials required for preclinical and phase 1 testing. Earlier this year, CEPI announced initial funding to <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/curevac-and-cepi-extend-their-cooperation-to-develop-a-vaccine-against-coronavirus-ncov-2019/"">Curevac Inc.</a>, <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019"">Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.</a>, <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019"">Moderna, Inc.</a>, and <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019"">University of Queensland</a> to develop COVID-19 vaccine candidates using innovative platform technologies.
The investments announced today are a result of a recent global <a href=""https://cepi.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Call-text_CfP2_019-nCoV_30.01.2020-1.pdf"">call for proposals</a> that CEPI issued in early February, which invited funding applications for proven vaccine technology that could be used to rapidly develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus, and most importantly at scale and with the necessary equitable access provisions.

<h4><strong>Novavax, Inc. (recombinant protein nanoparticle technology)</strong></h4>
Novavax has produced and is currently assessing multiple nanoparticle vaccine candidates to identify the best candidate(s) for human testing, which is expected to begin by the end of spring 2020. Novavax is creating COVID-19 vaccine candidates using its proprietary recombinant protein nanoparticle technology platform to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein. Novavax expects to use its proprietary Matrix-M™ adjuvant with its COVID-19 vaccine candidate to enhance immune responses. Novavax has experience in rapid innovative vaccine development against novel emerging viruses, including efforts to develop vaccines against the similar coronaviruses Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
<h4><strong>The University of Oxford (ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine)</strong></h4>
ChAdOx1 is a replication-deficient simian adenoviral vaccine vector. This vaccine platform has been used to produce vaccine candidates against multiple pathogens, including Influenza, Chikungunya, and Zika. In 2018, CEPI provided <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-awards-contract-worth-up-to-usd19-million-to-oxford-university-and-janssen-vaccines-to-develop-mers-lassa-and-nipah-vaccines/"">up to $19 million to Oxford</a> to develop vaccines against Lassa, Nipah, and MERS. Oxford’s ChAdOx1 MERS candidate has completed phase 1 studies and a second clinical study is underway in Saudi Arabia.
<h4><a href=""https://cepi.net/contact/?target=investor"">Invest Now</a></h4>
Without immediate additional financial contributions the vaccine programmes we have begun will not be able to progress and ultimately will not deliver the vaccines that the world needs.
<a href=""https://cepi.net/contact/?target=investor""><strong>Join our coalition</strong></a> and help us create a future in which epidemics are no longer a threat to humanity.

</strong></li>
</ul>
Basel, 11 March 2020 — Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of CINtec® <em>PLUS</em> Cytology as the first biomarker-based triage test for women whose primary cervical cancer screening results are positive for the human papillomavirus (HPV) using the cobas® 4800 HPV Test. This biomarker technology simplifies clinical decision making by providing easy to understand results so that clinicians and women are clear on next steps.
The CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology test identifies those women whose HPV infections are most likely to be associated with cervical pre-cancers. It enables clinicians to more confidently determine which women should be referred to immediate further diagnostic procedures, helping to prevent women from developing more advanced cervical disease.
About 13,800 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in the US in 2020, according to the American Cancer Society, and about 4,290 women will die from the disease this year. Persistent infection with HPV is the principal cause of cervical cancer, with the virus implicated in more than 99 percent of cervical cancers worldwide.
“Despite being nearly 100 percent preventable, cervical cancer is still one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. To address this, Roche is dedicated to investing in next-generation biomarkers that will significantly advance screening strategies and support global efforts to eradicate this disease,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO, Roche Diagnostics. “We are committed to providing women with the protection and care they deserve.” While most HPV infections resolve on their own, some women who test positive for the virus or whose co-testing results are inconclusive – HPV-positive and Pap cytology-negative – may develop pre-cancerous cervical lesions that, if left untreated, may progress to cervical cancer. Early identification of women who are most at risk is vital.
CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology provides definitive information about which HPV-positive women may benefit most from immediate referral to colposcopy versus repeat testing. This is a major step forward to individualize a woman’s care and prevent both overtreatment and undertreatment.
FDA considered data from the Roche-sponsored registrational IMPACT (IMproving Primary screening And Colposcopy Triage) trial, which enrolled more than 35,000 women in the US to clinically validate CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology as a triage test in different screening scenarios. Publication of study data is pending.
CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology is expected to be widely commercially available in the US later in 2020.
<strong>About the CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology test</strong>
The Roche cobas 4800 HPV Test, used in combination with CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology and CINtec® Histology, offers clinicians and labs in the US powerful support they have not had before. The dual-stain biomarker technology included in the CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology test detects the simultaneous presence within a single cell of the two biomarkers -- p16 and Ki-67. This abnormality is associated with HPV infections that are transforming and can, if left untreated, progress to pre-cancer or cancer. A positive result of these two biomarkers in a single cell signals that a woman is more significantly at risk for disease. The ability of CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology to distinguish those women who are at higher risk for cervical disease provides labs, clinicians and women, in conjunction with the physician’s assessment of patient screening history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines information, to guide patient management. This could reduce the number and frequency of follow-up visits, saving worry, time and money.
The new test can be performed using the same liquid sample that is used for HPV or Pap cytology testing. This eliminates the need for additional or repeat sample collection or time spent waiting to find out if an infection is clearing. Primary screening by the cobas 4800 HPV DNA test with triage using the CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology test demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity to detect transforming HPV infections reliably and cost-effectively.
Prior to FDA approval for use in the US, the CINtec <em>PLUS</em> Cytology test, which runs on the BenchMark ULTRA IHC/ISH system, had been used as a triage test for HPV-positive results and mildly abnormal Pap cytology results in Europe, Asia, South America and Australia.

<b>RARITAN, NJ, March 10, 2020</b> – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for JNJ-61186372 (JNJ-6372) for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 insertion mutations, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. JNJ-6372 is an EGFR-mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific antibody that targets activating and resistant EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications.<sup><a class=""Link"" href=""https://www.jnj.com/janssen-announces-u-s-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-granted-for-jnj-6372-for-the-treatment-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#_edn1"" data-cms-ai=""0"">[1]</a></sup>Currently, there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies for patients with lung cancer who have EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations.<sup><a class=""Link"" href=""https://www.jnj.com/janssen-announces-u-s-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-granted-for-jnj-6372-for-the-treatment-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#_edn2"" data-cms-ai=""0"">[2]</a></sup>
Patients with NSCLC and EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations have a form of disease that is generally insensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatments and carries a worse prognosis compared to patients with more common EGFR mutations (Exon 19 deletions/L858R substitution).<sup><a class=""Link"" href=""https://www.jnj.com/janssen-announces-u-s-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-granted-for-jnj-6372-for-the-treatment-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#_edn3"" data-cms-ai=""0"">[3]</a></sup> The current standard of care for this patient population is conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.<sup><a class=""Link"" href=""https://www.jnj.com/janssen-announces-u-s-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-granted-for-jnj-6372-for-the-treatment-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#_edn4"" data-cms-ai=""0"">[4]</a></sup>
“JNJ-6372 is a novel bispecific antibody that we believe has the potential to benefit patients with Exon 20 mutation insertions who often do not respond to currently available oral EGFR-targeted or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies,” said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “This Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to advance JNJ-6372 in clinical development and target genetically-defined lung cancer.”

<strong>Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, Japan, March 10, 2020 </strong>– Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://www.takeda.com/investors/"">TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</a>) (“Takeda”) today announced the results from the TOURMALINE-MM2 study designed to evaluate the addition of NINLARO™ (ixazomib) to lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients. The addition of ixazomib to lenalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in an improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.5 months (35.3 months versus 21.8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.83; p=0.073); however, it did not meet the threshold for statistical significance. The safety profile associated with NINLARO from the TOURMALINE-MM2 trial was generally consistent with the existing prescribing information.
Results from the TOURMALINE-MM2 study will be submitted to an upcoming medical congress.
“There is a need for treatment options in transplant ineligible patients. We remain committed to advancing the field of multiple myeloma and continue to drive innovation through ongoing research and development,” said Christopher Arendt, Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “We are confident there will be numerous learnings from this trial and look forward to sharing these data with the community. We want to thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this important program.”
Investigators have been informed of the outcome and will discuss the potential impact with study participants. For patients currently enrolled in this study, it is up to the discretion of physicians to continue their current treatment.
<h4><strong>About the TOURMALINE-MM2 Trial</strong></h4>
TOURMALINE-MM2 is an international, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial, designed to evaluate NINLARO<sup>TM</sup> (ixazomib) plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to placebo plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone, in 705 adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not candidates for transplant. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Key secondary endpoints include rate of complete response (CR), pain response and overall survival (OS). For additional information: <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01850524"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01850524"" data-action=""External"">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01850524</a>
<h4><strong>About Multiple Myeloma</strong></h4>
Multiple myeloma is a life-threatening rare blood cancer that arises from the plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that is made in the bone marrow. These plasma cells become abnormal, multiply and release a type of antibody known as a paraprotein, which causes symptoms of the disease, including bone pain, frequent or recurring infections and fatigue, a symptom of anemia. These malignant plasma cells have the potential to affect many bones in the body and can cause a number of serious health problems affecting the bones, immune system, kidneys and red blood cell count. The typical multiple myeloma disease course includes periods of symptomatic myeloma followed by periods of remission. Nearly 230,000 people around the world live with multiple myeloma, with approximately 114,000 new cases diagnosed globally each year.
<h4><strong>About NINLARO</strong><strong><sup>TM</sup></strong> <strong>(ixazomib) capsules</strong></h4>
NINLARO™ (ixazomib) is an oral proteasome inhibitor which is being studied across the continuum of multiple myeloma treatment settings. NINLARO was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015 and is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. NINLARO is currently approved in more than 60 countries, including the United States, Japan and in the European Union, with more than 10 regulatory filings currently under review. It was the first oral proteasome inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials and to receive approval.
<h4><strong>NINLARO<sup>TM</sup> (ixazomib): GLOBAL IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></h4>
<strong>SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>
<strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> has been reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively) with platelet nadirs typically occurring between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle and recovery to baseline by the start of the next cycle. It did not result in an increase in hemorrhagic events or platelet transfusions. Monitor platelet counts at least monthly during treatment with NINLARO and consider more frequent monitoring during the first three cycles. Manage with dose modifications and platelet transfusions as per standard medical guidelines.
<strong>Gastrointestinal toxicities</strong> have been reported in the NINLARO and placebo regimens respectively, such as diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), and vomiting (22% vs. 11%), occasionally requiring use of antiemetic and anti-diarrheal medications, and supportive care.
<strong>Peripheral</strong> <strong>neuropathy</strong> was reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 21% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). The most commonly reported reaction was peripheral sensory neuropathy (19% and 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Peripheral motor neuropathy was not commonly reported in either regimen (&lt; 1%). Monitor patients for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and adjust dosing as needed.
<strong>Peripheral edema </strong>was reported with NINLARO (25% vs. 18% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Evaluate patients for underlying causes and provide supportive care, as necessary. Adjust the dose of dexamethasone per its prescribing information or the dose of NINLARO for severe symptoms
<strong>Cutaneous reactions</strong> occurred in 19% of patients in the NINLARO regimen compared to 11% of patients in the placebo regimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens was maculo-papular and macular rash. Manage rash with supportive care, dose modification or discontinuation.
<strong>Thrombotic microangiopathy</strong>, sometimes fatal, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), have been reported in patients who received NINLARO. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TPP/HUS and stop NINLARO if diagnosis is suspected. If the diagnosis of TPP/HUS is excluded, consider restarting NINLARO. The safety of reinitiating NINLARO therapy in patients previously experiencing TPP/HUS is not known.
<strong>Hepatotoxicity, </strong>drug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular injury, hepatic steatosis, and hepatitis cholestatic have been uncommonly reported with NINLARO. Monitor hepatic enzymes regularly and adjust dose for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms.
<strong>Pregnancy</strong>- NINLARO can cause fetal harm. Advise male and females patients of reproductive potential to use contraceptive measures during treatment and for an additional 90 days after the final dose of NINLARO. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while taking NINLARO due to potential hazard to the fetus. Women using hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of contraception.
<strong>Lactation</strong>- It is not known whether NINLARO or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There could be potential adverse events in nursing infants and therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued.
<strong>SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS</strong>
<strong>Hepatic Impairment:</strong> Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
<strong>Renal Impairment:</strong> Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. NINLARO is not dialyzable and, therefore, can be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis.
<strong>DRUG INTERACTIONS</strong>
Co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers with NINLARO is not recommended.
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (= 20%) in the NINLARO regimen, and greater than in the placebo regimen, were diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), thrombocytopenia (28% vs. 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 21%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), peripheral edema (25% vs. 18%), vomiting (22% vs. 11%), and back pain (21% vs. 16%). Serious adverse reactions reported in = 2% of patients included thrombocytopenia (2%) and diarrhea (2%). For each adverse reaction, one or more of the three drugs was discontinued in = 1% of patients in the NINLARO regimen.

In the<i> </i>CheckMate -040<i> </i>cohort of HCC patients previously treated with sorafenib, after a minimum follow up of 28 months,<sup>1 </sup>33% (16/49; 95% CI: 20-48)<i> </i>of patients responded to treatment with <i>Opdivo + Yervoy</i>; 8% (4/49) had a complete response (CR) and 24% (12/49) had a partial response (PR).<sup>1</sup> Duration of responses (DOR) ranged from 4.6 to 30.5+ months, with 88% lasting at least six months, 56% at least 12 months and 31% at least 24 months.<sup>1</sup> Overall response rate (ORR) and DOR were assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).<sup>1 </sup>ORR assessed by BICR using modified RECIST was 35% (17/49; 95% CI: 22-50), with a CR reported in 12% (6/49) of patients and a PR reported in 22% (11/49) of patients.<sup>1</sup>
<i>Opdivo</i> is associated with the following Warnings and Precautions including immune-mediated: pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, skin adverse reactions, encephalitis, other adverse reactions; infusion-related reactions; embryo-fetal toxicity; and increased mortality in patients with multiple myeloma when <i>Opdivo</i> is added to a thalidomide analogue and dexamethasone, which is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.<sup>1 </sup>Please see the Important Safety Information section below, including <b>Boxed WARNING for <i>Yervoy</i> (ipilimumab) regarding immune-mediated adverse reactions</b>, as well as select safety information from CheckMate -040.
“The incidence of liver cancer is rising in the United States, and HCC is the most common and aggressive form of the disease,”<sup>4,5,6,7,8,9</sup>said Andrea Wilson, president and founder, Blue Faery: The Adrienne Wilson Liver Cancer Association. “Today’s approval provides a new option for patients with HCC previously treated with sorafenib, giving the community more hope.”<sup>1</sup>
<i>Opdivo + Yervoy</i> is the only dual immunotherapy approved by the FDA in this setting. The therapy features a potentially synergistic mechanism of action that targets two different checkpoints (PD-1 and CTLA-4) and works in complementary ways.<sup>1</sup>
“We recognize there is a critical need to provide patients with aggressive forms of cancer, like HCC, new treatment options that may offer clinically meaningful and ultimately durable responses,” said Adam Lenkowsky, general manager and head, U.S., Oncology, Immunology, Cardiovascular, Bristol Myers Squibb. “Today’s announcement builds on our legacy in pioneering immunotherapy treatments and is an important step in our commitment to transforming patients’ lives through science.”
<i>Opdivo</i> + <i>Yervoy</i> was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication and a Priority Review from the FDA.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</span></b>
<b>WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>
<b>YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.</b>
<b>Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy, and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests, at baseline and before each dose.</b>
<b>Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.</b>
<b>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</b>
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or more severe pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2.

In a separate Phase 3 trial of YERVOY 3 mg/kg, severe, life-threatening, or fatal (diarrhea of =7 stools above baseline, fever, ileus, peritoneal signs; Grade 3-5) immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 34 (7%) patients. Across all YERVOY-treated patients in that trial (n=511), 5 (1%) developed intestinal perforation, 4 (0.8%) died as a result of complications, and 26 (5%) were hospitalized for severe enterocolitis.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Addition of an alternative immunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid therapy, or replacement of the corticosteroid therapy, should be considered in corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis if other causes are excluded.
<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</b>
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment.

Encephalitis occurred in one MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patient (0.8%) receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg after 15 days of exposure.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in &lt;1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in &lt;1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>
Based on mechanism of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO or YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
<b>Lactation</b>
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from OPDIVO or YERVOY, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 5 months after the last dose.

(Nasdaq: VIR) today announced a research collaboration agreement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Vaccine Research Center (VRC) to advance characterization and development of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19. The joint project, which will begin this week, will augment ongoing efforts by both parties to identify antibodies that can be used to prevent or treat infection with existing and emerging viruses and help inform the development of vaccines.</span>[/caption]
Under the terms of the agreement, Vir and NIAID will work together to identify and optimize combinations of antibodies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS, as well as antibodies that may be effective across additional types of coronaviruses. The two parties will exchange antibodies and other materials for testing in combination and individually and, by mutual agreement, will perform in vivo animal studies to analyze immune responses.
<p align=""justify"">“This collaboration expands Vir’s efforts to characterize and develop antibody therapies against coronaviruses by allowing us to access the VRC’s significant and broad research experience with coronaviruses, which is complementary to ours,” said Herbert “Skip” Virgin, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Vir. “This is one of multiple approaches we are taking to rapidly identify and test potential prophylactics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and we expect it to allow us to accelerate finding solutions to this urgent public health need.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Vir has identified a number of monoclonal antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies were isolated from individuals who had survived a SARS infection. The company is conducting research to determine if its antibodies, or additional antibodies that it may be able to identify from COVID-19 survivors, can be effective as treatment and/or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p align=""justify"">NIAID-funded scientists are exploring ways to treat and prevent human coronavirus infections by working to develop new antibodies, drugs, and vaccines that block entry to cells, enhance the immune system response, or block viral replication. To date, this research has focused on the coronavirus spike protein and includes development of neutralization assays and competition assays that are used to characterize antibodies.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Vir’s Antibody Platform</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Vir has a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from, or have recovered from, infectious diseases. The platform is used to identify rare antibodies from survivors that have the potential to treat and prevent rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens via direct pathogen neutralization and immune system stimulation. Vir engineers the fully human antibodies that it discovers to enhance their therapeutic potential. This platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including Ebola (mAb114, currently in use in the Democratic Republic of Congo), hepatitis B virus, influenza A, malaria, and others.</p>

</div>
<div class=""text"">
<div>Shanghai, China, March 9, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that an investigational new drug (IND) application has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for HLX14, a Denosumab biosimilar independently developed by Henlius, indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.</div>
<div></div>
<strong><u>HLX14 can prevent RANKL/RANK mediated bone-related diseases</u></strong>
<div>HLX14, a recombinant anti-RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) human monoclonal antibody (mAb) injection, is a biosimilar of Denosumab (Trade Name: Prolia®) developed in accordance with Biosimilar Guidelines. HLX14 can specifically bind to RANKL and block the interaction between RANKL and RANK, which is expressed on the surface of osteoclasts, thus inhibiting RANKL/RANK-mediated differentiation, maturation and activation of osteoclasts, thereby reducing bone resorption and the incidence of skeletal-related events<sup>[1]</sup>.</div>
<div></div>
<strong><u>Several studies have shown the similarity between HLX14 and its original drug</u></strong>
<div>Currently, the original drug of HLX14, Denosumab has been approved in the United States and the European Union, for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, as well as for the treatment of patients with giant cell tumor of bone and patients with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Denosumab can increase the bone density and reduce the risk of fracture for these patient populations. In China, Denosumab has already been approved to treat giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, while the other indications like osteoporosis have not been approved. Developed in accordance with Biosimilar Guidelines and via step-by-step comparison , HLX14 was proved to be in high similarity with Denosumab in preclinical pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies.</div>
<div></div>
<strong><u>Increasing medical needs endow HLX14 a broad market prospect</u></strong>
<div>Nowadays, the serious problem of osteoporosis is arising throughout the world. Among all countries, China has the largest population that is suffering from osteoporosis, which mainly occurs in postmenopausal women and elderly people<sup>[2]</sup>. Health problems caused by osteoporosis, like facture, can result in significant loss of quality of life. Nonetheless, the percentage of patients with osteoporosis that have received standardized treatment is relatively low. With the increasing patient number and improved diagnosis of osteoporosis in China, the huge unmet medical needs in the treatment of osteoporosis are urgently to be addressed<sup>[3]</sup>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The original drug of HLX14, Denosumab, can also be used in the treatment of bone metastasis from solid tumors. Bone is a frequent site of metastases in cancer patients, but the overall incidence of bone metastasis is not known. The relative incidence of bone metastasis by type of tumor, in patients with advanced metastatic disease, is: 65-75% in BC; 65-75% in prostate; 60% in thyroid; 30-40% in lung; 40% in bladder; 20-25% in renal cell carcinoma and 14-45% in melanoma<sup>[4]</sup>. Another indication of Denosumab is giant cell tumor of bone, which is a benign but usually aggressive neoplasm of bone<sup>[5]</sup>. Globally, giant cell tumor accounts for 4% to 5% of primary bone tumors<sup>[6]</sup>. Compared with western population, the incidence of giant cell tumor is relatively higher in Chinese population, accounting for 20% of primary bone tumors<sup>[7]</sup>. Despite the fact that most giant cell tumors are benign, without proper treatment, they often causes serious damage of the affected bone and can finally result in bone fracture, joint dysfunction or even amputation.</div>
<div></div>
<strong><u>The development of HLX14 expands Henlius’ portfolio to cover more disease areas</u></strong>
Henlius actively implements its product development strategy and the product portfolio covers several advanced mAb biosimilar candidates with near-term commercialization possibility. Following HLX01(???), the first approved biosimilar in China, HLX03 (adalimumab injection) and HLX02 (trastuzumab for injection) are now having their NDA under priority review by the NMPA. Remarkably, the Marketing Authorization Application for HLX02, the first biosimilar developed in China to enter a global multi-center phase 3 clinical trial, was accepted to review by EMA in June 2019. The development of HLX14 is an active attempt of Henlius in advancing forward products in the field of osteoporosis and will help the company to further expand portfolio to cover more disease areas.
On top of biosimilar, Henlius has built an extensive pipeline in bio-innovative and combination therapy. While quickly driving clinical studies of novel products in different countries and areas, Henlius is also actively diversifying versatile in-house combination therapy portfolio with a focus on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs to capture future immuno-oncology opportunities. Looking forward, Henlius will continue to advance the development of innovative biologics by virtue of its established and integrated innovation platform, underscoring its long-term commitment to providing affordable and effective therapies for patients worldwide.

TEL AVIV, Israel--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Teva Pharmaceutical Europe BV an affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) today announced that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended AJOVY (fremanezumab) in its Final Appraisal Document (FAD) for the prevention of migraine in adults with chronic migraine. NICE recommends AJOVY® for chronic migraine patients who have not responded to at least three prior preventive drug treatments.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“NICE's decision to approve the use of AJOVY® on the NHS in England and Wales for patients with chronic migraine is fantastic news”</p>
<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200312005055/en/Positive-Recommendation-NICE-anti-CGRP-migraine-therapy-AJOVY%C2%AE%E2%96%BC#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
AJOVY® is one of several monoclonal antibodies specifically designed to target the CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) pathway, a key contributor to migraine and is the first anti-CGRP preventive therapy approved by NICE. AJOVY ® is a long-acting treatment that offers monthly or quarterly dosing options and can be self-injected. <sup>1</sup>
Until the anti-CGRPs were approved, migraine preventive therapies in Europe were limited and none of the commonly used treatments (anti-epileptics, anti-depressants, beta blockers and botulinum toxin injections) were developed specifically to target the molecular pathways of migraine.<sup>2</sup>
“NICE's decision to approve the use of AJOVY® on the NHS in England and Wales for patients with chronic migraine is fantastic news,” comments Dr Mark Weatherall, President of the British Association for the Study of Headache. “Anyone who looks after people with chronic migraine understands just how debilitating this neurological disorder can be. We have waited a long time for this new class of drug to be made available in the NHS, but now that we can prescribe fremanezumab, I am excited to see what a difference it will make to the lives of many of my worst affected patients,” said Dr Mark Weatherall, President of the British Association for the Study of Headache.
Migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated in at least 50% of all patients. Less than 50% of people with migraine are not recognized by their general practitioner and less than 30% of migraine patients have management of their disease.<sup>3</sup> Migraine typically presents as a moderate to severe throbbing headache, often accompanied by nausea and/or vomiting, with sensitivity to noise, light and/or smell.<sup>4</sup>
It is estimated that 1 in 7 adults are affected by migraine and women are three times more likely to be affected than men.<sup>5</sup> Chronic migraine, defined as 15 or more headache days and at least 8 migraine days per month for more than three months, is estimated to affect around 900,000 <sup>6.7</sup> of the adult population in the UK and can have a tremendous impact on quality of life. With 15% of people affected, Europe has the highest percentage of people with migraine of all continents. <sup>8</sup>
NICE recommends AJOVY® for chronic migraine patients who have not responded to at least three prior preventive drug treatments. This decision is based on a dossier submitted to NICE for a Single Technology Appraisal (STA). Following issuance of the FAD, NICE will provide its formal guidance to the NHS in England. The full NICE recommendations and conditions can be viewed on their website.
Richard Daniell, Executive Vice President European Commercial, Teva: “This is an important decision to help the lives of migraine patients in England and signifies a recognition of the impact of this disease. Patients’ lives and choices are limited by their migraine. We are proud that Teva’s AJOVY® is the first anti-CGRP preventive therapy that NICE has considered to demonstrate cost-effectiveness leading to a reimbursement decision. In time we hope that this treatment becomes available for all adult chronic migraine patients across Europe.”

<h3><b><i>Designation based on positive results from two Phase III trials</i></b></h3>
&nbsp;
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for <i>Calquence</i> (acalabrutinib) as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), one of the most common types of leukaemia in adults.<sup>1</sup>
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “This is an important regulatory milestone for our work in haematology and for patients living with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a life-threatening disease. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation acknowledges the growing body of evidence that supports <i>Calquence</i> as a highly-selective Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the potential to offer patients a new, differentiated, chemotherapy-free treatment option with a favourable safety profile.”
The FDA granted the BTD based on positive results from the interim analyses of the <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2019/calquence-phase-iii-elevate-tn-trial-met-primary-endpoint-at-interim-analysis-in-previously-untreated-chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia06062019.html"">ELEVATE-TN</a> and <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2019/calquence-phase-iii-ascend-trial-met-primary-endpoint-at-interim-analysis-in-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia-and-will-stop-early-07052019.html"">ASCEND</a> Phase III clinical trials. Together the trials showed that <i>Calquence</i> alone or in combination significantly increased the time patients lived without disease progression or death, with safety and tolerability that was consistent with its established profile.
This is the 10th BTD that AstraZeneca has received from the FDA since 2014. An FDA BTD is designed to accelerate the development and regulatory review of new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and that have shown encouraging early clinical results which may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically-significant endpoint over currently-available medicines.
<i>Calquence</i> is currently approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the US, Brazil, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Argentina and recently Singapore and is being developed for the treatment of CLL and other blood cancers. The positive results from both the ELEVATE-TN and ASCEND trials will serve as the foundation for regulatory submissions later this year.
<b>About ELEVATE-TN</b>
ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) is a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of <a name=""_Hlk5899500""></a><i>Calquence</i> alone or in combination with obinutuzumab vs. chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in previously-untreated patients with CLL. In the trial, 535 patients were randomised (1:1:1) into three arms. Patients in the first arm received chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the second arm received <i>Calquence</i> (100mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the third arm received <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).<sup>2</sup>
The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) in the <i>Calquence</i> and obinutuzumab arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm, assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and a key secondary endpoint is IRC-assessed PFS in the <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm. Other secondary endpoints include objective response rate, time to next treatment and overall survival.<sup>2</sup>
<b>About ASCEND</b>
ASCEND (ACE-CL-309) is a global, randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of <i>Calquence</i>in previously-treated patients with CLL.<sup>2</sup> In the trial, 310 patients were randomised (1:1) into two arms. Patients in the first arm received <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). Patients in the second arm received physician’s choice of either rituximab in combination with idelalisib or rituximab in combination with bendamustine.<sup>3,4</sup>
The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by an IRC, and key secondary endpoints include physician-assessed PFS, IRC- and physician-assessed overall response rate and duration of response, as well as overall survival, patient-reported outcomes and time to next treatment.<sup>3,4</sup>
<b>About <i>Calquence</i></b>
<i>Calquence</i> (acalabrutinib) was granted accelerated approval by the US FDA in October 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
<i>Calquence</i> is an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). <i>Calquence</i> binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.<sup>5</sup>In beta (B) cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.
As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating <i>Calquence</i> in 26 company-sponsored clinical trials. <i>Calquence</i> is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma, and multiple myeloma and other haematologic malignancies. Several Phase III clinical trials in CLL are ongoing, including ASCEND, ELEVATE-TN, ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006) evaluating acalabrutinib vs. ibrutinib in patients with previously-treated high-risk CLL, and ACE-CL-311 evaluating acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax and with/without obinutuzumab in patients with previously-untreated CLL without 17p deletion or TP53 mutation.
<b>About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</b>
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is one of the most common type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 105,000 new cases globally and 20,720 new cases in the US annually, and prevalence that is expected to grow with improved treatment.<sup>1,6,7,8</sup> In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections.<sup>1</sup> As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.<sup>1</sup> This could result in anaemia, infection and bleeding.<sup>1</sup> B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.
<b>About AstraZeneca in haematology</b>
Leveraging its strength in oncology, AstraZeneca has established haematology as one of four key oncology disease areas of focus.

 	<li>Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M vaccine adjuvant enhances immune response of malaria antigen developed at Jenner Institute at Oxford University</li>
 	<li>Phase 2b clinical efficacy study of experimental malaria vaccine with Matrix-M nearing completion in Burkina Faso</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">GAITHERSBURG, Md., March 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, and Serum Institute of India (SII) today announced a commercial license agreement for the use of Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M™ vaccine adjuvant with SII’s malaria vaccine candidate. SII licensed the R21 malaria vaccine, which targets the most severe <em>plasmodium falciparum</em>-induced malaria disease, from the Jenner Institute at Oxford University in 2017. Matrix-M is a key component in the malaria vaccine candidate, currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial sponsored by the Jenner Institute, with top-line data expected to be reported in the second quarter of 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the terms of the agreement, SII is granted rights to use Matrix-M in the vaccine in regions where the disease is endemic and will pay Novavax royalties on its market sales of the vaccine. Matrix-M will be manufactured and supplied to SII by Novavax AB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novavax based in Uppsala, Sweden.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In addition, as part of the arrangement, Novavax has gained the rights to sell and distribute the SII-manufactured vaccine in high-income countries, primarily in the travelers and military vaccine markets.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, is leading the clinical studies of the experimental vaccine, which was created using the R21 malaria antigen combined with Matrix-M. He commented, “It has proven very challenging to develop a vaccine against malaria and many different approaches have been tested. After a thorough evaluation of several adjuvants pre-clinically many years ago, we selected Matrix-M for this program based on the strong immune responses elicited in those preclinical studies. Multiple clinical trials sponsored by the Jenner Institute have now confirmed these immunogenicity results. The current Phase 2b efficacy trial represents an important opportunity to test the efficacy of a malaria vaccine using the potent Matrix-M adjuvant in infants in an endemic setting.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Novavax’ next-generation adjuvant, Matrix-M, is an impressive and critical component in this much-needed malaria vaccine,” said Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer of Serum Institute of India. “This will be an important long-term partnership in advancing an innovative potential malaria vaccine and while we have much work to do, this marks a key step forward.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“As the world’s largest vaccine producer in terms of doses delivered, Serum Institute of India is the ideal partner to ensure that an improved malaria vaccine ultimately reaches the many millions of individuals at risk in areas where malaria is endemic,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novavax. “This agreement highlights our mutual confidence in Matrix-M’s ability to induce a strong immune response that will ultimately increase vaccine effectiveness.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Malaria</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by at least four different parasites that are found on certain types of mosquitos. <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>, the most severe of these parasites, causes the type of malaria that is most likely to result in severe infections and, if not promptly treated, can lead to death. There are approximately 2,000 annual cases of malaria diagnosed in the U.S.; the vast majority of which are in travelers and immigrants returning from endemic parts of the world where malaria transmission occurs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Globally, the World Health Organization estimated that in 2018, over 200 million clinical cases of malaria occurred, resulting in over 400,000 deaths, mostly children in Africa.<sup>1</sup> Globally, malaria is the one of the leading causes of death in children younger than age five years.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Matrix-M™</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Matrix-M™ is Novavax’ next-generation saponin-based adjuvant, powered by a novel formulation that provides a potent and well-tolerated adjuvant effect. Saponins are steroid or triterpenoid glycosides, which occur in many plant species. In Matrix-M, purified saponin fractions are mixed with synthetic cholesterol and a phospholipid to form stable particles than can be readily formulated with a variety of vaccine antigens. Saponin-based adjuvants act in part by stimulating the entry of antigen-presenting cells into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in the local lymph nodes. Matrix-M has the ability to stimulate cell-mediated immunity as well as to enhance antibody production; and importantly, when facing rapidly emerging diseases such as those caused by coronaviruses, Ebola virus or pandemic influenza, they can allow immune responses to be achieved with much lower doses of antigen, known as “dose-sparing.” Matrix-M also increases the opportunity for longer-lasting immunity, which may reduce the number of vaccinations needed to gain optimal protection.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Novavax’ past experience with saponin-based adjuvants in both animals and humans indicates that, like all adjuvants, they increase the local reaction at the injection site. However, those local reactions are transient and there is no evidence of longer-term adverse effects. Matrix-M has been evaluated in several Novavax vaccine candidates, including Novavax’ Phase 3 NanoFlu™ vaccine for influenza in older adults, and is expected to be included in Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which is expected to go into clinical trials in spring of 2020.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation acknowledges the significant unmet need of these patients and the potential benefit of selumetinib in this setting.”<br />Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, at MSD Research Laboratories, said: “This new designation validates our ongoing development of selumetinib. As a result of this, selumetinib has the potential to receive expedited regulatory review and we hope to bring this medicine to patients as soon as possible.”<br />The BTD is based on Phase II data from the SPRINT trial, testing selumetinib as an oral monotherapy in paediatric patients, aged three years or older with inoperable NF1-related PN. <a href=""https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/159508/abstract"" rel=""link-confirmation"">The results of the trial</a> were presented by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.<br />This is the ninth BTD that AstraZeneca has received from the FDA since 2014. BTD is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and that have shown encouraging early clinical results, which may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically-significant endpoint over available medicines.<br />Selumetinib was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NF1 by the US FDA in February 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in August 2018.<br />Selumetinib is a MEK 1/2 inhibitor and potential new medicine licensed by AstraZeneca from Array BioPharma Inc. in 2003. AstraZeneca and MSD entered a co-development and co-commercialisation agreement for selumetinib in 2017.<br />The <i>NF1</i> gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin, which negatively regulates the RAS/MAPK pathway, helping to control cell growth, differentiation and survival. Mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene may result in dysregulations in RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling, which can cause cells to grow, divide and copy themselves in an uncontrolled manner, and may result in tumour growth. Selumetinib inhibits the MEK enzyme in this pathway, potentially leading to inhibition of tumour growth.<br />Selumetinib is being assessed as a monotherapy and in combination with other treatments in ongoing trials.<br /><b>About SPRINT</b><br />The SPRINT trial is a US Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) NCI-sponsored Phase I/II trial. The Phase I trial was designed to identify the optimal Phase II dosing regimen, and the results were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.<sup>1</sup><br /><b>About NF1</b><br />Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an incurable genetic condition that affects one in 3,000 to 4,000 individuals.<sup>2,3</sup> It is caused by a spontaneous or inherited mutation in the <i>NF1</i> gene and is associated with many symptoms, including soft lumps on and under the skin (cutaneous neurofibromas), skin pigmentation (so-called ‘<i>cafe au lait’</i> spots) and, in 20-50% of patients, tumours develop on the nerve sheaths (plexiform neurofibromas). These plexiform neurofibromas can cause clinical issues such as pain, motor dysfunction, airway dysfunction, bowel/bladder dysfunction and disfigurement as well as having the potential to transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST).<br />People with NF1 may experience a number of complications such as learning difficulties, visual impairment, twisting and curvature of the spine, high blood pressure, and epilepsy. NF1 also increases a person’s risk of developing other cancers, including malignant brain tumours, MPNST and leukaemia. Symptoms begin during early childhood, with varying degrees of severity, and can reduce life expectancy by up to 15 years.<sup>4</sup><br /><b>About the AstraZeneca and MSD Strategic Oncology Collaboration</b><br />In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib), the world’s first PARP inhibitor and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza </i>and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.<br /><b>About AstraZeneca in Oncology</b><br />AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in Oncology and offers a quickly-growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With at least six new medicines to be launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, we are committed to advance New Oncology as one of AstraZeneca’s five Growth Platforms focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to our core capabilities, we actively pursue innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by our investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.<br />By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms - Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates - and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.<br /><b>About AstraZeneca</b><br />AstraZeneca is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas - Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal &amp; Metabolism and Respiratory.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 12, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved VENCLYXTO<sup>®</sup> (venetoclax) in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who were previously untreated. The approval is valid in all 27 member states of the EU, as well as <span class=""xn-location"">Iceland</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Liechtenstein</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Norway</span> and the <span class=""xn-location last-child"">United Kingdom</span>.
""This approval underscores the growing utility of VENCLYXTO in treating CLL and demonstrates its clinical benefit as a chemotherapy-free combination therapy option for CLL patients in <span class=""xn-location first-child"">Europe</span> who have not yet been treated,"" said <span class=""xn-person last-child"">Neil Gallagher</span>, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and vice president of development. ""We look forward to bringing VENCLYXTO to even more patients who can potentially benefit from achieving a deep response and sustained progression free survival, with the added benefit of a finite treatment duration.""
This is the third approval for VENCLYXTO, a first-in-class B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor. BCL-2 is a protein that prevents cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis, the process that leads to the natural death or self-destruction of cancer cells. VENCLYXTO is also approved in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy, and as a monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence or absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.
This most recent approval is based on results from the Phase 3 CLL14 clinical trial primary analysis (median follow up of 28 months), which demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS; the time on treatment without disease progression or death) as assessed by investigators in patients treated with VENCLYXTO plus obinutuzumab compared to patients who received a standard of care chemotherapy regimen of chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (hazard ratio 0.35; 95% CI (0.23,0.53), p&lt;0.0001, medians not yet reached). At an updated CLL14 efficacy analysis (median follow-up of 40 months), the median PFS  had not been reached in the VENCLYXTO + obinutuzumab arm and was 35.6 months [95% CI: 33.7,40.7] in the obinutuzumab + chlorambucil arm (hazard ratio 0.31; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.44). The 36-month PFS estimate in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab arm was 81.9% [95% CI: 76.5, 87.3] and in the obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil arm was 49.5% [95% CI: 42.4, 56.6]. Additionally, after completing one year of treatment, patients treated with the VENCLYXTO combination experienced deep response as measured by higher rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) or complete response (CR) as compared to patients receiving a standard of care regimen.<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1,5</sup>
In the trial, adverse events (AEs) were consistent with the known safety profiles of venetoclax and obinutuzumab alone. At least one AE of any grade occurred in 94.3% of patients in the venetoclax combination arm. The most common Grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia and infections. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) was reported in three patients in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab group (all during treatment with obinutuzumab and before venetoclax).<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1</sup>
""CLL is the most common of the nearly 95,000 new cases of leukemia in <span class=""xn-location first-child"">Europe</span> each year, and chemotherapy is often the first line of treatment,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Michael Hallek</span>, M.D., lead investigator of the CLL14 study, director of the Department of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology at the University Hospital Cologne in <span class=""xn-location last-child"">Germany</span>, and head of the German CLL Study Group. ""Having the option to utilize a first-line, chemotherapy-free treatment combination that can produce a deep response, thus allowing patients to stop treatment, will change the way we treat CLL and have a significant impact on patients.""
In January 2020, AbbVie announced that the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted a positive opinion for the Marketing Authorization Application for VENCLYXTO plus obinutuzumab for the treatment of patients with previously untreated CLL.
VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.
<b class=""first-child"">About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>CLL is a slow-growing form of leukemia, or blood cancer, in which too many immature lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are found predominantly in the blood and bone marrow. In 2018, approximately 95,000 new cases of leukemia were diagnosed in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>.<sup>2</sup> CLL is the most common form of leukemia in the Western Hemisphere, accounting for approximately one third of new leukemia diagnoses.<sup class=""last-child"">3,4</sup>
<b class=""first-child"">About the CLL14 Trial<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>The randomized, multicenter, open-label, actively controlled Phase 3 CLL14 trial, which was conducted in close collaboration with the German CLL Study Group (DCLLSG), evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combined regimen of VENCLYXTO and obinutuzumab (n=216) versus obinutuzumab and chlorambucil (n=216) in patients with previously-untreated CLL and coexisting medical conditions (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score &gt;6 or creatinine clearance &lt;70 mL/min). The therapies were administered for a fixed duration of 12 cycles for VENCLYXTO in combination with six cycles of obinutuzumab. Cycles were comprised of 28 days. The trial enrolled 432 patients, all of whom were diagnosed according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria and were previously untreated. The primary efficacy outcome was PFS as assessed by the investigator.<sup>1</sup><sup> </sup> Key secondary endpoints were MRD-negativity in peripheral blood and bone marrow, and overall and complete response rates.<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>
<b class=""first-child"">About VENCLYXTO<sup class=""first-child last-child"">®</sup> (venetoclax tablets)</b>
VENCLYXTO<sup class=""last-child"">®</sup> is a first-in-class medicine that selectively binds and inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other cancerous tumors, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from undergoing their natural death or self-destruction process, which is called apoptosis. VENCLYXTO targets the BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.
VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Together, the companies are committed to BCL-2 research and to studying venetoclax in clinical trials across several blood and other cancers.
VENCLYXTO is approved in more than 50 countries, including the U.S. AbbVie and Roche are currently working with regulatory agencies around the world to bring this medicine to additional eligible patients in need.
<b class=""first-child last-child"">VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) EU Indication and Summary of Important Safety Information<sup class=""first-child last-child"">5</sup></b>
<b class=""first-child last-child"">Indication<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li class=""first-child"">in the presence of 17p deletion or <i class=""first-child last-child"">TP53</i> mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or</li>
 	<li class=""last-child"">in the absence of 17p deletion or <i class=""first-child last-child"">TP53</i> mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.</li>
</ul>
<b class=""first-child last-child"">Contraindications<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is contraindicated.  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase due to increased risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Concomitant use of preparations containing St. John's wort as VENCLYXTO efficacy may be reduced.
<b class=""first-child last-child"">Special Warnings &amp; Precautions for Use<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal events, has occurred in patients with previously treated CLL with high tumour burden when treated with VENCLYXTO. VENCLYXTO poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week dose-titration phase. Changes in electrolytes consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLYXTO and at each dose increase. Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis for TLS. Blood chemistries should be monitored, and abnormalities managed promptly. More intensive measures (including IV hydration, frequent monitoring and hospitalization) should be employed as overall risk increases.
Neutropenia (grade 3 or 4) has been reported and complete blood counts should be monitored throughout the treatment period. Serious infections including events of sepsis with fatal outcome have been reported. Patients require monitoring of signs and symptoms of infection and prompt treatment. Supportive measures including antimicrobials for any signs of infection should be considered.
Live vaccines should not be administered during treatment or thereafter until B-cell recovery.
<b class=""first-child last-child"">Drug Interactions<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>CYP3A inhibitors may increase VENCLYXTO plasma concentrations. At initiation and dose-titration phase: Strong CYP3A inhibitors are contraindicated due to increased risk for TLS and moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be used, physicians should refer to the SmPC for dose adjustment recommendations. At steady daily dose: If moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors must be used, physicians should refer to the SmPC for dose adjustment recommendations.
CYP3A4 inducers may decrease VENCLYXTO plasma concentrations.
Avoid coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. These agents may decrease venetoclax plasma concentrations.
Co-administration of bile acid sequestrants with VENCLYXTO is not recommended as this may reduce the absorption of VENCLYXTO.
<b class=""first-child last-child"">Adverse Reactions<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (=20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax in the combination studies with obinutuzumab or rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract infection. In the monotherapy studies, the most common adverse reactions were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection.
The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (=2%) in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab were pneumonia, sepsis febrile neutropenia, and TLS. In the monotherapy studies, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (=2%) were pneumonia and febrile neutropenia.
Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients treated with venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab in the CLL14 and MURANO studies, respectively.  In the monotherapy studies with venetoclax, 11% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions.
Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab in the CLL14 study, in 15% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and rituximab in the MURANO study and 14% of patients treated with venetoclax in the monotherapy studies.
<b class=""first-child last-child"">Specific Populations<br class=""first-child last-child"" /></b>Patients with reduced renal function (CrCl &lt;80 mL/min) may require more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring to reduce the risk of TLS.  Safety in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min) or on dialysis has not been established, and a recommended dose for these patients has not been determined. VENCLYXTO should be administered to patients with severe renal impairment only if the benefit outweighs the risk and patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity due to increased risk of TLS.
For patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction of at least 50% throughout treatment is recommended.
VENCLYXTO may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment. Advise nursing women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment.

<span class=""xn-location"">CARLSBAD, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 12, 2020</span> /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Thermo Fisher Scientific announced today it has signed an agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, to co-develop a companion diagnostic (CDx) in oncology. The CDx will support clinical trial enrollment globally.
Under the agreement, Thermo Fisher Scientific will collaborate with Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC scientists to validate multiple biomarkers for use with <span class=""xn-person"">Thermo Fisher's</span> Oncomine Dx Target Test, which will be used to identify variant-positive patients for enrollment into clinical trials focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additional indications in oncology may follow as part of the agreement.
Oncomine Dx Target Test is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that contains 46 cancer-related biomarkers and a workflow that features a fast turnaround time and the lowest sample requirements on the market for detection of both DNA and RNA variants.
NGS is an established method of identifying gene variants at the center of several clinical trials or which are targeted by on-market and emerging therapies for cancer. Since its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017, Oncomine Dx Target Test has been the focus of multiple drug development and clinical trial support agreements between <span class=""xn-person"">Thermo Fisher</span> and international pharmaceutical companies.
""The ability of the Oncomine Dx Target Test to rapidly detect variants of interest from very small quantities of DNA or RNA samples makes this technology ideally suited to support development programs requiring an NGS-based workflow that delivers actionable insights consistently,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Peter Silvester</span>, senior vice president and president of Life Sciences Solutions at Thermo Fisher Scientific. ""We are confident that this approach to patient stratification helps expedite drug development initiatives which ultimately are designed to promote better health outcomes through targeted therapies.""

MZL is an indolent form of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (iNHL) and accounts for about 10% of all non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the U.S.<sup>1</sup><br />The Breakthrough Therapy Designation was granted based on data from the MZL subgroup of the pivotal Phase II CHRONOS-1 study, which is the trial that accelerated the U.S. FDA approval of Aliqopa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) – the most common histological subtype of iNHL – who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate (ORR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.<br />Aliqopa is an intravenous phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor with inhibitory activity predominantly against the PI3K-alpha and PI3K-delta isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. The compound is currently not approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or other authorities outside of the U.S.<br />""The clinical evidence suggests that Aliqopa may address an unmet medical need by providing physicians and MZL patients with a therapy in a relapsed setting,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Scott Z. Fields</span>, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development at Bayer's Pharmaceutical Division. ""We will continue working closely with the FDA in order to bring Aliqopa to these underserved patients as soon as possible.""<br />The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drug candidates that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapies.<sup>2</sup><br />Bayer is conducting two additional Phase III studies – CHRONOS-3 and CHRONOS-4 – to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aliqopa in combination with other therapies for those with iNHL (including MZL) who have relapsed following one or more prior therapies.  <br /><b>Clinical Evidence for Aliqopa in Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) </b>In the Phase II study 16439 part B (CHRONOS-1), Aliqopa showed preliminary efficacy in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL) patients including 23 patients with relapsed or refractory MZL, who have received at least two prior therapies. At the primary analysis, the overall response rate (ORR) of overall iNHL population (n=142) was 59.2%, while MZL patients was 69.6% (n=23).  An 18 month follow-up analysis of CHRONOS-1 showed an ORR in the full analysis set (FAS) population of 60.6% and in the MZL histology an ORR of 78.3% (n=23). The most common treatment emergent adverse events (experienced by greater than or equal to 20% of the MZL subgroup) were hyperglycemia and fatigue (47.8%), hypertension and diarrhea (43.5%), nausea (26.1%), pyrexia and cough (21.7%). The most common worst Grade 3 TEAEs were hypertension (39.1%) and hyperglycemia (34.8%).<br /><b>About MZL </b>MZL is an indolent form of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (iNHL) and accounts for about 10% of all non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the U.S.<sup>1</sup> Typically chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy are often chosen for the treatment of MZL. While initial therapies are often successful, there continues to be an unmet need for relapsed (advanced) MZL.<br /><b>About Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) Injection<sup>3 </sup></b>Aliqopa (copanlisib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.<br />Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.<br />Aliqopa is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K-a and PI3K-d isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. Aliqopa has been shown to induce tumor cell death by apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of primary malignant B cell lines. Aliqopa inhibits several key cell-signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor signaling, CXCR12 mediated chemotaxis of malignant B cells, and NF?B signaling in lymphoma cell lines.<br />The broad clinical development program for copanlisib also includes ongoing Phase III studies in indolent NHL (iNHL) patients who have relapsed or are refractory to prior therapies. The CHRONOS-3 Phase III study is evaluating copanlisib in combination with rituximab in relapsed iNHL and the CHRONOS-4 Phase III study is evaluating copanlisib in combination with standard immunochemotherapy in relapsed iNHL. More information about these trials can be found at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2479990-1&amp;h=1882961320&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2F&amp;a=www.clinicaltrials.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>.<br /><b>Important Safety Information for Aliqopa (copanlisib) Injection</b><br /><b>Infections</b>: Serious, including fatal, infections occurred in 19% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. The most common serious infection was pneumonia. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and withhold ALIQOPA for Grade 3 and higher infection.<br />Serious pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) infection occurred in 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Before initiating treatment with ALIQOPA, consider PJP prophylaxis for populations at risk.  Withhold ALIQOPA in patients with suspected PJP infection of any grade. If confirmed, treat infection until resolution, then resume ALIQOPA at previous dose with concomitant PJP prophylaxis.<br /><b>Hyperglycemia</b>: Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (blood glucose 250 mg/dL or greater) occurred in 41% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious hyperglycemic events occurred in 2.8% of patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels typically peaked 5 to 8 hours post-infusion and subsequently declined to baseline levels for a majority of patients; blood glucose levels remained elevated in 17.7% of patients one day after ALIQOPA infusion. Of 155 patients with baseline HbA1c &lt;5.7%, 16 (10%) patients had HbA1c &gt;6.5% at the end of treatment.<br />Of the twenty patients with diabetes mellitus treated in CHRONOS-1, seven developed Grade 4 hyperglycemia and two discontinued treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus should only be treated with ALIQOPA following adequate glucose control and should be monitored closely. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia.<br />Achieve optimal blood glucose control before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia.<br /><b>Hypertension</b>: Grade 3 hypertension (systolic 160 mmHg or greater or diastolic 100 mmHg or greater) occurred in 26% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious hypertensive events occurred in 0.9% of 317 patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hypertension. The mean change of systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 2 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 was 16.8 mmHg and 7.8 mmHg,
 respectively. The mean BP started decreasing approximately 2 hours post-infusion; BP remained elevated for 6 to 8 hours after the start of the ALIQOPA infusion. Optimal BP control should be achieved before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Monitor BP pre- and post-infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hypertension.<br /><b>Non-infectious Pneumonitis</b>: Non-infectious pneumonitis occurred in 5% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Withhold ALIQOPA and conduct a diagnostic examination of a patient who is experiencing pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exam. Patients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by ALIQOPA have been managed by withholding ALIQOPA and administration of systemic corticosteroids. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of non-infectious pneumonitis.<br /><b>Neutropenia</b>: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 24% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious neutropenic events occurred in 1.3%. Monitor blood counts at least weekly during treatment with ALIQOPA. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of neutropenia.<br /><b>Severe Cutaneous Reaction</b>: Grade 3 and 4 cutaneous reactions occurred in 2.8% and 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy respectively. Serious cutaneous reaction events were reported in 0.9%. The reported events included dermatitis exfoliative, exfoliative rash, pruritus, and rash (including maculo-papular rash). Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of severe cutaneous reactions.<br /><b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of copanlisib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rats at maternal doses as low as 0.75 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m2/day body surface area) corresponding to approximately 12% the recommended dose for patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.<br /><b>Adverse Drug Reactions</b>: Serious adverse reactions were reported in 44 (26%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were pneumonia (8%), pneumonitis (5%) and hyperglycemia (5%). Adverse reactions resulted in dose reduction in 36 (21%) and discontinuation in 27 (16%) patients. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (=20%) in ALIQOPA-treated patients were: hyperglycemia (54%), leukopenia (36%), diarrhea (36%), decreased general strength and energy (36%), hypertension (35%), neutropenia (32%), nausea (26%), thrombocytopenia (22%), and lower respiratory tract infections (21%).<br /><b>Drug Interactions</b>: Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers. Reduce the ALIQOPA dose to 45 mg when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors.<br /><b>Lactation</b>: Advise women not to breastfeed. Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIQOPA and for at least 1 month after the last dose.<br /><b>Please see the </b><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2479990-1&amp;h=1924596146&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Flabeling.bayerhealthcare.com%2Fhtml%2Fproducts%2Fpi%2FAliqopa_PI.pdf&amp;a=full+Prescribing+Information"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><b>full Prescribing Information</b></a><b> of Aliqopa (copanlisib) Injection.</b><br /><b>About Oncology at Bayer  </b>Bayer is committed to delivering science for a better life by advancing a portfolio of innovative treatments.

This is the third Breakthrough Therapy designation for the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination and is based on updated interim results from the Phase 1b trial KEYNOTE-524/Study 116. An earlier interim analysis was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2019. The first two Breakthrough Therapy designations for the combination were in advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced and/or metastatic non-microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) endometrial carcinoma, received in January 2018 and July 2018, respectively. The combination of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is investigational. The efficacy and safety of this combination has not been established. The KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination is not approved in any cancer types today.<br />“As part of our ongoing collaboration with Eisai, we are committed to evaluating the potential of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA across a number of different types of cancer,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, Vice President, Oncology Clinical Research, Merck Research Laboratories. “With this Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA, we look forward to working with Eisai to potentially build upon our existing indications for this difficult-to-treat cancer, so that we can help patients through a combination approach.”<br />“We are excited that the FDA has recognized the potential of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA in combination in advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to locoregional treatment with this Breakthrough Therapy designation,” said Dr. Takashi Owa, Vice President, Chief Medicine Creation and Chief Discovery Officer, Oncology Business Group at Eisai. “We are dedicated to working together with Merck to potentially bring another important option to patients.”<br />The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions and to qualify for this designation, preliminary clinical evidence must demonstrate that the therapy may provide substantial improvement over currently available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint.<br /><b>About KEYNOTE-524/Study 116</b><br />KEYNOTE-524/Study 116 is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously every three weeks) and LENVIMA (12 mg/day for patients weighing 60 kg or more, and 8 mg/day for patients weighing less than 60 kg) in patients with unresectable HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B (not eligible for transarterial chemoembolization [TACE]) or C, Child-Pugh class A, and ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. The primary endpoints are tolerability and safety, and the secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria. Tumor assessments of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were confirmed at least four weeks (or longer) after initial response. The first part of the trial evaluated tolerability by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of treatment in patients for whom no other appropriate therapy was available. After tolerability was confirmed, additional patients with no prior systemic therapy for unresectable HCC were enrolled in the expansion part of the trial, which is evaluating ORR and duration of response as measured by mRECIST and Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) based on independent imaging review (IIR).<br /><b>About Hepatocellular Carcinoma</b><br />The prevalence and mortality rate of liver cancer have been rising steadily over the past decade. In 2019, it is estimated there will be more than 42,000 new liver cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. (including intrahepatic bile duct cancer). Additionally, it is estimated there will be nearly 32,000 deaths from liver cancer in the U.S. Liver cancer — which is often diagnosed at an advanced stage — has one of the highest mortality rates of solid cancers, with a five-year survival rate of about 18%. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of these cases. The stage of disease at diagnosis largely determines the treatment approach, with potentially curative options, like resection or transplantation, only available for early-stage HCC. Unresectable HCC, a type of liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery, has a worse prognosis, with a median survival of less than one year. Unfortunately, approximately 70% of patients are diagnosed too late to be eligible for resection, ablation or transplantation, and there have been limited treatment options available for patients with unresectable disease.<br /><strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong><br />KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.<br />Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.<br /><strong>KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing</strong><br /><i>Melanoma</i><br />KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grade 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.<br />Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.<br /><b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b><br />KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.<br /><b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination with Axitinib)</b><br /><i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</i><br />KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.<br /><i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination with Axitinib</i><br />KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.<br /><b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b><br />KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%), receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.<br />Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.<br /><b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b><br />KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer co
rticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.<br /><b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b><br />Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.<br /><b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b><br />Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.<br />The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.<br />Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.<br /><b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b><br />KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.<br /><b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b><br />Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.<br />In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.<br /><b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b><br />In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.<br /><b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b><br />Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.<br /><b>Adverse Reactions</b><br />In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

 	<li><em>Currently, there are no targeted therapies approved to treat MET exon14 skipping-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a particularly aggressive form of the disease
</em></li>
 	<li><em>Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) now covers treatment-naïve and patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy

<strong>Basel, </strong><strong> </strong>""We are pleased to announce that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to capmatinib (INC280) as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic MET exon14 skipping-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis.
Recent research concludes that the cMET gene is an oncogenic driver[1],[2], and the investigational lung cancer therapy capmatinib has been shown to be a highly potent and selective MET inhibitor. The MET mutation is seen in an estimated 3% - 4% of all patients with NSCLC[3]. These patients are generally older and often have a poor prognosis that can limit lung cancer treatment options[4-6]. “As we continue to reimagine medicine and place a renewed focus on the development of innovative lung cancer treatments, we look forward to working with the FDA and global health authorities to bring capmatinib to patients who currently have no available targeted therapy options,” continued Dr. Tsai.
According to FDA guidelines, treatments that receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation must target a serious or life-threatening disease and demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more significant preliminary research endpoints. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for capmatinib based on positive primary results from the GEOMETRY mono-1 study presented at the 2019 meeting of American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Capmatinib (INC280) is an investigational, oral, highly potent and selective MET inhibitor licensed to Novartis by Incyte Corporation in 2009. Under the Agreement, Incyte granted Novartis worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for nemolizumab, an investigational drug under development by Galderma, for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis
Prurigo nodularis is a rare disease associated with skin nodules and severe pruritus
This is the eighth Breakthrough Therapy Designation received for five drug candidates created by Chugai
TOKYO, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for nemolizumab, an anti-interleukin-31 (IL-31) receptor A humanized monoclonal antibody created by Chugai, for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. The designation was received by Galderma, a global leader in skin health, with whom Chugai made a license agreement for the development and marketing of nemolizumab worldwide with the exception of Japan and Taiwan.
Prurigo nodularis is a chronic skin disease with thick skin nodules covering large body areas and associated severe pruritus. It is a rare disease and may affect daily life. 1, 2, 3) Galderma presented results from its Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of nemolizumab in prurigo nodularis at the 28th Annual Congress of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV 2019).
“Nemolizumab is a first-in-class investigational drug targeting IL-31 receptor A, and created by utilizing Chugai’s proprietary antibody engineering technology ACT-Ig. I am excited that this 8th BTD for five drug candidates from Chugai research was granted based on the Phase 2 clinical study that Galderma conducted,” said Dr. Hisafumi Okabe, Chugai’s Executive Vice President in charge of Research and Translational Research. “Patients’ quality of life can be severely affected by symptoms of prurigo nodularis, however, there are limited treatment options available for this disease. We expect a great deal from Galderma’s exceptional expertise in skin health to hopefully bring nemolizumab as a new treatment option to patients.”
Galderma is now preparing for the initiation of a Phase 3 pivotal program with nemolizumab in adult patients with prurigo nodularis in 2020. Please refer below for the Galderma’s press release regarding this BTD of nemolizumab:

<p align=""left"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGIO), a leader in the field of cellular metabolism to treat cancer and rare genetic diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup> (ivosidenib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. MDS is a group of bone marrow disorders that can cause severe complications, such as infections and uncontrolled bleeding, and can lead to the development of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).</p>
“There is a significant need for new targeted therapeutic approaches for individuals with MDS whose disease continues to progress despite treatment with standard of care,” said Chris Bowden, M.D., chief medical officer at Agios. “The Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on results from the initial 12 patients in the MDS arm of our Phase 1 study in advanced hematologic malignancies with an IDH1 mutation and recognizes the potential for single-agent treatment with TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup> to make an impact on these patients. We recently re-opened the MDS arm of this study with the goal of generating sufficient data to pursue a regulatory filing in this indication.”
The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is under investigation to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
Results from the MDS arm of the ongoing TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup> Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study in hematologic malignancies were presented at the 7<sup>th</sup>Society of Hematologic Oncology Annual Meeting, held September 11-14, 2019, in Houston, Texas. These demonstrate that TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup> administered as a monotherapy was well tolerated and associated with durable remissions as well as the achievement and maintenance of transfusion independence in patients with relapsed or refractory MDS with an IDH1 mutation. Among the 12 patients who received 500 mg of oral TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup>daily, the median treatment duration was 11.4 months. The median age was 72.5 years, and 42% of patients were age 75 or older. As of the November 2, 2018 data cut-off, 75% (9/12) of patients had a response and 42% (5/12) had a complete response (CR). The median duration of CR had not been reached (95% CI, 2.8 months, NE). Of the patients who had a CR, 60% remained relapse-free at 12 months. In addition, 9 (75%) patients were transfusion-independent for 56 days or longer during study treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) of any grade were back pain, diarrhea, fatigue and rash. Grade 2 IDH differentiation syndrome was observed in 1 of 12 patients. No AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of treatment.
<strong>TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup></strong><strong> Clinical Development in MDS</strong>
The MDS arm of the Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup> (ivosidenib) in adults with advanced hematologic malignancies with IDH1 mutations is assessing the clinical activity, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup> in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MDS with a susceptible IDH1 mutation. The arm was re-opened in October 2019 and will enroll up to 25 total patients with the goal of generating sufficient data to pursue a potential regulatory filing in this indication. Study recruitment is ongoing across 22 sites in the U.S. and France.
<strong>About Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)</strong>
MDS comprises a diverse group of bone marrow disorders in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature or become healthy blood cells. The National Cancer Institute estimates that more than 10,000 people are diagnosed with MDS in the U.S. each year. Failure of the bone marrow to produce mature healthy cells is a gradual process, and reduced blood cell and/or reduced platelet counts may be accompanied by the loss of the body’s ability to fight infections and control bleeding. For roughly 30 percent of the patients diagnosed with MDS, this bone marrow failure will progress to AML. Chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents and supportive blood products are used to treat MDS.
<em>TIBSOVO<sup>®</sup> is not approved in any country for the treatment of patients with MDS.</em>
<strong>About TIBSOVO<sup>® </sup>(ivosidenib)</strong>
TIBSOVO<strong><sup>®</sup></strong> (ivosidenib) is an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. For more information, visit TIBSOVO.com.
<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
<strong>WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME</strong>
<strong>Patients treated with TIBSOVO have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal if not treated. Symptoms may include fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, rapid weight gain or peripheral edema, hypotension, and hepatic, renal, or multi-organ dysfunction. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution.</strong>
<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>
<strong>Differentiation Syndrome: See Boxed WARNING. </strong>In the clinical trial, 19% (34/179) of patients with relapsed or refractory AML treated with TIBSOVO experienced differentiation syndrome. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal if not treated. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with TIBSOVO included noninfectious leukocytosis, peripheral edema, pyrexia, dyspnea, pleural effusion, hypotension, hypoxia, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, pericardial effusion, rash, fluid overload, tumor lysis syndrome, and creatinine increased. Of the 34 patients who experienced differentiation syndrome, 27 (79%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of TIBSOVO. Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 3 months after TIBSOVO initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis.
If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours (or an equivalent dose of an alternative oral or IV corticosteroid) and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement. If concomitant noninfectious leukocytosis is observed, initiate treatment with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis, as clinically indicated. Taper corticosteroids and hydroxyurea after resolution of symptoms and administer corticosteroids for a minimum of 3 days. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroid and/or hydroxyurea treatment. If severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids, interrupt TIBSOVO until signs and symptoms are no longer severe<em>.</em>
<strong>QTc Interval Prolongation:</strong> Patients treated with TIBSOVO can develop QT (QTc) prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. One patient developed ventricular fibrillation attributed to TIBSOVO. Concomitant use of TIBSOVO with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., anti-arrhythmic medicines, fluoroquinolones, triazole anti-fungals, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists) and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation. Conduct monitoring of electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes. In patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or in those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval, more frequent monitoring may be necessary.
Interrupt TIBSOVO if QTc increases to greater than 480 msec and less than 500 msec. Interrupt and reduce TIBSOVO if QTc increases to greater than 500 msec. Permanently discontinue TIBSOVO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs or symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia.
<strong>Guillain-Barré Syndrome:</strong> Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred in &lt;1% (2/258) of patients treated with TIBSOVO in the clinical study. Monitor patients taking TIBSOVO for onset of new signs or symptoms of motor and/or sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, paresthesias, or difficulty breathing. Permanently discontinue TIBSOVO in patients who are diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome.
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The most common adverse reactions (=20%) of any grade were fatigue (39%), leukocytosis (38%), arthralgia (36%), diarrhea (34%), dyspnea (33%), edema (32%), nausea (31%), mucositis (28%), electrocardiogram QT prolonged (26%), rash (26%), pyrexia (23%), cough (22%), and constipation (20%).</li>
 	<li>The most frequently reported =Grade 3 adverse reactions (=5%) were electrocardiogram QT prolonged (10%), dyspnea (9%), leukocytosis (8%), tumor lysis syndrome (6%), and differentiation syndrome (5%).</li>
 	<li>Serious adverse reactions (=5%) were differentiation syndrome (10%), leukocytosis (10%), and electrocardiogram QT prolonged (7%). There was one case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).</li>
</ul>
<strong>DRUG INTERACTIONS</strong>
<strong>Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors:</strong> Reduce TIBSOVO dose with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Monitor patients for increased risk of QTc interval prolongation.
<strong>Strong CYP3A4 Inducers:</strong> Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO.
<strong>Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates:</strong> Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO.
<strong>QTc Prolonging Drugs:</strong> Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO. If co-administration is unavoidable, monitor patients for increased risk of QTc interval prolongation.
<strong>LACTATION</strong>
Many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TIBSOVO and for at least 1 month after the last dose.

<b>AbCellera and Lilly will select from 500+ unique antibodies isolated from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19 to create antibody therapeutics for treatment and prevention of COVID-19</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
VANCOUVER, British Columbia and INDIANAPOLIS,  AbCellera and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today they have entered into an agreement to co-develop antibody products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus. The collaboration will leverage AbCellera's rapid pandemic response platform, developed under the DARPA Pandemic Prevention Platform (P3) Program, and Lilly's global capabilities for rapid development, manufacturing and distribution of therapeutic antibodies.
Within one week of receiving a blood sample from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19, AbCellera screened over 5 million immune cells looking for ones that produced functional antibodies that helped the patient neutralize the virus and recover from the disease. From this effort, AbCellera has identified over 500 unique fully human antibody sequences, the largest panel of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ever reported. The next step is to screen these antibodies to find the ones most effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. Many of these antibodies will be expressed in collaboration with partners at the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and pending agreement with NIAID will be tested for their ability to neutralize the virus.
""AbCellera's platform has delivered, with unprecedented speed, by far the world's largest panel of anti-SAR-CoV-2 antibodies,"" said Carl Hansen, Ph.D., CEO of AbCellera. ""In 11 days, we've discovered hundreds of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the current outbreak, moved into functional testing with global experts in virology, and signed a co-development agreement with one of the world's leading biopharmaceutical companies. We're deeply impressed with the speed and agility of Lilly's response to this global challenge. Together, our teams are committed to delivering a countermeasure to stop the outbreak.""
""With the number of cases rapidly increasing all over the world, doctors and patients are seeking a therapeutic intervention that can speed their recovery or prevent the disease. Lilly is committed to playing our part to bring innovation to patients amidst this global outbreak,"" said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. ""We've partnered with AbCellera because we're impressed with the speed and quality of their efforts. We are moving at top speed to create a potential treatment to help patients. While typically a new therapeutic antibody program might take years to get in the clinic, our goal with AbCellera is to be testing potential new therapies in patients within the next four months.""
Under the terms of the agreement, AbCellera and Lilly have committed to equally share initial development costs towards a product, after which Lilly will be responsible for all further development, manufacturing and distribution. If successful, Lilly is ready to work with global regulators to bring a treatment to patients.

<strong> </strong>
Basel, 13 March 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test. It is intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples from patients who meet COVID-19 clinical and/or epidemiological criteria for testing. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s fully automated cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems, which are widely available in the U.S. and around the world.
The CE-IVD test is also available in markets accepting the CE mark for patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 disease and living in affected areas where the SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to be present.
""Providing quality, high-volume testing capabilities will allow us to respond effectively to what the World Health Organization has characterized as a pandemic.  It is important to quickly and reliably detect whether a patient is infected with SARS-CoV-2,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “Over the last weeks, our emergency response teams have been working hard to bring this test to the patients. CE-mark certification and the FDA’s granting of EUA supports our commitment to give more patients access to reliable diagnostics which are crucial to combat this serious disease.”
The widely available Roche’s cobas 6800/8800 Systems, which are used to perform the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test, provide test results in three and half hours and offer improved operating efficiency, flexibility, and fastest time-to-results with the highest throughput providing up to 96 results in about three hours and a total of 1,440 results for the cobas 6800 System and 4,128 results for the cobas 8800 System in 24 hours. The test can be run simultaneously with other assays provided by Roche for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems.
Upon authorisation Roche will have millions of tests a month available for use on the cobas 6800 and 8800 systems. Roche is committed to delivering as many tests as possible and is going to the limits of our production capacity.
<strong>About Emergency Use Authorization Status
</strong>The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test has not been FDA cleared or approved. It has been authorized by the FDA under an EUA for use by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. § 263a, to perform moderate and high complexity tests. The test has been authorised only for the detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virus and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, not for any other viruses or pathogens. It is only authorised for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorisation of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb- 3(b)(1), unless the authorisation is terminated or revoked sooner<strong>
About SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus)</strong>
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has not previously been identified in humans.<sup>1</sup>
Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and fever. In more severe cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death can occur.
To control the spread of the infection, WHO recommends regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness.
<strong>About cobas SARS-CoV-2 Assay</strong>
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test is a single-well dual target assay, which includes both specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 and pan-sarbecovirus detection for the sarbecovirus subgenus family that includes SARS-CoV-2. The test is a real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acids from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples from patients who meet the CDC SARS-CoV-2 clinical criteria.The test runs on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems and has a full-process negative control, positive control and internal control.
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.
The cobas SARS-CoV-2 is intended for use by trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of real-time PCR and in vitro diagnostic procedures. In the United States, the cobas SARS-CoV-2 is only for use under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization.
<strong>About the cobas 6800/8800 Systems</strong>
Since 2014, the cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 Systems have established the new standard for routine molecular testing by delivering fully integrated, automated solutions that serve the areas of viral load monitoring, donor screening, sexual health and microbiology. Based on Nobel prize-winning PCR technology, the systems deliver proven performance with full automation, increased throughput, fast turnaround time and complete track connectivity validated for molecular testing, providing users with greater flexibility to consolidate their IVD and LDT testing to a single system while increasing overall workflow efficiencies.

MADISON, Wis.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Usona Institute has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for psilocybin in the treatment<b> </b>of major depressive disorder (MDD). Breakthrough Therapy Designation establishes FDA’s organizational<b> </b>commitment to promoting an efficient development program for psilocybin in MDD.
<blockquote>

The designation of psilocybin as a Breakthrough Therapy for MDD acknowledges both the unmet medical need in this broad population and the potential for significant improvements over existing therapies, and bolsters Usona’s mission to advance this revolutionary treatment paradigm toward new drug approval.
“The results from previous studies clearly demonstrate the remarkable potential for psilocybin as a treatment in MDD patients, which Usona is now seeking to confirm in its own clinical trials. What is truly groundbreaking is FDA’s rightful acknowledgement that MDD, not just the much smaller treatment-resistant depression population, represents an unmet medical need and that the available data suggest that psilocybin may offer a substantial clinical improvement over existing therapies,” says Charles Raison, MD, Director of Clinical and Translational Research at Usona. “Given that there is so much complexity with psilocybin and that Usona is charting new ground, these interactions will ensure that Usona and the FDA are aligned in approaching the development program with acceptable best practices.”
The new status follows the recent launch of Usona’s Phase 2 clinical trial, PSIL201, which will include approximately 80 participants at seven study sites around the US. Two<b> </b>of the seven study sites are currently recruiting, with the others expected to be active by the first quarter of 2020.
<span class=""bwuline"">Significance for Patients Suffering from MDD</span>
This is a significant milestone for the over 17 million people in the US who suffer from MDD. Although there are several existing MDD treatments, Breakthrough Therapy Designation recognizes that psilocybin may offer a clinically significant improvement over these therapies. Psilocybin potentially offers a novel paradigm in which a short-acting compound imparts profound alterations in consciousness and could enable long-term remission of depressive symptoms.
Depression is the world’s leading cause of disability, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. With such a broad potential impact, this designation represents a major step forward in mental health research and for patients suffering from depression.

<h3><b><i>The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of progression- free survival vs. platinum-based chemotherapy
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced high-level results from the Phase III GY004 trial, led by NRG Oncology and sponsored by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), that examined primarily the efficacy and safety of the potential new medicine cediranib added to <i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide.
The trial did not meet the primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with cediranib added to <i>Lynparza</i> versus platinum-based chemotherapy. Cediranib is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor, which blocks the growth of blood vessels supporting tumour growth.
Jose´ Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “Despite these disappointing results, we remain committed to expanding on the benefits already demonstrated with <i>Lynparza</i> for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We will work closely with NRG Oncology and the NCI to review the full results to inform our ongoing research.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Ovarian cancer is one of the most difficult tumours to diagnose and treat early. AstraZeneca, MSD and our partners will continue to explore ways to help patients through our joint clinical trial development programme.”
The safety and tolerability profiles observed in GY004 were generally consistent with those known for each medicine.
The NCI and NRG Oncology will present the full data at a forthcoming medical meeting.
<b>Ovarian cancer</b>
Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide.<sup>1</sup> In 2018, there were nearly 300,000 new cases diagnosed<sup>2 </sup>and around 185,000 deaths.<sup>1</sup> Most women are diagnosed with advanced (Stage III or IV) ovarian cancer and have a five-year survival rate of approximately 30%.<sup>3</sup> The primary aim of treatment in relapsed ovarian cancer is to delay progression of the disease for as long as possible, therefore increasing the time to re-initiation of chemotherapy with its associated toxicities, and maintaining quality of life for these patients.<sup>4,5,6</sup>
<b>GY004</b>
GY004 is an open-label, randomised, multicentre, Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of the potential new medicine cediranib added to <i>Lynparza</i>, versus <i>Lynparza</i> monotherapy versus standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer patients, with or without a BRCA mutation.
The GY004 trial is led by NRG Oncology, a non-profit research organisation funded by the NCI, in collaboration with AstraZeneca. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. AstraZeneca provided both cediranib and <i>Lynparza</i> to support the trial through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI.
<i><b>Lynparza</b></i>
<i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with <i>Lynparza</i> leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. <i>Lynparza</i> is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.
<i>Lynparza</i> is currently approved in 73 countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in 58 countries, including the US and Japan, for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. In 2019, <i>Lynparza </i>was additionally approved<i> </i>in the US for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in other jurisdictions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.
<i>Lynparza</i>, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, is approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. It has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide.<i> Lynparza</i> has the broadest and most advanced clinical-trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. <i>Lynparza</i> is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
<b>Cediranib</b>
Cediranib is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination in various cancers. Cediranib has shown anti-tumour activity in many cancers, including ovarian, breast, colorectal, renal, lung, sarcoma and glioblastoma. Cediranib is being evaluated in combination with <i>Lynparza</i> in advanced ovarian cancer in the Phase II CONCERTO trial, Phase II/III GY005 trial (sponsored by the NCI) and Phase III ICON9 trial (sponsored by University College, London).
<b>The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration</b>
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i>, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

<b>-- FDA Fast Track designation is for the investigation of potential new therapies that treat serious conditions and fulfill an unmet medical need</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, March 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for the investigation of Jardiance<sup>® </sup>(empagliflozin) to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular death in adults with chronic kidney disease, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced. This Fast Track designation for Jardiance underscores the urgent need for additional treatment options for the over 30 million Americans living with chronic kidney disease, many of whom are at risk of progressing to end-stage kidney disease.
""Chronic kidney disease can have a devastating impact on people's lives. Not only does it cause damage to the kidneys that can eventually lead to the need for dialysis or transplant, but it could also increase the risk of cardiovascular death,"" said Mohamed Eid, M.D., M.P.H., M.H.A, vice president, Clinical Development &amp; Medical Affairs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ""Chronic kidney disease is a common and deadly condition, and there are still only limited treatment options, which is what motivates us to explore the potential role Jardiance may play in improving outcomes.""
Chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of premature death from cardiovascular causes and is the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. About two-thirds of cases are attributed to metabolic conditions such as diabetes (known as diabetic kidney disease), hypertension and obesity.
""We recognize the close link between the health of the heart, kidneys and metabolic system, and we have committed to a broad clinical development program assessing the cardiorenal metabolic benefits of Jardiance,"" said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly. ""The Fast Track designation from the FDA is an important step in evaluating the potential of Jardiance to enhance care for those with chronic kidney disease.""
The ongoing EMPA-KIDNEY clinical study is evaluating the effect of Jardiance on the progression of kidney disease and the occurrence of cardiovascular death in adults with established chronic kidney disease with and without diabetes. The EMPA-KIDNEY study was initiated based on promising exploratory results from the landmark EMPA-REG OUTCOME<sup>®</sup> trial, which found that treatment with Jardiance reduced the risk of new-onset and worsening kidney disease by 39 percent in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease compared with placebo.
EMPA-KIDNEY is being independently conducted, analyzed and reported by the Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit at the University of Oxford (MRC PHRU), which is based in the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU), in partnership with the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are providing the funding for the study.
Jardiance is a once-daily tablet used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and known cardiovascular disease. Jardiance is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).
In June 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the clinical investigation of Jardiance to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in people with chronic heart failure.
<b>About EMPA-KIDNEY [<a title=""Please note: If you click this link, you will leave this Lilly website."" href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2747420-1&amp;h=4000155223&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03594110&amp;a=NCT03594110"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener tooltip noreferrer"">NCT03594110</a>]</b>
EMPA-KIDNEY is a multinational randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is designed to evaluate the effect of Jardiance on kidney disease progression and cardiovascular mortality risk. The primary outcome is defined as time to a first event of either cardiovascular death or kidney disease progression, defined as end-stage kidney disease (the need for kidney replacement therapy such as dialysis or kidney transplantation), a sustained decline in eGFR to &lt;10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, renal death, or a sustained decline of =40% in eGFR from randomization. EMPA-KIDNEY includes adults with established chronic kidney disease both with and without diabetes.
The study is a global trial aiming to randomize about 6,000 participants to receive either Jardiance 10 mg once daily or placebo, each on top of standard of care.
<b>About Chronic Kidney Disease</b><b>
</b>Chronic kidney disease is defined as a progressive decline of kidney function over time. About two-thirds of chronic kidney disease cases are attributable to metabolic diseases such as diabetes (known as diabetic kidney disease), hypertension and obesity. Notably, chronic kidney disease is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The majority of deaths among people with chronic kidney disease occur as a result of cardiovascular complications, often before reaching end stage renal disease. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 15 percent of adults in the United States and treatment costs are estimated to exceed $48 billion annually. Since there are currently only few treatment options, the overarching unmet medical need for additional treatment options in chronic kidney disease is evident.
<b>About Cardiorenal Metabolic Conditions
</b>Cardiorenal metabolic conditions are a group of interconnected disorders affecting the heart, kidneys and endocrine system. In aggregate, these conditions are the leading cause of deaths worldwide, accounting for up to 20 million deaths annually. Conditions within this group include coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, among many others.
Emerging science on the link between the cardiorenal and metabolic systems supports taking a multidisciplinary approach toward diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies for people living with these conditions. We remain committed to developing treatments with broad cardiorenal metabolic effects, which may help improve outcomes for people with serious chronic conditions such as these.

There has been limited innovation for patients with locally advanced SCCHN over the past 10 years.<sup>1</sup> Despite aggressive standard-of-care treatment with high-dose chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy, LA SCCHN will ultimately recur in a large proportion of patients.<sup>2</sup> In recognition of the unmet need for additional treatment options that can prevent recurrence or metastatic disease,<sup>3 </sup>the alliance initiated the JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 trial, which is the first Phase III study to report topline results for an immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination with CRT in LA SCCHN.
<b>About JAVELIN Head and Neck 100
</b>JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 (NCT02952586) is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study investigating treatment with avelumab plus standard-of-care CRT followed by avelumab maintenance versus CRT alone in patients with previously untreated LA SCCHN. A total of 697 patients who had not received prior therapy for locally advanced SCCHN and were eligible for CRT with curative intent were randomly assigned to receive avelumab plus CRT or CRT alone. The primary endpoint was PFS per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), time to locoregional failure, time to distant metastatic failure, overall response, duration of response and pathologic complete response.
<b>About Head and Neck Cancer
</b>Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide.<sup>4</sup> In 2016, there were nearly 150,000 newly diagnosed cases in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>.<sup>4</sup> Approximately 60% of people are diagnosed with head and neck cancer when their disease has already progressed to the locally advanced stage (Stage III-IVB).<sup>5</sup> At this stage, the cancer has spread from its site of origin to local lymph nodes, but not another part of the body.<sup>6</sup> Standard of care for these patients includes high-dose chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy.<sup>7</sup>
<b>About </b><b>BAVENCIO</b><b><sup>® </sup></b><b>(avelumab)
</b>BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.<sup>8-10 </sup>In <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2014</span>, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.
<b>BAVENCIO Approved Indications
</b>BAVENCIO<sup>®</sup> (avelumab) in combination with axitinib is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
In the US, the FDA granted accelerated approval for BAVENCIO for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in 50 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.
<b>BAVENCIO Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label
</b>BAVENCIO can cause <b>immune-mediated pneumonitis</b>, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis, and evaluate suspected cases with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis occurred in 1.2% of patients, including one (0.1%) patient with Grade 5, one (0.1%) with Grade 4, and five (0.3%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause <b>hepatotoxicity and immune-mediated hepatitis</b>, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) immune-mediated hepatitis until resolution and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred with BAVENCIO as a single agent in 0.9% of patients, including two (0.1%) patients with Grade 5, and 11 (0.6%) with Grade 3.
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib </i>can cause <b>hepatotoxicity </b>with higher than expected frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used as monotherapy. Withhold BAVENCIO and axitinib for moderate (Grade 2) hepatotoxicity and permanently discontinue the combination for severe or life-threatening (Grade 3 or 4) hepatotoxicity. Administer corticosteroids as needed. In patients treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST occurred in 9% and 7% of patients, respectively, and immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% of patients, including 4.9% with Grade 3 or 4.</p>
BAVENCIO can cause <b>immune-mediated colitis</b>. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold BAVENCIO until resolution for moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) colitis until resolution. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening (Grade 4) or recurrent (Grade 3) colitis upon reinitiation of BAVENCIO. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.5% of patients, including seven (0.4%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause <b>immune-mediated endocrinopathies</b>, including adrenal insufficiency, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40"">Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of <b>adrenal insufficiency </b>during and after treatment, and administer corticosteroids as appropriate. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency was reported in 0.5% of patients, including one (0.1%) with Grade 3.</p>
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><b>Thyroid disorders </b>can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Manage hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy and hyperthyroidism with medical management. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) thyroid disorders. Thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, were reported in 6% of patients, including three (0.2%) with Grade 3.</p>
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><b>Type 1 diabetes mellitus </b>including diabetic ketoacidosis: Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Withhold BAVENCIO and administer antihyperglycemics or insulin in patients with severe or life-threatening (Grade =3) hyperglycemia, and resume treatment when metabolic control is achieved. Type 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative etiology occurred in 0.1% of patients, including two cases of Grade 3 hyperglycemia.</p>
BAVENCIO can cause <b>immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction</b>. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) nephritis until resolution to Grade 1 or lower. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.1% of patients.
BAVENCIO can result in <b>other severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions </b>involving any organ system during treatment or after treatment discontinuation. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate to confirm or rule out an immune-mediated adverse reaction and to exclude other causes. Depending on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and initiate hormone replacement therapy, if appropriate. Resume BAVENCIO when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or lower following a corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for any severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 1738 patients treated with BAVENCIO as a single agent or in 489 patients who received <i>BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib</i>: myocarditis including fatal cases, pancreatitis including fatal cases, myositis, psoriasis, arthritis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, hypopituitarism, uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and systemic inflammatory response.
BAVENCIO can cause severe or life-threatening <b>infusion-related reactions</b>. Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to the first 4 infusions and for subsequent infusions based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25% of patients, including three (0.2%) patients with Grade 4 and nine (0.5%) with Grade 3.
<i>BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib</i> can cause <b>major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) </b>including severe and fatal events. Consider baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular events. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue BAVENCIO and axitinib for Grade 3-4 cardiovascular events. MACE occurred in 7% of patients with advanced RCC treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib compared to 3.4% treated with sunitinib. These events included death due to cardiac events (1.4%), Grade 3-4 myocardial infarction (2.8%), and Grade 3-4 congestive heart failure (1.8%).
BAVENCIO can cause <b>fetal harm </b>when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus including the risk of fetal death. Advise females of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BAVENCIO and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO. It is not known whether BAVENCIO is excreted in human milk. Advise a lactating woman <b>not to breastfeed </b>during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

<p align=""left""><em>-The clinical study will explore the potential of TJM2, a proprietary mAb against GM-CSF, to fight ""cytokine storm” during severe COVID-19 disease</em></p>
<em>-The study to be conducted initially in the United States with planned expansion of study into other countries</em>
SHANGHAI, China and ROCKVILLE, MD., March 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- I-Mab Biopharma (Nasdaq: IMAB), (“I-Mab” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel or highly differentiated biologics to treat diseases with significant unmet medical needs, particularly cancers and autoimmune disorders, today announced that it is initiating the development of TJM2 (TJ003234) to treat cytokine storm in severe and critically ill patients caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). TJM2 is an I-Mab-discovered neutralizing antibody against human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an important cytokine that plays a critical role in acute and chronic inflammation.
The development will start following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) acceptance of I-Mab’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and the study will commence initially in the United States with plans to expand into other hardest-hit countries.
Cytokine storm is characterized by surge of high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines, and is an overreaction of the immune system under the conditions, such as CAR-T therapy <sup>[1]</sup> and patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies revealed that high levels of GM-CSF, along with a few other cytokines, are critically associated with severe clinical complications in COVID-19 patients. High concentration of GM-CSF was found in the plasma of severe and critically ill patients <sup>[2]</sup>, which account for approximately 20% of all patients <sup>[3]</sup>, especially in those requiring intensive care.
“Research data provide the rationale to use TJM2 as a potential treatment for cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, because the antibody effectively neutralizes circulating GM-CSF to control acute inflammatory responses, and it may also exhibit potential advantages over conventional IL-6 antibodies <sup>[4]</sup>, ” said Dr. Joan Shen, CEO of I-Mab. “This expanded IND application of TJM2 would allow us to act timely to help battle the global COVID-19 pandemic.”
The Company has successfully completed a Phase I single ascending dose (SAD) study of TJM2 in the United States (NCT03794180), in which TJM2 has exhibited favorable safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and immunogenicity profiles. TJM2 also received IND clearance from China’s National Medical Products Administration for a multiple-dose Phase 1b study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results from the planned COVID-19 study will also be used to further evaluate the potential therapeutic role of TJM2 in reducing or preventing cytokine storm and neurotoxicity associated with CAR-T therapy.
According to the WHO, as of March 12, 2020, there were 125,048 confirmed cases and 4,613 deaths of COVID-19 globally.

<strong>About TJM2</strong>
TJM2 is an internally discovered neutralizing antibody against human GM-CSF, an important cytokine that plays a critical role in chronic inflammation and destruction in autoimmune diseases such as RA. GM-CSF can polarize macrophages into the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and is known to induce an inflammatory cascade involving other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23. It is evident that GM-CSF plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and disease progression of multiple autoimmune conditions.
TJM2 specifically binds to human GM-CSF with high affinity and can block GM-CSF from binding to its receptor, thereby preventing downstream signaling and target cell activation. As a result, it can effectively inhibit inflammatory responses mediated by macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, leading to reduced tissue inflammation and damage.
TJM2 is expected to be the first antibody of its class to enter clinic trials in China in 2020.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., March 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced that its Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies have entered a collaboration with the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) to support the development of a preventive vaccine candidate for COVID-19. The parties have commenced preclinical testing of multiple vaccine prospects, with the aim to identify by the end of the month a COVID-19 vaccine candidate for clinical trials.
Janssen is optimistic that, in collaboration with multiple global strategic partners, it can initiate a Phase 1 clinical study of a potential vaccine candidate by the end of the year. In parallel to these efforts, Janssen is preparing to upscale production and manufacturing capacities to levels required to meet global public health vaccination needs.
“It is critical to work with the best scientific minds as we look to rapidly identify and develop solutions to the COVID-19 outbreak,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “We are grateful for talented and experienced collaboration partners like Dan Barouch and his team at BIDMC. By mobilizing our collective resources, we believe we can leverage the top science and cutting-edge capabilities to respond to this pandemic.”
Janssen’s vaccine program will use the Janssen AdVac® and PER.C6® technologies that provide the ability to rapidly upscale production of an optimal vaccine candidate. The company is leveraging its proven vaccine technology that it is also using to develop its investigational Ebola (which also utilizes its MVA-BN® technology), Zika, RSV and HIV vaccines. Research and collaboration on preclinical work for our Zika and HIV vaccine candidates at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center was foundational to developing these vaccines.
Dan Barouch, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at BIDMC and the Ragon Institute, stated, “We are currently evaluating a series of potential vaccine candidates for COVID-19. This collaboration with Janssen is aimed at the development of a COVID-19 vaccine that would allow for rapid development, large-scale manufacturing, and global delivery.”
Dr. Barouch’s team is well-known for their work on the pathogenesis and immunology of viral infections and the development of vaccine strategies for global infectious diseases.
Johnson & Johnson’s efforts to expedite development and production of a vaccine are enhanced by the existing COVID-19 vaccine collaborations between Janssen and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
In addition to Janssen’s efforts to develop a vaccine candidate, the Company is working closely with global strategic partners to screen its library of antiviral molecules to accelerate the discovery of potential COVID-19 treatments and provide relief for people around the world.

<b>Recognition reinforces baricitinib's potential to be the first FDA-approved medicine for individuals living with alopecia areata</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
INDIANAPOLIS, March 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to baricitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata (AA), an autoimmune disorder that can cause unpredictable hair loss on the scalp, face and other areas of the body. The Breakthrough Therapy designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over already available therapies on a clinically significant endpoint(s).
""Patients with AA currently do not have any FDA-approved treatment options available to them,"" said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. ""AA not only causes hair loss but also may be a psychosocial burden for people living with this disease. At Lilly, we aspire to create new medicines that can give hope to patients. We look forward to working with the FDA to further explore baricitinib's potential to become the first approved treatment option for these individuals.""
The FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on the positive Phase 2 results of Lilly's adaptive Phase 2/3 study BRAVE-AA1, which evaluated treatment with baricitinib versus placebo in adult patients with AA. In the Phase 2 portion of the BRAVE-AA1 study up to Week 36, there were no new safety signals with no serious adverse events reported. The reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate and the most common included upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis and acne.
Based on the interim results of the Phase 2 part of the study, the Phase 3 portion of BRAVE-AA1 and an additional Phase 3 double-blind study (BRAVE-AA2), are currently assessing the efficacy and safety of the 2-mg and 4-mg doses of baricitinib relative to placebo.
""There are millions of people around the world affected by and living with AA,"" said Dory Kranz, president and CEO of the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. ""We're encouraged by baricitinib's potential to be one of the first FDA-approved medicines to treat AA.""
Baricitinib is currently approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). More than 100,000 patients have experience using baricitinib, which is approved in over 65 countries including the U.S., member states of the EU and Japan. It is marketed as OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup>.
<b>Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
</b>OLUMIANT<sup>®</sup> (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS</b><b> </b>
<b>WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS</b>
<b><i>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</i>: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.</b>
<b>Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.</b>
<b><i>MALIGNANCIES</i>: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.</b>
<b><i>THROMBOSIS</i>: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.</b>
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: </b>The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>with chronic or recurrent infection</li>
 	<li>who have been exposed to TB</li>
 	<li>with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection</li>
 	<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or</li>
 	<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>
</ul>
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.
<b>Tuberculosis </b>– Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.
<b>Viral Reactivation</b> – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.
The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.
<b>MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS:</b> Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
<b>THROMBOSIS</b><b>:</b> Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.
<b>GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: </b>Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.
<b>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:</b>
<b><i>Neutropenia</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC &lt;1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Lymphopenia</i></b> – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Anemia</i></b> – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to &lt;8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
<b><i>Liver Enzyme Elevations</i></b> – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to =5x and =10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.
Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.
<b><i>Lipid Elevations</i></b> – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.
<b>VACCINATIONS:</b> Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</b>Adverse reactions (=1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.
<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</b>
<b>PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: </b>No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.
<b>HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: </b>Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

<span class=""xn-location"">CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">TARRYTOWN, N.Y.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 16, 2020</span> /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc today announced they have started a clinical program evaluating Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway by binding and blocking the IL-6 receptor. IL-6 may play a role in driving the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19 infection. The role of IL-6 is supported by preliminary data from a <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2752647-1&amp;h=1048431951&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chinaxiv.org%2Fabs%2F202003.00026&amp;a=single-arm+study+in+China"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">single-arm study in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span></a> using another IL-6 receptor antibody.
This U.S.-based trial will begin at medical centers in <span class=""xn-location"">New York</span>, one of the epicenters of the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak, and will assess the safety and efficacy of adding Kevzara to usual supportive care, compared to supportive care plus placebo. The multi-center, double-blind, Phase 2/3 trial has an adaptive design with two parts and is anticipated to enroll up to 400 patients. The first part will recruit patients with severe COVID-19 infection across approximately 16 U.S. sites, and will evaluate the impact of Kevzara on fever and patients' need for supplemental oxygen. The second, larger part of the trial will evaluate the improvement in longer-term outcomes including preventing death and reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen and/or hospitalization.
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>""At Sanofi, we are taking a leading role in addressing the global challenge of COVID-19 disease.  We believe that there is scientific evidence to suggest that Kevzara may be a potentially important treatment option for some patients, and this trial will provide the well-controlled, rigorous scientific data we need to determine if IL-6 inhibition with Kevzara is better than current supportive care alone.  Additionally, we expect to rapidly initiate trials outside the U.S. in the coming weeks, including areas most affected by the pandemic such as <span class=""xn-location"">Italy</span>,""</i> said <span class=""xn-person"">John Reed</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Sanofi's Global Head of Research and Development.  <i> ""In addition to Kevzara, Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, is leveraging previous development work for a SARS vaccine as part of our goal to quickly develop a COVID-19 vaccine.""</i></p>
Scientists have preliminary evidence that IL-6 may play a key role in driving the inflammatory immune response that causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients critically ill from COVID-19.  Initial non-peer reviewed results from a single-arm, 21-patient Chinese trial found COVID-19 patients experienced rapidly reduced fevers and 75% of patients (15 out of 20) reduced their need for supplemental oxygen within days of receiving another IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab). Based on these results, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> recently updated its COVID-19 treatment guidelines and approved the use of that IL-6 inhibitor to treat patients with severe or critical disease.
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>""To initiate this trial quickly, Regeneron and Sanofi have worked closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, otherwise known as the FDA and BARDA ,"" </i>said <span class=""xn-person"">George D. Yancopoulos</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron.<i> ""Data from <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> suggest that the IL-6 pathway may play an important role in the </i><i>overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients</i><i> with COVID-19. Despite this encouraging finding, it's imperative to conduct a properly designed, randomized trial to understand the true impact.  Our trial is</i> <i>the first controlled trial in the U.S. to evaluate the effect of IL-6 inhibition prospectively in COVID-19 patients. In addition to our Kevzara program, Regeneron is also rapidly advancing a novel antibody cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, which we hope to have available for human testing this summer. Both of these programs are made possible by our unprecedented end-to-end antibody discovery, development and manufacturing technologies, starting with our proprietary VelocImmune human antibody mouse, and incorporating our associated rapid manufacturing technologies designed to select and produce the best neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, these technologies expedite a typically years-long process into a matter of months. This same technology was applied to the Ebola virus, where our therapy, REGN-EB3, was shown to dramatically improve survival in infected patients last year.""</i></p>
In late 2019, Regeneron and Sanofi announced their intent to simplify the joint collaboration for Kevzara, which is expected to be finalized in the first-quarter of 2020. The companies will continue to collaborate on COVID-19 and other related ARDS development, with Regeneron leading U.S.-based work and Sanofi leading work outside of the U.S.
The use of Kevzara to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 is investigational and has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.
<b>About the Trial
</b>This Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial uses an adaptive design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Kevzara in adults hospitalized with serious complications from COVID-19. To enter the trial, patients must be hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 that is classified as severe or critical, or who are suffering from multi-organ dysfunction. All patients must have pneumonia and fever. After receiving the study dose, patients will be assessed for 60 days, or until hospital discharge or death.
In the Phase 2 part of the trial, patients will be randomized 2:2:1 into three groups: Kevzara high dose, Kevzara low dose and placebo. The primary endpoint is reduction of fever and the secondary endpoint is decreased need for supplemental oxygen.
The Phase 2 findings will be utilized in an adaptive manner to determine transition into Phase 3, helping to determine the endpoints, patient numbers and doses. The second, larger part of the trial will evaluate the improvement in longer-term outcomes including preventing death and reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen and/or hospitalization.
If the trial continues with all three treatment arms to the end, it is expected to enroll approximately 400 patients, depending on the status of the COVID-19 outbreak and the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 and high levels of IL-6.
<b>About Kevzara® (sarilumab) Injection
</b>Kevzara was jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.  Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody. Kevzara binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor, and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is a signaling protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity, joint destruction and other systemic problems. It is also being investigated for its ability to reduce the overactive inflammatory immune response associated with COVID-19.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KEVZARA<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab) INJECTION</b>
<b>KEVZARA can cause serious side effects including:</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</b>: <b>KEVZARA is a medicine that affects your immune system. KEVZARA can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have serious infections while using KEVZARA, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections.</b> <b>Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting KEVZARA. Your healthcare provider should monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with KEVZARA.</b>
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>Before starting KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you:
<ul type=""square"">
 	<li>think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, with or without a fever. Symptoms may include sweats or chills, muscle aches, a cough, shortness of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, if you feel very tired, or if you are being treated for an infection, get a lot of infections or have repeated infections</li>
 	<li>have diabetes, HIV, or a weakened immune system</li>
 	<li>have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB</li>
 	<li>live or have lived, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the <span class=""xn-location"">Ohio</span> and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance of getting certain fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis)</li>
 	<li>have or have had hepatitis</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>After starting KEVZARA, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>CHANGES IN CERTAIN LABORATORY TEST RESULTS:</b> Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before and after starting KEVZARA to check for low neutrophil (white blood cells that help the body fight off bacterial infections) counts, low platelet (blood cells that help with blood clotting and stop bleeding) counts, and an increase in certain liver function tests. Changes in test results are common with KEVZARA and can be severe.  You may also have changes in other laboratory tests, such as your blood cholesterol levels. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests 4 to 8 weeks after starting KEVZARA and then every 6 months during treatment to check for an increase in blood cholesterol levels.
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li><b>TEARS (PERFORATION) OF THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES: </b>Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines. Some people using KEVZARA had tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go away.</li>
 	<li><b>CANCER:</b> KEVZARA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works.  Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.</li>
 	<li><b>SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS: </b>Serious allergic reactions can happen with KEVZARA.  Get medical attention right away if you have any of the following signs: shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling dizzy or faint; swelling of your lips, tongue or face; moderate or severe stomach (abdominal) pain or vomiting; or chest pain.</li>
 	<li>Do not use KEVZARA if you are allergic to Sarilumab or any of the ingredients of KEVZARA.</li>
 	<li>Before using KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you
<ul type=""square"">

 	<li>have liver problems</li>
 	<li>have had stomach (abdominal) pain or a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines</li>
 	<li>recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine.  People who take KEVZARA should not receive live vaccines</li>
 	<li>plan to have surgery or a medical procedure</li>
 	<li>are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if KEVZARA will harm your unborn baby</li>
 	<li>are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you use KEVZARA.  It is not known if KEVZARA passes into your breast milk</li>
 	<li>take any prescription or nonprescription medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements. It is especially important to tell your healthcare provider if you use any other medicines to treat your RA.   Using KEVZARA with these medicines may increase your risk of infection</li>
 	<li>medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>The most common side effects include:
<ul type=""square"">
 	<li>injection site redness</li>
 	<li>upper respiratory tract infection</li>
 	<li>urinary tract infection</li>
 	<li>nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class=""bwalignc""><i>HERZUMA is a biosimilar to HERCEPTIN<sup>®1</sup> (trastuzumab)</i></p>
TEL AVIV, Israel &amp; PARSIPPANY, N.J. &amp; INCHEON, South Korea--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a U.S. affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.<b></b>(NYSE and TASE: TEVA), and Celltrion Healthcare, Co., Ltd. (KRX KOSDAQ:091990), today announced that HERZUMA<sup>®1 </sup>(trastuzumab-pkrb) for Injection, a biosimilar to HERCEPTIN<sup>®1</sup>, is now available in the United States with the same indications as the reference product including:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Adjuvant Breast Cancer
</b>HERZUMA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-overexpressing node-positive or node-negative (ER/PR negative or with one high-risk feature) breast cancer
<ul class=""bwlistcircle"">
 	<li>as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel</li>
 	<li>as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin</li>
 	<li>as a single agent following multi-modality anthracycline based therapy</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>Metastatic Breast Cancer
</b>HERZUMA is indicated:
<ul class=""bwlistcircle"">
 	<li>In combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer</li>
 	<li>As a single agent for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><b>Metastatic Gastric Cancer
</b>HERZUMA is indicated in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease.</li>
</ul>
In these indications, patients should be selected for therapy based on a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product.
“We are proud to make HERZUMA available to patients in the U.S. living with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, and their providers,” said Brendan O’Grady, Executive Vice President, North America Commercial, Teva. “The launch of HERZUMA continues our commitment to help lower healthcare costs and increase price competition through the availability of biosimilars. Teva is continuing to invest in biopharmaceuticals as part of our long-term strategy for the future, and to help patients around the world, and we look forward to additional milestones for our biosimilar products later this year.”
HERZUMA has received FDA approval for the same indications of the reference product.
“We are pleased that HERZUMA is now available to patients in the U.S.,” said Mr. Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Teva to bring biosimilars to as many patients as possible in the U.S., as we believe they address an unmet need in the market.”
The Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC or “list price”) for HERZUMA 150 mg is $1,402.50 and HERZUMA 420 mg is $3,927, which is a 10 percent discount to the WAC of HERCEPTIN<sup>®</sup>. Actual costs to individual patients and providers for HERZUMA are anticipated to be lower than WAC because WAC does not account for additional rebates and discounts that may apply. Savings on out-of-pocket costs may vary depending on the patient’s insurance payer and eligibility for participation in the assistance program.
Dedicated patient support services are also available from Teva through the CORE program. CORE is available to help eligible patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals navigate the reimbursement process. CORE offers a range of services, including benefits verification and coverage determination, support for precertification and prior authorization, assistance with coverage guidelines and claims investigation, and support through the claims and appeals process. A savings program is also available for eligible commercially insured patients.

NEW YORK &amp; MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE, “Pfizer”) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech”) today announced that the companies have agreed to a letter of intent regarding the co-development and distribution (excluding China) of a potential mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection. The companies have executed a Material Transfer and Collaboration Agreement to enable the parties to immediately start working together.
<p id=""news-body-cta"">This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005943/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005943/en/</a></p>
The collaboration aims to accelerate development of BioNTech’s potential first-in-class COVID-19 mRNA vaccine program, BNT162, which is expected to enter clinical testing by the end of April 2020. The rapid advancement of this collaboration builds on the research and development collaboration into which Pfizer and BioNTech entered in 2018 to develop mRNA-based vaccines for prevention of influenza.
“We are proud that our ongoing, successful relationship with BioNTech gives our companies the resiliency to mobilize our collective resources with extraordinary speed in the face of this worldwide challenge,” said Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Worldwide Research, Development &amp; Medical, Pfizer. “We believe that by pairing Pfizer’s development, regulatory and commercial capabilities with BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine technology and expertise as one of the industry leaders, we are reinforcing our commitment to do everything we can to combat this escalating pandemic, as quickly as possible.”
“This is a global pandemic, which requires a global effort. In joining forces with our partner Pfizer, we believe we can accelerate our effort to bring a COVID-19 vaccine to people around the world who need it,” said Ugur Sahin, Co-Founder and CEO of BioNTech.
The companies expect to utilize multiple research and development sites from both companies, including in the United States and Germany, to house the activities identified by the collaboration agreement.
The companies will begin collaborating immediately. They will finalize details of the agreement regarding financial terms, and all activities related to development, manufacturing and potential commercialization over the next few weeks.
On March 13, 2020, Pfizer issued a five-point plan calling on the biopharmaceutical industry to join the company in committing to unprecedented collaboration to combat COVID-19.

<strong>Bagsværd, Denmark, 16 March 2020 - </strong>Novo Nordisk today announced that two clinical trials in the concizumab phase 3 programme (explorer7 and 8) and one clinical trial in the phase 2 programme (explorer5) have been paused. The three clinical trials were investigating concizumab prophylaxis treatment in haemophilia A and B patients regardless of inhibitor status. Consequently, no additional patients will be recruited, and further treatment of patients currently enrolled in the trials with concizumab will cease.
The decision is a result of the occurrence of non-fatal thrombotic events in three patients enrolled in the ongoing phase 3 programme. Novo Nordisk and an independent Data Monitoring Committee are currently assessing the relevance of the events to the continuation of the programme and no conclusions have yet been made.
“While it is disappointing to pause the trials, patient safety is of utmost importance to Novo Nordisk – both for those taking part in our clinical trials and those who use our products on a daily basis” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. “Together with relevant authorities, we will now carefully evaluate all available data and decide how to best move forward”.
<strong>About the concizumab phase 2 and 3 programmes                           </strong>
In October 2019, Novo Nordisk initiated the explorer7 phase 3 clinical trial with concizumab in patients with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors towards FVIII or FIX. The objective of the trial was to establish the safety and efficacy of once-daily prophylactic subcutaneous concizumab delivered in a pen device to reduce the number of bleeds. A parallel phase 3 trial in haemophilia A or B patients without inhibitors, explorer8, was initiated in November 2019. The trials were to enrol approximately 293 patients from 32 countries. The explorer5 phase 2 trial was initiated in October 2017 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily prophylactic subcutaneous concizumab delivered in a pen device to reduce the number of bleeds of haemophilia A patients. The trial currently includes 15 patients. Approximately 109 patients are currently being treated with concizumab.

<span class=""xn-location"">REDWOOD CITY, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 16, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/acelrx-pharmaceuticals-to-acquire-tetraphase-pharmaceuticals-301024578.html#financial-modal"">ACRX</a>) (AcelRx), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for use in healthcare institutions, today announced the execution of a definitive merger agreement to acquire Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Tetraphase) in a stock for stock deal at an exchange ratio of 0.6303 shares of AcelRx for each share of Tetraphase, or approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$14.4 million</span> as of the close of trading on <span class=""xn-chron"">March 13, 2020</span>, plus a contingent value right (CVR). The CVR represents additional consideration upon XERAVA™ (eravacycline for injection) achieving certain net sales starting in 2021.  The acquisition is consistent with AcelRx's strategic plan to expand and diversify the company's product portfolio and create a growth platform towards becoming a leader in providing innovative treatments to healthcare institutions. The transaction was unanimously approved by both the AcelRx and Tetraphase Boards of Directors and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.  Tetraphase's four largest shareholders, including Armistice Capital, have signed voting agreements in favor of the transaction.
AcelRx and Tetraphase have also entered into a co-promotion agreement to commercialize XERAVA™ for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and DSUVIA® for the management of acute pain in medically supervised settings. The co-promotion agreement will take effect immediately and enable the AcelRx and Tetraphase teams to benefit from the promotion of multiple products, leverage each company's customer relationships, and create efficiencies amongst commercial teams prior to the closing of the merger. The combined sales team covering 35 territories will reach in excess of 70% of each company's originally targeted hospitals, illustrating the revenue and expense synergy potential of the transaction.
""We are excited to have reached agreement with Tetraphase, a company with a well-established US salesforce and a high-growth hospital product that complements AcelRx's commercial strategy,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Vince Angotti</span>, Chief Executive Officer of AcelRx. ""This transaction highlights our focus on efficiently commercializing DSUVIA with a salesforce promoting multiple products and is the first step in our plan to create a growth platform to further consolidate hospital-focused pharmaceutical companies and products. We look forward to integrating XERAVA™ and the existing Tetraphase commercial infrastructure with our own as we strengthen our position on promoting innovative products to healthcare institutions.""
""This transaction marks an exciting time for both companies, and we are thrilled to collaborate with AcelRx, a partner whose strategic goals complement our own,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Larry Edwards</span>, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tetraphase. ""We continue to believe that XERAVA is a key addition to the hospital anti-infective armamentarium, and together with AcelRx we will be able to more effectively deliver a diverse portfolio of new patient treatments to healthcare institutions.""
Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Tetraphase common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.6303 shares of AcelRx common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, and a CVR that could provide up to an additional aggregate <span class=""xn-money"">$12.5 million</span> to Tetraphase stockholders upon the achievement of net sales of XERAVA™ of <span class=""xn-money"">$20 million</span>, <span class=""xn-money"">$35 million</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$55 million</span> within the applicable timeframes, and as soon as year-end 2021. AcelRx shareholders will own approximately 85.4% of the combined company and Tetraphase shareholders will own approximately 14.6% on a pro forma, fully diluted basis, giving effect to all dilutive securities at the time of announcement, and excluding any settlement of the CVR through issuance of AcelRx common stock.
Closing of the transaction – expected in the second quarter of 2020 – is subject to Tetraphase having a defined cash level at closing and receipt of approval of its shareholders, as well as satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.  The transaction does not require a vote by AcelRx stockholders.
Cooley LLP is acting as legal counsel to AcelRx.

High-level results from the final analysis of the Phase III CASPIAN trial showed AstraZeneca’s <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) in combination with a choice of standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapies confirmed a sustained, clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) treated in the 1st-line setting.
In June 2019, the CASPIAN trial met one <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/imfinzi-improves-overall-survival-at-interim-analysis-in-the-phase-iii-caspian-trial-in-1st-line-extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-27062019.html"">primary endpoint</a> for <i>Imfinzi</i> plus SoC (etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy) by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS versus SoC alone at a planned interim analysis.
The second experimental arm testing tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, added to <i>Imfinzi</i> and SoC did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in OS in this analysis.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D, said: “We are pleased to see the sustained and meaningful survival benefit of <i>Imfinzi</i> for patients with small cell lung cancer after more than two years median follow up. We have already received the first global regulatory approval for <i>Imfinzi</i> with etoposide plus either carboplatin or cisplatin and remain on track for more approvals soon as we provide patients an important new 1st-line treatment option.”
The safety and tolerability for <i>Imfinzi</i> and tremelimumab were consistent with the known safety profiles of these medicines. The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
<i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is currently under regulatory review for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the 1st-line setting based on the Phase III CASPIAN trial in the US, EU and Japan. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted a <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/imfinzi-granted-fda-priority-review-for-the-treatment-of-patients-with-extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer.html"">Priority Review</a> with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date set for the first quarter of 2020.
As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is also being tested following concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC in the Phase III ADRIATIC trial with data anticipated in 2021.
<b>Small cell lung cancer</b>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.<sup>1</sup> Lung cancer is broadly split into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with about 15% classified as SCLC.<sup>2</sup> SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to chemotherapy.<sup>3,4</sup> About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.<sup>5</sup> Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.<sup>5</sup>
<b>CASPIAN</b>
CASPIAN is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared <i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy, or <i>Imfinzi</i><a name=""_Hlk35003244""></a>and chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation. The trial was conducted in more than 200 centres across 23 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was OS in each of the two experimental arms.
<b><i>Imfinzi</i></b>
<i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.
<i>Imfinzi </i>is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. <i>Imfinzi</i> recently received its first global approval for the 1st-line treatment of ES-SCLC in combination with SoC chemotherapy in Singapore. <i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.
As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.
<b>Tremelimumab</b>
Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death. Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with <i>Imfinzi</i> in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and liver cancer.
<b>AstraZeneca in lung cancer</b>
AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. We aim to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines <i>Iressa</i> (gefitinib) and <i>Tagrisso</i> (osimertinib), and its ongoing Phase III trials ADAURA, LAURA, and FLAURA2.<sup>6-8</sup>We are also committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test <i>Tagrisso</i> in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. <i>Enhertu</i> (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments.
An extensive late-stage Immuno-Oncology programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.<sup>9</sup> <i>Imfinzi</i>, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON, and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. <i>Imfinzi</i> is also in development in the Phase II combination trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline.
<b>AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)</b>
Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca believes that IO-based therapies offer the potential for life-changing cancer treatments for the clear majority of patients.
The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.
<b>AstraZeneca in Oncology</b>
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients' lives and the Company's future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca's main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.
<b>AstraZeneca</b>
AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas - Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism, and Respiratory.

“Appointments will continue to expand through this program as we scale capacity in the near future. Please check back later,” the site now says, but only after you’ve gone through most of the questionnaire.
It’s obviously not Verily’s fault that the state’s testing sites are at capacity and, if anything, this proves the need for a service like this on a national scale.

<span class=""xn-location"">MISSISSAUGA, ON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 16, 2020</span> /CNW/ - NUCALA (mepolizumab) has now been approved in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> as an add-on maintenance treatment for use in adults, adolescents and children (aged 6 years and older) with severe eosinophilic asthma<sup>1</sup>.
NUCALA is the first anti-Interleukin-5 (IL5) biologic to be approved for the condition in a pediatric population (as young as 6 years old) in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>. IL-5 plays an important role in regulating the function of eosinophils, an inflammatory cell known to be active in asthma.
<b>Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Alex Romanovschi</span>, Country Medical Director, GSK Canada</b>, said: ""Severe asthma is a chronic disease that can make daily activities a challenge for adolescents, children and their caregivers. GSK has a long and established history in respiratory health innovation, with treatments for asthma, COPD and other respiratory diseases. We are pleased to announce the extension of NUCALA's indication to adolescents and children aged 6 years and older, thereby bringing our specialty biologic medicines to patients and their families who have limited treatment options"".
<b>About asthma<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways<sup>2</sup>.  The causes of asthma are not completely understood but likely involve an interaction between a person's genetic make-up and the environment.
<b>About severe asthma and eosinophilic inflammation  </b> <br class=""dnr"" />Severe asthma is a chronic disease with symptoms that can be life-threatening<sup>3</sup>. Approximately 250,000 Canadians live with severe asthma<sup>4</sup>, which can have several underlying causes, including eosinophilic inflammation<sup>5</sup>. In a sub-set of severe asthma patients, the over-production of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) is known to cause inflammation in the lungs. Studies suggest about 60% of severe asthma patients may have eosinophilic airway inflammation<sup>6</sup>.  IL-5 is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. The prevalence of severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma is =1% among treated children aged 6-17 years old. Although the proportion of severe asthmatics among children is less than adult asthma patients, the severity of disease is greater among children and adolescents as evidenced by increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations<sup>7,8</sup>.

<b>About NUCALA (mepolizumab)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>NUCALA contains the active substance, mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking a specific protein called interleukin-5. By blocking the action of interleukin-5, NUCALA limits the production of more eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the number of eosinophils in the blood, lungs and tissues<sup>1</sup>.
In <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> NUCALA is indicated as add-on maintenance treatment for adults, adolescents, and children (aged 6 years and older) with severe eosinophilic asthma who:
<ul>
 	<li>are inadequately controlled with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (patients = 18 years of age) or medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (patients 6-17 years of age) and an additional asthma controller(s) (e.g., LABA); and</li>
 	<li>have a blood eosinophil count of = 150 cells/µL (0.15 GI/L) at initiation of treatment with NUCALA OR = 300 cells/µL (0.3 GI/L) in the past 12 months.</li>
</ul>
NUCALA is also approved in the US, <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> and in over 20 other markets for adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, and in the US, <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, and other jurisdictions for paediatric use from ages 6 to 17 as an add-on treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma.  In Canada, the US, <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> and several other markets, it is approved as add-on maintenance treatment for patients with a rare blood vessel disease associated with increased eosinophils, called Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA).
NUCALA has been studied in over 3,000 patients in 21 clinical trials, across a number of eosinophilic conditions.

Study enrolling Seattle-based healthy adult volunteers.
A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. The <a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses"">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</a>, part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial. KPWHRI is part of NIAID’s <a href=""https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/infectious-diseases-clinical-research-consortium-awards-announced"">Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium</a>. The open-label trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks. The first participant received the investigational vaccine today.
The study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine.
The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.
“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.”
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As of March 15, 2020, the <a class=""ext"" href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide. More than 2,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths have been reported in the United States as of March 15, according to the <a class=""ext"" href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>.
Currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA). The investigational vaccine directs the body’s cells to express a virus protein that it is hoped will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans.
Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry. VRC and Moderna scientists already were working on an investigational MERS vaccine targeting the spike, which provided a head start for developing a vaccine candidate to protect against COVID-19. Once the genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 became available, the scientists quickly selected a sequence to express the stabilized spike protein of the virus in the existing mRNA platform.
The Phase 1 trial is led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., senior investigator at KPWHRI. Study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort. The first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose. Investigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations. Another safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort.
Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up visits between vaccinations and for additional visits across the span of a year after the second shot. Clinicians will monitor participants for common vaccination symptoms, such as soreness at the injection site or fever as well as any other medical issues. A protocol team will meet regularly to review safety data, and a safety monitoring committee will also periodically review trial data and advise NIAID. Participants also will be asked to provide blood samples at specified time points, which investigators will test in the laboratory to detect and measure the immune response to the experimental vaccine.
“This work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus,” Dr. Jackson said. “We are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an NIH clinical trials center since 2007.”

""Published research has revealed that viral replication can be highly dependent on specific monosaccharides and has demonstrated the effectiveness of a compound known as '2-DG,' a dual decoy of glucose and mannose, in the treatment of certain viruses<sup>1</sup>,"" commented Walter Klemp, Moleculin's Chairman and CEO. ""And, this is rooted in an emerging field of research focused on the role of glycolysis and glycosylation, or more specifically, on glucose and mannose metabolism in viral activity, including the coronavirus<sup>2</sup>. Importantly, although 2-DG has shown promise in the laboratory in relevant in vivo models, its potential as a therapy is severely limited by its lack of drug-like properties, including circulation time and organ uptake. Our drug candidate, WP1122, is a prodrug of 2-DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose) that, based on recently developed preclinical data appears to overcome 2-DG's lack of drug-like properties and is able to significantly increase tissue/organ concentration.""
Dr. Donald Picker, Chief Science Officer for Moleculin added: ""the in vivo research supporting the use of 2-DG as dual inhibitor of glycolysis and glycosylation to defeat viruses like Coronavirus through multiple effects critical to the progression of viral infection is promising. And, with the improved drug-like properties of WP1122 and an apparent ability to increase concentration of the drug in the infected organs, we are excited to begin testing against coronavirus, as well as others.  Our hope for this kind of therapeutic approach is not only as a potential treatment for infected patients, but even as a possible preventative measure.""
Under the agreement, Moleculin will supply the lead drug candidate, WP1122, and related inhibitors, as well as technical support and UTMB will begin testing these candidates against various viral disease models, including COVID-19, in connection with the UTMB Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases.
The UTMB Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases (CBEID) was established in 2003, the same year the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) selected UTMB as one of eight institutions to lead a Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCE) and to receive a grant to construct on the UTMB campus one of two National Biocontainment Laboratories, now known as the Galveston National Laboratory.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Gefapixant (45 mg Twice Daily) Demonstrated Statistically Significant Decrease in 24-hour Coughs Per Hour Compared to Placebo at Week 12 and 24 in Phase 3 Trials</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced top-line efficacy results from two ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trials (COUGH-1 and COUGH-2) evaluating the efficacy and safety of gefapixant (MK-7264), an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. In these studies, the primary efficacy endpoints were met for the gefapixant 45 mg twice daily treatment arms – demonstrating a statistically significant decrease in 24-hour coughs per hour (average hourly cough frequency based on 24-hour sound recordings) versus placebo at 12 (COUGH-1) and 24 weeks (COUGH-2). The gefapixant 15 mg twice daily treatment arms did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint in either Phase 3 study. The safety and tolerability profile of gefapixant during the trials to date is consistent with the previously reported Phase 2 study. The trials will continue for long-term follow-up to collect additional safety data.
“The burden for patients faced with this disease underscores the need for effective therapeutic options for refractory and unexplained chronic cough,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are pleased gefapixant at the 45 mg dose met the primary efficacy endpoints in both Phase 3 studies and we look forward to sharing the detailed findings at an upcoming medical meeting.”
<b>About COUGH-1 and COUGH-2</b>
COUGH-1 (NCT03449134) and COUGH-2 (NCT03449147) are international Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gefapixant in reducing cough frequency in adult participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. COUGH-1 enrolled 732 participants and COUGH-2 enrolled 1,317 participants, with refractory or unexplained chronic cough for at least one year, as defined by guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). In both studies, patients were randomized to one of three groups: gefapixant 45 mg twice daily, gefapixant 15 mg twice daily, or placebo. Participants remained on their assigned treatment at randomization throughout both studies. The primary efficacy outcomes measure for COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12, and 24-hour coughs per hour at week 24, respectively, measured using an ambulatory digital audio recording device. Secondary endpoints in both trials included awake coughs per hour, percentage of participants with a greater than 1.3-point increase from baseline in the Leicester Questionnaire (LCQ) total score, and percentage of participants with a greater than 30% reduction from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour. COUGH-1 had a 12-week treatment period and a 40-week extension period, while COUGH-2 had a 24-week treatment period and a 28-week extension period. Primary safety outcomes include the percentage of patients experiencing greater than one adverse event during treatment and follow up, and the percentage of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events.
<b>About Gefapixant</b>
Gefapixant is an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. It is believed that excessive activation of P2X3 receptors is associated with hyper-sensitization of sensory neurons. Neuronal hyper-sensitization in the airways and lungs, triggered by injury or infection, can cause an exaggerated, persistent and frequent urge to cough, otherwise known as chronic cough.
<b>About Chronic Cough</b>
The prevalence of chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 8 weeks) is estimated at 10% of the general adult population globally, and in up to 46% of these cases, no treatable cause can be identified despite a thorough diagnostic investigation. There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of chronic cough.
<b>About Merck</b>

<span class=""xn-location"">HOUSTON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">March 16, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- NuProbe Global, a global molecular diagnostics company based in <span class=""xn-location"">Shanghai</span>and Suzhou, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Houston, TX</span>, today announced it has entered into a collaboration agreement with QIAGEN to develop next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based cancer diagnostic tests for non-invasive liquid biopsy. Under terms of the collaboration agreement, NuProbe and QIAGEN will explore integrating their two amplicon-based enrichment and sequencing technologies: NuProbe's proprietary Blocker Displacement Amplification (BDA) technology and QIAGEN's Single Primer Extension (SPE) technology, for accurate and affordable analysis of DNA mutations with very low variant allele fractions and to advance non-invasive cancer genomic profiling.
Meanwhile, NuProbe has also recently completed five CE IVD registrations for molecular diagnostic products, including for common mutations related to non-small-cell lung cancer (EGFR mutations) and for melanoma and thyroid cancer (BRAF mutations).
Liquid biopsy is gaining emerging popularity for non-invasive profiling of cancer mutations to inform optimal target therapy selection and provide timely early warning of cancer recurrence. The NGS liquid biopsy oncology panels that the two companies are investigating will achieve adequate limit of detection in a cost-effective manner that other current technologies cannot equal on liquid biopsies.
""BDA technology is one of our core technologies and have been demonstrated robustness across multiple platforms including NGS,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David Y. Zhang</span>, co-founder of and head of innovation at NuProbe, and associate professor of bioengineering at <span class=""xn-org"">Rice University</span>. ""We are enthusiastic to further expand its application to QIAGEN's recognized SPE platform.""
The QIAGEN and NuProbe teams will initially work on developing research use only products, for clinical researchers in oncology. The two companies may explore further strategic collaboration and develop other commercial products in the future.
""We are excited about the potential products that will come out of the two synergistic rare variant enrichment and detection methods,"" said Yingshuang Chai, CEO and Chairman of NuProbe. ""This collaboration further demonstrates the adoption of our cutting-edge technology by industry leaders, and our high valuable products will help more eligible patients benefit from therapy selection and recurrence monitoring with non-invasive detection.""
Separately from the QIAGEN collaboration, NuProbe announces that it has recently completed five CE IVD registrations for molecular diagnostic products, including liquid biopsy mutation detection kits for the EGFR and BRAF genes. NuProbe is planning CE IVD and NMPA (<span class=""xn-location"">China's</span> equivalent of FDA) registrations for additional products including the recently released VarTrace™ AML Multi-gene Panel.

<b>Regeneron has identified hundreds of virus-neutralizing antibodies; plans to initiate large-scale manufacturing by mid-April with antibody cocktail therapy</b>
<b>Potential to enter human clinical studies by early summer</b>
<b>This program is in addition to Regeneron's separate ongoing clinical program evaluating Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody) in severe COVID-19 patients</b>
<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2753554-1&amp;h=2886705198&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regeneron.com%2F&amp;a=Regeneron+Pharmaceuticals%2C+Inc."" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</a> (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the latest progress in its efforts to discover and develop a novel multi-antibody cocktail that can be administered as prophylaxis before exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or as treatment for those already infected. Regeneron scientists have now isolated hundreds of virus-neutralizing, fully human antibodies from the company's <i>VelocImmune</i><sup>®</sup> mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system. Regeneron has also isolated antibodies from humans who have recovered from COVID-19, in order to maximize the pool of potentially potent antibodies. From this large pool of candidates, Regeneron will select the top two antibodies for a 'cocktail' treatment based on potency and binding ability to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, as well as other desirable qualities. Using a multi-antibody approach allows for targeting of different parts of the virus and may help protect against multiple viral variants. Regeneron previously used these technologies to rapidly develop a <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2753554-1&amp;h=3143220097&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fpalm-ebola-clinical-trial-stopped-early-regenerons-regn-eb3&amp;a=successful+treatment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">successful treatment</a> for Ebola virus infection, which is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In order to meet the pressing public health need, Regeneron is applying its <i>VelociMab</i><sup>®</sup>technology to prepare manufacturing-ready cell lines as lead antibodies are selected, so that clinical-scale production can begin immediately. The company is working toward the goal of producing hundreds of thousands of prophylactic doses per month by the end of summer and hopes to have smaller quantities available for initial clinical testing at the beginning of the summer. The company is working with the U.S. Health &amp; Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Defense Authority (BARDA) to increase capacity even further.
""Our three decades of investment in our <i>VelociSuite</i> antibody technologies, which accelerate and improve the traditional drug discovery process, have hopefully prepared us for this critical time and to meet this important challenge,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. ""Given the tremendous interest and concern around the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be providing regular and transparent updates on our discovery and development programs. I want to recognize our incredible team, which is working around the clock to develop needed solutions to this global health crisis.""
All coronaviruses have a single glycoprotein on the virus surface called the spike protein, which is the protein on the virus cell surface that binds to the host cell and is required for infectivity. Regeneron's SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will target the spike protein in order to block its interaction with the host cell, and thus neutralize the virus.
""I'm so proud to be part of this cross-company team, which delivered a novel and effective fully human antibody treatment for Ebola in record time and is making every effort to once again rise to this unprecedented challenge,"" said Christos Kyratsous, Ph.D., Vice President of Research, Infectious Diseases and Viral Vector Technologies at Regeneron.
Yesterday, Regeneron and its collaborator Sanofi also <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2753554-1&amp;h=3173196355&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fregeneron-and-sanofi-begin-global-kevzarar-sarilumab-clinical&amp;a=announced+the+initiation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">announced the initiation</a> of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating Kevzara<sup>®</sup> (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Kevzara inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6), which may play a role in driving the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Basel, 19 March 2020- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced  we are working with the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the US Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care.
This is the first global study of Actemra/RoActemra in this setting and is expected to begin enrolling as soon as possible in early April with a target of approximately 330 patients globally, including the US. The primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) variables.
“We are initiating a clinical trial to study Actemra/RoActemra for the treatment of people hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia, so that we can better establish the potential role for Actemra/RoActemra in fighting this disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “In these unprecedented times, today’s announcement is an important example of how industry and regulators can collaborate quickly to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will share the results as soon as possible.”
To date, there are several independent clinical trials exploring the efficacy and safety of Actemra/RoActemra for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Actemra/RoActemra has been included in the 7th updated diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 issued by China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on March 3, 2020.
However, this new trial is vital because there are no well-controlled studies and limited published evidence on the safety or efficacy of Actemra/RoActemra in the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19. In addition, Actemra/RoActemra is not currently approved for this use by any health authorities, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In addition to initiating this trial, Roche received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test on March 13, 2020, to detect the novel virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Learn more here.
About the Clinical Trial
Roche is initiating a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (COVACTA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra/RoActemra added to standard of care in adult patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. The primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) variables. Patients will be followed for 60 days post-randomisation, and an interim analysis will be conducted to look for early evidence of efficacy.
About Actemra/RoActemra
Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved anti-IL-6 receptor biologic available in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Actemra/RoActemra can be used alone or with methotrexate (MTX) in adult RA patients who are intolerant to, or have failed to respond to, other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In Europe, RoActemra IV and SC are also approved for use in adult patients with severe, active and progressive RA who previously have not been treated with MTX. Actemra/RoActemra IV and SC are approved globally for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and in the US and Europe for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in children two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra SC injection is also the first approved therapy for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in more than 40 countries, including the US and Europe. In the US and Europe, Actemra/RoActemra IV injection is approved for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in people two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved treatment for CRS in this setting. A prefilled autoinjector ACTPen has been approved in the US and Europe. In Japan, Actemra is also approved for the treatment of Castleman’s Disease and Takayasu Arteritis. Actemra/RoActemra is part of a co-development agreement with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and has been approved in Japan since April 2005. Actemra/RoActemra is approved in more than 110 countries worldwide.

</ul>
<strong>Basel, March 19, 2020</strong> — Novartis Pharma K.K. (“Novartis Pharma”) today announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved Zolgensma<sup>®</sup>(onasemnogene abeparvovec) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients under the age of two, including those who are pre-symptomatic at diagnosi<em>s. </em>Patients must be negative for elevated anti-AAV9 antibodies. A rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional <em>SMN1</em> gene, SMA results in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.<sup>3</sup> Approximately 60% of all SMA is Type 1. Zolgensma is a one-time gene therapy designed to address the genetic root cause of the disease by replacing the function of the missing or nonworking <em>SMN1</em> gene. Zolgensma is administered during a single intravenous (IV) infusion, delivering a new working copy of the SMN gene into a patient’s cells, halting disease progression. Approximately 15-20 SMA patients in Japan are expected to be eligible for treatment each year. Reimbursement with MHLW is expected by the end of 1H20 and, pending agreement, Zolgensma will be available at that time.
“SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death and, if left untreated in its most common form, Type 1, leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases,” said Kazunari Tsunaba, president and representative director, Novartis Pharma. “A one-time dose of Zolgensma has the potential to make a truly transformative impact on this life-threatening disease. This is an important day for the children and families in Japan impacted by SMA, both today and in the future.”
Approval is based on the Phase 1 START, START Long-term follow-up, Phase 3 STR1VE-US, Phase 3 SPR1NT and Phase 1/2 STRONG (intrathecal injection) trials. START and STR1VE-US were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in symptomatic SMA Type 1 patients &lt;6 months of age at dosing, who had one or two copies of the <em>SMN2</em> backup gene, or two copies of the <em>SMN2</em> backup gene, respectively. Zolgensma demonstrated rates of survival never seen in the natural history of the disease; rapid motor function improvement, often within one month of dosing; and milestone achievement, including the ability to sit without support, a milestone never achieved in untreated patients. Patients in START Long-term follow-up are now reaching five years of age. Interim results from the ongoing SPR1NT trial, a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm study of a single, one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in pre-symptomatic patients (&lt;6 weeks at age of dosing) genetically defined by bi-allelic deletion of <em>SMN1</em> with 2 or 3 copies of <em>SMN2 </em>demonstrate rapid, age-appropriate major milestone gain, reinforcing the critical importance of early intervention in SMA patients. It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.
The most commonly observed side effects after treatment were elevated liver enzymes and vomiting. Acute serious liver injury and elevated aminotransferases can occur. Patients with pre-existing liver impairment may be at higher risk. Prior to infusion, physicians should assess liver function of all patients by clinical examination and laboratory testing. And, they should administer systemic corticosteroid to all patients before and after treatment, and then continue to monitor liver function for at least 3 months after infusion.
“Zolgensma provided rapid, significant and clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit in symptomatic and pre-symptomatic SMA, including prolonged event-free survival and achievement of motor milestones never seen before in natural history of the disease. We are proud to bring the first gene therapy for SMA to Japan, and especially of the transformational impact Zolgensma will have on the children and families affected by SMA,” said Dave Lennon, president, AveXis.
In May 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zolgensma for the treatment of pediatric patients less than two years of age with SMA with bi-allelic mutations in the <em>SMN1</em> gene. Approximately 400 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program in the U.S.  In the U.S. nearly all on-label patients have been approved by their payer for access to Zolgensma. AveXis is pursuing registration in close to three dozen countries with a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use opinion expected in 1Q 2020 and regulatory decisions anticipated in Switzerland, Canada and Australia in late 2020 or early 2021.
<strong>About Spinal Muscular Atrophy</strong>
SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death and is designated as an intractable disease in Japan.<sup>1</sup> If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases.<sup>2</sup> Approximately 60% of all SMA is Type 1. Approximately 15-20 SMA patients in Japan are expected to be eligible for treatment each year <sup>4,5 </sup>. SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional <em>SMN1</em> gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.<sup>3</sup> It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.<sup>6</sup> This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities.<sup>7</sup> More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.<sup>8</sup>
<strong>About Zolgensma<sup>®</sup> (onasemnogene abeparvovec)</strong>
Zolgensma is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma represents the first approved therapeutic in the company’s proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. Approximately 400 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program in the U.S.
AveXis has an exclusive, worldwide license with Nationwide Children's Hospital to both the intravenous and intrathecal delivery of AAV9 gene therapy for the treatment of all types of SMA; has an exclusive, worldwide license from REGENXBIO for any recombinant AAV vector in its intellectual property portfolio for the <em>in vivo</em> gene therapy treatment of SMA in humans; an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Genethon for <em>in vivo</em> delivery of AAV9 vector into the central nervous system for the treatment of SMA; and a non-exclusive, worldwide license agreement with AskBio for the use of its self-complementary DNA technology for the treatment of SMA.

INDIANAPOLIS, March 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE:LLY) announced today its scientists are partnering with the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH), with support from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to accelerate testing in Indiana for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
""Lilly is bringing the full force of our scientific and medical expertise to attack the coronavirus pandemic around the world,"" said David A. Ricks, Lilly's chairman and chief executive officer. ""For more than 140 years Lilly has played a leading role in solving problems in our Indiana home. Today we are marshalling our people and our assets to confront and defeat the novel coronavirus in our state.""
Lilly will use its specialized research laboratories to analyze samples taken in Indiana healthcare facilities, including nursing homes and emergency rooms. Assuming the company can continuously access required diagnostic reagents, this should start to expand the state's ability to conduct testing and receive a timely diagnosis of individuals who suspect they may be carrying the virus. As Lilly's testing capacity expands, Lillyand ISDH will work together to maximize the impact of broader testing.
""As the global COVID-19 pandemic has intensified, Lilly has redirected efforts to help solve critical issues – including potential therapeutics, diagnostics and testing,"" said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. ""Lilly's scientists have been working day and night for several weeks to implement and validate this testing approach, and access or produce the chemical reagents that are in short supply across the country. Lilly's lab meets the required certifications to conduct testing, and we're optimistic in our ability to help accelerate testing.""
""At the State Department of Health, we started partnering with Lilly from the early stages to tap into the capabilities of this innovative Indiana company,"" said Dr. Kris Box, Indiana State Health Commissioner. ""We know the magnitude of the impact that advances by Lilly can have on how we diagnose and treat Hoosiers and people worldwide, and we're grateful for Lilly's commitment to help accelerate solutions.""
In addition, Lilly is piloting drive through testing that may eventually be able to test patients outside of a healthcare facility to avoid spread of the virus. The company hopes to have additional details in the coming days.
Lilly will not accept money from government agencies, hospitals, insurance companies or patients for conducting or analyzing tests. ""This is one contribution we can make to help slow the spread of coronavirus in our community, and this testing will be entirely free,"" Ricks said.

<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca today announced that <i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) has been granted orphan drug designation (ODD) in Japan for the maintenance treatment of germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) curatively unresectable pancreatic cancer. <i>Lynparza </i>is co-developed and co-commercialised with MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada).
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare grants ODD to medicines intended for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan and for which there is a high unmet medical need.
Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate of the most common cancers and is the only major cancer with a five-year survival rate below 10% in almost every country.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, R&amp;D Oncology, said: “Japan has the fifth-highest incidence of pancreatic cancer worldwide and patients have seen limited treatment advances over the last few decades. This designation is an important step forward in bringing the first targeted medicine to biomarker-selected patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in Japan.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “A pancreatic cancer diagnosis is devastating and we are committed to research that aims to change the prognosis for patients. The POLO trial demonstrated that treatment with <i>Lynparza</i> extended time without disease progression or death in patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer and we are hopeful that we will be able to bring this treatment to patients in Japan soon.”
The <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/lynparza-nearly-doubled-the-time-patients-lived-without-disease-progression-from-germline-brca-mutated-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer02062019-2.html"">Phase III POLO trial</a> showed <i>Lynparza</i> nearly doubled the time patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death to a median of 7.4 months versus 3.8 months on placebo. The safety and tolerability profile of <i>Lynparza</i> in the POLO trial was in line with that observed in previous trials.
<i>Lynparza</i> was approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer in <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2019/lynparza-approved-in-the-us-as-a-1st-line-maintenance-treatment-of-germline-brca-mutated-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer-30122019.html"">December 2019</a> with ongoing regulatory reviews in the EU and other jurisdictions.
<b>Pancreatic cancer</b>
Pancreatic cancer is a deadly cancer with a high unmet medical need. The disease has the lowest survival rate of the most common cancers.<sup>1 </sup>Japan has the fifth-highest rate of pancreatic cancer in the world with 43,000 new cases diagnosed in 2018.<sup>2,3</sup> Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in Japan, resulting in 37,000 deaths in 2018.<sup>3</sup>
Globally, pancreatic cancer is the 11th-most commonly occurring cancer<sup> </sup>and the seventh leading cause of cancer death.<sup>4,5</sup>There were approximately 460,000 new cases worldwide in 2018.<sup>5</sup> As there are often no symptoms, or symptoms may be non-specific in the early stages, it is most commonly diagnosed at an incurable stage.<sup>6,7</sup> Around 80% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed when the disease has metastasised, at which point average survival is less than a year.<sup>8</sup> Despite advances in treatment, few improvements have been made in diagnosis and treatment in the past few decades.<sup>9 </sup>Current treatment is surgery (for which approximately only 10-20% of patients are eligible), chemotherapy and radiotherapy, highlighting a critical unmet medical need for more effective treatment options.<sup>10</sup>
<b>POLO</b>
POLO is a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial of <i>Lynparza</i> tablets (300mg twice daily) as maintenance monotherapy versus placebo. The trial randomised 154 patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed on 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomised (3:2) to receive <i>Lynparza</i> or placebo until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), time to second disease progression, overall response rate and health-related quality of life.
The results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, where <i>Lynparza</i> nearly doubled the time patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death to a median of 7.4 months versus 3.8 months on placebo and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47% (HR 0.53 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35-0.82], p=0.004). In patients with measurable disease at baseline, 23% responded to <i>Lynparza</i>versus 12% on placebo (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% CI, 0.89-6.76]) and had a median duration of treatment in excess of two years (24.9 months [95% CI, 14.8-could not be calculated]) versus 3.7 months on placebo (95% CI, 2.10-could not be calculated). The median OS, a secondary endpoint, at interim analysis and at a data maturity of 46% was 18.9 months for <i>Lynparza</i>versus 18.1 months for placebo but did not reach statistical significance (HR=0.91; p=0.68).
The safety and tolerability profile of <i>Lynparza</i> in the POLO trial was in line with that observed in previous trials.
<b>BRCA mutations</b>
BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role in maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.
<i><b>Lynparza</b></i>
<i>Lynparza</i> (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with <i>Lynparza</i> leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. <i>Lynparza</i> is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.
<i>Lynparza</i> is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. In 2019, <i>Lynparza </i>was additionally approved<i> </i>in the US for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in several jurisdictions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.
<i>Lynparza</i>, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide.<i> Lynparza</i> has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. <i>Lynparza</i> is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
<b>The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration</b>
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise <i>Lynparza</i>, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop <i>Lynparza</i> and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.
<b>AstraZeneca in oncology</b>
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly-growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investment that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

In light of this, the headline of this article has been changed to reflect the current advice. The original news text, provided by the news wire service AFP, remains below.

<div id=""google_ads_iframe_/10518929/tmnp.sciencealert/article/a0-p1-s1_0__container__""><strong>Or</strong><strong style=""font-size: 1rem"">iginal (18 March 2020): </strong><span style=""font-size: 1rem"">The World Health Organization recommended Tuesday that people suffering COVID-19 symptoms avoid taking ibuprofen, after French officials warned that anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen effects of the virus.</span></div>
</div>
The warning by French Health Minister Olivier Veran followed a recent study in <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext""><em>The Lancet</em></a> medical journal that hypothesised that an enzyme boosted by anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen could facilitate and worsen COVID-19 infections.
Asked about the study, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva the UN health agency's experts were ""looking into this to give further guidance.""
""In the meantime, we recommend using rather paracetamol, and do not use ibuprofen as a self-medication. That's important,"" he said.
He added that if ibuprofen had been ""prescribed by the healthcare professionals, then, of course, that's up to them.""
His comments came after <a href=""https://twitter.com/olivierveran/status/1239931737549033472"">Veran sent a tweet</a> cautioning that the use of ibuprofen and similar anti-inflammatory drugs could be ""an aggravating factor"" in COVID-19 infections.
<div id=""Purch_Y_C_0_1_clone_1"" class=""priad"" data-google-query-id=""CITsk_XFpugCFQ3zjwodkuMIaw"">
<div id=""google_ads_iframe_/10518929/tmnp.sciencealert/article/a0-p1-s1_1__container__""><span style=""font-size: 1rem"">""In the case of fever, take paracetamol,"" he wrote.</span></div>
</div>
The French minister stressed that patients already being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs should ask advice from their doctor.
Paracetamol must be taken strictly according to the recommended dose, because too much of it can damage the liver.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected around 190,000 people worldwide and killed more than 7,800, causes mild symptoms in most people, but can result in pneumonia and in some cases severe illness that can lead to multiple organ failure.
Even before the pandemic, French authorities sounded the alarm over serious ""infectious complications"" linked to the use of ibuprofen, which is sold under various brands like Nurofen and Advil, and other anti-inflammatory drugs.
A spokesperson for British pharmaceutical company Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Nurofen,<a href=""https://www.rb.com/media/news/2020/march/response-to-speculation-regarding-ibuprofen/""> said in an email statement </a>that the company was aware of concerns raised about ""the use of steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) products, including ibuprofen, for the alleviation of COVID-19 symptoms.""
""Consumer safety is our number one priority,"" the spokesperson said, stressing that ""ibuprofen is a well-established medicine that has been used safely as a self-care fever and pain reducer, including in viral illnesses, for more than 30 years.""
""We do not currently believe there is any proven scientific evidence linking over-the-counter use of ibuprofen to the aggravation of COVID-19,"" the statement said.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","TITUSVILLE, N.J., March 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) today announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ponesimod for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).
Ponesimod is an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator that inhibits S1P protein activity and in so doing is believed to reduce the number of circulating lymphocytes that can cross the blood-brain barrier. In patients with MS, the movement of immune cells into the brain damages myelin, the protective sheath that insulates nerve cells. Damage to myelin slows or halts nerve conduction, producing the neurologic signs and symptoms of MS.i
“Nearly 1 million people over the age of 18 in the U.S. live with MSii, and approximately 85 percent of people with the condition are initially diagnosed with relapsing MS.iii Despite new advancements and treatments coming to market, a number of unmet needs still remain – leaving patients struggling to manage often-debilitating symptoms,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “In the coming months, we’ll work closely with the FDA to bring ponesimod one step closer to the MS patient community and remain encouraged by its superior efficacy profile – specifically in reducing new inflammatory lesions and disability accumulation – in comparison to a leading therapy on the market.”
The NDA is based on the head-to-head OPTIMUM Phase 3 study, which showed superior efficacy of ponesimod 20 mg on the primary endpoint of reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR), as well as most secondary endpoints, compared to Aubagio® (teriflunomide) 14 mg in adults with relapsing MS.
At week 108, a highly statistically significant reduction of 30.5 percent on ARR was observed with ponesimod when compared to Aubagio®. Additionally, a statistically significant reduction of fatigue symptoms and a 56 percent reduction on combined unique active lesions (CUALs) in the brain were observed with ponesimod compared to Aubagio®. The safety profile observed for ponesimod was consistent with previous studies of ponesimod and the known safety profile for other S1P receptor modulators.
“What’s interesting about MS is that symptoms are not always visible. Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of MS and yet, it’s one of the most challenging to manage and treat,” said Husseini Manji, M.D., F.R.C.P.C., Global Therapeutic Area Head for Neuroscience at Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We were thrilled to see improvement in fatigue-related symptoms as part of the Phase 3 OPTIMUM trial as we know the profound impact it may have on a person’s daily life. The improvement in fatigue, coupled with reduction in ARR, demonstrate great promise for ponesimod with patients seeking a more targeted treatment option.”
The clinical study data that supports this filing was presented in September 2019 at the 35th Congress of The European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis Conference (ECTRIMS) in Stockholm, Sweden. More information may be found here.
About Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
MS is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system affecting 2.3 million people worldwide,iv with females more impacted than males.v The disease is characterized by demyelinationii and axonal loss leading to neurological impairment and severe disability.vi Relapsing forms of MS, which make up 85 percent of all MS cases, include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS.vii In addition to the debilitating neurological symptoms of the disease, patients often also suffer from “hidden symptoms,” namely fatigue and depression, both of which are major contributors to the reduced quality of life.viii Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of MS, occurring in about 80 percent of people.ix
Relapses are defined as new, worsening or recurrent neurological symptoms that last for more than 24 hours with the absence of fever or infections. Relapses may be fully resolved over days or weeks or lead to persistent residual deficits and accumulation of disability.x

<div class=""news-description"">
<strong>OSLO, NORWAY, March 18, 2020</strong> – CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, today announced its seventh COVID-19 vaccine project. CEPI will be investing an initial US$620,000 in a partnering agreement with The University of Hong Kong (HKU) to rapidly develop a vaccine candidate against COVID-19. This collaboration brings CEPI’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine R&amp;D to $24.3 million.
CEPI will provide initial funding to HKU to undertake preclinical testing of their vaccine candidate and will consider additional funding for further clinical testing pending results of these preclinical studies.
To date, CEPI has provided initial funding to <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/curevac-and-cepi-extend-their-cooperation-to-develop-a-vaccine-against-coronavirus-ncov-2019/"">Curevac Inc.</a>, <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019/"">Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.</a>, <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019/"">Moderna, Inc.</a>, <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-expands-investment-in-covid-19-vaccine-development/"">Novavax, Inc.</a>, <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-expands-investment-in-covid-19-vaccine-development/"">The University of Oxford</a> and <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019/"">The University of Queensland</a> to develop COVID-19 vaccine candidates.

&nbsp;
<h5>Urgent call for US$2 billion to develop COVID-19 vaccine</h5>
On March 6, CEPI issued an urgent call for $2 billion of new funding to enable the organisation to expand the number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development and to fund the clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. Our ambition is to have at least 3 vaccine candidates, which could be submitted to regulatory authorities for licensure for general use/use in outbreaks.
To date, the Governments of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and the UK have committed over $185 million towards our COVID-19 vaccine development efforts. CEPI still urgently needs additional financial contributions to ensure that the vaccine programmes we have initiated can continue to progress at their current pace. We call on other sovereign states, private sector partners, and philanthropies around the world to invest in CEPI’s crucial push to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 virus.
Detailed information about our funding needs is available <a href=""https://cepi.net/news_cepi/2-billion-required-to-develop-a-vaccine-against-the-covid-19-virus/"">here</a>.
&nbsp;
<h5>CEPI’s commitment to access</h5>
As COVID-19 demonstrates, infectious diseases utterly ignore political borders. We cannot prevent or stop a global infectious disease threat without equitable access to globally fair allocation of vaccines. CEPI is wholly committed to equitable access. This commitment drives every aspect of our work and the way we are approaching COVID-19 vaccine development.  CEPI’s support for equitable access is key to our success as a global health organisation. Equitable access to epidemic vaccines—in the context of an outbreak—means that appropriate vaccines are first available to populations when and where they are needed to end an outbreak or curtail an epidemic, regardless of ability to pay. The COVID-19 vaccines that we are developing will exist for the benefit of all humanity, in rich, middle income, and poor countries alike.
&nbsp;
<h5>About CEPI</h5>
CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has reached over US$750 million of its $1 billion funding target. CEPI’s priority diseases include Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invests in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (ie, Disease X). To date, CEPI has committed to investing nearly $480 million in vaccine and platform development.

&nbsp;
<h5>CEPI’s work on COVID-19</h5>
The rapid global spread and unique epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are deeply concerning. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO, who is leading the development of a coordinated international response. So far, we have initiated 7 partnerships to improve our understanding and to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes will leverage rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships. The aim is to advance COVID-19 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b><i>-- Pediatric approval of protease inhibitor-free, pan-genotypic, pan-fibrotic, once-daily regimen supports HCV elimination efforts by providing critical option for broad range of populations --</i></b></p>
FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Epclusa<sup>®</sup>(sofosbuvir 400mg/velpatasvir 100mg; sofosbuvir 200mg/velpatasvir 50 mg) for the treatment of people with chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) as young as 6 years of age or weighing at least 17 kg, regardless of HCV genotype or liver disease severity. The recommended dosage of Epclusa in children ages 6 years and older is based on weight and liver function. Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic, protease inhibitor-free regimen approved in the United States for adults and children.
In the United States, there are approximately 23,000-46,000 children living with HCV. Children born to mothers with HCV are a growing concern, increasing in prevalence by 60 percent from 2011 to 2014. Additionally, engagement in high-risk practices, such as intravenous drug use, is an increasingly common route of HCV transmission in adolescents and young adults.
“While the treatment of HCV has been transformed in recent years, physicians caring for some children have still needed to take several factors into consideration, including genotype and liver disease severity, when selecting the appropriate treatment plan,” said Kathleen B Schwarz, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “The expanded approval of Epclusa can help eligible children living with HCV combat this life-threatening and debilitating disease.”
The approval of Epclusa is based on data from a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial (Study 1143) that enrolled 175 children who were treated with Epclusa for 12 weeks, of which 173 were included in the efficacy analysis. In children 12 to &lt;18 years old, treatment with Epclusa resulted in a cure rate (SVR12) of 93 percent (71/76) in those with genotype 1 HCV infection and 100 percent in those with genotype 2 (6/6), genotype 3 (12/12), genotype 4 (2/2) and genotype 6 (6/6) HCV infection. In children 6 to &lt;12 years old, the SVR rate was 93 percent (50/54) in those with genotype 1 HCV infection, 91 percent (10/11) in those with genotype 3 HCV infection, and 100 percent in those with genotype 2 (2/2) and genotype 4 (4/4) HCV infection. The safety profile of Epclusa in children 6 years of age and older treated was generally consistent with that observed in clinical trials in adults. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10 percent, all grades) observed with treatment with Epclusa for 12 weeks in adults are headache and fatigue.
“Gilead’s continued commitment to HCV elimination includes bringing our medicines to the most difficult-to-cure populations and today’s decision by the FDA represents an important step toward that goal,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “With consistently high cure rates in clinical trials and in the real world, Epclusa has the potential to help many of the children living with HCV in the United States.”
For adults, Epclusa was first approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2016. A line extension application for the use of Epclusa in children aged 6 to &lt;18 years of age is currently under review with the EMA.
The U.S. product label for Epclusa contains a BOXED WARNING for the risk of hepatitis B reactivation in HCV/HBV co-infected patients. See below for U.S. Important Safety Information.
<b>IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR THE USE OF EPCLUSA</b>
<b>BOXED WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN HCV/HBV COINFECTED PATIENTS</b>
Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating treatment with EPCLUSA. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals (DAAs) and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive, in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV, and also in patients receiving certain immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV DAAs may be increased in patients taking these other agents. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.
<b>Contraindications</b>
If EPCLUSA is used in combination with ribavirin (RBV), all contraindications, warnings and precautions, in particular pregnancy avoidance, and adverse reactions to RBV also apply. Refer to RBV prescribing information.
<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>
<b>Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone:</b> Amiodarone is not recommended for use with EPCLUSA due to the risk of symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in patients also taking beta blockers or with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or with advanced liver disease. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir containing regimen. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. Patients should seek immediate medical evaluation if they develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia.
<b>Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers and/or Moderate to Potent Inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 or CYP3A4:</b> Rifampin, St. John’s wort and carbamazepine are not recommended for use with EPCLUSA as they may significantly decrease sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir plasma concentrations.
<b>Adverse Reactions</b>
The most common adverse reactions (=10%, all grades) with EPCLUSA were headache and fatigue; and when used with RBV in decompensated cirrhotics were fatigue, anemia, nausea, headache, insomnia, and diarrhea.
<b>Drug Interactions</b>

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">March 18, 2020</span> /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the company's molecular test for novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Abbott is immediately shipping 150,000 Abbott RealTi<i>m</i>e SARS-CoV-2 EUA tests to existing customers in the U.S. The tests are used on the company's <i>m</i>2000™ RealTi<i>m</i>e System. Abbott will be working with health systems and government authorities to deploy additional <i>m</i>2000 systems where they are needed.
""A global challenge like coronavirus requires the commitment and cooperation of everyone who has the ability to help address it,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Miles D. White</span>, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. ""I'm proud of the Abbott team and what they've accomplished in such a short period of time, and I want to thank the Administration and the FDA for their partnership in making this happen.""
<b>Accelerating testing to help combat the pandemic </b>
As a leader in diagnostics testing, Abbott is working to do its part to combat this global pandemic. Across the U.S., more than 175 <i>m</i>2000 systems are used in hospital and reference laboratories. The systems have the ability to run high volumes of up to 470 tests in 24 hours, helping to meet the increasing demand for testing. Many of these instruments are used in university and community hospitals where patients come for care, resulting in testing that happens closer to the patient rather than sending it to an offsite lab. Abbott is immediately distributing 150,000 tests and will continue ramping up production to the highest levels possible, with the goal of providing up to 1 million tests per week. Abbott is manufacturing these tests in the U.S.
<b>About the <i>m</i>2000 Molecular Platform</b>
The Abbott <i>m</i>2000 RealTi<i>m</i>e System is a molecular solution featuring a broad menu of tests, including ones for infectious diseases. The platform uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, which amplifies a single piece (or few copies of a piece) of DNA to quickly and accurately diagnose a patient. The <i>m</i>2000 is currently used in labs around the world.
<b>About Abbott's Diagnostics Leadership</b>
Abbott has long been a global leader in infectious disease testing, including the development of the first HIV test. The company created a Global Surveillance Program 25 years ago to monitor HIV and hepatitis viruses and identify mutations to ensure the company's tests remain up to date. Abbott also has a long-standing discovery program that identifies new or unknown pathogens and develops tests to address these new threats.

[3/19/2020] FDA is aware of news reports stating the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, could worsen coronavirus disease (COVID-19). These news reports followed a March 11, 2020 letter in <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2213-2600%2820%2930116-8"">The Lancet medical </a><a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2213-2600%2820%2930116-8"">journal</a><a class=""ext-disclaimer"" href=""http://www.fda.gov/about-fda/website-policies/website-disclaimer""><span class=""sr-only"">External</span></a><a class=""ext-disclaimer"" href=""http://www.fda.gov/about-fda/website-policies/website-disclaimer""><span class=""sr-only""> Link Disclaimer</span></a>, which hypothesized that an enzyme (a molecule that aids a biochemical reaction in the body) is increased by NSAIDs and could aggravate COVID-19 symptoms.
At this time, FDA is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, with worsening COVID-19 symptoms. The agency is investigating this issue further and will communicate publicly when more information is available. However, all prescription NSAID labels warn that “the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.”
For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are multiple over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. FDA suggests speaking to your health care professional if you are concerned about taking NSAIDs and rely on these medications to treat chronic diseases.
FDA advises the public to read the full <a title=""OTC Drug Facts Label"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-information-consumers/otc-drug-facts-label"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""a075d5a6-0d1d-4021-aae6-6904d83acc20"">Drug Facts Label</a> on OTC medications prior to use. OTC medications are safe and effective when you follow the directions on the label and/or as directed by your health care professional. Patients who use prescription drugs should take these medications as directed by your health care professional and in accordance with instructions on the label.
FDA encourages health care professionals and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of any medication to FDA’s <a title=""MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""0785221e-cef4-4465-8621-b77dcb1032b6"">MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting</a> program:

&nbsp;
<strong>CAMBRIDGE, MA, March 18, 2020 —</strong> BGI Genomics. Co. Ltd. (SZSE:300676) and US subsidiary BGI Americas Corp., today announced that its Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is now commercially available in the United States. With the updated guidance from FDA issued on March 16, BGI’s detection kit is eligible to be used immediately to expedite clinical testing for the novel coronavirus.
BGI is submitting a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its SARS-CoV-2 test and expects to receive formal EUA in the near future. BGI has been in regular communication with the FDA about its testing data since submitting information to the agency more than a week ago.
“We appreciate the FDA’s move to open up the market for our diagnostic test kits,” said BGI Genomics CEO Yin Ye. “Our goal is to deploy our maximum capability to support efforts to contain the virus worldwide. Our technology has been put to the test on the front lines of fighting this novel coronavirus outside the US. We are now bringing rapid and accurate testing capability at scale to bolster detection efforts throughout the US and help more patients receive accurate diagnosis.”
BGI has been on the forefront of testing for SARS-CoV-2. Following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China, BGI was among the first few companies that developed the diagnostic test that received emergency approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) on January 26, 2020, followed by CE-IVD marking on March 2, 2020.  BGI quickly scaled up manufacturing and currently has a daily capacity of up to 300,000 reactions per day. BGI has performed over 500,000 SARS-CoV-2 tests in its own central laboratories in China and is distributing its SARS-CoV-2 detection kits to more than 50 countries and regions around the world.
BGI is bringing its full genomics expertise and resources to the fight against the 2019 novel coronavirus around the world. BGI’s long history of responses to public health crisis events includes decoding the genome of the SARS virus in 2003 and developing the virus detection kit in 96 hours, and helping fight the Ebola outbreak in 2014 in West Africa, where BGI quickly set up a front-line laboratory in Sierra Leone and helped the local team to develop Ebola virus detection kits.
&nbsp;
<strong><em>About EUA</em></strong>
The Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR Kit for Detecting SARS-2019-nCoV has not been FDA cleared or approved. However, the FDA can issue an EUA to permit use of certain medical products that may be effective in diagnosing, treating or preventing a disease or condition, as in the case of the novel coronavirus when the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declares a public health emergency. HHS Secretary Alex Azar declared an emergency for COVID-19 on January 31. The test is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

Shanghai, China, and Osaka, Japan, March 23, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) has announced that the gut-selective biologic Entyvio® (vedolizumab) was approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). The approved indications are for adult patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD) who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to conventional therapies or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) inhibitors.
Entyvio was included in the first batch list of ‘urgently needed’ overseas medicines for accelerated approval by the NMPA in 2018.
Sean Shan, President of Takeda China, said, “Many thanks to the NMPA for officially approving the availability of Entyvio for China’s patients. Its approval brings more treatment options to clinicians, and will enable more IBD patients to return to their normal daily lives.”
“The Chinese government’s determination to significantly improve access of innovative drugs, and to improve peoples’ quality of life is crystal clear. Including Entyvio in the first list of ‘urgently needed’ overseas drugs, and its accelerated approval process is a clear example of this,” Mr. Shan added. “For our part, Takeda is committed to continuing to develop and make available highly innovative medicines and will bring these novel solutions to China’s patients as fast as possible.”
About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).[1]Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, with CD potentially progressing over time.[2],[3] UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.[4],[5] CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.[4],[5] UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.[4],[6] CD commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.[2] The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to UC or CD.[4],[7],[8]
About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations.[9],[10] It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).[11] MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.[12] The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.[11] These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).[11],[13],[14] By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.[11]
Vedolizumab is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa)-antagonist.[9],[10] Vedolizumab has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 415,000 patient years of exposure to date.[15]
Therapeutic Indications for vedolizumab
Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) antagonist.
Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) antagonist.
Important Safety Information for vedolizumab
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Special warnings and special precautions for use
Vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.
Infusion-related reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.
Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the a4ß7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.
Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.
Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.
Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.
Please consult with your local regulatory agency for approved labeling in your country.

<b>Berlin, Germany and New Delhi, India, March 23, 2020 </b>– Bayer and Curadev Pvt. Ltd., a drug discovery company based in India, today announced a research collaboration and license agreement for Curadev’s Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) antagonist program. The collaboration aims to discover new drug candidates for the treatment of lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases and other inflammatory diseases. STING antagonists offer tremendous potential for new treatments as STING is known to play a role in activating the innate immune system in auto-inflammatory diseases.
“In line with our strategy, we continue to deepen our understanding of pathology in disease areas with high unmet medical need and further strengthen our research activities on mechanisms with broader potential, rather than individual indications,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG's Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “We are continuously looking for new breakthroughs to improve patients’ lives and Curadev’s deep experience working on the STING pathway makes them an ideal partner.”
Curadev’s small molecule STING antagonist program aims to discover and develop inhibitors of the intracellular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which can modulate the immune response associated with various auto-inflammatory diseases. As part of the agreement, Bayer will gain exclusive access to novel molecules from Curadev that are designed to inhibit the STING pathway. The companies will collaborate to optimize and advance these molecules, as well as others generated during the collaboration, into clinical development.
“Curadev identified STING as a versatile target where both agonists and antagonists can play an important role in diverse disease conditions,” said Dr. Arjun Surya, Co-Founder &amp; Chief Scientific Officer of Curadev. “The agile and collaborative approach of Bayer in building this partnership convinces us that we have found the ideal partner to develop our portfolio of STING antagonists for various disease indications.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Curadev will receive an upfront payment. In addition, Curadev will receive research funding during the research term and might be eligible for pre-clinical, clinical and sales milestones of potentially over EUR 250 million as well as royalties of single digit percentages of net sales.
The Pharmaceuticals Business Development &amp; Licensing team of Bayer facilitated this collaboration.

<strong>SEATTLE and REDMOND, Wash. — March 20, 2020</strong> <strong>—</strong> Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. (Nasdaq: ADPT) and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) on Friday announced they will leverage their existing partnership mapping population-wide adaptive immune responses to diseases at scale to study COVID-19. Finding the relevant immune response signature may advance solutions to diagnose, treat and prevent the disease, augmenting existing research efforts that primarily focus on the biology of the virus. These data will be made freely available to any researcher, public health official or organization around the world via an open data access portal.
“We can improve our collective understanding of COVID-19 by decoding the immune system’s response to the virus and the disease patterns that can be inferred from studying these data at the population level,” said Chad Robins, CEO and co-founder of Adaptive Biotechnologies. “Immune response data may enable detection of the virus in infected people not showing symptoms and improve triaging of newly diagnosed patients, potentially solving two of the challenges we are facing in the current diagnostic paradigm.”
<p class="""">To generate immune response data, Adaptive will open enrollment in April to collect de-identified blood samples, using a LabCorp-enabled mobile phlebotomy service, from individuals diagnosed with or recovered from COVID-19 in a virtual clinical trial managed by Covance. Immune cell receptors from these blood samples will be sequenced using Illumina platform technology and mapped to SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens that will have been confirmed by Adaptive’s proprietary immune medicine platform to induce an immune response. The immune response signature found from the initial discovery work and the initial set of samples will be uploaded to the open data access portal. Leveraging Microsoft’s hyperscale machine learning capabilities and the Azure cloud platform, the accuracy of the immune response signature will be continuously improved and updated online in real time as more trial samples are sequenced from the study.</p>
To expedite the development and relevance of the immune response signature across the global population, the companies are seeking additional participation from institutions and research groups around the world to contribute blood samples to this open data initiative. Providence, a large health system with 51 hospitals, including the one near Seattle that treated the first U.S. COVID-19 patient, is an initial clinical collaborator.
“The solution to COVID-19 is not likely going to come from one person, one company or one country. This is a global issue, and it will be a global effort to solve it,” said <a href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/?p=52551358"">Peter Lee, corporate vice president, AI and Research, Microsoft</a>. “Making critical information about the immune response accessible to the broader research community will help advance ongoing and new efforts to solve this global public health crisis, and we can accomplish this goal through our proven TCR-Antigen mapping partnership with Adaptive.”
Timing and enrollment details about the upcoming study and the open data access portal will be coming soon. Institutions or collaborators interested in contributing blood samples can direct inquiries to COVID19ImmuneResponse@adaptivebiotech.com.

<strong>About the Adaptive and Microsoft partnership</strong>
Adaptive and Microsoft partnered in 2018 to create a TCR-Antigen Map, an approach to translating the genetics of the adaptive immune system to understand at scale how it works. Together we are using immunosequencing and machine learning to map T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences to diseases and disease-associated antigens. Using these data, we aim to develop a blood test for the early and accurate detection of many diseases, translating the natural diagnostic capability of the immune system into the clinic. In 2019, we confirmed clinical signals in two diseases, and established our first proof of concept in Lyme Disease. We expect to submit our first clinical application to the FDA in 2020.
<strong>About Adaptive Biotechnologies</strong>
Adaptive Biotechnologies is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on harnessing the inherent biology of the adaptive immune system to transform the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We believe the adaptive immune system is nature’s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our proprietary immune medicine platform reveals and translates the massive genetics of the adaptive immune system with scale, precision and speed to develop products in life sciences research, clinical diagnostics, and drug discovery. We have two commercial products, and a robust clinical pipeline to diagnose, monitor and enable the treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases. Our goal is to develop and commercialize immune-driven clinical products tailored to each individual patient.

<p align=""justify"">SAN DIEGO, March 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, ""Sorrento"") announced it has produced a preclinical batch of the STI-4398 (COVIDTRAP) protein to immediately commence testing its neutralization and blocking activity in preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus from infecting ACE2-expressing cells.</p>
STI-4398 is a proprietary ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)-Fc fusion protein (COVIDTRAP). The STI-4398 protein binds to the S1 domain of the spike protein, which is expected to block the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to bind the ACE2 receptors present on the target respiratory epithelial cells. Without the ability to penetrate target cells, the SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot replicate and spread itself. By interfering with the viral infection cycle, STI-4398 might be the most effective way to prevent an infection to progress to a fully advanced COVID-19 disease. This approach could be ideal in generating passive immunity and shielding at-risk populations, including healthcare providers, the elderly population or patients with compromised immune systems, from developing the COVID-19 disease after viral exposure.
The STI-4398 COVIDTRAP preserves the ACE2 enzyme activity in converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, resulting in reduced vasoconstriction and increased blood flow to the infected lung tissue. It could potentially confer organ protection and lessen severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Although STI-4398’s primary functionality is to interfere with the viral infection cycle, the COVIDTRAP protein with active ACE2 enzyme may have therapeutic potential for late-stage COVID-19 disease.
STI-4398 has been engineered to have a prolonged half-life in the human blood circulation, which may allow it to be used prophylactically to confer short-term and durable passive immunity (with repeated doses) to those that are regularly exposed to the virus (healthcare workers) or are at particular risk following an exposure event (elderly, patients with hypertension or immune-compromised patients).
In vitro cell studies for SARS-CoVID-2 virus infection and neutralization are expected to be conducted in the next few weeks in collaboration with world-leading coronavirus experts.
Sorrento scientists are in parallel working speedily to generate a stable CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) manufacturing cell line that would enable high-yield cGMP production of the COVIDTRAP fusion protein. Sorrento’s approximately 300,000 square feet of state-of-the-art R&amp;D and cGMP facilities in San Diego, CA and Suzhou, China are dedicated to therapeutic antibodies and protein production and cell therapies, as well as its fill-and-finish cGMP facilities. These existing manufacturing infrastructures and capacity are available for rapid and significant scaled-up manufacturing to meet emergency demand following successful human trials. Sorrento currently anticipates it will complete the enabling studies for an expedited IND filing in the next few months.
“The COVIDTRAP candidate product developed by our scientists in the past month follows the similar approach we take to developing immune-oncology products for suppressing and/or killing off cancer cells by targeting specific tumor targets on cancer cells. We believe the same approach works for deadly viral diseases,” stated Dr. Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “Our immuno-therapy expertise is relevant and applicable to the COVID-19 disease. We are looking forward to quickly demonstrating our COVIDTRAP’s safety and efficacy in IND-enabling preclinical studies and clinical trials and make this potentially life-saving medicine available in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.”

<div class=""bw-release-story"">
INCHEON, South Korea--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Celltrion Group today announced key milestones in its efforts to fight the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As part of its emergency preparedness plan to address the outbreak, which has infected over 200,000 people worldwide,<sup>1,2</sup> Celltrion has successfully completed the first step of developing an antiviral treatment to fight COVID-19 and aims to launch a rapid self-testing diagnostic kit that could provide results within 15-20 minutes.
Celltrion has been selected as a preferred developer for a monoclonal antibody project to treat and prevent COVID-19 by the Korea Centers for Disease Control (KCDC). Korea was one of the first countries to be affected by the global pandemic.<sup>3</sup> Celltrion has identified the library of antibodies sourced from the blood of recovered patients in Korea, which are thought to be involved in neutralising the virus and may contribute to recovery from COVID-19. These antibodies are undergoing further screening processes to identify those that are most effective in neutralising the virus causing COVID-19. Once identified these will form the basis of the antiviral treatment to be tested through pre-clinical and clinical trials around the world in the third quarter of 2020.
Furthermore, Celltrion plans to develop a ‘super antibody’ that can attach and neutralise all kinds of coronavirus related strains, such as those causing COVID-19 and SARS, enabling further protection against unforeseen or unexpected mutations. Celltrion hopes the ‘super antibody’ candidate could contribute towards preparedness for potential future pandemic situations.
Alongside therapeutic antibody development, Celltrion aims to launch a rapid self-testing diagnostic kit in the summer of this year. The kit will focus on the gene that encodes the surface spike (S) protein; an essential glycoprotein for viral entry into human host cells. The kit is designed to show results within 15-20 minutes, with optimised sensitivity, specificity and improved accuracy features. Once it has gained a CE mark, the rapid self-testing diagnostic kit will become available throughout Europe through Celltrion Healthcare. Celltrion plans to apply for device authorisation from the FDA in the US and other regulatory authorities after acquiring relevant data.
Ki-Sung Kwon, Head of R&amp;D Division at Celltrion said, “Our COVID-19 antiviral treatment is designed to train the immune system to make antibodies that recognise and block the spike protein that the virus uses to enter human cells. Antibodies that bond to the COVID-19 antigen will also be used to develop a diagnostic kit. We implemented an emergency preparedness plan at the very start of the COVID-19 outbreak leveraging our unique antibody discovery, development and manufacturing technologies. We remain dedicated to supporting healthcare systems across the world and innovating to support patients throughout this pandemic.”

REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Codexis, Inc., a leading protein engineering company and developer of novel biotherapeutics, announces the signing of a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) for the research and development of novel gene therapies for certain disease indications, including the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and blood factor deficiencies.
Under the terms of the agreement, Codexis will generate novel gene sequences encoding protein variants tailored to enhance efficacy as a result of increased activity, stability, and cellular uptake using its CodeEvolver<sup>®</sup> protein engineering platform. Takeda will combine these improved transgenes with its gene therapy capabilities to generate novel candidates for the treatment of rare genetic disorders.
“Our CodeEvolver<sup>®</sup> platform technology enables the rapid engineering of novel genetic sequences that encode more efficacious proteins. The prospects of these improved sequences for the development of differentiated gene therapies for patients with rare diseases therefore holds great promise,” stated John Nicols, Codexis’ President and CEO. “Takeda’s expertise in developing novel treatments for patients with rare genetic disorders, and its commitment to developing the best possible gene therapies, makes them an ideal partner for our growing Novel Biotherapeutics business unit.”
Gjalt Huisman, Codexis’ Senior Vice-President, and General Manager, Novel Biotherapeutics added, “We are looking forward to working with Takeda to advance our pre-clinical assets for lysosomal storage disorders, and to broaden our biotherapeutics pipeline to now include blood factor disorders.”
<strong>Terms of Agreement</strong>
Under the terms of the agreement, the parties will begin collaborative work on three initial programs. Codexis is responsible for the creation of novel enzyme sequences for advancement as gene therapies into pre-clinical development. Takeda is responsible for the pre-clinical and clinical development and commercialization of gene therapy products resulting from the collaboration programs. Under the terms of the agreement, in addition to the three initial programs, Takeda may initiate up to four additional programs for separate target indications. Subject to the terms of the agreement, Codexis is eligible to receive an upfront payment, reimbursement for research and development fees, development and commercial milestone payments, and low- to mid-single digit percentage royalties on sales of any commercial product developed through such initial programs and any other programs that Takeda may elect under the agreement. Back Bay Life Science Advisors served as strategic and financial advisors to Codexis.

<b>Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
</b>This communication contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

<strong>Roche response to COVID-19 pandemic</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>Roche accelerates delivery and production of Actemra</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Roche is working around the clock to increase availability of COVID 19-tests</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Roche calls on governments across the world to work closely with industry to keep manufacturing and supply running
</strong></li>
</ul>
Basel, 24 March 2020 - Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today provided an update on the various actions the company is taking to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
<strong>
</strong><strong>Roche initiates global phase III study and collects data on Actemra’s potential utility in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients</strong>
On March 19, 2020, Roche confirmed initiation of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the US Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). The study, COVACTA, will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) on top of standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo on top of standard of care.
This is the first global study of Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. In addition to the Roche trial, Roche is also carefully following independently-led clinical trials, on multiple medicines including Actemra, that are taking place around the world.
At the moment, there are no robust, well-controlled studies showing safety and efficacy of Actemra in clinical treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, and Actemra is not currently approved for this use.
<strong>Actemra Manufacturing and Supply</strong>
Despite some of the supply and logistics challenges due to COVID-19, Roche has been able to continue to deliver life-saving medicines to patients around the world, thanks to the resilience of its global network. Currently, we continue to see limited disruption, and are continually monitoring the situation.
With the announcement of new clinical trials, and a potential increase in demand for Actemra, Roche is working urgently to accelerate manufacturing capacity to maximize production of Actemra wherever possible with the goal of increasing available supply globally.
While Roche is ensuring a coordinated, global overview of additional supply requests, provision of medicines is managed on a country level according to local rules and regulations and in close collaboration with the authorities.
<strong>Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test to detect the novel virus that causes COVID-19 disease</strong>
As a leader in diagnostics, Roche is committed to providing testing solutions for the world’s most challenging healthcare emergencies. On March 12, 2020, Roche received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test to detect the novel virus that causes COVID-19 disease. The test is also available in markets accepting the CE mark.
Roche is committed to delivering as many tests as possible within the limits of supply and delivering its coronavirus tests to areas where they can be immediately effective. Tests will be shipped from Roche’s production sites to locations where appropriate infrastructure is in place and testing can begin without delay.
At the current maximum production rate, Roche can supply millions of tests per month on the cobas 6800/8800 instruments and on the MagnaPure / Lightcycler solution. Roche is working around the clock to increase that quantity as the company recognises the importance of patients having access to these critical tests.
To safeguard supply, Roche strongly advises to focus COVID-19 testing on patients with signs and symptoms of the disease, not broad testing of the healthy population.
<strong>Industry, governments and society must work together to tackle this pandemic</strong>
Roche is committed to doing all we can to ensure adequate supply of our medicines and tests during this pandemic, but we cannot do it alone. Roche is calling on governments across the world to work closely with industry to keep manufacturing and supply running, and to help us meet demand across the globe.
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Ensure the free flow of vital goods across national borders to keep manufacturing and supply running;</li>
 	<li>Consider pragmatic temporary adjustments to regulations on packaging, reviews,
customs etc, to expedite delivery of urgently needed medical supplies;</li>
 	<li>Work together across governments internationally, in order to balance global needs.</li>
</ul>

<div class=""node__content""><b>Collaboration to leverage synergies between Monoclonal Antibody and Non-Viral Gene Delivery Platforms</b>
<p align=""justify"">SAN DIEGO and BOSTON, March 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In response to the government call for rapidly deployable countermeasures, Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, Sorrento) and SmartPharm Therapeutics Inc. (SmartPharm) today announced a research and development collaboration to develop a next-generation, gene-encoded antibody vaccine for COVID-19. The collaboration will utilize monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus discovered and/or generated by Sorrento that will be encoded into a gene for delivery utilizing SmartPharm’s non-viral nanoparticle platform.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Over the past 10+ years, Sorrento has extensively utilized the G-MABTM Library, one of the largest and most diverse fully human antibody libraries in the biopharma space, for discovering potent immuno-oncology and anti-infective antibodies against over 100 drug targets. In the effort to more quickly resolve the global COVID-19 crisis, our company has initiated a rapidly accelerated program for the identification of potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antigens that may be used for either treatment or prophylaxis,” said Henry Ji, CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “We expect our platform to produce many candidate neutralizing antibodies for SmartPharm to incorporate into its powerful gene delivery platform. We look forward to our partnership with SmartPharm as part of our goal to make a meaningful impact in this truly global effort.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“As a company founded by infectious disease physicians, including myself, we are passionate about applying our novel gene delivery platform to this national and global health crisis,” said Jose Trevejo CEO of SmartPharm Therapeutics. “Given the disproportionate mortality in elderly and immune-compromised, it is critical that we develop novel technologies that will better protect our populations that are particularly vulnerable to severe coronavirus infection.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Unlike classical antigen-based vaccines, which rely on a patient’s immune system to establish efficacy, SmartPharm’s gene-encoded antibody platform is designed to directly neutralize the coronavirus by producing the protective antibody directly in the muscle of the individual. This gene-encoded monoclonal antibody delivery platform or Gene MAb™ bypasses the in vitro antigen production process and potential for vaccine-induced side-effects in immunized individuals. This is especially important in susceptible populations like the elderly, where antigen-based vaccines are significantly less effective for the prevention of respiratory infections such as influenza or coronavirus. The companies expect that this novel approach will enable faster progression to clinic, pending agreement with the FDA.</p>
<p align=""justify"">As part of the collaboration, Sorrento and SmartPharm expect to develop a gene-encoded antibody or antibodies that can be administered as a prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plans for the collaboration may include candidate development as well as filing of an IND application in the next few months.</p>

Genentech will also provide 10,000 vials of Actemra to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile
Current U.S. supply of Actemra for approved indications is not expected to be impacted
<b>South San Francisco, CA -- March 23, 2020 --</b>
Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra<sup>®</sup> (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
Additionally, to further support U.S. COVID-19 response efforts, Genentech will provide 10,000 vials of Actemra to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile for potential future use at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The company has robust business continuity and mitigation strategies in place, and current U.S. supply of Actemra for approved indications is not expected to be impacted. Genentech has also been working with distributors to manage product supply to enable both Genentech and our distribution partners to quickly fill orders to meet patient needs.
“We thank the FDA for rapidly expediting the approval of this clinical trial to evaluate Actemra in critically ill patients suffering from pneumonia following coronavirus infection and we’re moving forward to enroll as quickly as possible,” said Alexander Hardy, chief executive officer of Genentech. “Conducting this clinical trial in partnership with BARDA and providing Actemra to support the national stockpile, through the efforts of Secretary Azar and HHS, are important examples of how the U.S. government the biotechnology industry and healthcare communities are working together in response to this public health crisis.”
To date, several independent clinical trials have begun globally to explore the efficacy and safety of Actemra for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, this new trial is vital because there are no well-controlled studies and limited published evidence on the safety or efficacy of Actemra in the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19. In addition, Actemra is not currently approved for this use by the FDA.

<strong>About the Clinical Trial</strong>
Genentech is initiating a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (COVACTA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra added to standard of care in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. The primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) variables. Patients will be followed for 60 days post-randomization, and an interim analysis will be conducted to look for early evidence of efficacy.
<strong>About Actemra</strong>
Actemra was the first humanized interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have used one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate (MTX), that did not provide enough relief. The extensive Actemra RA IV clinical development program included five Phase III clinical studies and enrolled more than 4,000 people with RA in 41 countries. The Actemra RA subcutaneous clinical development program included two Phase III clinical studies and enrolled more than 1,800 people with RA in 33 countries. Actemra subcutaneous injection is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and for patients two years of age and older with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) or active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA). In addition, Actemra is also approved in the IV formulation for patients two years of age and older with active PJIA, SJIA or CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Actemra is not approved for subcutaneous use in people with CRS. It is not known if Actemra is safe and effective in children with PJIA, SJIA or CRS under two years of age or in children with conditions other than PJIA, SJIA or CRS.
Actemra is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare practitioner.
<strong>Important Safety Information</strong>
<strong>Actemra can cause serious side effects. Actemra changes the way a patient’s immune system works. This can make a patient more likely to get infections or make any current infection worse. Some people taking Actemra have died from these infections.</strong>
<strong>Actemra can cause other serious side effects. These include:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Tears of the stomach or intestines</li>
 	<li>Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)</li>
 	<li>Changes in blood test results, including low neutrophil (white blood cells) and platelet (platelets help the blood to clot) counts, and increases in certain liver function test levels and blood cholesterol levels</li>
 	<li>An increased risk of certain cancers by changing the way a patient’s immune system works</li>
 	<li>Hepatitis B infection</li>
 	<li>Serious allergic reactions, including death. These may happen with Actemra infusions or injections, even if they did not occur with an earlier infusion or injection. If a patient has had hives, a rash, or experienced flushing after injecting, the patient should tell their doctor or nurse before their next injection</li>
 	<li>Nervous system problems</li>
</ul>

The QIAstat-Dx test kit can differentiate the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from 20 other respiratory infections in patients who may have similar symptoms in a single testing run of about one hour. It is a multiplexed nucleic acid test that evaluates samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. This new panel includes assays targeting two genes used to detect SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen behind the disease.
“We are pleased to begin making QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 test kits available in the United States as the first syndromic test not only to detect SARS-CoV-2, but also a range of more than 20 other respiratory targets. This is an important step in our commitment to offer a range of solutions to support the public health fight against COVID-19 and dramatically ramp up production,” said Thierry Bernard, Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN. “Our teams have responded rapidly to the challenge, implementing 24/7 production of test components, adding staff and investing in expanding production capacity. In addition to QIAstat-Dx, we are supplying RNA extraction kits to the U.S. and other countries around the world, and are committed to accelerating these efforts.”

<em>- </em><em>CytomX to Receive $80 Million Upfront Payment and</em>
<em>Ability to Exercise Option for U.S. Co-Commercialization Rights -</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and TOKYO, March 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytomX Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTMX, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Sean McCarthy, D. Phil. “CytomX”) and Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) today announced they have entered into a strategic collaboration agreement focused on the discovery, research, development and commercialization of novel T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies targeting CD3 and tumor cell surface antigens for the treatment of cancer.  The parties will utilize CytomX’s Probody<sup>®</sup> therapeutic technology platform, as well as its proprietary bispecific formats and CD3 modules.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“This collaboration with Astellas leverages CytomX’s deep expertise in targeting multiple antibody modalities to the tumor microenvironment,” said Sean McCarthy, D. Phil., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of CytomX. “We are excited about the use of our technology to assist Astellas in unlocking the potential of T-cell engaging bispecifics in the treatment of solid tumors, building on the growing proof of concept we have established for our platform.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“At Astellas, immuno-oncology is a Primary Focus of our research and development strategy, and we are working on the development of next-generation cancer immuno-therapy using new modalities/technologies,” stated Naoki Okamura, Representative Director Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Astellas.“We look forward to the collaboration with CytomX, which will enable us to leverage both companies capabilities and expand our next-generation immuno-oncology therapeutic pipeline as we continue to dedicate our efforts to deliver innovative treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">Probody<sup>®</sup> therapeutics are designed to remain inactive until they are activated by proteases in the tumor microenvironment. As a result, Probody<sup>®</sup> therapeutics are designed to bind selectively to tumors and minimize binding to healthy tissue, thereby reducing toxicities and potentially creating safer, more effective therapies. Probody T-cell engaging bispecifics are antibody constructs capable of directing cytotoxic T-cells to tumor microenvironments, leading to cell-mediated anti-cancer activity.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the agreement, CytomX and Astellas will collaborate on several initial programs.  CytomX will lead research and discovery activities, up to clinical candidate selection, that will be funded by Astellas. Astellas will lead and fund preclinical and clinical development and commercialization activities. Astellas will make an upfront cash payment of $80 million to CytomX with CytomX eligible to receive future preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones of over $1.6 billion. CytomX is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on global net sales that range from high-single digits to mid-teens.</p>
<p align=""justify"">For a specified number of targets, prior to the initiation of the first pivotal clinical trial for a product directed toward such target, CytomX may exercise an option to co-fund a pre-determined portion of clinical development costs. For these products, CytomX is eligible to receive a pre-specified portion of profits in the United States and tiered low-double digit to mid-teen percentage royalties on net sales outside of the United States. CytomX may later elect to co-commercialize the products directed toward such targets in the United States.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About CytomX Therapeutics</strong>
CytomX is a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company with a vision of transforming lives with safer, more effective therapies. We are developing a novel class of investigational antibody therapeutic candidates, based on our Probody technology platform, for the treatment of cancer. As leaders in the field, our innovative technology is designed to turn previously undruggable targets into druggable targets and to enable more effective combination therapies. CytomX and its partners, comprised of leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, have developed a robust pipeline of potential best-in-class immunotherapeutic candidates against clinically validated targets and potential first-in-class therapeutic candidates against novel, difficult to drug targets. Five novel drug-candidates utilizing our Probody technology are in the clinic, with three in Phase 2 studies and two in Phase 1 studies. These clinical programs include cancer immunotherapeutic candidates against validated targets such as a PD-L1-targeting Probody therapeutic wholly owned by CytomX (CX-072) and a CTLA-4-targeting Probody therapeutic partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS-986249). The CytomX clinical stage pipeline also includes first-in-class Probody drug conjugate product candidates against previously undruggable targets, including a CD166-targeting Probody drug conjugate wholly owned by CytomX (CX-2009) and a CD71-targeting Probody drug conjugate partnered with AbbVie (CX-2029). CD166 and CD71 are among cancer targets that are considered to be inaccessible to conventional antibody drug conjugates due to their presence on many healthy tissues. In addition to its wholly owned programs, CytomX has strategic collaborations with AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

<p align=""justify"">SAN DIEGO, March 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, ""Sorrento"") today announced it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with China-based antibody biopharmaceutical company, Mabpharm Limited (Hong Kong Stock Exchange: 2181HK, “Mabpharm”), for the clinical development and commercialization of the ACE-MAB fusion protein (Sorrento’s product code name STI-4920 and Mabpharm’s product code name CMAB020) for the potential treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Mabpharm has generated a fusion protein (CMAB020) that binds to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Designed as a bi-specific fusion protein, ACE-MAB has two functional arms. One arm (Ab) is a fully human antibody that targets the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity. The other arm (TR) is a truncated ACE2 protein that binds to a different epitope of the spike protein. The ACE-MAB fusion protein could also block the receptor binding domain (RBD) with CD147 to mitigate lung inflammation and cytokine storm. The dual-arm design could be a unique advancement, potentially providing binding to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is sufficient to prevent the virus from invading normal human cells. ACE-MAB retains the ACE2 enzymatic function, which could provide benefits such as reduced vasoconstriction and increased blood flow to infected lung tissue. The ACE2 arm competes with RBD binding to respiratory epithelial or other cells. It should preserve the ACE2 enzymatic activity, which is important in maintaining normal blood pressure and healthy blood flow into patients with infected lung tissue, which would include patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Under the exclusive license agreement, Sorrento will focus on the development and commercialization of ACE-MAB in the North American and European markets, while Mabpharm retains rights in the rest of the world, including the China and Japan markets.</p>
“The license of the ACE-MAB fusion protein from our partner Mabpharm provides Sorrento with yet another potential therapeutic agent to combat COVID-19,” stated Dr. Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “Since the breakout of COVID-19, Sorrento has built a broad product candidate pipeline for the potential vaccination and treatment of COVID-19. We are looking forward to further evaluating the safety and efficacy in IND-enabling preclinical studies and clinical trials and making these potentially Life-Saving medicines available to the vast population affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

<strong>Oasmia Pharmaceutical AB and US based Elevar Therapeutics Inc. have signed a global strategic partnership deal regarding the commercialization of Oasmia’s anticancer product Apealea®. The agreement includes milestone payments with a potential of up to USD 678 million depending on Elevar’s achievement of future sales milestones, clinical development milestones and regulatory approval milestones. Elevar will also pay Oasmia double-digit royalties on sales of Apealea®. Oasmia will also receive USD 20 million as an upfront payment.</strong>
</div>
<div class=""mfn-body"">
The worldwide partnership between Oasmia and Elevar grants Elevar the exclusive right to commercialize Apealea®, a proprietary formulation of paclitaxel, in all global territories, with the exception of countries in which Oasmia and its partners are already present including Nordics, Baltics, Russia and some other CIS countries[1] in which Oasmia and its partners will continue to drive the commercialization of the product. The arrangement gives Elevar the right to sub-license Apealea<strong>®</strong> to other strategic partners, including, for example, in Europe.
Elevar will be responsible for all regulatory application processes in its territory, including the submission of the approval application to the FDA in the US.
The collaboration between the two companies will include a joint steering committee and working teams in order to optimize the global development, launch and commercialization processes. The partnership will build upon Oasmia’s product development strategy for Apealea<strong>®</strong>, and exploring possible new indications.
Oasmia will remain in sole control over, and will continue to develop, its proprietary technology platform XR17, for use with active pharmaceutical ingredients other than paclitaxel.
“<em>This first major commercial partnership for Oasmia demonstrates both its clinical &amp; regulatory capabilities in getting Apealea</em>®<em> approved for the EU and its commercial capabilities by successfully negotiating a global partnership agreement with a US-based company for global exploitation of that product. This is a great achievement. Clinical studies have demonstrated that Apealea</em>®<em> is an effective cancer treatment with strong benefits for cancer patients. We will capitalize on this partnership to move Oasmia to its next level of growth by continuing to develop the other compounds in our pipeline. We will also be looking to add new complementary assets. I believe by implementing this partnership, Oasmia has achieved a significant milestone and is on track to become a major oncology player</em><em><strong>, </strong></em>says Francois R Martelet, CEO at Oasmia.
“<em>At Elevar, we are thrilled to take this exciting anti-cancer drug to the market. We see great potential to commercialize Apealea</em>®<em> on a global scale and to develop it further, creating new tools for patients and health care professionals to fight cancer</em>”, says Alex Kim, CEO of Elevar.
“<em>This is a great step forward for Oasmia on our way to truly capitalize on the proprietary XR17 technology that has been developed by our company. This deal, together with a lot of hard work the last year, has created a very good platform for the future growth of Oasmia. We have a lot more to achieve</em>”, says Jörgen Olsson, Chairman of the Board in Oasmia.

<a href=""https://www.pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PR.png""><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-9277"" src=""https://www.pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PR.png"" alt=""Press Release"" width=""1079"" height=""559"" /></a>DUBLIN--Horizon Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: HZNP) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PROCYSBI® (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release oral granules in packets for adults and children one year of age and older living with nephropathic cystinosis. This new dosage form provides another option for people living with cystinosis, in addition to the currently available PROCYSBI capsules.
Both the capsules and the packets contain the same PROCYSBI granules, also called microbeads, that provide 12 hours of cystine control. Providing oral granules in packets offers a tear-open option for those living with cystinosis who may have difficulty swallowing, need to sprinkle the granules on certain foods or liquids, or administer medication through a gastrostomy tube (g-tube). Families living with cystinosis are often challenged with managing multiple, different medications on daily basis and the oral granules in tear-open packets will provide an alternative option for accessing PROCYSBI day-to-day.
“We would like to thank the families and health professionals in the cystinosis community who provided feedback and guidance as the packets were developed and helped to ensure this alternative to opening individual capsules to remove the granules provides meaningful benefit,” said Jeffrey D. Kent, M.D., FACG, FACP, executive vice president, medical affairs and outcomes research, Horizon. “Having two options will allow families and physicians to select what is best for them and reflects our continued commitment to invest in creating solutions for patients and families based on their needs.”
PROCYSBI oral granules in packets in 75 mg and 300 mg strengths are expected to be available in the first half of the year. PROCYSBI capsules will continue to be available in 25 mg and 75 mg strengths.
<b>About Nephropathic Cystinosis</b>
Nephropathic cystinosis is a rare, life-threatening metabolic lysosomal storage disorder that causes toxic accumulation of cystine in all cells, tissues, and organs in the body. If untreated, elevated cystine accumulation leads to progressive, irreversible tissue damage and multi-organ failure, including kidney failure, blindness, muscle wasting and premature death. It is estimated that only about 2,000 people worldwide are currently diagnosed with nephropathic cystinosis. Nephropathic or “classic infantile” cystinosis – the most common and most severe form of the disease – is typically diagnosed in infancy and requires lifelong cystine depleting therapy.<sup>1</sup>
<b>About PROCYSBI</b>
PROCYSBI (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules and delayed-release oral granules is a cystine-depleting agent indicated for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in adults and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Patients with serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis to penicillamine or cysteamine.</li>
</ul>
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><b>Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome: </b>Skin and bone lesions that resemble clinical findings for Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome have been reported in patients treated with high doses of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate or other cysteamine salts. Monitor patients for development of skin or bone lesions and reduce PROCYSBI dosing if patients develop these lesions.</li>
 	<li><b>Skin Rash:</b> Severe skin rashes such as erythema multiforme bullosa or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Discontinue use if severe skin rash occurs.</li>
 	<li><b>Gastrointestinal (GI) Ulcers and Bleeding: </b>GI ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Monitor for GI symptoms and consider decreasing the dose if severe symptoms occur.</li>
 	<li><b>Central Nervous System (CNS) Symptoms: </b>CNS symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been associated with immediate-release cysteamine. Monitor for CNS symptoms; interrupt or reduce the dose for severe symptoms or those that persist or progress.</li>
 	<li><b>Leukopenia and/or Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels:</b><i> </i>Cysteamine has been associated with reversible leukopenia and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Monitor white blood cell counts and alkaline phosphatase levels; decrease or discontinue the dose until values revert to normal.</li>
 	<li><b>Benign Intracranial Hypertension: </b>Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri; PTC) and/or papilledema has been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of PTC; interrupt or reduce the dose for signs/symptoms that persist, or discontinue if diagnosis is confirmed.</li>
</ul>
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS</b>
The most common adverse reactions reported in PROCYSBI clinical trials <i>(= 5%): </i>were:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><i>Patients 2 years of age and older previously treated with cysteamine: </i>vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, conjunctivitis, influenza, gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, dehydration, ear infection, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, arthralgia, cough, and pain in extremity.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><i>Patients 1 year of age and older naïve to cysteamine treatment: </i>vomiting, gastroenteritis/viral gastroenteritis, diarrhea, breath odor, nausea, electrolyte imbalance, headache.</li>
</ul>
<b>DRUG INTERACTIONS</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Drugs that increase gastric pH<b> </b>may alter the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine due to the premature release of cysteamine from PROCYSBI and increase WBC cystine concentration. Monitor WBC cystine concentration with concomitant use.</li>
 	<li>Consumption of alcohol with PROCYSBI may increase the rate of cysteamine release and/or adversely alter the pharmacokinetic properties, as well as the effectiveness and safety of PROCYSBI.</li>
 	<li>PROCYSBI can be administered with electrolyte (except bicarbonate) and mineral replacements necessary for management of Fanconi Syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone.</li>
</ul>
<b>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li><i>Lactation: </i>Because of the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children from cysteamine, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with PROCYSBI.</li>
</ul>

 	<li><b>In Phase II VISION study <i>MET</i>ex14 skipping alterations were identified by liquid or tissue biopsy</b></li>
 	<li><b>TEPMETKO has been approved in Japan on the basis of demonstrating meaningful benefit in objective response across different lines of treatment, and is administered as a once-daily oral dose</b></li>
</ul>
Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced <a id=""_Hlk35965411"" name=""_Hlk35965411""></a>that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved TEPMETKO<sup>®*</sup> (tepotinib) <a id=""_Hlk34733494"" name=""_Hlk34733494""></a>for the treatment of patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with <a id=""_Hlk34733606"" name=""_Hlk34733606""></a><i>MET</i> exon 14 (<i>MET</i>ex14) skipping alterations. TEPMETKO is administered 500 mg once daily as two 250 mg tablets. This is the first regulatory approval globally for an oral MET inhibitor indicated for the treatment of advanced NSCLC harboring <i>MET</i> gene alterations. TEPMETKO was previously granted SAKIGAKE ’fast-track’ designation and orphan drug designation by the MHLW.
“With TEPMETKO, we are pleased to offer the first approved MET inhibitor in Japan, and a new option that can change the course of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer harboring <i>MET</i>ex14 skipping alterations,” said Belén Garijo, CEO Healthcare and Member of the Executive Board of Merck. “With a focus on identifying these alterations in NSCLC patients with flexibility and precision, the companion diagnostic to TEPMETKO offers both liquid and tissue biopsy testing capabilities to best support the delivery of this targeted therapy to the patients who may benefit.”
The approval of TEPMETKO (tepotinib) in Japan is supported by data from 99 patients (including 15 Japanese patients) with NSCLC with<a id=""_Hlk32308248"" name=""_Hlk32308248""></a> <i>MET</i>ex14 skipping alterations enrolled in the ongoing single-arm Phase II VISION study.<sup>1</sup> The primary endpoint, objective response rate as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), was 42.4% (95% CI: 32.5, 52.8) in patients identified by liquid biopsy (LBx) or tissue biopsy (TBx). The median duration of response based on independent assessment was 12.4 months for both LBx-identified (95% CI: 8.4 months, not evaluable) and TBx-identified patients (95% CI: 9.7 months, NE). In a safety analysis of 130 patients, tepotinib was well-tolerated; the most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were peripheral edema (53.8%), nausea (23.8%) and diarrhea (20.8%). TRAEs led to permanent discontinuation in 11 patients (8.5%).
“Identifying oncogenic drivers in order to guide the course of treatment for lung cancer patients is a clinical best practice; however, there previously was no approved therapy that specifically targeted <i>MET</i> alterations in metastatic NSCLC,” said Hiroshi Sakai, M.D., Director, Division of Thoracic Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, Japan. “With the approval of TEPMETKO, we now have a new treatment option that addresses this need, offering clinical benefit and duration of response with convenient once-daily oral dosing, representing real progress for patients with this aggressive type of lung cancer.”
Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide, with 2 million cases diagnosed annually,<sup>2 </sup>and is the second most common type of cancer in Japan.<sup>3</sup> Alterations of the<i> </i>MET signaling pathway are found in various cancer types, including 3% to 5% of NSCLC cases, and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis.<sup>4-6<a id=""_Hlk32400587"" name=""_Hlk32400587""></a></sup>
Merck has a strategic partnership with ArcherDX to develop a companion diagnostic featuring both liquid and tissue biopsy capabilities to identify <i>MET</i>ex14 skipping alterations among patients with NSCLC with high precision and accuracy prior to treatment. <a id=""_Hlk34865341"" name=""_Hlk34865341""></a><a id=""_Hlk32400656"" name=""_Hlk32400656""></a>The companion diagnostic received approval by MHLW in March 2020, and it is the first and only companion diagnostic to be approved for the detection of <i>MET</i> gene alterations. <a href=""https://archerdx.com/"">ArcherDX</a> is a genomic analysis company dedicated to democratizing precision oncology through a suite of products and services that are accurate, personal, actionable and easy to use in local settings.
<a id=""_Hlk35595813"" name=""_Hlk35595813""></a>Discovered in-house at Merck, tepotinib is an oral MET inhibitor that is <a id=""_Hlk33002198"" name=""_Hlk33002198""></a>designed to inhibit the oncogenic MET receptor signaling caused by <i>MET </i>(gene) alterations, including both <i>MET</i>ex14 skipping alterations and <i>MET </i>amplifications, or MET protein overexpression.
In September 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tepotinib in patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring <i>MET</i>ex14 skipping alterations who progressed following platinum-based cancer therapy. Merck plans to file tepotinib for regulatory review with the FDA in 2020. Tepotinib is also being investigated in the INSIGHT 2 study (NCT03940703) in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated, <i>MET </i>amplified, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that has acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKI.
<i>*The brand name TEPMETKO<sup>®</sup> is not approved for use outside of Japan.</i>
______________________
<b>About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</b>
With 2 million cases diagnosed annually, lung cancer (including trachea, bronchus and lung) is the most common type of cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related death, with 1.7 million mortality cases worldwide. Alterations of the MET signaling pathway, including <i>MET </i>exon 14 <i>(MET</i>ex14) skipping alterations and <i>MET</i> amplifications, occur in 3% to 5% of NSCLC cases.
<b>About TEPMETKO<sup>®</sup></b>
TEPMETKO<sup>®</sup> (tepotinib) is approved in Japan for the treatment of unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with <i>MET </i>exon 14 <i>(MET</i>ex14) skipping alterations. Tepotinib is an oral MET inhibitor that is designed to inhibit the oncogenic MET receptor signaling caused by <i>MET </i>(gene) alterations, including both <i>MET</i>ex14 skipping alterations and <i>MET </i>amplifications, or MET protein overexpression. Discovered in-house at Merck, it has been designed to have a highly selective mechanism of action,<sup>7</sup> with the potential to improve outcomes in aggressive tumors that have a poor prognosis and harbor these specific alterations. Tepotinib is currently under clinical investigation in NSCLC and not yet approved in any markets outside of Japan. Merck is actively assessing the potential of investigating tepotinib in combination with novel therapies and in other tumor indications.

Silence Therapeutics Announces Collaboration with AstraZeneca to Discover and Develop siRNA Therapeutics for Cardiovascular, Renal, Metabolic and Respiratory Diseases
25 March 2020
AstraZeneca to invest $80 million through upfront cash and equity investment in Silence For each disease target, Silence is eligible to receive up to $400 million in milestones, plus tiered royalties
Companies to collaborate to achieve delivery of siRNA molecules to liver, heart, lung and other tissues Silence retains the option to co-develop two programs discovered through the collaboration
Webcast and conference call today at 1pm GMT
LONDON - Silence Therapeutics plc (LON: SLN) (“Silence”) today announced a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca to discover, develop and commercialize small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics for the
treatment of Cardiovascular, Renal, Metabolic and Respiratory diseases. The collaboration draws on Silence’s extensive experience as a leader in the discovery, development and delivery of siRNA therapeutics together with AstraZeneca’s industry leading expertise in disease biology and target identification with the aim of developing first-in-class and differentiated therapeutics to address significant unmet need.
AstraZeneca will make an upfront cash payment of $60 million and an equity investment of $20 million in Silence. The parties anticipate initiating work on five targets within the first three years of the collaboration, with AstraZeneca having the option to extend the collaboration to a further five targets. Silence will harness its established GalNAc-siRNA platform to inhibit liver expressed gene targets and the
companies will collaborate to achieve targeted delivery of siRNA molecules to other tissues including heart, kidney and lung. Delivery of siRNA molecules to the liver hepatocytes is an established approach;
targeted delivery to these other tissue types represents a new and compelling opportunity to treat Cardiovascular, Renal, Metabolic and Respiratory diseases.
Under the collaboration, Silence will be responsible for designing siRNA molecules against gene targets selected by AstraZeneca, and for manufacturing of material to support GLP toxicology studies and Phase I
clinical studies. AstraZeneca and Silence will collaborate during discovery phase and AstraZeneca will lead clinical development and commercialization of molecules arising from the collaboration. Silence will have
the option to negotiate for co-development of two programs of their choice starting from Phase II. AstraZeneca will pay Silence an option fee of $10 million for each selected target at the point of candidate
nomination and thereafter for each target selected Silence will be eligible for up to $140 million in development milestones and up to $250 million in commercialization milestones as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from high single digit to low double digit. Iain Ross, Executive Chairman at Silence said “We are delighted to announce this collaboration with
AstraZeneca as it is a further validation of our proprietary siRNA platform. It not only provides us with an  opportunity to collaborate on specific liver expressed gene targets but also to work with a leading company
to achieve targeted delivery of siRNA molecules to other tissues including heart, kidney and lung.” Mene Pangalos, EVP BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, AstraZeneca said “This collaboration with Silence adds an
exciting new modality, siRNA, into our drug discovery toolbox. Importantly we can apply this drug modality across our key therapy areas in cardiovascular, renal and metabolism and respiratory to target novel
pathways not amenable to more traditional drug discovery approaches.”
The Silence management team will host a conference call accompanied by a live presentation and Q&amp;A for analysts and investors at 13:00 GMT (09:00 ET) today, Wednesday 25 March 2020 to discuss this
announcement. Dial-in details are below:

<p align=""center""><em>Twirla<sup>®</sup> is a new non-daily, non-invasive contraceptive approved in the U.S.</em></p>
PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 14, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agile Therapeutics, Inc., (Nasdaq: AGRX) (Agile or the Company), a forward-thinking women’s healthcare company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Twirla<sup>® </sup>(levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol) transdermal system.
INDICATION AND USAGE
TWIRLA is indicated as a method of contraception for use in women of reproductive potential with a BMI &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2 </sup> for whom a combined hormonal contraceptive is appropriate.
Limitations of Use
Consider TWIRLA’s reduced effectiveness in women with a BMI &gt; 25 to &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> before prescribing.  TWIRLA is contraindicated in women with a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
Please see Important Safety Information for TWIRLA, including BOXED WARNING on Cigarette Smoking and Serious Cardiovascular Events and Contraindication in Women with a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, below in “About Twirla.”
“Twirla is an important addition to available hormonal contraceptive methods, allowing prescribers to now offer appropriate U.S. women a weekly transdermal option that delivers estrogen levels in line with labeled doses of many commonly prescribed oral contraceptives,” said Dr. David Portman, a primary investigator on the SECURE clinical trial. “I’m pleased that Agile conducted a comprehensive study in a diverse population providing important data to prescribers and to women seeking contraception.  It is vital to expand the full range of contraceptive methods and inform the choices that fit an individual’s family planning needs and lifestyle.  I am excited healthcare providers can now include Twirla among available contraception options.”
Twirla is designed for weekly application to deliver a 30 mcg daily dose of ethinyl estradiol, a type of estrogen, along with a 120 mcg daily dose of levonorgestrel, a well-known progestin with a long history in the category.  The newly approved patch can be worn on the abdomen, buttock, or upper torso (excluding the breasts).
“The FDA’s approval of Twirla will enable us to deliver on our short-term goal of establishing Agile in the contraceptive prescription market and working towards our longer-term mission to broaden our women’s health portfolio, including in areas of unmet need. We are grateful to the clinical trial patients, researchers, healthcare providers, and advocates, whose contributions helped us secure the approval of a new transdermal contraceptive option that may serve the contraceptive needs and preferences of many women,” said Al Altomari, chairman and chief executive officer, Agile Therapeutics. ""We are proud to offer this new option and look forward to bringing Twirla to women and their healthcare providers.”
As part of Twirla’s approval, the FDA is requiring Agile to conduct a long-term prospective, observational post-marketing study comparing the risks for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism (ATE) in new users of Twirla to new users of other combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC).  The FDA’s requirement for Twirla is similar to another post-marketing study requirement for a recently approved CHC.  The final study report for the Twirla study is scheduled to be submitted to the FDA in November 2032, with interim safety data reporting to the FDA due in November 2026.  Agile has also agreed to a post-marketing commitment (PMC) study to assess the residual drug content and strength of Twirla in a minimum of 25 women, which will analyze the Twirla ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel content after the prescribed wear and will monitor adhesion. The PMC is similar to residual drug studies requested of patch developers in the FDA’s November 2019 draft guidance entitled <em>Transdermal and Topical Delivery Systems – Product Development and Quality Considerations.</em>  The Company plans to begin designing the post-approval studies and evaluating related costs during the first half of 2020.
With the approval of Twirla, Agile will accelerate its commercial activities.  In the first quarter of 2020, Agile plans to initiate work with managed care and patient payors to gain market access for Twirla.  Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Company plans to hire and train an initial sales team. In parallel with these activities, Agile plans to complete the validation of its commercial manufacturing process and expects to ship initial product to wholesalers in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company believes that the potential new CHC users who have a BMI &lt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> represent a significant population of women.  Based on the Company’s market research, analysis of the current and expected future U.S. contraceptive market, and review of other product launches in the category, the Company estimates that Twirla can potentially achieve a peak market share of 5-8%.  As the Company prepares for the commercialization of Twirla, it will continue to analyze the contraceptive market and update its market research as it evaluates the commercial opportunity for Twirla.

<strong>Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, CHCs, including TWIRLA, are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.  </strong><strong>Contraindicated in Women with a BMI = 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup></strong>
<strong>TWIRLA is contraindicated in women with a BMI = 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.  Compared to women with a lower BMI, women with a BMI = 30 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>had reduced effectiveness and may have a higher risk for venous thromboembolism events (VTEs).</strong></td>

</div>
<strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>
TWIRLA is contraindicated and should not be used in women with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic disease, including women with a BMI = 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; have headaches with focal neurological symptoms, migraine with aura, women over 35 years of age with any migraine headache; liver tumors, acute viral hepatitis, or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis, or liver disease; undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding; pregnancy; current or history of breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancer; hypersensitivity to any components of TWIRLA; and use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paraparesis/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir.
<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Conditions-</strong>
Women are at increased risk for a venous thromboembolic event (VTE) when using TWIRLA
<ul>
 	<li>Stop TWIRLA if an arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic event occurs</li>
 	<li>Stop TWIRLA if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately</li>
 	<li>Discontinue TWIRLA during prolonged immobilization and, if feasible, stop TWIRLA at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery</li>
 	<li>Start TWIRLA no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who are not breast-feeding</li>
 	<li>Before starting TWIRLA, evaluate any past medical history or family history of thromboembolism or thromboembolic disorders and consider whether history suggests inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Arterial Events- CHCs increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, particularly among older women (&gt; 35 years of age), smokers, and women with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or obesity.
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>Liver Disease- </strong>Discontinue TWIRLA if jaundice develops</li>
 	<li><strong>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment- </strong>Discontinue TWIRLA prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. TWIRLA can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>Hypertension-</strong> Monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop TWIRLA if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women using CHCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gallbladder Disease-</strong> Studies suggest CHCs increase risk of developing gallbladder disease and may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.</li>
 	<li><strong>Adverse Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects-</strong>
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>TWIRLA may decrease glucose tolerance. Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are using TWIRLA.</li>
 	<li>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. TWIRLA may cause adverse lipid changes. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may have an increase in serum triglyceride concentrations when using TWIRLA, which may increase the risk of pancreatitis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Headache-</strong> If a woman using TWIRLA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue TWIRLA if indicated. Consider discontinuation of TWIRLA if there is any increased frequency or severity of migraines during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).</li>
 	<li><strong>Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea-</strong> Women using TWIRLA may experience unscheduled bleeding, especially during the first three months of use, or experience absence of scheduled bleeding. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on TWIRLA, or if scheduled bleeding does not occur, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or, in the case of unscheduled bleeding, malignancy.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>Other Warnings and Precautions- </strong>Other warnings and precautions include, depression, cervical cancer, increased serum concentrations of binding globulins, hereditary angioedema, and chloasma. <strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
The following serious adverse reactions occurred in &lt;1% of women who received TWIRLA: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, major depression, suicidal ideation, appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis. A total of four VTEs in TWIRLA-treated patients were identified in the Phase 3 clinical trial. The most common adverse reactions (=2%) in clinical trials for TWIRLA are application site disorders, nausea, headache, dysmenorrhea, and increased weight.
<strong>Patients should be counseled that TWIRLA does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</strong>
<strong>DRUG INTERACTIONS</strong>
Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of TWIRLA or increase breakthrough bleeding.  Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with TWIRLA.
<strong>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </strong>
TWIRLA is indicated as a method of contraception for use in women of reproductive potential with a BMI &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for whom a combined hormonal contraceptive is appropriate.
Limitations of Use:
Consider TWIRLA’s reduced effectiveness in women with a BMI = 25 to &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> before prescribing TWIRLA. TWIRLA is contraindicated in women with a BMI = 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

<span class=""xn-location"">NEW HAVEN, Conn.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 27, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biohavens-nurtec-odt-rimegepant-receives-fda-approval-for-the-acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults-301013021.html#financial-modal"">BHVN</a>) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved NURTEC™ ODT (rimegepant) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. NURTEC ODT is the first FDA-approved product for Biohaven, a company dedicated to advancing innovative therapies for neurological diseases.
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">
A single quick-dissolving tablet of NURTEC ODT can provide fast pain relief and return patients to normal function within one hour, and deliver sustained efficacy that lasts up to 48 hours for many patients. NURTEC ODT disperses almost instantly in a person's mouth without the need for water, offering people with migraine a convenient, discreet way to take their medication anytime and anywhere they need it. NURTEC ODT is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine. Biohaven expects topline results from its prevention of migraine trial later this quarter.
</div>
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">
<span class=""xn-person"">Vlad Coric</span>, M.D., CEO of Biohaven commented, ""The FDA approval of NURTEC ODT marks an important milestone for the migraine community and a transformative event for Biohaven. Millions of people suffering from migraine are often not satisfied with their current acute treatment, at times having to make significant tradeoffs because of troublesome side effects and reduced ability to function. NURTEC ODT is an important new oral acute treatment for migraine that offers patients the potential to quickly reduce and eliminate pain and get back to their lives."" Dr. Coric added, ""We believe NURTEC ODT will be the first of many innovative Biohaven medicines to become available to treat devastating neurological diseases, a therapeutic category many other companies have abandoned. We are dedicated to helping patients with these conditions, who often have limited or no treatment options, live better, more productive lives.""
NURTEC ODT, with its novel quick-dissolve oral tablet formulation, works by blocking CGRP receptors, treating a root cause of migraine. NURTEC ODT is not an opioid or narcotic, does not have addiction potential and is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
NURTEC ODT may offer an alternative treatment option, particularly for patients who experience inadequate efficacy, poor tolerability, or have a contraindication to currently available therapies. More than 3,100 patients have been treated with rimegepant with more than 113,000 doses administered in clinical trials, including a one-year long-term safety study. In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, NURTEC ODT was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse reaction was nausea (2%) in patients who received NURTEC ODT compared to 0.4% of patients who received placebo.
<span class=""xn-person"">Mary Franklin</span>, Executive Director of the National Headache Foundation commented, ""Everyone knows someone living with migraine, yet it remains an invisible disease that is often overlooked and misunderstood. Almost all people with migraine need an acute treatment to stop a migraine attack as it occurs, which can happen without warning. The approval of NURTEC ODT is exciting for people with migraine as it provides a new treatment option to help people regain control of their attacks and their lives.""
<span class=""xn-person"">Peter Goadsby</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Neurology and Director of the King's Clinical Research Facility, King's College Hospital commented, ""I see many patients in my practice whose lives are disrupted by migraine, afraid to go about everyday life in case of a migraine attack. Many feel unsure if their acute treatment will work and if they can manage the side effects. With the FDA approval of NURTEC ODT, there is renewed hope for people living with migraine that they can get back to living their lives without fear of the next attack.""
The FDA approval of NURTEC ODT is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (Study 303) and the long-term, open-label safety study (Study 201). In the Phase 3 trial, NURTEC ODT achieved statistical significance on the regulatory co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from most bothersome symptom (MBS) at two hours post dose compared to placebo. NURTEC ODT also demonstrated statistical superiority at one hour for pain relief (reduction of moderate or severe pain to no pain or mild pain) and return to normal function. The benefits of pain freedom, pain relief, return to normal function and freedom from MBS were sustained up to 48 hours for many patients. Importantly, these benefits were seen with only a single dose of NURTEC ODT. Eighty-six percent of patients treated with NURTEC ODT did not require rescue medication (e.g. NSAIDS, acetaminophen) within 24 hours post dose. The long-term safety study assessed the safety and tolerability of rimegepant with multiple doses used over up to one year. The study evaluated 1,798 patients, who used rimegepant 75 mg as needed to treat migraine attacks, up to one dose per day. The study included 1,131 patients who were exposed to rimegepant for at least six months, and 863 who were exposed for at least one year, all of whom treated an average of at least two migraine attacks per month. The safety of treating more than 15 migraines in a 30-day period has not been established.
NURTEC ODT is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rimegepant, NURTEC ODT, or to any of its components. Hypersensitivity reactions with dyspnea and severe rash, including delayed serious hypersensitivity days after administration, occurred in less than 1% of subjects taking NURTEC ODT in clinical studies.

NURTEC ODT will be available in pharmacies in early <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2020</span> in packs of eight tablets. Each eight tablet pack covers treatment of eight migraine attacks with one dose, as needed, up to once daily.  Sample packs containing two tablets will also be made available to healthcare providers. Patients with migraine should discuss with their primary care provider or neurologist whether NURTEC ODT is appropriate for them.
<b>About NURTEC ODT <br class=""dnr"" /></b>NURTEC™ ODT (rimegepant) is the first and only calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist available in a quick-dissolve ODT formulation that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The activity of the neuropeptide CGRP is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. NURTEC ODT is a CGRP receptor antagonist that works by reversibly blocking CGRP receptors, thereby inhibiting the biologic activity of the CGRP neuropeptide. The recommended dose of NURTEC ODT is 75 mg, taken as needed, up to once daily. For more information about NURTEC ODT, visit <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2733404-1&amp;h=3009140066&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nurtec.com%2F&amp;a=www.nurtec.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">www.nurtec.com</a>.
<b>About Migraine <br class=""dnr"" /></b>Nearly 40 million people in the U.S. suffer from migraine and the World Health Organization classifies migraine as one of the 10 most disabling medical illnesses. Migraine is characterized by debilitating attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that can be associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia). There is a significant unmet need for new acute treatments as more than 90 percent of migraine sufferers are unable to work or function normally during an attack.
<b>About CGRP Receptor Antagonism <br class=""dnr"" /></b>Small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of migraine. This unique mode of action potentially offers an alternative to current agents, particularly for patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans, or who have a poor response to triptans or are intolerant to them.
<b>What is NURTEC ODT? <br class=""dnr"" /></b>NURTEC™ ODT (rimegepant) is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.
<b>Limitations of Use <br class=""dnr"" /></b>NURTEC ODT is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine.
<b>Important Safety Information</b>
<b>Contraindications:</b> Hypersensitivity to NURTEC ODT or any of its components.
<b>Warnings and Precautions:</b> If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue NURTEC ODT and initiate appropriate therapy.  Serious hypersensitivity reactions have included dyspnea and rash, and can occur days after administration.
<b>Adverse Reactions:</b> The most common adverse reaction was nausea (2% in patients who received NURTEC ODT compared to 0.4% in patients who received placebo).  Hypersensitivity, including dyspnea and rash, occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with NURTEC ODT.
<b>Drug Interactions:</b> Avoid concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A or inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP.  Avoid another dose of NURTEC ODT within 48 hours when it is administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4.

</ul>
<p align=""justify"">SAN DIEGO, March 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, ""Sorrento"") today announced it has been working on a novel decoy cellular vaccine for COVID-19 (STI-6991) and is in active discussions with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research under IND#019724 regarding the required IND-enabling studies, CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and controls), clinical protocol and end-points for potential accelerated approval. Upon receiving guidance from the FDA, Sorrento intends to submit a full package for an IND filing that would enable human clinical trials to start as soon as possible.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The decoy cell strategy (I-Cell™, which means immune-training cells) has been conceptualized and developed by Sorrento scientists utilizing expertise acquired in the fight against cancer. Sorrento expects to utilize a well-known replicating cell line (human erythroleukemia, K562) to incorporate SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein or its S1 domain onto the cellular membrane so that the viral antigen is presented on a decoy cell surface to elicit both T cell and B cell immunities. The selected cell line has been used safely in cancer vaccination programs and is well characterized (clinical trials using K562 expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor have been used as a tumor vaccine). Upon expression of the viral protein as a surface marker, the decoy cell “looks like” the virus to a healthy person’s immune system. After irradiation to prevent the replication of the cells, the cells can be administered by intramuscular injection as a vaccine. In the presence of this “look alike” training cell, the recipient may develop a protective immune response and produce corresponding neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the vaccinated subject is later exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, his or her T cell immunity and neutralizing antibodies are expected to block the spike protein from attaching to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) on the normal human cell surface, thus potentially attenuating or preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection which causes COVID-19 disease.</p>
<p align=""justify"">A short communication explaining this vaccination approach was accepted for publication by Medicine in Drug Discovery (an Elsevier peer reviewed open access journal. The article can be found at <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4ajV0i8w9bAjuZIuSOjNfsaMNKVXYM4B4mO1FU-7v-W5KmDoJVcVNv5bT_wT2FYiMRThTK4ZWKhT5WzdoMxbaDldViawH5ODIHXWMXB-Avl2rEah5O7DPWHEwzTfz3N59j0dyfZnhyA6l_2EzMSGlfmUcvTJH-U5pszES0Lk-M9k3ZT-Es6R3rH73US0KCcbrVg-t3TvC1wsYwfU2lLYSle_B0DpfCqrOaD-Q6OutKhwlcfsvvP85hze2gOo8j3w"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300130?via%3Dihub</a>). Per the publication, “the overall strategy to utilize a viral antigen-expressing, non-replicating cellular system as both a carrier, and as an immunogenic antigen-presenting platform is novel. The view is that this platform will be recognized by the immune system, and a neutralizing antibody response will ensue. The most important aspect of the platform is that it should allow for dendritic cells to recruit T lymphocytes and induce Th1 cell polarization that if feasible will also induce a cytotoxic T cell response and thus clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strategy should be safe as they are using K562 cell line that is HLA negative. The platform appears to be readily scalable and would appear to provide uniform cell product. One key aspect is that will the vaccine prevent engraftment and proliferation after host implantation; the answer here appears to be yes as the cells will be irradiated post-expansion in order to abolish their replication ability and thus no in vivo cell growth. In sum an intriguing platform is put forth and if viable as it appears to be it could make an impact on the treatment of COVID-19.”<sup>1</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">Sorrento is currently working to demonstrate I-Cells’ ability to generate protective T cell and B cell immunities in an animal model. Sorrento has identified a leading infectious disease contract research organization to support the phase 1 clinical trial and accelerated timelines. Sorrento has begun process development, validation and scaled up manufacturing testing in its state-of-the-art cGMP cell therapy facilities in San Diego in anticipation of registrational clinical trials and commercialization.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sorrento anticipates all IND requirements will be fulfilled in the next few months. Depending on government support and the FDA’s response, Sorrento believes it may be in a position to initiate human vaccination trials as early as mid-year 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">David Epstein, former CEO of Novartis Pharmaceuticals, a division of Novartis AG, who has been advising Sorrento, said, “This promising vaccination strategy is uniquely suited for rapid scale up and advancement into the clinic.  I am hopeful because this novel approach can make a difference in the lives of so many.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We have developed a novel approach to vaccination that we believe can be a breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19. We believe using a human cell as a training agent is unique and likely to be effective for vaccination,” stated Dr Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “By utilizing an existing cell line that has previously been used to make cancer vaccines, we know we have a product candidate with a promising safety profile. We are very confident that, if our product candidate is approved, we will have the required capacity in place to produce enough doses to protect millions of people in the near term. Confirming that I-Cell works in humans is our top priority and our most immediate focus.”</p>

<p align=""left""><em>ANJESO Is The Only Approved 24-Hour, Intravenous COX-2 Preferential NSAID that Offers Once-Daily Dosing</em></p>
<p align=""left""><em>U.S. Commercial Launch Planned to Commence in Late April or Early May 2020</em></p>
<p align=""left""><em>Management to Host Conference Call and Webcast Today at 4:30 p.m. ET</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">MALVERN, Pa., Feb. 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Baudax Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=BXRX&amp;exchange=2"">BXRX</a>), a pharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics for acute care settings, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for ANJESO™ (meloxicam injection), which is indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain, alone or in combination with other non-NSAID analgesics.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The approval of ANJESO marks a major advancement in the treatment landscape for managing moderate to severe pain,” said Gerri Henwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Baudax Bio. “With our nation currently in the midst of a national opioid epidemic, we are thrilled to be able to offer a novel, non-opioid therapeutic option with the potential to meaningfully impact the acute pain treatment paradigm.  We expect to make ANJESO available to physicians and patients in late April or early May 2020.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">ANJESO is approved for the management of moderate to severe pain and will be administered as a once-a-day intravenous (IV) bolus push. ANJESO is the only available 24-hour, intravenous (IV) COX-2 preferential non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) and offers once-daily dosing.  The active ingredient meloxicam is a long-acting, preferential COX-2 inhibitor that possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities, which are believed to be related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase type 2 pathway (COX-2) and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin biosynthesis.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The safety and efficacy of ANJESO have been well-established through several mid- and late-stage clinical studies,” said Stewart McCallum, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Baudax Bio. “Moreover, data from our Phase III safety trial demonstrated that ANJESO is well tolerated and impacted opioid consumption compared to placebo, further highlighting its value to patients, providers and health systems.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The approval of ANJESO marks an important achievement for the medical community given the unmet need for non-opioid options in the pain treatment landscape,” said Dr. Keith Candiotti chair of the Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Medicine and Pain Management at the University of Miami.  “While traditional opioid medications have proven effective at providing pain relief, the associated adverse side effects, including sedation and respiratory depression, have driven physicians to employ a multi-modal approach to treating post-operative pain. With 24-hour, durable pain relief and a safety profile comparable to placebo, ANJESO has the potential to serve as a meaningfully differentiated analgesic alternative.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The ANJESO approval is supported by two Phase III efficacy studies and one double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III safety study.  The results from these studies, as well as results from four Phase II clinical studies and other safety studies, comprised the NDA package.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The most common ADVERSE REACTIONS reported in =2% of patients treated with ANJESO and at a greater frequency than placebo included: constipation, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased and anemia.</p>

<p align=""justify""><strong>ANJESO™ COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL TRIALS</strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Phase 3  Efficacy Study Evaluating ANJESO Following Bunionectomy Surgery</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 201 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a postoperative regimen of ANJESO (30mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, once every 24 hours for up to 3 doses following bunionectomy surgery, a representative hard tissue surgery. The ANJESO treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SPID48 (p=0.0034) compared to the placebo arm. The study also achieved 15 of the 19 secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in SPID6 (p=0.0153), SPID12 (p=0.0053), SPID24 (p=0.0084), SPID24-48 (p=0.0050), time to first use of rescue medication (p=0.0076), and several other rescue use and pain relief metrics during the first 48 hours, compared to placebo. The safety results demonstrated that ANJESO was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or bleeding events in the ANJESO-treated patients.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Phase 3 Efficacy Study Evaluating ANJESO Following Abdominoplasty Surgery</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 219 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a postoperative regimen of ANJESO (30mg bolus injection) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, once every 24 hours. The ANJESO treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SPID24 (p=0.0145) compared to the placebo arm.  The study also achieved statistical significance for 10 of the secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in SPID12 (p=0.0434), time to perceptible pain relief (p=0.0050), subjects with =30% improvement at 24 hours (p=0.0178), number of times patients required rescue in the first 24 hours after randomization (p=0.0275), as well as number of times rescued from 24 to 48 hours (p=0.0009), and several other pain relief metrics, compared to placebo. The safety results demonstrated that ANJESO was well tolerated with no difference in serious adverse events (SAEs) related to bleeding for ANJESO treated patients versus placebo (1 each).</p>
<strong>Phase 3 Safety Study Evaluating ANJESO Following Major Surgery</strong>
<p align=""justify"">This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial, included patients who had undergone major elective surgical procedures which were expected to result in hospitalization for at least 24-48 hours. Major surgical procedures included total hip and knee replacements, spinal, GI, hernia repair, and gynecologic surgeries, as well as a range of other surgeries.  Patient demographics were balanced across treatment groups and included 40% male patients and about 23% of patients who were over age 65.  Unlike the pivotal efficacy trials, minimum pain scores were not required for treatment.  Sites were permitted to use opioids and other pain management modes according to their “standard of care” and meloxicam or placebo was added to this regimen.  Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either ANJESO or IV placebo daily for up to 7 doses.  A total of 721 patients received at least one dose of study medication. In patients age 65 and over, the percentage of patients reporting at least one AE was approximately 7% less in the ANJESO treatment arm compared to the placebo arm.  The total occurrence of patients with at least one serious adverse event (SAE) was observed to be lower in the ANJESO group, 2.6%, (14/538 meloxicam patients) than in the placebo group, 5.5%, (10/183 placebo patients).  In this safety study only two SAE events were listed as possibly related to study treatment. Both of these SAEs occurred in one placebo treated patient. No deaths were reported in either treatment group.  Approximately 3% of patients in each study group discontinued.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>INDICATION AND USAGE</strong></p>
ANJESO is indicated for use in adults for the management of moderate-to-severe pain, alone or in combination with non-NSAID analgesics.
Limitation of Use: Because of delayed onset of analgesia, ANJESO alone is not recommended for use when rapid onset of analgesia is required.
<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong>
<strong>WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS</strong>
<strong>Cardiovascular </strong><strong>Risk</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>ANJESO is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Gastrointestinal </strong><strong>Risk</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events.</li>
</ul>
<strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>
ANJESO is contraindicated in patients with:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Known hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to meloxicam or any components of the drug product.</li>
 	<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.</li>
 	<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.</li>
 	<li>Moderate to severe renal insufficiency patients who are at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion</li>
</ul>
<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>
<u>Hepatotoxicity</u>: Elevations of ALT or AST have been reported in patients with NSAIDs. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue ANJESO immediately if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.
<u>Hypertension</u>: NSAIDs including ANJESO can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events. Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure.
<u>Heart Failure and Edema</u>: NSAID use increased the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Avoid use of ANJESO in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. If ANJESO is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.
<u>Post MI Patients</u>: Avoid the use of ANJESO in patients with recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If ANJESO is used in these patients, monitor for signs of cardiac ischemia.
<u>Renal Toxicity</u>: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury. ANJESO is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency and is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency who are at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating ANJESO. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of ANJESO in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. If ANJESO is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.
<u>Anaphylactic Reactions</u>: Meloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.
<u>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</u>: ANJESO is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity).
<u>Serious Skin Reactions</u>: NSAIDs, including ANJESO, can cause serious skin reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal and can occur without warning. Discontinue ANJESO at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity.
<u>Hematologic Toxicity</u>: Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs, including ANJESO, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding.
<strong>DRUG INTERACTIONS</strong>
<u>Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs)</u>: Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking ANJESO with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of ANJESO and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended.
<u>Angiotensin Converting Enzymes (ACE) Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), or Beta-Blockers</u>: Concomitant use with ANJESO may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure.
<u>ACE Inhibitors and ARBs</u>: Concomitant use with ANJESO in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function.
<u>Diuretics</u>: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to ensure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects.
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
The most common adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials occurring in = 2% of patients treated with ANJESO and at a greater frequency than placebo include:  constipation, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, and anemia.
<strong>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</strong>
<u>Pregnancy</u>: Use of NSAIDs during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks gestation.
<u>Infertility</u>: NSAIDs are associated with reversible infertility. Consider withdrawal of ANJESO in women who have trouble conceiving.

<p align=""justify""><strong>About ANJESO™</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">ANJESO (meloxicam) injection is a proprietary, long-acting, preferential COX-2 inhibitor that possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities, which are believed to be related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase type 2 pathway (COX-2) and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin biosynthesis.  ANJESO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2020 for the management of moderate to severe pain, alone or in combination with other non-NSAID analgesics.  Because of the delayed onset of analgesia, ANJESO alone is not recommended for use when rapid onset of analgesia is required.  The Company expects to launch ANJESO in late April or early May 2020.  The ANJESO product approval was supported by two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials, a large double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III safety trial and four Phase II clinical efficacy trials, as well as other safety studies.  As a non-opioid, Baudax Bio believes ANJESO has the potential to overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential, while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain.  ANJESO was designed using the NanoCrystal<sup>®</sup> platform, a technology that enables enhanced bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drug compounds.

<p align=""left"">ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Esperion (NASDAQ:<a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=ESPR&amp;exchange=2"">ESPR</a>) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved NEXLIZET™  (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) tablet, an oral, once-daily, non-statin LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C), lowering medicine. NEXLIZET is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLIZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. NEXLIZET is the first non-statin, LDL-C lowering combination medicine ever approved. This approval follows the approval of NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) tablet last week.</p>
<p align=""left"">NEXLIZET contains bempedoic acid and ezetimibe and lowers elevated LDL-C through complementary mechanisms of action by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver and absorption in the intestine.</p>
<p align=""left"">“The approval of NEXLIZET underscores Esperion’s commitment to providing patients and their healthcare providers with innovative non-statin medicines that fit into their everyday routines to lower elevated levels of bad cholesterol in adult patients with ASCVD or HeFH on maximally tolerated statins. This is the first non-statin combination medicine ever approved for lowering LDL-C,” said Tim M. Mayleben, president and chief executive officer of Esperion. “We are truly grateful to all of the patients and healthcare providers who put their confidence in Esperion’s team of lipid experts.”</p>
<p align=""left"">LDL-C is a waxy, fat-like substance that’s found in the body. Elevated LDL-C contributes to a buildup of this fat in the arteries and can lead to cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke. Despite standard of care treatments, it is estimated nearly 15 million ASCVD or HeFH patients on maximally tolerated statins in the U.S. cannot achieve guideline recommended LDL-C levels.</p>
<p align=""left"">“NEXLIZET provides significant additional LDL-C lowering for adult patients with ASCVD or HeFH when added to maximally tolerated statin medicine, including those patients for whom maximally tolerated statin may be no statin at all,” said Christie M. Ballantyne, M.D., chairman of Esperion’s Phase 3 Executive Committee and professor and chief of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “I believe this one-of-a-kind combination medicine which has two complementary, non-statin medications can provide highly effective additional reductions in LDL-C when added to statin therapy. It also has the conventional, oral, once-daily administration which can prove beneficial to patients struggling to meet their cholesterol goals with the currently available statin options in their daily regimen.”</p>
<p align=""left"">The approval of NEXLIZET is supported by the Phase 3 Fixed Combination Drug Product LDL-C Lowering program, as well as safety data from the NEXLETOL (bempedoic acid) tablet global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program and the existing ezetimibe safety profile. NEXLIZET lowered LDL-C by a mean of 38 percent compared to placebo when added on to maximally tolerated statins. Results have been published in <em>The European Journal of Preventative Cardiology.</em></p>
<p align=""left"">NEXLIZET was generally well-tolerated in a pivotal Phase 3 study. Label warnings and precautions include hyperuricemia, with the development of gout in a small percentage of patients, as well as an increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. The most common adverse events reported in the development program (incidence = 2% and greater than placebo)  were generally reported at similar rates in patients who received placebo and were upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis fatigue, influenza. The majority of adverse events reported with NEXLIZET were mild to moderate in severity.

<p align=""left""><strong>NEXLETOL</strong>™<strong> (bempedoic acid) Tablet</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">NEXLETOL is a first-in-class ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by reducing cholesterol biosynthesis and up-regulating the LDL receptors. Completed Phase 3 studies conducted in more than 3,000 patients, with over 2,000 patients treated with NEXLETOL , demonstrated an average 18 percent placebo corrected LDL-C lowering when used in patients on moderate or high-intensity statins. NEXLETOL is the first oral, once-daily, non-statin LDL-C lowering medicine approved in the U.S. in nearly 20 years for patients with ASCVD or HeFH. NEXLETOL was approved by the FDA in February 2020.</p>
<p align=""left""><u>Indication and Limitation of Use</u>
NEXLETOL is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C.

<p align=""left""><strong>CLEAR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">The effect of NEXLETOL or NEXLIZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Esperion initiated a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) to assess the effects of bempedoic acid on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiovascular disease (CVD) who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and are considered ""statin averse."" The CVOT — known as CLEAR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial — is an event-driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that completed enrollment in August 2019 of 14,032 patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk at over 1,400 sites in 32 countries.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Esperion Therapeutics</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Through scientific and clinical excellence, and a deep understanding of cholesterol biology, the experienced Lipid Management Team at Esperion is committed to developing new LDL-C lowering medicines that will make a substantial impact on reducing global cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death around the world.

<p align=""left""><strong>Esperion Therapeutics’ Commitment to Patients with Hyperlipidemia</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">High levels of LDL-C can lead to a build-up of fat and cholesterol in and on artery walls (known as atherosclerosis), potentially leading to cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke. In the U.S., 96 million people, or more than 37 percent of the adult population, have elevated LDL-C. There are approximately 18 million people in the U.S. living with elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy — including individuals considered statin averse — leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events<sup>1</sup>. In the United States, more than 50 percent of ASCVD patients who are not able to reach their LDL-C with statins alone need less than a 40 percent reduction to reach their LDL-C threshold<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p align=""left"">Esperion's mission as the Lipid Management Company is to deliver oral, once-daily medicines that complement existing oral drugs to provide the additional LDL-C lowering that these patients need.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding the regulatory approval pathway for bempedoic acid tablet and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe fixed dose combination tablet, the therapeutic potential of, and the clinical development plan for bempedoic acid tablet and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe fixed dose combination tablet, including Esperion's timing, designs, plans for announcement of results regarding its CLEAR Outcomes study and other ongoing clinical studies for bempedoic acid tablet and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination fixed dose tablet, timing for the review and approval of the NDAs and the MAAs, and Esperion's expectations for the market for medicines to lower LDL-C, including the commercial launch and market adoption of bempedoic acid tablet and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe fixed dose combination tablet, if approved. Any express or implied statements contained in this press release that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Esperion's actual results to differ significantly from those projected, including, without limitation, delays or failures in Esperion’s studies, that positive results from a clinical study of bempedoic acid may not be sufficient for EMA approval or necessarily be predictive of the results of future or ongoing clinical studies, that notwithstanding the completion of Esperion’s Phase 3 clinical development program for LDL-C lowering, the FDA or EMA require additional development in connection with seeking regulatory approval, or approval of an expanded indication, that existing cash resources may be used more quickly than anticipated, and the risks detailed in Esperion's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

First combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain relief to be available OTC in 2020
<span class=""xn-location"">WARREN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Feb. 28, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- GlaxoSmithKline (LSE/NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-gsks-advil-dual-action-with-acetaminophen-for-over-the-counter-use-in-the-united-states-301013675.html#financial-modal"">GSK</a>) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Advil Dual Action with Acetaminophen as an over-the-counter (OTC) product for pain relief. The exclusive formula is now the first FDA-approved OTC combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and will be available over-the-counter nationwide in 2020.
Franck Riot, Head of R&amp;D, GSK Consumer Healthcare said: ""For decades, many consumers have been using ibuprofen and acetaminophen to get the benefits of both active ingredients when safely treating their headaches, muscle aches, backaches, arthritis and other joint pain. Now Advil, the No. 1 selling OTC pain reliever, will offer US consumers the first-ever alternative option -- a single, fixed-dose combination pain reliever. As the world-leader in pain relief, Advil Dual Action and our recently FDA-approved Voltaren Arthritis Pain gel, demonstrates GSK's commitment to providing new safe, effective and convenient pain relief options for consumers.""
Advil Dual Action provides relief for multiple symptoms and is the first formulation that combines ibuprofen and acetaminophen, two powerful ingredients indicated for OTC pain relief that work in different ways.
The submission in support of today's approval of Advil Dual Action was based on data from seven clinical studies, three of which were pivotal efficacy and safety studies in pain relief. The data supports a pain relief indication and demonstrates that the fixed-dose combination achieves superior efficacy compared to the individual monocomponents of ibuprofen (250mg) and acetaminophen (500mg) alone (as evidenced by appreciable improvements in acute pain symptoms across multiple pre-specified endpoints).
<b>About Advil Dual Action<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Advil Dual Action is an exclusive pain-fighting formula, combining ibuprofen and acetaminophen to fight pain in two ways. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) that targets pain at the source, temporarily reducing the production of prostaglandins, which cause swelling and pain signals. Acetaminophen is a pain reliever that blocks the transmission of pain signals to the brain. Advil Dual Action will be available over-the-counter nationwide in 2020.
<b>GSK's commitment to pain relief<br class=""dnr"" /></b>We are the world leader in pain relief. With a portfolio of (systemic and topical) products to relieve pain, our range brings comfort and ease to millions.

<div class=""node__content"">
MONROVIA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 25, 2020-- Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ:XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease, today announced it has entered into a technology license agreement with Vir Biotechnology, Inc., in which Vir will have non-exclusive access to Xencor’s Xtend™ Fc technology to extend the half-life of novel antibodies that Vir is investigating as potential treatments for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
“The COVID-19 crisis requires urgent and coordinated action by the biotechnology industry to develop new drugs and vaccines. Xtend Fc technology has demonstrated, in multiple antibodies and through numerous human clinical trials, the ability to extend antibody drug half-life and reduce dosing frequency in patients, an important feature in anti-viral therapy for pandemic use,” said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer at Xencor. “We are committed to broadly using Xtend technology, and our other XmAb<sup>®</sup> tools, to rapidly develop potential treatments for COVID-19. Vir’s antibody candidates, supported by their deep infectious disease expertise, are a promising approach for treating coronavirus infections.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Vir will be solely responsible for the activities and costs related to research, development, regulatory and commercial activities. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Xencor and Vir previously entered into a separate technology license agreement in August 2019, in which Xencor provided a non-exclusive license to Xtend technology for Vir's use in developing and commercializing antibodies as potential treatments for patients with influenza and hepatitis B virus infection.
Xencor continues to evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing and planned clinical studies. The Company is currently maintaining preestablished guidance on 2020 corporate milestones and will provide additional updates as needed.
<b>About Xtend™ XmAb<sup>®</sup> Fc Technology</b>
Xencor’s Xtend™ XmAb<sup>®</sup> Fc domains increase circulating half-life by increasing binding affinity to the receptor FcRn. FcRn is present inside lysosomes in endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and functions to rescue antibodies from the degradation that makes most proteins short-lived in circulation. Half-life extension can be exploited to potentially improve therapeutic antibody performance in several ways, such as increasing dosing interval or decreasing drug quantities at the same dosing interval compared to a parent antibody. Xtend technology is currently in multiple clinical-stage programs and one approved therapy, Alexion’s Ultomiris<sup>®</sup> (ravulizumab-cwvz).
<b>About Xencor, Inc.</b>
Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Currently, 15 candidates engineered with Xencor's XmAb<sup>®</sup> technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor's XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.

<p align=""justify"">
<em>This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014</em>.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Cambridge, UK and Indianapolis, US – 27 February 2020: </strong>Acacia Pharma Group plc (“Acacia Pharma” or the “Company”) (EURONEXT: ACPH), a hospital pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new products aimed at improving the care of patients undergoing significant treatments such as surgery, other invasive procedures, or cancer chemotherapy, announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BARHEMSYS<sup>®</sup> (amisulpride injection) for the prevention and treatment of PONV in adult patients.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The approval of our first product represents a significant milestone in Acacia Pharma’s evolution into an integrated hospital pharmaceutical company with strong development and commercialization capabilities,” <strong>commented Mike Bolinder, Acacia Pharma’s CEO</strong>. “I would like to thank the Acacia Pharma team and stakeholders that have delivered this new treatment option for the millions of adult surgical patients each year suffering from, or at risk of, PONV. Our goal is for BARHEMSYS to become established as the new standard of care in the US for the treatment of PONV in patients who have failed standard prophylaxis, the area of highest unmet need. The results of our extensive clinical program also allow us to offer BARHEMSYS as an option for the prevention of PONV in higher-risk patients and settings, where combination prophylaxis can be valuable. We are on target with our commercial preparations and expect to launch BARHEMSYS in the second half of this year.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Professor TJ Gan, Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at Stony Brook University in New York, said:</strong> “PONV remains a major problem for surgical patients and there have been few therapeutic advances over the past 20 years. It is often considered by patients to be the most undesirable complication of surgery, even worse than pain. It is therefore very welcome to be able to add BARHEMSYS to the treatment arsenal, especially for rescue treatment of patients failing standard prophylaxis, where we previously had no approved agent.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“We are delighted that BARHEMSYS has gained FDA approval,” <strong>said Acacia Pharma’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Gabriel Fox</strong>. “BARHEMSYS demonstrated significant benefits in the treatment and prevention of PONV in four pivotal trials. We are grateful to all the clinical investigators, hospital staff and, above all, patients who have made this approval possible through their participation in our clinical development program.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">BARHEMSYS is an intravenous formulation of the selective dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> antagonist amisulpride (2.5 mg/mL). The New Drug Application (NDA) submitted by Acacia Pharma for BARHEMSYS, which included four positive Phase 3 studies, contained data gathered from more than 3,300 surgical patients and healthy volunteers. The approval for BARHEMSYS covers the treatment of PONV in patients who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or who have not received prophylaxis and the prevention of PONV, either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Company owns global rights to BARHEMSYS and intends to directly commercialize the product in the US through its own sales channel, having built critical sales, marketing, medical, and operational infrastructure and capabilities over the past two years. The Company plans to launch BARHEMSYS in 2H 2020.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving patients who had failed the most commonly used antiemetic prophylaxis, a single 10 mg dose of BARHEMSYS (n=230) was significantly more effective than placebo (n=235) at treating patients (42% vs 29%; p=0.003).<sup>1</sup> In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients at the highest risk of suffering from PONV (Apfel score 3 or 4), a single 5 mg dose of BARHEMSYS in combination with another antiemetic (n=572) significantly improved protection from PONV compared to placebo plus another antiemetic (n=575; 58% vs 47%; p&lt;0.001).<sup>4</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">The most common side effects observed across the four pivotal studies, reported in at least 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS and at a higher rate than placebo were: infusion site pain (6% vs 4% with placebo), chills (4% vs 3%), hypokalemia (4% vs 2%), procedural hypotension (3% vs 2%), and abdominal distension (2% vs 1%). Serum prolactin concentrations were measured in one prophylaxis study where 5% (9/176) of BARHEMSYS-treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction compared to 1% (1/166) of placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Acacia Pharma’s second product, Byfavo™ (remimazolam injection), was recently in-licensed from Cosmo Pharmaceuticals NV and an NDA is currently under review by FDA for use in procedural sedation in adults. The application has a target PDUFA action date of 5 April 2020. Subject to approval, the Company also intends to launch Byfavo in the US during 2020 and to commercialize Byfavo using the same sales and marketing infrastructure.</p>

<p align=""justify""><strong>About PONV</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">PONV is a common complication of surgery, occurring in approximately 30% of surgical patients and up to 80% of high-risk patients. It is associated with the use of anesthetic gases and opioid painkillers and is particularly common following gynecological, abdominal, breast, eye, and ear operations, especially those lasting an hour or more. PONV has been ranked as the most undesirable of all surgical complications in some patient surveys, even worse than pain.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p align=""justify"">Acacia Pharma estimates that approximately 65 million surgical procedures are conducted in the US each year that are eligible for antiemetic use to prevent PONV. Based on market research, Acacia Pharma estimates that the total market in the US for high-risk prophylactic and rescue treatment comprises an estimated 34 million patients annually.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About BARHEMSYS<sup>®</sup></strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">BARHEMSYS is a selective dopamine-2 (D<sub>2</sub>) and dopamine-3 (D<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist, which Acacia Pharma has developed and protected for the management of PONV.</p>
<p align=""justify"">BARHEMSYS is indicated in adults for:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>treatment of PONV in patients who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or who have not received prophylaxis</li>
 	<li>prevention of PONV, either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify""><a title="""" href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=M6SidPq3xEAqXiN_X24CuZbPqDPr4nPx2Z3f-4oBS1X9d9kiay-0IX1mpoOe4-y-8VzpX2V99-CowOI6qLHw7YGkyAEq98_4_LpESV1gq7E="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>www.BARHEMSYS.com</u></a></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Important Safety Information for BARHEMSYS<sup>®</sup> (amisulpride) Injection</strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Contraindication</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">BARHEMSYS is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to amisulpride.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>QT Prolongation</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">BARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg as a single intravenous (IV) dose infused over 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Avoid BARHEMSYS in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients taking droperidol.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias/cardiac conduction disorders, electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, and in patients taking other medicinal products (e.g., ondansetron) or with other medical conditions known to prolong the QT interval.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Adverse Reactions</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Common adverse reactions reported in = 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 5 mg (n=748) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=741) in clinical trials for the prevention of PONV were: chills (4% vs. 3%), hypokalemia (4% vs. 2%), procedural hypotension (3% vs. 2%), and abdominal distention (2% vs. 1%).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Serum prolactin concentrations were measured in one prophylaxis study where 5% (9/176) of BARHEMSYS-treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction compared with 1% (1/166) of placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The most common adverse reaction, reported in = 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 10 mg (n=418) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=416), in clinical trials for the treatment of PONV was infusion site pain (6% vs. 4%).</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Use in Specific Populations</strong></p>
<p align=""justify""><em>Lactation</em>
Amisulpride is present in human milk. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed child and no information on the effects of amisulpride on milk production.</p>
<p align=""justify"">BARHEMSYS may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible increase in maternal milk production. In a clinical trial, serum prolactin concentrations in females (n=112) increased from a mean of 10 ng/mL at baseline to 32 ng/mL after BARHEMSYS treatment and from 10 ng/mL to 19 ng/mL in males (n=61). No clinical consequences due to elevated prolactin levels were reported.</p>
<p align=""justify"">To minimize exposure to a breastfed infant, lactating women may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 48 hours after receiving a dose of BARHEMSYS.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>Pediatric Use</em>
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>Geriatric Use</em>
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>Renal Impairment</em>
Avoid BARHEMSYS in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The pharmacokinetics of amisulpride in patients with severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied in clinical trials. Amisulpride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and patients with severe renal impairment may have increased systemic exposure and an increased risk of adverse reactions.</p>
<p align=""justify"">No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment
(eGFR = 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Drug Interactions</strong></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>BARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent QT prolongation. To avoid potential additive effects, avoid use of BARHEMSYS in patients taking droperidol.</li>
 	<li>ECG monitoring is recommended in patients taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval (e.g., ondansetron).</li>
 	<li>Reciprocal antagonism of effects occurs between dopamine agonists (e.g., levodopa) and BARHEMSYS. Avoid using levodopa with BARHEMSYS.</li>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Collaboration to address product development and scale up challenges posed by current pandemic
Basel, March 26, 2020 — Today, Novartis and a consortium of life sciences companies announced an important collaboration to accelerate the development, manufacture and delivery of vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments for COVID-19 in response to the pandemic. The industry brings a range of assets, resources, and expertise needed to identify effective and scalable solutions to the pandemic that is affecting billions worldwide. Effects on health systems, economies, and livelihoods are significant, and effective response requires an unprecedented collaboration across government, academia, private sector, and philanthropy.
As co-chair of a consortium of life science companies headquartered across three continents, Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, said, “We feel a deep shared responsibility to see if there are specific areas where collaboration across the life sciences industry and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation can accelerate solutions to this pandemic. In addition to the individual contributions companies are already making, collective action is critical to ensure any promising studies into vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics are quickly scaled to people around the world who are affected by this pandemic.”
Trials of existing drugs, diagnostic tests, compounds, and investigational vaccines have begun around the world to identify interventions to slow or end the pandemic. Products that demonstrate efficacy will require clinical study, scale up of manufacturing, and distribution if proven effective. These are areas that the life sciences industry has extensive experience in managing for products that reach billions of people every day.
Mark Suzman, chief executive officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said, “We know that the private sector is where the technical skills from discovery to clinical trials to commercialization know-how sits. We look to harness that knowledge and experience, combine it where possible, to connect with national regulators and the World Health Organization to see if we can help flatten the curve of this pandemic and make sure the results reach everyone around the world, particularly those at highest risk and the poorest.”
Following a conference call with Gates Foundation leadership earlier this month, companies are working to identify concrete actions that will accelerate treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics to the field. As a first step, 15 companies have agreed to share their proprietary libraries of molecular compounds that already have some degree of safety and activity data – with the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator launched by the Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard two weeks ago to quickly screen them for potential against COVID-19. Successful hits would move rapidly into in vivotrials in as little as two months.
“This is an encouraging start in a critical area because if any of these compounds are shown to be effective against COVID-19 it dramatically accelerates the path to product approval and scale up,” said Suzman. “While each of the partners will also be pursuing other efforts in partnership with national governments and other partners, it is a great example of why we are optimistic that this unprecedented collaboration will provide a platform for a fundamentally different kind of partnership to help address this global health emergency.”
Companies participating in the collaboration include:
BD, Boehringer Ingelheim, bioMerieux, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GSK, J&J, Merck (MSD), Merck (Merck KGaA), Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi.

<p align=""left"">RALEIGH, N.C., March 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PRA Health Sciences announced today the commercial availability of the COVID-19 Monitoring Program, a mobile app-driven, tiered initiative that allows employers, payers, providers and health systems to track the health and wellbeing of individuals who may be asymptomatic, exposed or diagnosed with COVID-19 during the pandemic.</p>
Based on an individual’s COVID-19 disease status, they are assigned to one of three groups:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The educational program, which provides vital sign tracking, prevention techniques and mental health support for those who are asymptomatic.</li>
 	<li>The quarantine program, which delivers insights on what to watch for, addresses feelings of fear and isolation, and connects with a healthcare professional for those who have been exposed to COVID-19.</li>
 	<li>The in-depth monitoring program, which addresses symptom management, frequent monitoring by a healthcare professional and care coordination for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are still at home.</li>
</ul>
By downloading the program’s app on their personal mobile devices, participants in the program will be able to report key health metrics related to COVID-19 such as body temperature, heart rate and pulse oximetry. In addition, participants report on symptoms of COVID-19 like shortness of breath, fatigue and changes in coughing. Participants benefit from PRA’s nurse-led clinical call center staff, who monitor the information reported through the app on a daily basis. The trained staff can address physical symptoms, as well as the social and psychological impacts they may be experiencing.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the critical need for organizations of all sizes to be able to remotely assist individuals in monitoring their health and wellbeing,” said Kent Thoelke, Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at PRA Health Sciences. “Given the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are about to see our healthcare system and its infrastructure significantly stretched. With this program, individuals can have the peace of mind that they can connect with a healthcare professional from the comfort of their own homes while maintaining social distancing. Having the ability to interact with individuals remotely during this uncertain time is critical to maintaining the infrastructure and capability of the healthcare system as well as safety of patients and business continuity.”
The program, which was created by Care Innovations, a PRA Health Sciences company, can be deployed within days. Built on the cloud based Health Harmony Digital Health Platform, the program can also scale immediately and receive updated content as guidelines are changed.
PRA is deploying the COVID-19 Monitoring Program and mobile app to healthcare organizations, large employers, and the company is in discussions with academic institutions, governmental organizations, health departments and other private businesses to roll out the program.

PRINCETON, N.J.--(<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com&amp;esheet=52194838&amp;newsitemid=20200326005222&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bristol-Myers+Squibb+Company&amp;index=1&amp;md5=b09e829573cbbf29281e9f07ae7a36b1"" rel=""nofollow"">Bristol-Myers Squibb Company</a> (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZEPOSIA<sup>®</sup> (ozanimod) 0.92 mg for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease.<sup>1</sup> ZEPOSIA, an oral medication taken once daily, is the only approved sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that offers RMS patients an initiation with no genetic test and no label-based first-dose observation required for patients.<sup>1,4,5</sup> An up-titration scheme should be used to reach the maintenance dosage of ZEPOSIA, as a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays may occur.<sup>1</sup>
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves, creating damaging lesions that make it harder for signals to travel between each nerve cell.<sup>6,7</sup> This “signal breakdown” can lead to symptoms and relapses.<sup>6,8</sup>
“With the FDA approval of ZEPOSIA, appropriate patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis will have another oral treatment option with meaningful efficacy to help address the disease’s hallmark relapses and brain lesions,”<sup>9</sup> said <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com%2Fabout-us%2Fleadership%2Fleadership-team.html&amp;esheet=52194838&amp;newsitemid=20200326005222&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Samit+Hirawat%2C+M.D.&amp;index=2&amp;md5=61fcd2584168c7bac939da17dfe21202"" rel=""nofollow"">Samit Hirawat, M.D.</a>, chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “ZEPOSIA has substantial clinical potential, and we are well positioned with our heritage in transformational science to ensure this innovative compound ultimately benefits as many patients as possible.”
The approval is based on data from the largest pivotal, head-to-head RMS studies with an active comparator to date: the randomized, active-controlled Phase 3 SUNBEAM™ (safety and efficacy of ZEPOSIA versus interferon beta-1a in relapsing multiple sclerosis) and RADIANCE™ (safety and efficacy of the selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator ZEPOSIA in relapsing multiple sclerosis) Part B clinical trials of more than 2,600 adults.<sup>1,2,3,10</sup> In both trials – as compared to AVONEX<sup>®</sup> (interferon beta-1a), ZEPOSIA delivered powerful efficacy as measured by annualized relapse rate (ARR), as well as on the number and size of brain lesions.<sup>1,2,3</sup>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>ZEPOSIA demonstrated a relative reduction in ARR versus AVONEX of 48% through one year and 38% at two years (absolute ARR of 0.18 versus 0.35 and 0.17 versus 0.28, respectively).<sup>1,2,3</sup></li>
 	<li>At one year, treatment with ZEPOSIA reduced the number of T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced (GdE) brain lesions more than AVONEX (0.16 vs 0.43), a relative reduction of 63%, and reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions (1.47 vs. 2.84), a relative reduction of 48%.<sup>1,3</sup></li>
 	<li>At two years, treatment with ZEPOSIA reduced the number of T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced (GdE) brain lesions more than AVONEX (0.18 vs 0.37), a relative reduction of 53%.<sup>1,2</sup> ZEPOSIA also reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions vs AVONEX (1.84 vs 3.18), a relative reduction of 42%.<sup>1,2</sup></li>
</ul>
There was no statistically significant difference in the three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression between ZEPOSIA- and AVONEX- treated patients over two years.<sup>1</sup>
ZEPOSIA demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability in the Phase 3 SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B trials.<sup>1,2,3</sup> ZEPOSIA is contraindicated in patients who in the last six months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure; patients who have a presence of Mobitz type II second or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker; patients with severe untreated sleep apnea; and patients taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.<sup>1</sup> ZEPOSIA is associated with the following Warnings and Precautions: increased risk of infections, bradyarrhythmia and atrioventricular conduction delays, liver injury, fetal risk, increased blood pressure, respiratory effects, macular edema, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, additive immunosuppressive effects from prior immune-modulating treatments, severe increase in disability after stopping ZEPOSIA, and immune system effects after stopping ZEPOSIA.<sup>1</sup> Please see Important Safety Information for additional details. The most common adverse reactions (incidence =4%) were upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension.<sup>1</sup>
Before initiation of treatment with ZEPOSIA, all patients require assessments including a recent complete blood count including lymphocyte count (within six months or after discontinuation of prior MS therapy), an ECG to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present, a recent liver function test (within six months), and consideration of current and prior medications, including vaccinations.<sup>1</sup> For patients with a history of uveitis or macular edema, an ophthalmic assessment is required.<sup>1</sup>
“Treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis is critical to address this devastating neurological disease.<sup>11</sup> I’m excited, with the introduction of ZEPOSIA, I will have a new oral option to offer my RMS patients that has demonstrated efficacy and safety,”<sup>1</sup> said Bruce Cree, M.D., Ph.D., M.A.S., professor of clinical neurology, University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Weill Institute for Neurosciences and clinical research director, UCSF MS Center.
“Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and often disabling disease that affects nearly one million people in the United States.<sup>9,12</sup>Ongoing treatment with disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number of disease attacks,”<sup>11</sup> said Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research, National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “Each person can respond differently to these medications, which is why having treatment options is so important. We are pleased that there will now be another effective treatment option for people with MS.”
As the country’s healthcare system is dealing with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, Bristol Myers Squibb has made the decision to delay commercialization of ZEPOSIA. The Company made the decision based on what’s in the best health interest of our patients, customers and employees. Bristol Myers Squibb will continue to monitor the environment and will partner with the neurology community to inform launch timing.
A Marketing Authorization Application for ZEPOSIA for the treatment of adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the European Union is currently under review with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A regulatory decision from the EMA is expected in the first half of 2020.
<b>About SUNBEAM™</b>
SUNBEAM is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral ZEPOSIA (0.92 mg, equivalent to 1 mg) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX<sup>®</sup> (interferon beta-1a) for at least a 12-month treatment period.<sup>3</sup> The study included 1,346 people living with RMS across 152 sites in 20 countries.<sup>3</sup>
The primary endpoint of the trial was annualized relapse rates (ARR) during the treatment period.<sup>3</sup> The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months and number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 12.<sup>3</sup>
An analysis of the time to onset of three-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.<sup>1,2,3</sup>
<b>About RADIANCE™</b>
RADIANCE Part B is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral ZEPOSIA (0.92 mg, equivalent to 1 mg) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX<sup>®</sup> (interferon beta-1a) over a 24-month treatment period.<sup>2</sup> The study included 1,320 people living with RMS across 150 sites in 21 countries.<sup>2</sup>
The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR over 24 months.<sup>2</sup> The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 24 months.<sup>2</sup>
An analysis of the time to onset of three-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.<sup>1,2,3</sup>
<b>About Multiple Sclerosis</b>
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves.<sup>6</sup> The myelin damage disrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body.<sup>7</sup> Ultimately, the nerves themselves may deteriorate — a process that's currently irreversible.<sup>13</sup>
RMS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, is characterized by clearly defined attacks of worsening neurologic function.<sup>14</sup> These attacks — often called relapses, flare-ups or exacerbations — are followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remissions), during which symptoms improve partially or completely with no apparent progression of disease.<sup>14</sup> RMS is the most common disease course at the time of diagnosis.<sup>14</sup> Approximately 85% of patients are initially diagnosed with RMS, compared with 10-15% with progressive forms of the disease.<sup>14</sup>
<b>About ZEPOSIA<sup>®</sup> (ozanimod)</b>
ZEPOSIA<sup>®</sup> is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5.<sup>1</sup> ZEPOSIA blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood<sup>1</sup> The mechanism by which ozanimod exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown but may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.<sup>1</sup>
ZEPOSIA is also in development for additional immune-inflammatory indications, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.<sup>15,16</sup>
<b>Indication</b>
ZEPOSIA is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.

</ul>
<b>Infections:</b> ZEPOSIA may increase the susceptibility to infections. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS therapy) complete blood count (CBC) including lymphocyte count before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Delay initiation of ZEPOSIA in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Consider interruption of treatment with ZEPOSIA if a patient develops a serious infection. Continue monitoring for infections up to 3 months after discontinuing ZEPOSIA
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Herpes zoster was reported as an adverse reaction in ZEPOSIA-treated patients. Herpes simplex encephalitis and varicella zoster meningitis have been reported with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox), or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV), should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating ZEPOSIA. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with ZEPOSIA</li>
 	<li>Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) were reported in patients treated with another S1P receptor modulator. If CM is suspected, ZEPOSIA should be suspended until cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated.</li>
 	<li>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that typically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. No cases of PML were identified in active-controlled MS clinical trials with ZEPOSIA. PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators and other MS therapies and has been associated with some risk factors. If PML is suspected, withhold ZEPOSIA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. If confirmed, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued</li>
 	<li>In clinical studies, patients who received ZEPOSIA were not to receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS. Concomitant use of ZEPOSIA with any of these therapies would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression. When switching to ZEPOSIA from immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects</li>
 	<li>Use of live <i>attenuated</i> vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months after treatment with ZEPOSIA. If live <i>attenuated</i> vaccine immunizations are required, administer at least 1 month prior to initiation of ZEPOSIA</li>
</ul>
<b>Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays:</b> Since initiation of ZEPOSIA may result in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, dose titration is recommended to help reduce cardiac effects. Initiation of ZEPOSIA without dose escalation may result in greater decreases in heart rate. If treatment with ZEPOSIA is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought for those individuals:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>with significant QT prolongation</li>
 	<li>with arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class 1a or III anti-arrhythmic drugs</li>
 	<li>with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension</li>
 	<li>with a history of Mobitz type II second-degree or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sinoatrial heart block</li>
</ul>
<b>Liver Injury:</b> Elevations of aminotransferases may occur in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain liver function tests, if not recently available (i.e., within 6 months), before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have hepatic enzymes checked and ZEPOSIA should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Caution should be exercised when using ZEPOSIA in patients with history of significant liver disease
<b>Fetal Risk:</b> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal studies, ZEPOSIA may cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 3 months after stopping ZEPOSIA
<b>Increased Blood Pressure: </b>Increase in systolic pressure was observed after about 3 months of treatment and persisted throughout treatment. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment and managed appropriately. Certain foods that may contain very high amounts of tyramine could cause severe hypertension in patients taking ZEPOSIA. Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking ZEPOSIA
<b>Respiratory Effects:</b> ZEPOSIA may cause a decline in pulmonary function. Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy, if clinically indicated
<b>Macular edema:</b> S1P modulators have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. Patients with a history of uveitis or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Patients with a history of these conditions should have an ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, prior to treatment initiation and regular follow-up examinations. An ophthalmic evaluation is recommended in all patients at any time if there is a change in vision. Continued use of ZEPOSIA in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated; potential benefits and risks for the individual patient should be considered if deciding whether ZEPOSIA should be discontinued
<b>Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): </b>Rare cases of PRES have been reported in patients receiving a S1P receptor modulator. If a ZEPOSIA-treated patient develops unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms or any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase in intracranial pressure, a complete physical and neurological examination should be conducted. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued
<b>Unintended Additive Immunosuppressive Effects From Prior Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Drugs:</b>When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation. Initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA after treatment with alemtuzumab is not recommended
<b>Severe Increase in Disability After Stopping ZEPOSIA:</b> Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease should be considered after stopping ZEPOSIA treatment so patients should be monitored upon discontinuation
<b>Immune System Effects After Stopping ZEPOSIA:</b> After discontinuing ZEPOSIA, the median time for lymphocyte counts to return to the normal range was 30 days with approximately 90% of patients in the normal range within 3 months. Use of immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system, therefore caution should be applied when initiating other drugs 4 weeks after the last dose of ZEPOSIA
<b>Most common Adverse Reactions (= 4%):</b> upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension.

<p align=""justify"">
<strong>Paris – March 27, 2020</strong> – The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Sarclisa<sup>®</sup>(isatuximab). The CHMP recommends Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The European Commission (EC) will review the CHMP recommendation and a final decision on the Marketing Authorisation Application for Sarclisa in the E.U. is expected in the coming months. Sarclisa has not been approved for commercial use in the E.U. Sarclisa was approved in the US on March 2 in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adults with RRMM who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma is a complicated disease that continuously develops resistance to treatment, creating a significant need for continued innovation,”</em>said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Sanofi’s Global Head of Research &amp; Development. <em>“This positive CHMP opinion for Sarclisa brings us closer to our ambition to deliver a new treatment option for patients in Europe with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.”</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Sarclisa Phase 3 Study Results in Patients with RRMM </strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The CHMP positive opinion is based on data from ICARIA-MM, the first randomized Phase 3 trial to evaluate an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAB) in combination with pom-dex. In the ICARIA-MM study, Sarclisa added to pom-dex (Sarclisa combination therapy; n=154) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of progression free survival (PFS) with a median PFS of 11.53 months compared to 6.47 months with pom-dex alone (n=153; HR 0.596, 95% CI: 0.44-0.81, p=0.0010). Sarclisa combination therapy also demonstrated a significantly greater overall response rate compared to pom-dex alone (60.4% vs. 35.3%, p&lt;0.0001). In additional analyses, Sarclisa combination therapy compared to pom-dex alone showed a treatment benefit consistent across select subgroups reflective of real-world practice, including patients with high risk cytogenetics, those aged 75 years and older, patients with renal insufficiency, and patients who were refractory to lenalidomide.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The most common adverse reactions (all grades occurring in 20% or more of patients) in patients who received Sarclisa combination therapy were neutropenia (96%), infusion-related reactions (39%), pneumonia (31%), upper respiratory tract infection (57%) and diarrhea (26%). Serious adverse reactions that occurred in more than 5% of patients who received Sarclisa combination therapy included pneumonia (25.3%) and febrile neutropenia (12.3%). Permanent discontinuation of Sarclisa combination therapy due to an adverse reaction (Grades 3-4) occurred in 7% of patients, and 3% of patients discontinued due to an infusion-related reaction.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Multiple Myeloma: A Significant Burden to Patients</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy<sup>1</sup>, with more than 138,000 new diagnoses of multiple myeloma worldwide yearly.<sup>2</sup> In Europe, approximately 39,000 patients are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year.<sup>3</sup> Despite available treatments, multiple myeloma remains an incurable malignancy, and is associated with significant patient burden. Since multiple myeloma does not have a cure, most patients will relapse. Relapsed multiple myeloma is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory multiple myeloma refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.</p>
<strong>About Sarclisa</strong>
<p align=""justify"">CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on multiple myeloma cells and cell surface receptors, making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. Sarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma cells. It is designed to work through many mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. The clinical significance of these findings is under investigation.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sarclisa is approved in the U.S. in combination with pom-dex for the treatment of adults with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. In the U.S., the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Outside of the U.S., Sarclisa is an investigational agent and its safety and efficacy have not been established by any regulatory authority worldwide.</p>

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- <b>Quidel Corporation (NASDAQ: QDEL) (“Quidel”)</b>,a provider of rapid diagnostic testing solutions, cellular-based virology assays and molecular diagnostic systems, announced today that Quidel’s Lyra® SARS-CoV-2 Assay has received expanded Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) claims from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow testing with three additional thermocyclers: Applied Biosystems 7500 Standard, Roche LightCycler 480, and Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q.<sup>1</sup>
<b>Acceptable Specimens Expanded to Include Nasal and Nasal Turbinate Swabs</b>
Under the initial EUA, the Lyra® SARS-CoV-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test was intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens from patients suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. The list of acceptable specimens has been expanded by the CDC to include nasal and nasal turbinate swabs. Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, to perform high complexity tests. EUAs allow for the early availability of important diagnostic tools “when there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives.”<sup>2</sup>
The Lyra® reagents include unique features that provide for simple transport and storage, improved workflow, shorter time to result, and other benefits that favorably affect diagnostic test outcome. The Lyra SARS-CoV-2 Assay provides these and certain additional advantages over many other tests currently on the market for this novel coronavirus, including easier set-up and faster time to result.
<b>Quidel Receives CE Mark, Health Canada Authorization</b>
Separately, the Lyra® SARS-CoV-2 Assay received CE-Mark on March 25, 2020. The CE Mark allows Quidel to market and sell the Lyra® SARS-CoV-2 Assay in Europe, as well as other countries that accept the CE Mark. Also, on March 25, 2020, Quidel received authorization from Health Canada to market and sell the assay in Canada. The assay is currently available for sale in the United States under EUA and can be purchased by laboratory professionals through Quidel directly, or through their Cardinal Health representative.

<p class=""article-date"">LONDON (PRWEB) MARCH 26, 2020</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">As healthcare systems are overwhelmed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, British healthtech company Medopad is offering immediate support by providing its Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) software at cost to NHS Trusts across the UK and global healthcare providers. Medopad has worked with clinicians from Imperial College, Guys and St Thomas’s NHS Foundation Trust and Johns Hopkins to create a readily available, out-of-box version of its modular RPM platform configured for tracking COVID-19 that can be deployed in days. Through its RPM software, Medopad helps healthcare systems monitor ill and at-risk patients, enable care for chronically ill patients and provide insights to healthcare systems to help them prioritise resources and respond more effectively.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">To further support healthcare systems, Medopad is also working with its global partners, including Johns Hopkins and Tencent, to clinically validate digital biomarkers to identify individual patient risk for COVID-19 and monitor respiratory symptoms and disease progression using only a smartphone.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">Monitoring COVID-19 Patients and Protecting the Vulnerable
The WHO, NHS, and FDA have formally recommended that healthcare systems use telemedicine and RPM during the COVID-19 public health emergency to reduce the strain on healthcare systems and limit disease spread. Medopad’s clinically validated RPM solutions are secure, infrastructure-ready and scalable to address the demands on healthcare systems and providers, enabling more global understanding of the disease. Medopad’s RPM solution is CE registered and under FDA enforcement discretion and is ready to be deployed in the EU, US, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and beyond for supporting patient care with chronic conditions and configurable for rare diseases.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">Medopad’s app and clinician dashboard help track patient data and symptom progression to maintain ongoing patient care and support, flag patients with worsening symptoms and notify clinicians of a patient’s deteriorating health when they are out of the clinical setting. The patient’s mobile app allows them to opt-in to securely share personal health data, including vital signs such as temperature, respiration rate, and heart rate using their smartphone. Medopad has pioneered its RPM solution across fifteen NHS trusts in the UK in the past two years, working with Trusts like Chelsea and Westminster Foundation Trust on diseases like Heart Failure to to reduce the unpredictability of patients presenting at A&amp;E by collecting data and information on heart failure patients when outside of hospital settings.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">“As part of the NHSE Test Bed Programme we partnered with Medopad to empower our patients. Through the continuous monitoring of their health, we aim to reduce pressure on A&amp;E and outpatients and avoid hospital admissions and reduce hospital bed days. During the COVID-19 crisis, Medopad’s solution can allow hospitals to continuously monitor and engage with their patients without the need to bring them into the healthcare system where there is an elevated risk of them contracting COVID-19,” commented Felix Vaal, Senior Project Manager for Digital Innovation, Chelsea and Westminster Trust.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">Developing a COVID-19 Biomarker: Using a Smartphone to Monitor Symptoms and Disease Progression
Medopad is prioritising R&amp;D efforts for novel technologies that could help reduce the spread and management of COVID-19. Medopad is collaborating with Johns Hopkins and key opinion leaders from Imperial College and other major academic partners to fast-track the development and validation of a digital biomarker to determine an individual risk profile for COVID-19.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">“We have been working in collaboration with Medopad for over a year on a digital biomarker project. COVID-19 presents an opportunity for us to take this work further and develop a specific COVID-19 digital biomarker. The aim is to adjust the data points collected and focus specifically on cardio-respiratory diseases, diabetes and other conditions which compromise the immune system to identify those who are most at risk should they contract COVID-19,” added Alain Labrique, Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">Medopad is also developing a way to use a smartphone’s gyroscope-powered motion sensors to accurately measure an individual’s heart and respiratory rate without the need for additional hardware by placing a phone on the patient’s chest wall for 30-60 seconds. Developing and validating this digital biomarker, combined with other data points, will enable more efficient COVID-19 patient monitoring and clinical team support by remotely tracking vital signs that indicate the severity of COVID-19.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">Dan Vahdat, founder and CEO of Medopad, commented, “This is an unprecedented global health crisis that requires a global response. To do our part, Medopad is providing our platform and development efforts to aid in the fight of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have already had initial success detecting digital biomarkers for rare and chronic diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and are now shifting most of our resources towards COVID-19 efforts. Now is the time for global collaboration to help ease the burden of COVID-19 on our healthcare systems, reduce disease spread through remote patient monitoring and maintain the continuity of care for at-risk populations.”</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">Medopad is conducting feasibility studies and clinical trials to validate its digital biomarkers for detecting and assessing diseases and health conditions such as Parkinson’s with partners including Tencent, J&amp;J, Bayer and more. It is now working with partners including Johns Hopkins and Tencent to fast-track the development and validation of a specific digital biomarker for COVID-19 using only a smartphone.</p>
<p class=""responsiveNews"">“The joint Medopad and Tencent Medical AI lab have been working for the last 2 years on various digital biomarker projects. COVID-19 presents an opportunity for us to modify some of our R&amp;D work to showcase the power of using smartphones and simple devices to capture data directly from patients and the population at large and generating novel insights from it. Together with our academic partners, we are working on a number of digital biomarkers which can be done with only a smartphone to help unlock valuable data to better understand and treat COVID-19. While moving at pace, we continue to work closely with regulators and design our technology to maximise data privacy,” and Dr. David Wei Fan, Executive Director of Tencent Medical AI Lab.</p>

HERTFORDSHIRE, England &amp; PITTSBURGH &amp; NEW YORK--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Mylan N.V. (Nasdaq: MYL) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that due to the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including associated delays in the regulatory review process, the proposed transaction involving Mylan and Upjohn, a division of Pfizer, is now anticipated to close in the second half of 2020.
There are no additional changes to the previously announced terms or plans regarding the transaction. The two companies remain highly confident in the benefits of the pending transaction to their respective shareholders and other stakeholders. Mylan, Pfizer and Upjohn are working closely on integration planning and are making significant progress toward Day 1 readiness. Together the companies continue to progress toward a successful close.
The primary focus of both companies remains the health and safety of their dedicated and valued employees who are working tirelessly towards completion of this transaction while also maintaining their responsibility to meet patient needs during this extraordinary time.
Also, in light of increased meeting and other restrictions due to COVID-19 developments in the Netherlands, where Mylan is incorporated, Mylan’s extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “EGM”) to approve certain matters in connection with the transaction has been rescheduled from April 27, 2020, to June 30, 2020, and will be hosted in conjunction with the company’s annual general meeting of shareholders (the “AGM”) which is being scheduled for the same day. Accordingly, the record date for the EGM and the AGM in respect of Mylan’s ordinary shares is June 2, 2020 and the cut-off time for the EGM and the AGM – which is the time prior to which holders of Mylan ordinary shares can give notice of attendance at the applicable meeting or vote by internet or telephone or by submitting a proxy card - is 5:00 p.m. Central European Summer Time (CEST) on June 29, 2020. Further details about the time and location of the EGM and AGM will be announced once those have been finalized.
Mylan and Pfizer continue to look forward to the proposed combination creating a new champion for global health at the close of this transaction.

<strong>PARIS and LEXINGTON, MASS. - March 27, 2020</strong> – Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, and Translate Bio (NASDAQ: TBIO), a clinical-stage messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics company, will collaborate to develop a novel mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. This collaboration leverages an existing agreement from 2018 between the two companies to develop mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases.
Translate Bio has begun to produce multiple mRNA constructs and will use its mRNA platform to discover, design, and manufacture a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. Sanofi will provide deep vaccine expertise and support from its external research networks to advance vaccine candidates for potential further development.  Translate Bio has established 100 gram single-batch production with its clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics platform. Build-out is underway of dedicated manufacturing space through a contract manufacturing partner to accommodate at least two 250-gram batches per month.  Depending on the final human dose, the mRNA platform of Translate Bio has excellent promise to meet the future demands for a pandemic response.
For Sanofi, this marks a second collaboration in its efforts to develop a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In February 2020, Sanofi announced a collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to advance a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The agreement with BARDA calls for Sanofi to initiate development of a recombinant, protein-based vaccine candidate against COVID-19.
<em>“We are committed to leveraging different ways to address the COVID-19 public health crisis by testing treatments, as well as two vaccines using different platforms. We believe the more approaches we explore, the better our likelihood of success in achieving this goal,”</em> said David Loew, Global Head of Vaccines at Sanofi. <em>“Having sufficient installed capacity will be key to satisfy the strong demand for vaccines we will probably see, and based on the experience we’ve had under the collaboration to date, we believe the Translate Bio mRNA platform could help us meet that need.”</em>
<em>“The Translate Bio and Sanofi Pasteur teams have generated encouraging preclinical data across multiple infectious disease targets, as part of our ongoing mRNA vaccine collaboration. This work will serve as a strong foundation as we direct joint research efforts against COVID-19 to help address this public health threat,”</em> said Ronald Renaud, Chief Executive Officer of Translate Bio. <em>“Our collaborative efforts to combat COVID-19 will leverage Translate Bio’s innovative mRNA platform as well as Sanofi’s vaccine expertise and ongoing COVID-19 research with the goal of advancing a novel mRNA vaccine rapidly to the clinic.”</em>
<strong>About mRNA Vaccines</strong>
Vaccines work by mimicking disease agents to stimulate the immune system; building up a defense mechanism that remains active in the body to fight future infections. mRNA vaccines offer an innovative approach by delivering a nucleotide sequence encoding the antigen or antigens selected for their high potential to induce a protective immune response. mRNA vaccines also represent a potentially innovative alternative to conventional vaccine approaches for several reasons - their high potency, ability to initiate protein production without the need for nuclear entry, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration using non-viral delivery. This approach potentially enables the development of vaccines for disease areas where vaccination is not a viable option today. Additionally, a desired antigen or multiple antigens can be expressed from mRNA without the need to adjust the production process offering maximum flexibility and efficiency in development.
<strong>About the Sanofi Pasteur/Translate Bio Collaboration</strong>
In 2018, Translate Bio entered into a collaboration and exclusive licensing agreement with Sanofi Pasteur Inc., the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, to develop mRNA vaccines for up to five infectious disease pathogens. This collaboration brings together Sanofi Pasteur’s leadership in vaccines and Translate Bio’s mRNA research and development expertise. Under the agreement, the companies are jointly conducting research and development activities to advance mRNA vaccines and mRNA vaccine platform development during a three-year research term. Translate Bio and Sanofi Pasteur have advanced the preclinical development vaccine programs including screening, optimization and production of mRNA and LNP formulations across multiple targets.
<strong>About Translate Bio</strong>
Translate Bio is a clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics company developing a new class of potentially transformative medicines to treat diseases caused by protein or gene dysfunction.  Translate Bio is primarily focused on applying its technology to treat pulmonary diseases caused by insufficient protein production or where the reduction of proteins can modify disease. Translate Bio’s lead program is being developed as a treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) and is in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. The Company also believes its technology is applicable to a broad range of diseases, including diseases that affect the liver. Additionally, the platform may be applied to various classes of treatments, such as therapeutic antibodies or vaccines in areas such as infectious disease and oncology. For more information about the Company, please visit www.translate.bio or on Twitter at @TranslateBio.

<div class=""component rich-text osw-full field-content osw-initialized"">
PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – March 30, 2020 – The first patient outside of the U.S. has been treated as part of a global clinical program evaluating Kevzara® (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. The global clinical program has now been initiated in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and the United States – all countries that have been impacted by COVID-19.
This is the second multi-center, double-blind, Phase 2/3 trial as part of the Kevzara COVID-19 program, and the companies are continuing to work with health authorities around the world to secure initiation at additional sites. This follows Sanofi and Regeneron’s announcement earlier this month of the initiation of the first trial, which is U.S.-based.
<em>“Sanofi and Regeneron are relentlessly working to rapidly initiate trials around the world that will help determine whether Kevzara has the potential to play a role in addressing the COVID-19 global health crisis. These trials will provide important data to determine whether Kevzara ameliorates the life-threatening complications of COVID-19 infections by counteracting the overactive inflammatory responses in the lungs when damaged by the virus. In these unprecedented times, we are deeply grateful for the daily collaboration with health authorities that are enabling us to conduct this clinical work so quickly,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Sanofi’s Global Head of Research and Development. “In addition to this clinical trial aiming to help critically ill COVID-19 patients, our work continues to bring forth a vaccine for disease prevention, along with efforts to provide other important Sanofi medicines that may help patients impacted by COVID-19.”</em>
Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway by binding and blocking the IL-6 receptor. IL-6 may play a role in driving the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19 infection. The role of IL-6 is supported by preliminary data from a single-arm study in China using another IL-6 receptor inhibitor.
<em>“Data from a single-arm study in China suggest that the interleukin-6 pathway may play an important role in the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Despite this encouraging finding, it's imperative to conduct a properly designed, randomized trial to understand the true impact of Kevzara, which we are now doing through this global clinical trial program,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “In addition to the Kevzara program, Regeneron continues to rapidly advance a novel antibody cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.”</em>
The trial outside of the U.S. will assess the safety and efficacy of adding a single intravenous dose of Kevzara to usual supportive care, compared to supportive care plus placebo. The trial has an adaptive design with two parts and is anticipated to enroll approximately 300 patients. The trial will recruit hospitalized patients from several countries who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19 infection.
Scientists have preliminary evidence that IL-6 may play a key role in driving the inflammatory immune response that causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients critically ill from COVID-19. In an initial, non-peer-reviewed case series from China, a 21-patient cohort of COVID-19 patients experienced rapidly reduced fevers and 75% of patients (15 out of 20) reduced their need for supplemental oxygen within days of receiving another IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab). Based on these results, China updated its COVID-19 treatment guidelines and approved the use of that IL-6 inhibitor to treat patients with severe or critical disease.
The use of Kevzara to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 is investigational and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.
<strong>About the Trial</strong>
This Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial uses an adaptive design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Kevzara in adults hospitalized with serious complications from COVID-19. To enter the trial, patients must have pneumonia and be hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 that is classified as severe or critical, or who are suffering from multi-organ dysfunction. After receiving the study dose, patients will be assessed for 60 days, or until hospital discharge or death.
In the Phase 2 part of the trial, patients will be randomized 2:2:1 into three groups: Kevzara higher dose, Kevzara lower dose and placebo.
The Phase 2 findings will be utilized in an adaptive manner to determine transition into Phase 3, helping to determine the endpoints, patient numbers and doses.
If the trial continues with all three treatment arms to the end, it is expected to enroll approximately 300 patients, depending on the status of the COVID-19 outbreak and the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19.
<strong>About Kevzara® (sarilumab) Injection</strong>
Kevzara is currently approved in multiple countries to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded to or tolerated previous therapy.
Kevzara was jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody. Kevzara binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor, and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity, joint destruction and other systemic problems. Kevzara is being investigated for its ability to reduce the overactive inflammatory immune response associated with COVID-19 based on evidence of markedly elevated levels of IL-6 in severely ill patients infected with coronaviruses.
<strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KEVZARA® (sarilumab) INJECTION</strong>
<strong>KEVZARA can cause serious side effects including:</strong>
<strong>SERIOUS INFECTIONS: KEVZARA is a medicine that affects your immune system. KEVZARA can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have serious infections while using KEVZARA, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting KEVZARA. Your healthcare provider should monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with KEVZARA.</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Before starting KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you:
<ul>
 	<li>think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, with or without a fever. Symptoms may include sweats or chills, muscle aches, a cough, shortness of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, if you feel very tired, or if you are being treated for an infection, get a lot of infections or have repeated infections</li>
 	<li>have diabetes, HIV, or a weakened immune system</li>
 	<li>have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB</li>
 	<li>live or have lived, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance of getting certain fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis)</li>
 	<li>have or have had hepatitis</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>After starting KEVZARA, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none"">
<ul>
 	<li>CHANGES IN CERTAIN LABORATORY TEST RESULTS: Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before and after starting KEVZARA to check for low neutrophil (white blood cells that help the body fight off bacterial infections) counts, low platelet (blood cells that help with blood clotting and stop bleeding) counts, and an increase in certain liver function tests. Changes in test results are common with KEVZARA and can be severe. You may also have changes in other laboratory tests, such as your blood cholesterol levels. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests 4 to 8 weeks after starting KEVZARA and then every 6 months during treatment to check for an increase in blood cholesterol levels.
<ul>

HERTFORDSHIRE, England, PITTSBURGH and MUMBAI, India, March 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2762647-1&amp;h=2992084050&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mylan.com%2F&amp;a=Mylan+N.V."" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Mylan N.V.</a> (NASDAQ: MYL) and Lupin Limited (Lupin) today announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Nepexto<sup>®</sup>, a biosimilar to Enbrel<sup>®</sup> (etanercept), for all indications of the reference product including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis), plaque psoriasis and paediatric plaque psoriasis.
The positive CHMP opinion is based on a biosimilarity assessment which included preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference product. In addition, a phase 3 clinical study<sup>i</sup> in patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis confirmed equivalence of Nepexto to the reference product in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.
The CHMP positive opinion will now be considered by the European Commission (EC). Once approved the EC will grant a centralized marketing authorization for member countries of the EU. The decision on the EC's approval is expected in May 2020.
Mylan President <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2762647-1&amp;h=3621640&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mylan.com%2Fen%2Fabout-mylan%2Fleadership%2Fpresident-rajiv-malik&amp;a=Rajiv+Malik"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Rajiv Malik</a> commented, ""We are pleased with the positive CHMP opinion for Nepexto, biosimilar etanercept. This recommendation validates the strong scientific program supporting this important treatment, which is one of 20 products in our broad and diverse biosimilars portfolio, and our shared commitment with Lupin to help increase access to more affordable biologic treatments, such as etanercept, in Europe and many other regions around the world.""
Vinita Gupta, CEO, Lupin Limited said, ""Biosimilars like Nepexto will play a critical role in expanding access to patients in Europe, providing an effective treatment for multiple therapies including rheumatoid arthritis. We are extremely pleased with the positive CHMP opinion on our application. This milestone brings us one step closer to bringing an affordable biosimilar to etanercept to the European market through our partner Mylan. Once approved by the European Commission, Nepexto will be our first biosimilar to receive regulatory approval in Europe. Building on this progress, we continue to focus on advancing our biosimilar pipeline.""
Enbrel had sales of approximately $9.6 billion globally for the 12 months ending December 2019, according to IQVIA.
In June 2018, Lupin and Mylan announced a collaboration to commercialize a biosimilar to etanercept in several global markets.
<b>About Etanercept
</b>Etanercept is an injectable, biologic medicine which inhibits Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF). TNF is a key cytokine involved in the pro-inflammatory cascade in many chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis or plaque psoriasis. By specifically binding to TNF, etanercept blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other disease symptoms.

<h3><b><i>Only PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy to demonstrate a significant survival benefit in combination with etoposide and a choice of carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy
</i></b></h3>

<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca’s <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) has been approved in the US as a 1st-line treatment for adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapies, etoposide plus either carboplatin or cisplatin (platinum-etoposide).
The approval by the Food and Drug Administration was based on positive results from the Phase III CASPIAN trial showing<i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with SoC platinum-etoposide demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) versus SoC alone.
SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to chemotherapy.<sup>1,2</sup>
Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “The US approval of <i>Imfinzi</i> brings a new medicine to extensive-stage small cell lung cancer patients in urgent need of new options. <i>Imfinzi</i> is the only immunotherapy to show both a significant survival benefit and improved response rate in combination with chemotherapy for these patients, an important step forward in treating this devastating disease.”
Jonathan Goldman, MD, Associate Professor of Hematology &amp; Oncology, UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, California and a lead investigator in the Phase III CASPIAN trial, said: “Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer continue to face a poor prognosis, and finding new medicines to improve outcomes in this setting has been a formidable challenge. The CASPIAN trial enables clinicians to choose durvalumab in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin, making this an important new 1st-line treatment option for patients that is both effective and well-tolerated.”
The Phase III CASPIAN trial had two primary endpoints comparing experimental arms to SoC. In the <i>Imfinzi</i> plus SoC arm, the risk of death was reduced by 27% (equal to a hazard ratio of 0.73; 95% CI 0.59-0.91; p=0.0047), with median OS of 13.0 months versus 10.3 months for SoC alone. Results also showed an increased confirmed objective response rate in the <i>Imfinzi</i> plus SoC arm (68% versus 58% for SoC alone). The safety and tolerability for <i>Imfinzi</i> plus SoC was consistent with the known safety profiles of these medicines. The <i>Imfinzi</i> plus SoC data from the CASPIAN trial were published in <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2819%2932222-6/fulltext"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>The Lancet</i></a>.<sup>3</sup>
The second experimental arm testing tremelimumab added to <i>Imfinzi</i> and SoC <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/imfinzi-confirmed-a-sustained-overall-survival-benefit-in-final-analysis-of-the-phase-iii-caspian-trial-in-1st-line-extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer.html"">recently completed</a>, but did not meet its primary endpoint. Details will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
The CASPIAN trial used a fixed dose of <i>Imfinzi</i> (1500mg) administered every three weeks for four cycles while in combination with chemotherapy and then every four weeks until disease progression. As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is also being<b> </b>tested following concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC in the Phase III ADRIATIC trial with data anticipated in 2021.
<i>Imfinzi</i> received its first approval based on the Phase III CASPIAN trial in Singapore for patients with ES-SCLC in February 2020. <i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is currently under regulatory review for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the 1st-line setting based on the Phase III CASPIAN trial in the EU and Japan.
<b>Small cell lung cancer</b>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one fifth of all cancer deaths.<sup>4</sup> Lung cancer is broadly split into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with about 15% classified as SCLC.<sup>5</sup> About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with ES-SCLC, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.<sup>6</sup> Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.<sup>6</sup>
<b>CASPIAN</b>
CASPIAN was a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared <i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy, or <i>Imfinzi </i>and chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation. The trial was conducted in more than 200 centres across 23 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was OS in each of the two experimental arms.
<b><i>Imfinzi</i></b>
<i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.
<i>Imfinzi </i>is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. <i>Imfinzi</i> is approved for the 1st-line treatment of ES-SCLC in combination with SoC chemotherapy in the US and Singapore.<i> Imfinzi</i> is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.
As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.
<b>Tremelimumab</b>
Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T-cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death.  Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with <i>Imfinzi</i> in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and liver cancer.
<b>AstraZeneca in lung cancer</b>
AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. We aim to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines <i>Iressa</i> (gefitinib) and <i>Tagrisso</i> (osimertinib), and its ongoing Phase III trials ADAURA, LAURA, and FLAURA2.<sup>7-9</sup>We are also committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test <i>Tagrisso</i> in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. <i>Enhertu</i> (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments.
An extensive late-stage Immuno-Oncology programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.<sup>10</sup> <i>Imfinzi</i>, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. <i>Imfinzi</i> is also in development in the Phase II combination trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline.
<b>AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)</b>
Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca believes that IO-based therapies offer the potential for life-changing cancer treatments for the clear majority of patients.
The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.
<b>AstraZeneca in Oncology</b>
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients' lives and the Company's future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca's main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

<b>-- Taltz is the first and only IL-17A antagonist approved to treat this population --</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
INDIANAPOLIS, March 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has approved a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Taltz<sup>®</sup> (ixekizumab) injection, 80 mg/mL for the treatment of pediatric patients (ages 6 to under 18) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Psoriasis affects nearly 8 million people in the U.S.<sup>1</sup> Many people living with psoriasis develop symptoms during childhood.<sup>2</sup>
""As I have often seen in my clinic, psoriasis is particularly challenging for children and adolescents, resulting in itchy and painful symptoms that can feel especially embarrassing for pediatric patients during a crucial developmental period in their young lives,"" said Jennifer Cather, M.D., Modern Research Associates, Dallas, Texas. ""In the Phase 3 pediatric study, half of patients treated with Taltz achieved completely clear skin after only 12 weeks of treatment. These results and the subsequent FDA approval make a strong case for Taltz as an effective treatment option for doctors to consider for pediatric patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.""
Taltz should not be used in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients. Taltz may increase the risk of infection. Other warnings and precautions for Taltz include pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis, hypersensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunizations. See Important Safety Information below.
""At Lilly, we are working to unite our compassion for individuals with our enthusiasm for scientific discovery in an effort to provide medicines that help make life better for people,"" said Patrik Jonsson, senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. ""We have over five years of data demonstrating that Taltz is a safe and effective treatment option for psoriasis in adults, and with this approval, we're pleased to now be able to offer Taltz to more people living with this challenging condition.""
The safety, tolerability and efficacy of Taltz in patients ages 6 to under 18 was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study that included 171 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The co-primary endpoints of the study were the proportion of patients achieving a 75 percent improvement from baseline on their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) and a static Physician's Global Assessment of clear or almost clear skin (sPGA 0,1) at Week 12.
Patients were randomized to receive Taltz (20 mg for &lt;25 kg, 40 mg for 25-50 kg or 80 mg for &gt;50 kg through Week 12, with 40 mg, 80 mg or 160 mg starting doses, respectively) or placebo. At 12 weeks, the proportion of patients achieving the co-primary endpoints was superior to placebo with statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.001):
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>89 percent of patients treated with Taltz achieved PASI 75 compared to 25 percent of patients treated with placebo.</li>
 	<li>81 percent of patients treated with Taltz achieved sPGA 0,1 compared to 11 percent of patients treated with placebo.</li>
</ul>
Taltz also met all major secondary endpoints in the study (P&lt;0.001), which included the proportion of patients achieving PASI 90, sPGA (0) and PASI 100 at Week 12, and at least a four-point improvement in Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS =4) among patients with baseline Itch NRS =4 at Week 12, as well as PASI 75 and sPGA 0,1 at Week 4.
Overall, the safety profile observed in pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis treated with Taltz every four weeks is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of the frequencies of conjunctivitis (3%), influenza (2%) and urticaria (2%). In this clinical trial, Crohn's disease occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group (0.9%) than the placebo group (0%) during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period. Crohn's disease occurred in a total of four Taltz-treated subjects (2.0%) in the clinical trial. The Taltz safety profile has been studied across 13 clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, with over 5,000 patients receiving Taltz, with a total exposure of over 17,000 patient-years.
""Due to limited pediatric psoriasis treatment options available, treating children and adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis can be challenging,"" said Stacie Bell, chief scientific and medical officer, National Psoriasis Foundation. ""Having more FDA approved pediatric psoriasis treatment options available is a positive step forward in helping relieve the burden of psoriasis for pediatric patients, their families and the health care providers that treat these young patients.""
Taltz was first approved by the FDA in March 2016 for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The FDA also approved Taltz for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis in December 2017 and for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis in August 2019.
Lilly will work with insurers, health systems and providers to ensure patients are able to access this treatment. Patients, physicians, pharmacists or other healthcare professionals with questions about Taltz should contact The Lilly Answers Center at <b>1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979)</b> or visit <b><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2763295-1&amp;h=408140695&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lilly.com%2F&amp;a=www.lilly.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">www.lilly.com</a></b>.
<b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR TALTZ
</b>Taltz is approved for the treatment of pediatric patients ages 6 to under 18 with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. In addition, Taltz is approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Taltz is also approved for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TALTZ</b>
<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS
</b>Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections
</b>Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.
<b>Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis
</b>Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
<b>Hypersensitivity
</b>Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each =0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.
<b>Inflammatory Bowel Disease
</b>Patients treated with Taltz may be at an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. In clinical trials, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group than the placebo group.  During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease and if IBD occurs, discontinue Taltz and initiate appropriate medical management.
<b>Immunizations
</b>Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</b>Most common adverse reactions (=1%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profiles observed in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis were consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis in psoriatic arthritis and conjunctivitis, influenza, and urticaria in pediatric psoriasis.

ZEPOSIA is an oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity selectively to S1P subtypes 1 (S1P<sub>1</sub>) and 5 (S1P<sub>5</sub>). The CHMP recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union.
“This positive CHMP opinion reinforces that ZEPOSIA has the potential to become an important treatment option for patients with relapsing remitting MS with active disease. There remains a need for effective and safe therapies that impact both the relapses and brain lesions that are characteristic of this disease,” said <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com%2Fabout-us%2Fleadership%2Fleadership-team.html&amp;esheet=52195483&amp;newsitemid=20200327005326&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Samit+Hirawat%2C+M.D.&amp;index=2&amp;md5=a0c5cc308a3684ea856e7c6fddc8b6cf"" rel=""nofollow"">Samit Hirawat, M.D.</a>, chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb<i>. </i>“We look forward to the European Commission’s decision and the potential to bring ZEPOSIA to patients in the EU.”
The CHMP adopted the positive opinion based on data from the randomized, active-controlled Phase 3 SUNBEAM™ and RADIANCE™ Part B clinical trials, which enrolled more than 2,600 patients across 150 sites in more than 20 countries. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZEPOSIA for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) on March 25, 2020.
<b>About SUNBEAM™</b>
SUNBEAM is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ZEPOSIA (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI, respectively) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX<sup>®</sup> (interferon beta-1a) for at least a 12-month treatment period. The study included 1,346 people living with RMS across 152 sites in 20 countries.
The primary endpoint of the trial was annualized relapse rates (ARR) during the treatment period. The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months, number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 12 and percent change from baseline in whole brain volume at month 12. Cortical grey and thalamic volume changes were also prospectively assessed versus active comparator.
An analysis of the time to onset of three-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.
<b>About RADIANCE™</b>
RADIANCE Part B is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ZEPOSIA (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI, respectively) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX<sup>®</sup> (interferon beta-1a) over a 24-month treatment period. The study included 1,320 people living with RMS across 150 sites in 21 countries.
The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR over 24 months. The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 24 months, number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 24 and percent change from baseline in whole brain volume at month 24. Cortical grey and thalamic volume changes were also prospectively assessed versus active comparator.
An analysis of the time to onset of three-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.
<b>About Multiple Sclerosis</b>
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves. The myelin damage disrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Ultimately, the nerves themselves may deteriorate — a process that's currently irreversible. MS affects 700,000 people in Europe and approximately 2.5 million people worldwide.
Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by clearly defined attacks of worsening neurologic function. These attacks — often called relapses, flare-ups or exacerbations — are followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remissions), during which symptoms improve partially or completely with no apparent progression of disease. RRMS is the most common disease course at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 85 percent of patients are initially diagnosed with RRMS, compared with 10-15 percent with progressive forms of the disease.
<b>About ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod)</b>
ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) is an oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5. ZEPOSIA blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood.The mechanism by which ZEPOSIA exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown but may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.
ZEPOSIA is also in development for additional immune-inflammatory indications, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>Contraindications:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Patients who in the last 6 months, experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure or have a presence of Mobitz type II second or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker</li>
 	<li>Patients with severe untreated sleep apnea</li>
 	<li>Patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor</li>
</ul>
<b>Infections:</b> ZEPOSIA may increase the susceptibility to infections. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS therapy) complete blood count (CBC) including lymphocyte count before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Delay initiation of ZEPOSIA in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Consider interruption of treatment with ZEPOSIA if a patient develops a serious infection. Continue monitoring for infections up to 3 months after discontinuing ZEPOSIA.
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Herpes zoster was reported as an adverse reaction in ZEPOSIA-treated patients. Herpes simplex encephalitis and varicella zoster meningitis have been reported with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox), or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV), should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating ZEPOSIA. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with ZEPOSIA</li>
 	<li>Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) were reported in patients treated with another S1P receptor modulator. If CM is suspected, ZEPOSIA should be suspended until cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated.</li>
 	<li>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that typically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. No cases of PML were identified in active-controlled MS clinical trials with ZEPOSIA. PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators and other MS therapies and has been associated with some risk factors. If PML is suspected, withhold ZEPOSIA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. If confirmed, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued</li>
 	<li>In clinical studies, patients who received ZEPOSIA were not to receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS. Concomitant use of ZEPOSIA with any of these therapies would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression. When switching to ZEPOSIA from immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects</li>
 	<li>Use of live <i>attenuated</i> vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months after treatment with ZEPOSIA. If live <i>attenuated</i> vaccine immunizations are required, administer at least 1 month prior to initiation of ZEPOSIA</li>
</ul>
<b>Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays:</b> Since initiation of ZEPOSIA may result in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, dose titration is recommended to help reduce cardiac effects. Initiation of ZEPOSIA without dose escalation may result in greater decreases in heart rate. If treatment with ZEPOSIA is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought for those individuals:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>with significant QT prolongation</li>
 	<li>with arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class 1a or III anti-arrhythmic drugs</li>
 	<li>with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension</li>
 	<li>with a history of Mobitz type II second-degree or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sinoatrial heart block</li>
</ul>
<b>Liver Injury:</b> Elevations of aminotransferases may occur in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain liver function tests, if not recently available (i.e., within 6 months), before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have hepatic enzymes checked and ZEPOSIA should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Caution should be exercised when using ZEPOSIA in patients with history of significant liver disease.
<b>Fetal Risk:</b> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal studies, ZEPOSIA may cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 3 months after stopping ZEPOSIA.
<b>Increased Blood Pressure: </b>Increase in systolic pressure was observed after about 3 months of treatment and persisted throughout treatment. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment and managed appropriately. Certain foods that may contain very high amounts of tyramine could cause severe hypertension in patients taking ZEPOSIA. Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking ZEPOSIA.
<b>Respiratory Effects:</b> ZEPOSIA may cause a decline in pulmonary function. Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy, if clinically indicated.
<b>Macular edema:</b> S1P modulators have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. Patients with a history of uveitis or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Patients with a history of these conditions should have an ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, prior to treatment initiation and regular follow-up examinations. An ophthalmic evaluation is recommended in all patients at any time if there is a change in vision. Continued use of ZEPOSIA in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated; potential benefits and risks for the individual patient should be considered if deciding whether ZEPOSIA should be discontinued.
<b>Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): </b>Rare cases of PRES have been reported in patients receiving a S1P receptor modulator. If a ZEPOSIA-treated patient develops unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms or any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase in intracranial pressure, a complete physical and neurological examination should be conducted. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued.
<b>Unintended Additive Immunosuppressive Effects From Prior Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Drugs:</b>When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation. Initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA after treatment with alemtuzumab is not recommended.
<b>Severe Increase in Disability After Stopping ZEPOSIA:</b> Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease should be considered after stopping ZEPOSIA treatment so patients should be monitored upon discontinuation.
<b>Immune System Effects After Stopping ZEPOSIA:</b> After discontinuing ZEPOSIA, the median time for lymphocyte counts to return to the normal range was 30 days with approximately 90% of patients in the normal range within 3 months. Use of immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system, therefore caution should be applied when initiating other drugs 4 weeks after the last dose of ZEPOSIA.
<b>Most common Adverse Reactions (= 4%):</b> upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Johnson & Johnson and BARDA Together Commit More than $1 Billion to Novel Coronavirus Vaccine Research and Development; Company Expects to Initiate Phase 1 Human Clinical Studies of Vaccine Candidate at Latest by September 2020
Johnson & Johnson Will Establish New U.S. Vaccine Manufacturing Capabilities and Additional Production Capacity Outside the U.S. to Begin Production at Risk to Help Ensure Global Vaccine Supply
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., March 30, 2020 – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced the selection of a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate from constructs it has been working on since January 2020; the significant expansion of the existing partnership between the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA); and the rapid scaling of the Company’s manufacturing capacity with the goal of providing global supply of more than one billion doses of a vaccine. The Company expects to initiate human clinical studies of its lead vaccine candidate at the latest by September 2020 and anticipates the first batches of a COVID-19 vaccine could be available for emergency use authorization in early 2021, a substantially accelerated timeframe in comparison to the typical vaccine development process.
Through a landmark new partnership, BARDA, which is part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Johnson & Johnson together have committed more than $1 billion of investment to co-fund vaccine research, development, and clinical testing. Johnson & Johnson will use its validated vaccine platform and is allocating resources, including personnel and infrastructure globally, as needed, to focus on these efforts. Separately, BARDA and the Company have provided additional funding that will enable expansion of their ongoing work to identify potential antiviral treatments against the novel coronavirus.
As part of its commitment, Johnson & Johnson is also expanding the Company’s global manufacturing capacity, including through the establishment of new U.S. vaccine manufacturing capabilities and scaling up capacity in other countries. The additional capacity will assist in the rapid production of a vaccine and will enable the supply of more than one billion doses of a safe and effective vaccine globally. The Company plans to begin production at risk imminently and is committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use.
Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said, “The world is facing an urgent public health crisis and we are committed to doing our part to make a COVID-19 vaccine available and affordable globally as quickly as possible. As the world’s largest healthcare company, we feel a deep responsibility to improve the health of people around the world every day. Johnson & Johnson is well positioned through our combination of scientific expertise, operational scale and financial strength to bring our resources in collaboration with others to accelerate the fight against this pandemic.”
Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said, “We greatly value the U.S. government’s confidence and support for our R&D efforts. Johnson & Johnson’s global team of experts has ramped up our research and development processes to unprecedented levels, and our teams are working tirelessly alongside BARDA, scientific partners, and global health authorities. We are very pleased to have identified a lead vaccine candidate from the constructs we have been working on since January. We are moving on an accelerated timeline toward Phase 1 human clinical trials at the latest by September 2020 and, supported by the global production capability that we are scaling up in parallel to this testing, we expect a vaccine could be ready for emergency use in early 2021.”
Johnson & Johnson’s Lead COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate
Johnson & Johnson began efforts in January 2020, as soon as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) sequence became available, to research potential vaccine candidates. Research teams at Janssen, in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, part of Harvard Medical School, constructed and tested multiple vaccine candidates using the Janssen AdVac® technology.
Through collaborations with scientists at multiple academic institutions, the vaccine constructs were then tested to identify those with the most promise in producing an immune response in preclinical testing.
Based on this work, Johnson & Johnson has identified a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate (with two back-ups), which will progress into the first manufacturing steps. Under an accelerated timeline, the Company is aiming to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study in September 2020, with clinical data on safety and efficacy expected to be available by the end of the year. This could allow vaccine availability for emergency use in early 2021. For comparison, the typical vaccine development process involves a number of different research stages, spanning 5 to 7 years, before a candidate is even considered for approval.
For more than 20 years, Johnson & Johnson has invested billions of dollars in antivirals and vaccine capabilities. The COVID-19 vaccine program is leveraging Janssen’s proven AdVac® and PER.C6® technologies that provide the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates and upscale production of the optimal vaccine candidate. The same technology was used to develop and manufacture the Company’s Ebola vaccine and construct our Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccine candidates which are in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical development stages.
Expanded Antiviral Research 
In addition to the vaccine development efforts, BARDA and Johnson & Johnson have also expanded their partnership to accelerate Janssen’s ongoing work in screening compound libraries, including compounds from other pharmaceutical companies. The Company’s aim is to identify potential treatments against the novel coronavirus. Johnson & Johnson and BARDA are both providing funding as part of this partnership. These antiviral screening efforts are being conducted in partnership with the Rega Institute for Medical Research (KU Leuven/University of Leuven), in Belgium.

Abbott has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the <a href=""https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2020-03-27-Abbott-Launches-Molecular-Point-of-Care-Test-to-Detect-Novel-Coronavirus-in-as-Little-as-Five-Minutes"">fastest available molecular point-of-care test</a> for the detection of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), delivering positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
What makes this test so different is where it can be used: outside the four walls of a traditional hospital such as in the physicians' office or urgent care clinics.
The new <a href=""https://www.alere.com/en/home/product-details/id-now-covid-19.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 test</a> runs on Abbott's ID NOW<sup>TM</sup> platform—a lightweight box (6.6 pounds and the size of a small toaster) that can sit in a variety of locations.
Because of its small size, it can be used in more non-traditional places where people can have their results in a matter of minutes, bringing an alternate testing technology to combat the novel coronavirus.
We're ramping up production to deliver 50,000 ID NOW COVID-19 tests per day, beginning next week, to the U.S. healthcare system.
This comes on the heels of our announcement last week of the availability of the Abbott RealTi<i>m</i>e SARS-CoV-2 EUA test under FDA EUA, which runs on <i>m</i>2000 RealTi<i>m</i>e molecular system for centralized lab environments. Combined with ID NOW, Abbott expects to produce about 5 million tests in April.
Testing remains a crucial step in controlling the novel COVID-19 pandemic. Continuing to supply healthcare providers with new technologies to help curb the spread of infection is a top priority for public health officials and healthcare providers.
<b>Taking molecular testing to the front lines</b>
Molecular point-of-care testing for COVID-19 offers healthcare workers rapid results in more settings where people show up for care. Molecular testing technologies help detect the presence of a virus by identifying a small section of the virus' genome, then amplifying that portion until there's enough for detection. This process can cut testing wait time from hours, if not days, to as little as five minutes for positive results and 13 minutes for negative results.
<div class=""fluid-vids""></div>
When not being used for COVID-19 testing, ID NOW is the leading molecular point-of-care platform for Influenza A&amp;B, Strep A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) testing. Our platform holds the largest molecular point-of-care footprint in the U.S. and is already widely available in physicians' offices, urgent care clinics, and hospital emergency departments across the country.
""Through the incredible work of teams across Abbott, we expect to deliver 50,000 COVID-19 tests per day to healthcare professionals on the front lines, where testing capabilities are needed most,"" said Chris Scoggins, senior vice president, Rapid Diagnostics, Abbott. ""Portable molecular testing expands the country's capacity to get people answers faster.""
<i>The ID NOW COVID-19 EUA has not been FDA cleared or approved. It has been authorized by the FDA under an emergency use authorization for use by authorized laboratories and patient care settings. The test has been authorized only for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens, and is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.</i>

<div class=""bd plntxt"">
<b>Berlin, March 30, 2020</b> – Bayer today announced that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) for Nubeqa<sup>®</sup> (darolutamide), an oral androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi). The compound, which is developed jointly by Bayer and Orion Corporation, a globally operating Finnish pharmaceutical company, is indicated for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. Bayer is responsible for global commercialization, with a co-promotion of Bayer and Orion Corporation in certain European markets, e.g. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Scandinavia and Finland.
Nubeqa has a distinct chemical structure which inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells while limiting the burden of side effects on patients’ everyday lives. The EU approval is based on the pivotal Phase III ARAMIS trial data evaluating the efficacy and safety of darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to placebo plus ADT. Results demonstrated a highly significant improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint of metastasis-free survival (MFS) of darolutamide plus ADT, with a median of 40.4 months, versus 18.4 months for placebo plus ADT (p&lt;0.001), and a favorable safety profile. Nubeqa is already approved in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, as well as Japan and filings in other regions are underway or planned.
“As men with nmCRPC typically have no symptoms and are leading active lives, it is important to have treatment options that delay the progression of their cancer while minimizing the burdensome side effects of treatment, allowing them to maintain their lifestyle with little disruption. Darolutamide provides a welcome new option with a favorable safety profile that helps patients to stay on therapy and allows us to meet these treatment goals,” said Karim Fizazi, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine at the Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.
Prostate cancer that is confined to the prostate region which is treated with ADT but keeps progressing without showing metastases, even when the amount of testosterone is reduced to very low levels in the body, is known as nmCRPC. In Europe over 67,000 men are estimated to have a CRPC diagnosis based on 2018 prostate cancer incidence numbers. About one-third of men with nmCRPC go on to develop metastases within two years.
“The approval of Nubeqa in Europe supports our commitment to delivering innovative medicines that are differentiated from current options and that address unmet medical needs, improve treatment outcomes and maintain quality of life for men at all stages of the prostate cancer continuum,” said Robert LaCaze, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer's Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of the Oncology Strategic Business Unit. “We expect to report results from the pre-planned OS analysis at an oncology meeting later this year.”
“We are pleased to collaborate with Bayer in combining our expertise in the development of Nubeqa<sup>®</sup> and look forward to our co-promotion in Europe to support patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and their healthcare professionals”, said Satu Ahomäki, Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations of Orion Corporation.
In the ARAMIS trial, overall survival (OS) and time to pain progression were additional secondary efficacy endpoints. At the time of final MFS analysis, a positive trend in OS was observed. OS data were not yet mature. Results from the pre-planned final OS analysis are expected to be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting in 2020. The MFS result was additionally supported by a delay in time to pain progression as compared to placebo plus ADT. All other secondary endpoints, time to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and time to a symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), also demonstrated a benefit in favor of darolutamide at the time of final MFS analysis.
Darolutamide plus ADT has demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The most frequent adverse reactions in the darolutamide plus ADT arm, that occurred with an absolute increase in frequency of =2% compared to placebo plus ADT, were fatigue/asthenic conditions (16% vs. 11%), pain in extremity (6% vs. 3%), and rash (3% vs. 1%). Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 9% of patients in both arms of the study.
<b>About the ARAMIS trial</b>
The ARAMIS trial is a randomized, Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral darolutamide in patients with nmCRPC who are currently being treated with ADT and are at high risk for developing metastatic disease. In the clinical study, 1,509 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 600 mg of darolutamide orally twice daily or placebo along with ADT. Patients with a history of seizure were allowed in the study.
<b>About Nubeqa</b><b><sup>®</sup></b><b> (darolutamide)</b>
Darolutamide was approved in March 2020 in the European Union under the brand name Nubeqa<sup>®</sup> for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. Nubeqa has also received regulatory approval in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada as well as Japan, and filings in other regions are underway or planned.
Nubeqa is an oral androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi) with a distinct chemical structure that binds to the receptor with high affinity and exhibits strong antagonistic activity, thereby inhibiting the receptor function and the growth of prostate cancer cells. The compound is also being investigated in a Phase III study in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (ARASENS). Information about these trials can be found at <a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>.
<b>About castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) </b>
Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men worldwide. In 2018, an estimated 1.2 million men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and about 358,000 died from the disease worldwide. Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men. Prostate cancer results from the abnormal proliferation of cells within the prostate gland, which is part of a man’s reproductive system. It mainly affects men over the age of 50, and the risk increases with age.
Treatment options range from surgery to radiation treatment to therapy using hormone-receptor antagonists, i.e., substances that stop the formation of testosterone or prevent its effect at the target location. However, in nearly all cases, the cancer eventually becomes resistant to conventional hormone therapy.
CRPC is an advanced form of the disease where the cancer keeps progressing despite ADT treatment, even when the amount of testosterone is reduced to very low levels in the body. In men with progressive nmCRPC, a rapid prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time has been consistently associated with reduced time to first metastasis and death.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced the following actions taken in its ongoing response effort to the COVID-19 pandemic:
<ul>
 	<li>On March 28, 2020, the FDA <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covidtherapeutics"">issued an Emergency Use Authorization</a> (EUA) to allow hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the <a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/03/29/hhs-accepts-donations-of-medicine-to-strategic-national-stockpile-as-possible-treatments-for-covid-19-patients.html"">Strategic National Stockpile</a>(SNS) to be distributed and used for certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19. These drugs will be distributed from the SNS to states for doctors to prescribe to adolescent and adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in treating COVID-19 be made available to health care providers and patients, including the known risks and drug interactions. The SNS, managed by ASPR, will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ship donated doses to states.</li>
 	<li>On March 29, 2020, the FDA <a title=""Enforcement Policy for Sterilizers, Disinfectant Devices, and Air Purifiers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-policy-sterilizers-disinfectant-devices-and-air-purifiers-during-coronavirus-disease"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""1ca2ab00-9d83-4f00-b89a-a5a3836a509b"">issued an immediately in effect guidance</a> that outlines an enforcement policy to help expand the availability and capability of sterilizers, disinfectant devices and air purifiers. The devices include those intended to make devices sterile, kill pathogens or other microorganisms and kill pathogens or microorganisms in the air. This policy reflects FDA’s commitment to ease burdens on health care providers and facilities as they face COVID-19.</li>
 	<li>The FDA <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ppe"">amended the Emergency Use Authorization</a> (EUA) for the Battelle Decontamination System for use in decontaminating compatible N95 respirators for reuse by health care personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This EUA is an important step forward in helping to reduce shortages in critical N95 respirators, by allowing for these important devices, when decontaminated, to be reused by medical professionals on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
 	<li>On March 30, 2020, the FDA issued an <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/136540/download"">immediately in effect guidance</a> to help expand the availability of surgical apparel for health care professionals, including gowns (togas), hoods, and surgeon’s and patient examination gloves during this public health emergency.</li>
 	<li>FDA and FTC issued warning letters to two companies for selling unapproved products claiming to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. One of the companies, <a title=""Corona-cure.com - 605875 - 03/26/2020"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/corona-curecom-605875-03262020"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""f4a48256-e2ae-4756-bcd5-361d924205ab"">Corona-cure.com</a>, was warned for selling the product Coronavirus Infection Prevention Nasal Spray with misleading claims on its website that its product is safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. The agencies also warned <a title=""Carahealth - 605826 - 03/26/2020"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/carahealth-605826-03262020"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""dd6663f7-d9dd-4be8-a08f-d274274248c6"">Carahealth</a> for selling its herbal products, including “Carahealth Immune,” with misleading claims of prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. We are particularly concerned that unapproved drugs that claim to cure, treat, or prevent serious conditions may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious or life-threatening harm. There is currently no approved treatment or preventative measure for COVID-19. FDA and FTC are closely monitoring social media, the online marketplace, and incoming reports for fraudulent COVID-19 products on the market.</li>
 	<li>The FDA issued an updated guidance, “<a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/136238/download"">Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Pandemic</a>,” with an appendix adding questions and answers on this subject. We plan to update this appendix as new questions arise.

<h3><b><i>Label update is based on data from Phase IIIb DIALIZE trial
</i></b></h3>

<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion on a dosing and administration label update for AstraZeneca’s <i>Lokelma</i> (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to include patients with hyperkalaemia on stable haemodialysis.
The recommendation was based on data from the Phase IIIb DIALIZE trial, which showed a significant reduction in potassium levels pre-dialysis for patients receiving <i>Lokelma</i>, compared with placebo.<sup>1</sup>
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “Despite being on dialysis, many patients with renal disease still have high potassium levels, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. This recommendation underscores the clinical value that <i>Lokelma</i> could provide to physicians and patients who are looking to normalise potassium levels between dialysis sessions.”
In DIALIZE, 41% of patients receiving <i>Lokelma</i> maintained pre-dialysis potassium levels on at least three out of four dialysis treatments after the long interdialytic interval and did not require urgent rescue therapy. This compared with 1.0% of patients receiving placebo, making it a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement. The safety profile of <i>Lokelma</i>observed in DIALIZE was consistent with previous trials.<sup>1</sup>
<i>Lokelma</i> is a highly selective, oral potassium-removing agent currently approved in the US, EU, Canada, Hong Kong, China, Russia and Japan for the treatment of hyperkalaemia.
<b>Hyperkalaemia</b>
Hyperkalaemia is characterised by high levels of potassium in the blood, generally classified as greater than 5mmol/l.<sup>2</sup> Many people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have hyperkalaemia despite being on haemodialysis and often experience fluctuations in their potassium levels.<sup>3,4</sup> Patients with high variability in potassium levels between dialysis sessions are at significant risk of arrhythmias which can lead to cardiac arrest.<sup>3</sup> Hyperkalaemia occurs in 23% to 47% of patients with CKD and/or heart failure with an estimated 700 million and 64 million people, respectively, living with each condition worldwide.<sup>5,6</sup>
<b>DIALIZE</b>
DIALIZE is the first ever randomised, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate a potassium binder in patients on stable haemodialysis. The Phase IIIb, multicentre, double-blinded trial investigated the efficacy of <i>Lokelma</i> versus placebo in 196 patients on haemodialysis with hyperkalaemia. Patients were randomised to receive <i>Lokelma</i> or placebo once daily on non-dialysis days for a treatment period of eight weeks. This included a four-week dose adjustment phase (starting at 5g and titrated weekly in 5g increments up to a maximum of 15g) and a four-week evaluation phase on stable dose.
The full results of the DIALIZE trial were published in September 2019 in the <a href=""https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/early/2019/06/13/ASN.2019050450"" rel=""link-confirmation""><i>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology</i>.</a>
<b><i>Lokelma</i></b>
<i>Lokelma</i> is an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension, that acts as a highly selective potassium-removing medicine. It is administered orally, is odourless, tasteless and stable at room temperature. It has been studied in three double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials and in one 12-month open label clinical trial in patients with hyperkalaemia.

<em>March 31, 2020</em>
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we are committed to doing everything we can to keep our staff and their families safe and to help the communities where we live and work reduce the number of people exposed to the virus. We are also committed to delivering an uninterrupted supply of our medicines for the patients who need them. If you are a patient, medical professional, employee, or member of the community, please see our <a href=""https://wwwext.amgen.com/covid-19/"">COVID-19 Information Center page</a>.
<h3><strong>IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Early in March we activated our business continuity plans to avoid or minimize business disruption and ensure the well-being of our staff.</li>
 	<li>At this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic we cannot rule out future impact on our business. For example, since the pandemic was declared, we have observed fewer patient/doctor interactions and our representatives are having fewer visits with health care providers which may affect our sales in the future.</li>
 	<li>We will provide further updates on our business performance when we report our Q1 earnings.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>SUPPLY OF OUR MEDICINES</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Amgen continues to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world and we do not currently anticipate a shortage of our medicines due to COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>CLINICAL TRIALS AND R&amp;D EFFORTS</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>We have clinical work ongoing at investigational sites across the globe.</li>
 	<li>An increasing number of clinical trial sites are restricting site visits and imposing restrictions on the initiation of new trials and patient visits to protect both site staff and patients from possible COVID-19 exposure.</li>
 	<li>Given the safety concerns around COVID-19 and the associated risk to maintaining normal clinical trial operations, we are making decisions study-by-study and country-by-country to minimize risk to the patients and facilities.</li>
 	<li>Accordingly, we have temporarily paused enrollment/screening in clinical trials where there is uncertainty around the ability of sites to ensure subject safety or data integrity at the present time.</li>
 	<li>We are allowing enrollment to continue in studies where there is the potential for significant benefit in a serious or life-threatening condition and where site resources allow new patients to be safely enrolled and closely monitored.</li>
 	<li>We are continuing study start-up activities where possible to allow rapid site activation and enrollment at the appropriate time.</li>
 	<li>Patients already enrolled in studies continue to receive study drug, and we remain focused on supporting our sites in providing care for these patients and providing continued investigational drug supply.</li>
 	<li>We are actively implementing remote and local procedures per recent FDA guidance and working with investigators for appropriate care of these patients in a safe manner consistent with agency guidelines.</li>
 	<li>The potentially pivotal AMG 510 Phase 2 non-small cell lung cancer study, the tezepelumab Phase 3 asthma study in collaboration with AstraZeneca, and the omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 heart failure study in collaboration with Cytokinetics are all fully enrolled, and thus we do not anticipate significant delays in obtaining results.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>One component of the Amgen Foundation’s mission is to invest in strengthening communities where Amgen staff members live and work. To that end:
<ul>
 	<li>Amgen and the Amgen Foundation have committed up to $12.5 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts directly in the communities where our team members live and work. The funds will be used to support emergency response efforts in Amgen’s U.S. and international communities, patient-focused organizations that are mounting their own response efforts, and international relief efforts by Direct Relief and International Medical Corps. <a href=""https://wwwext.amgen.com/media/news-releases/2020/03/amgen-and-the-amgen-foundation-commit-up-to-$12-5-million-to-support-covid-19-relief-efforts/"">Read more here</a>.</li>
 	<li>The Amgen Foundation will also match donations made by Amgen staff around the globe who wish to contribute their own funds to the relief efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>In addition, the Amgen Foundation seeks to advance excellence in science education and inspire the next generation of innovators.
<ul>
 	<li>In January, the Amgen Foundation and Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences launched LabXchange, a free online science education platform that provides users access to personalized instruction, virtual lab experiences and networking opportunities across the global scientific community. As the founding sponsor, the Amgen Foundation awarded $11.5 million in grant funding to Harvard to deepen the impact of this new online learning platform across the globe.</li>
 	<li>The Amgen Foundation is the founding biology partner of the Khan Academy, a leading innovative and effective educational technology platform with over 70 million registered users across the globe.</li>
 	<li>Free online learning programs supported through both of these deep relationships are available to help students continue their science education during school closures, and can be accessed via the <a href=""https://www.labxchange.org/"">LabXchange</a> and <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/"">Khan Academy’s online learning websites</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Amgen is also partnering with our communities to identify opportunities for our staff to volunteer to help with science education for students locally.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR OUR EMPLOYEES</strong></h3>
<strong>Financial Support</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>We have committed to pay continuity for employees and will assess the duration of that commitment as the situation evolves.</li>
 	<li>We are providing staff working from home in the U.S. and Puerto Rico a monthly stipend for home broadband Internet access along with an allowance to purchase any necessary home office equipment of their choice.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Working from Home Assistance</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>We have set up an internal website dedicated to COVID-19 for employees to review updates, video messages from leadership, podcasts, access to training, and frequently asked questions.</li>
 	<li>We have launched an additional teleconferencing platform globally with dedicated technical support.</li>
 	<li>Ongoing online training and development is being used by thousands of employees.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Employee Wellness Resources</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>We have launched a virtual health and wellness program for all Amgen team members with an emphasis on work-at-home strategies.</li>
 	<li>We have implemented a virtual workout, nutrition, and yoga app offering all of our Amgen team members around the world hundreds of regionally appropriate online programs free of charge.</li>
 	<li>We are offering mental health resources, including virtual coaching, therapy sessions, meditation and mindfulness programs.</li>
 	<li>We are providing manager resources, such as resilience training, to help our leaders assist their teams through this period of dynamic change.</li>
 	<li>Our largest medical plan is offering telemedicine visits for all illnesses with no deductibles or co-insurance for 90 days to encourage the safety of our team members, their families and healthcare providers.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Guidance to Staff on Work Locations, Meetings, and Travel</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Since Monday, March 16, all employees who were able to work from home have been doing so until further notice. This includes staff at our corporate headquarters in Thousand Oaks, CA. Our teams in Asia have been proactively modeling this behavior for many weeks and in some cases are now returning to work based on local conditions and guidance from local health officials.</li>
 	<li>In addition, we have made the decision to suspend all in-person meetings and interactions with the healthcare community and professionals in the U.S. As of March 16, all U.S. field staff have been working from home and have moved to a virtual interaction model.</li>
 	<li>Amgen has suspended international business travel and limited domestic travel in the U.S.</li>
 	<li>We have suspended attendance at medical congresses, conferences and other large events.</li>
 	<li>Enhanced cleaning procedures and visitor screenings were implemented at all Amgen locations.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong>
This communication contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this communication and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

<p align=""center""><em>Virtual office visits and smart health devices available through the VIVUS Health Platform give physicians new tools for optimizing patient care and protecting the health of those at increased risk for COVID-19</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">CAMPBELL, Calif., March 31, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VIVUS, Inc. (Nasdaq: VVUS; the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company, today announced the accelerated launch of the telemedicine and remote monitoring modules of the VIVUS Health Platform. Participating physicians will be able to use the VIVUS Health Platform to conduct virtual office visits, regardless of whether or not the patient is prescribed a VIVUS product.  The Company expects to enroll 150-200 physicians into the new modules each week.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Effective communication around health conditions, such as obesity, can be difficult under the best of circumstances, and are even more challenging in the current environment in which patients, physicians, and care facilities are adhering to social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  These guidelines also make it difficult for cystic fibrosis patients, who are at increased risk of COVID-19 due to their compromised lung function, to consult with their healthcare providers,” said John Amos, Chief Executive Officer at VIVUS.  “We have rapidly accelerated the launch of our telemedicine and remote monitoring modules to facilitate communication during this unprecedented pandemic and ensure that patients can receive optimum care without leaving their homes.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">The VIVUS Health Platform is designed to integrate pharmaceutical solutions, technology and clinical stakeholders to improve patient outcomes through increased information capture, resulting in enhanced patient access, increased adoption, and treatment durability.  It includes the VIVUS Advantage Programs, which offer Patient Assistance Programs to facilitate access to medication for uninsured or underinsured patients with obesity or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and also allows patients prescribed VIVUS medications to have their prescriptions filled online and sent directly to their homes.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The telemedicine and remote monitoring modules are designed to leverage normal clinical practices without disrupting routine clinical operations.  While the patient-physician interaction takes place virtually through the VIVUS Health Platform, powered by Vital Tech, all other activities, such as scheduling, patient administration, billing, etc., take place utilizing existing clinic processes and resources.  The telemedicine module is configured for easy and rapid activation, allowing physician offices and clinics to implement the platform with minimal effort.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Remote patient monitoring is integrated into the VIVUS Health Platform through the Apple Health Kit, Apple Watch, and a wide variety of blue tooth-enabled health devices that will include weight scales, pulse oximeters, spirometers to measure lung function, and blood pressure cuffs.  Data from these devices and the Apple Health Kit are transmitted and collated directly into the VIVUS Health Platform, which can be accessed by the patient’s physician.  Physicians can utilize these data to monitor a patient’s vital functions, and can implement or adapt treatment to achieve or maintain target goals for important health metrics.</p>
<p align=""justify"">There are no upfront or monthly fees, and physicians pay a fee only for each telemedicine visit and/or for remote patient monitoring.  The VIVUS Health Platform is also not limited by a patient’s health insurance plan.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Obesity is an epidemic in its own right, and in this time of social distancing, patients may find it more difficult to adhere to a healthy diet and activity goals.  Patients with cystic fibrosis are challenged day-to-day with the need to avoid respiratory infections, a challenge that is even more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic underscores the critical importance of helping patients manage health conditions that increase their susceptibility to other diseases,” added Santosh T. Varghese, MD, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer at VIVUS.  “VIVUS is committed to addressing these challenges by increasing access to care through telemedicine, online fulfillment of prescriptions, and data collection from smart health devices that allow patients and healthcare providers to monitor health progress in real-time.  Additionally, we are expanding this platform into the clinical trial space as we address the challenges of conducting studies in this new environment.”</p>

<b>Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
</b>This communication contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

NOVATO, Calif., March 31, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.(NASDAQ: RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel products for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced a strategic partnership and non-exclusive license and technology access agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited for Ultragenyx’s proprietary AAV-based gene therapy manufacturing technologies. Ultragenyx’s HeLa producer cell line (PCL) platform enables large commercial-scale AAV-based gene therapy product manufacturing that is intended to be highly reproducible, more consistent, and less expensive than other gene therapy manufacturing platforms. In addition, Ultragenyx has developed a proprietary HEK293 transient transfection system for AAV manufacture which is also a subject of the collaboration.
Under the license and technology access agreement, Ultragenyx granted Daiichi Sankyo a non-exclusive license to intellectual property, including know-how and patent applications, with respect to its HeLa PCL and HEK293 transient transfection manufacturing technology platforms for AAV-based gene therapy products. The parties will collaborate closely as part of a technology transfer plan to enable Daiichi Sankyo to use the technologies for its internal gene therapy programs. Ultragenyx retains the exclusive right to use its manufacturing technology for its current target indications and additional indications identified now and in the future.
“This new partnership with Daiichi Sankyo provides further validation of the value of Ultragenyx’s gene therapy-related technologies, especially our HeLa producer cell line platform that we believe is the most scalable mammalian cell AAV manufacturing system,” said Emil D. Kakkis, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. “We are encouraged that our proprietary technologies continue to enable the development of numerous programs, both internally and for our partners, to treat patients with serious unmet medical needs.”
“We are currently doing discovery research for gene therapy drugs using AAV vectors as one of our focused modalities toward sustained growth beyond achievement of our 2025 vision,” said Masayuki Yabuta, PhD, Executive Officer, Head of Biologics Division, Daiichi Sankyo. “In order to provide these drugs to patients in the future, manufacturing technology must be established early. Ultragenyx's proprietary technology is particularly excellent in terms of stable quality, high production efficiency, and ability to accommodate mass production.”
Daiichi Sankyo will be responsible for the manufacture, development, and commercialization of products manufactured with the Ultragenyx technology, except that Ultragenyx receives an option to co-develop and co-commercialize rare disease products at the IND stage. Ultragenyx will also provide strategic consultation to Daiichi Sankyo on the development of both AAV-based gene therapy products and other products for rare diseases.
Under the terms of the agreements, Daiichi Sankyo will make an upfront payment of $125 million and will purchase $75 million of Ultragenyx common stock at a price of approximately $60 per share. Daiichi Sankyo will pay an additional $25 million upon completion of the technology transfer of the HeLa PCL and HEK293 platforms as well as single-digit royalties on net sales of products manufactured in either system. Daiichi Sankyo will reimburse Ultragenyx for all costs associated with the transfer of the manufacturing technology.

The test does not require special equipment and may be used in a laboratory or at the point of care. The test detects antibodies in the blood that are produced by the body in response to coronavirus infection. These antibodies are typically present in the middle to later stages of COVID-19 infection, but may remain present after exposure, which helps clinicians determine who has been exposed to the coronavirus, even if a person didn't exhibit any symptoms of the COVID-19 disease. Data on past exposure is important for researchers to more accurately understand the likely true occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection across a population. This information will be helpful in informing future strategies for combatting COVID-19.
""Serology tests are important because they provide an additional piece of information to aid in characterizing possible prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, especially since many infections are mild or asymptomatic in severity,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Dave Hickey</span>, president of Integrated Diagnostic Solutions for BD. ""Initial evidence suggests that nearly all patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 will have developed a detectable antibody response within days of symptom onset, at which time a negative serologic test, along with molecular diagnostics, could be helpful in ruling out COVID-19. Our agreement with BioMedomics adds a rapid serology test that can augment current tests already on the market, and we are pleased to collaborate in this effort with <span class=""xn-person"">Henry Schein</span>, which has extensive knowledge of the point-of-care test field.""
The test is completed in four, simple steps. First, blood is collected through normal blood collection devices such as the BD Microtainer<sup>®</sup> Contact-Activated Lancet. A few drops of blood are then transferred to the test cartridge, followed by two to three drops of a buffer. The results can be read in 15 minutes, similar to how over-the-counter pregnancy tests show multiple lines for positive results and a single line for negative results.
""BioMedomics designed the test to be easy to use and provide results in minutes, with no special equipment necessary or the need to transport the sample to a laboratory for analysis,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Frank Wang</span>, CEO of BioMedomics. ""Our test has been clinically validated at several hospitals and clinical laboratories in both the U.S. and <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, and our published clinical data in the <i>Journal of Medical Virology</i> was one of the world's first for a COVID-19 serology test. It has been used widely in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> during the COVID-19 outbreak and is now ready to help combat coronavirus in the U.S. through our collaboration with BD. We are committed to doing our part to battle this disease and are excited to have BD as a partner to help deliver our high-quality rapid test to those who need it most.""
The test analyzes blood, serum or plasma samples for the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies associated with the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). IgM provides the first line of defense during viral infections, followed by the generation of adaptive, high-affinity IgG responses for long-term immunity and immunological memory. The detection of COVID-19 IgM antibodies tends to indicate a recent exposure to COVID-19, and detection of COVID-19 IgG antibodies indicates a later stage of infection, so this combined antibody test could also provide information on the stage of the disease in patients. Current guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude coronavirus infection. Depending on the clinical scenario, additional testing, such as those used on the BD MAX™ System may be considered to further evaluate the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
""We look forward to working with such an outstanding company as BD to help make the antibody test part of the standard of care,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Stanley M. Bergman</span>, <span class=""xn-person"">Henry Schein's</span> chairman of the board and chief executive officer. ""The test will help to identify people who have developed antibodies to the virus, which may inform future strategies regarding COVID-19.""
The test has not been reviewed by the FDA but is permitted for distribution and use under the public health emergency guidance issued by FDA on <span class=""xn-chron"">March 16, 2020</span>, and BD expects to begin shipping tests in April. BD will have capacity to supply more than one million tests over the coming months, with the ability to scale up based on market demand and is working with medical products distribution company <span class=""xn-person"">Henry Schein</span> to make these tests available to medical care facilities throughout <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. Health care providers can order the test and all collection devices needed to perform the test by contacting their BD or <span class=""xn-person"">Henry Schein</span> representatives.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","April 01, 2020
Three leading biopharmaceutical companies have announced programs enabling employees with medical and laboratory expertise to volunteer their services to local healthcare systems and those hardest hit by COVID-19.

KENILWORTH, N.J. & NEW YORK & INDIANAPOLIS–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck & Co., Inc., (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced medical service volunteer programs to enable employees who are licensed medical professionals to aid in the fight against COVID-19 while maintaining their base pay.
This new effort is one of the many ways that America’s biopharmaceutical companies are coming together to fight COVID-19. Together, these three major biopharmaceutical companies employ thousands of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical laboratory technicians and other medical professionals whose services are in high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these companies are expanding their existing corporate volunteer programs so that qualified employees who opt to serve can do so for a longer period of time than normally allowed.

Merck will support its employees around the world who are uniquely qualified to provide medical services and wish to aid communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the U.S., Merck intends to collaborate with The Health Management Academy to identify facilities with the greatest need and triage potential qualifying volunteers to serve.
Pfizer has created a new Global COVID-19 Medical Service Program that empowers medical colleagues to provide diagnostic, treatment, and public health support in the battle against COVID-19. Licensed medical professionals who feel duty-bound to provide their services during this crisis will now have a way to engage in the fight against COVID-19. Colleagues will continue to receive their full pay, benefits, and be able to return to their position upon completion of service.
Lilly is deploying its medical professionals to staff a free drive-through COVID-19 testing facility at its corporate headquarters in Indianapolis. The testing facility serves active frontline health care workers and first responders, as a service to the community and in an effort to protect people working on the front lines of this pandemic. Lilly scientists are using the company’s specialized research laboratories to analyze the tests, as well as samples taken in Indiana health care facilities, including nursing homes and emergency rooms, in partnership with the Indiana State Department of Health. Lilly is also allowing trained medical professionals to volunteer in service of patients.
“COVID-19 is one of the greatest challenges the global community will ever face, and our heroic health care professionals are, unquestionably, on the front-lines of that fight,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “We are enormously grateful to them all, and it is our honor to be able to support our own employee volunteers who are joining them in caring for patients and communities affected by this pandemic.”
“At Pfizer, we employ some of the most dedicated and passionate medical professionals who have devoted their lives to combating disease and helping patients,” said Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer. “During this unprecedented global health challenge, we are pursuing every option within Pfizer and with external partners to help fight COVID-19. We believe that by unleashing our medical professionals to help relieve some of the burden being felt by hospitals, we can help make a real and important difference. We support their wish to serve in this way and are grateful for their courage and selflessness.”
“Right now the purpose of our industry has never been more clear and vital – to bring the full force of our scientific and medical expertise to attack this pandemic around the world,” said David A. Ricks, chairman and chief executive officer, Lilly. “We’re honored to join our industry partners in deploying our expert workforce to help fight the virus, and our medical professionals stand ready to volunteer. We’re working together – and with partners around the world – to help our communities weather this storm and come back even stronger.”

The FDA unveiled a new initiative, dubbed the “Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Programme (CTAP),” designed to expedite the development of effective treatments for patients with COVID-19. Alex Azar, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said that “as part of this new program, the FDA is cutting red tape, redeploying staff and working day and night to review requests from companies, scientists and doctors who are working toward therapies.”
According to the FDA, CTAP is using “every tool” at the agency’s disposal to bring new therapies to patients as quickly as possible. These include triaging requests from developers and scientists working on new drug and biologic therapies, getting the relevant FDA staff in touch with them and providing rapid, interactive input to get studies under way quickly.
The agency noted, for example, that it “has reviewed study protocols within 24 hours in many cases and has reviewed single-patient expanded access requests generally within three hours.” It said it has also rearranged medical and regulatory staff to serve on review teams dedicated specifically to COVID-19 therapies and provided resources to help researchers submit emergency requests to use investigational products. In addition, the agency highlighted the potential of real-world data sources to complement traditional clinical studies, and as such, it is “advancing relationships with partners in the public and private sectors to rapidly collect and analyse information in areas such as illness patterns and treatment outcomes.”
Potential treatments currently being investigated for COVID-19 include antivirals such as Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir, while scientists are also evaluating other drugs, such as IL-6 receptor inhibitors, which include Roche’s Actemra (tocilizumab) and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ Kevzara (sarilumab), that may help reduce lung inflammation and improve lung function in infected patients.
The agency also pointed to interest in examining the potential of antibody-rich blood products such as convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin taken from blood donated by recovered patients. Meanwhile, it said work is ongoing to evaluate whether existing therapies such as the anitmalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, with or without other medications, can help treat patients with COVID-19. The FDA recently issued an emergency-use authorization to allow donated hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to be used amid the pandemic.
