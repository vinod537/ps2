IMU-838 is an orally available DHOD inhibitor, acts on activated T and B cells and leave other immune cells largely unaffected, allowing the immune system to stay functioning","NEW YORK, Aug. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Immunic, Inc. (Nasdaq: IMUX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing best-in-class, oral therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, today announced positive top-line data from its phase 2 EMPhASIS trial of lead asset, IMU-838, the company’s selective oral DHODH inhibitor, in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The study achieved all primary and key secondary endpoints, indicating activity in RRMS patients. In particular, the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the cumulative number of combined unique active (CUA) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions up to week 24 in patients receiving 45mg of IMU-838 once daily, by 62% (p=0.0002), as compared to placebo. The study also met its key secondary endpoint, showing a statistically significant reduction in the cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions for the 30mg once daily dose, by 70% (p<0.0001), as compared to placebo.

All other secondary endpoints, including those based on other MRI parameters and on clinical endpoints such as relapse events, also provided a noticeable signal and numerical benefit for the IMU-838 treatment groups, as compared to placebo. Given the study’s design, sample size and the patient’s follow-up duration, full statistical analysis of these secondary endpoints was not deemed appropriate or included in the analysis plan. Nonetheless, we believe data on these endpoints provides useful information for the further development path towards potential approval.

Consistent with prior data sets in other patient populations, administration of IMU-838 in this trial was observed to be safe and well-tolerated, thereby providing evidence of an attractive target product profile for IMU-838 in the RRMS patient population. The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events was 42.9% of IMU-838-treated patients compared with 43.5% of patients on placebo. Likewise, serious treatment-emergent adverse events were rare and only observed in 3 out of 140 IMU-838-treated patients, and in 1 out of 69 patients on placebo. The rate of treatment withdrawals in the 24-week blinded treatment period was only 5.0% in the pooled IMU-838 treatment arms versus 7.2% in the placebo group. In addition, the rate of discontinuations due to adverse events or protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were equivalent between the pooled IMU-838 treatment arms and placebo. There was no increase in liver or renal events for the IMU-838 treatment arms versus placebo. Analysis of the full EMPhASIS data is ongoing and will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.

“Patients in the EMPhASIS trial exhibited robust responses across all study endpoints included in the top-line analysis. In addition to showing consistent activity by IMU-838 in RRMS using different measures, the study data also supports the previously observed favorable safety and tolerability profile of IMU-838 in RRMS patients,” commented Andreas Muehler, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Immunic. “We believe this data strongly supports our goal of developing IMU-838 as an easy, safe and convenient oral treatment option for patients with RRMS and other autoimmune diseases. We are extremely encouraged by these results and intend to now focus on the development plan with the goal of eventually making IMU-838 available as a best-in-class, once-daily oral therapy for RRMS.”

The phase 2 EMPhASIS trial was an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of IMU-838 in patients with RRMS. Of the 210 patients randomized in 36 centers across four European countries, 209 patients received at least one dose of IMU-838 or placebo (placebo n=69, 30mg IMU-838 n=71, 45mg IMU-838 n=69), and 197 patients completed the blinded 24-week treatment period. All enrolled patients were required to have shown disease activity based on clinical evidence of relapse and additional MRI criteria. The primary and key secondary endpoints were the cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions, up to week 24, for 45mg and 30mg of IMU-838, respectively. MRI was performed at baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 18 and 24, and was evaluated centrally by an independent, blinded MRI reader. The study includes an optional, extended treatment period for up to 9.5 years to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of IMU-838.

“These positive phase 2 results impressively show the robust activity of IMU-838 in RRMS and provide further evidence of the favorable safety profile already observed in other patient populations, representing more than 650 human subjects and patients, to date,” stated Daniel Vitt, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Immunic. “We believe that these phase 2 data of IMU-838 speak volumes about its potential to provide a new, convenient, once daily oral front-line treatment option to patients suffering from RRMS, bolstered by a unique combination of potential efficacy, safety and tolerability. Given the strength of these top-line results, we will continue to prepare a clinical phase 3 program for IMU-838 in RRMS and, after a full review of the data, anticipate providing a further update on development strategy. We are also looking forward to reading out clinical data from the other ongoing phase 2 trials of IMU-838 in COVID-19, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis in the upcoming months.”

Financial and Operating Results

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses were $10.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $6.0 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $4.0 million increase was primarily attributable to (i) a $2.2 million increase in external development costs for lead development program, IMU-838, related to the phase 2 clinical trials in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, (ii) a $1.0 million increase in drug supply costs related to IMU-838, (iii) a $1.0 million increase in preclinical, drug supply and phase 1 preparation costs related to IMU-856, (iv) a $1.0 million increase in costs due to drug supply and the start of the phase 1 trial in September 2019 for the IMU-935 program and (v) $0.3 million of increased employee costs. The increase was partially offset by a contingent payment under the asset purchase agreement with 4SC AG settled in stock valued at $1.5 million at the transaction with Vital Therapies in the second quarter of 2019.

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, R&D expenses were $16.4 million compared to $9.4 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $7.0 million increase was primarily attributable to (i) a $3.2 million increase in external development costs for lead development program, IMU-838, related to the phase 2 clinical trials in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, (ii) a $1.2 million increase in drug supply costs related to IMU-838, (iii) $2.2 million of an increase in license fees, preclinical, drug supply and phase 1 preparation costs related to IMU-856, (iv) $1.2 million in costs for drug supply and the start of the phase 1 trial in September 2019 for the IMU-935 program and (v) $0.7 million of increased employee and other costs. The increase was offset by a contingent payment under the asset purchase agreement with 4SC AG settled in stock valued at $1.5 million at the transaction with Vital Therapies in the second quarter of 2019.

General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $9.0 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $6.7 million improvement is primarily due to one-time costs related to the transaction with Vital Therapies including $6.4 million of stock-based compensation for the executives, key employees and members of the board of directors and $1.2 million in investment banking and legal fees in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was offset by a $0.9 million increase in personnel and other expenses.

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, G&A expenses were $4.8 million compared to $10.3 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $5.5 million improvement was primarily due to one-time costs related to the transaction with Vital Therapies including $6.4 million of stock-based compensation for the executives, key employees and members of the board of directors and $2.1 million in investment banking and legal fees in the first six months of 2019. The decrease was partially offset by (i) a $1.6 million increase in personnel expenses, (ii) $0.8 million of increased legal and consultancy costs and (iii) $0.6 million of increased costs across numerous categories primarily due to becoming a public company and expanding operations into the United States.

Other Income was $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $0.3 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $0.5 million increase was primarily attributable to (i) $0.2 million of research and development tax incentives for clinical trials in Australia as a result of increased spending on clinical trials in Australia and (ii) $0.3 million recognized deferred income attributable to reimbursements of research and development expenses in connection with the option and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo.

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, other income was $1.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The $0.6 million increase was primarily attributable to (i) $0.3 million of research and development tax incentives for clinical trials in Australia as a result of increased spending on clinical trials in Australia and (ii) $0.3 million recognized deferred income attributable to reimbursements of research and development expenses in connection with the option and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo.

About Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. In MS, myelin, the coating that protects the nerves, is attacked and damaged by the immune system. Thus, MS is considered an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of the disease. Approximately 85% of patients with MS are expected to develop RRMS, with some of these patients later developing more progressive forms of the disease. RRMS is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These relapses are followed by periods of remission, or partial or complete recovery. During remissions, all symptoms may disappear, or some symptoms may continue and become permanent. MS is a progressive disease which, without effective treatment, leads to severe disability. MS affects more than 700,000 people in the United States, and more than 2.2 million people worldwide. The disease mainly affects young adults of prime working age, although MS can occur at any age. MS is at least two to three times more common in women than in men.

About IMU-838
IMU-838 is an orally available, next-generation selective immune modulator that inhibits the intracellular metabolism of activated immune cells by blocking the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). IMU-838 acts on activated T and B cells while leaving other immune cells largely unaffected and allows the immune system to stay functioning, e.g. in fighting infections. In previous trials, IMU-838 did not show an increased rate of infections compared to placebo. In addition, DHODH inhibitors, such as IMU-838, are known to possess a host-based antiviral effect, which is independent with respect to specific virus proteins and their structure. Therefore, DHODH inhibition may be broadly applicable against multiple viruses. IMU-838 was successfully tested in two phase 1 clinical trials in 2017 and is currently being tested in phase 2 trials in patients with COVID-19, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, Immunic’s collaboration partner, the Mayo Clinic, has started an investigator-sponsored proof-of-concept clinical trial testing IMU-838 activity in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. To date, IMU-838 has already been tested in about 650 individuals and has shown an attractive pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability profile. IMU-838 is not yet licensed or approved in any country and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use.

Combines two immunotherapies with complementary mechanisms of action with the aim to accelerate the path to market approval in melanoma if the trial is successful
Development costs for the clinical trial to be shared equally with each company retaining full commercial rights to their respective product candidates
MAINZ, Germany, July 31, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) today announced a strategic collaboration with Regeneron for a clinical trial combining BioNTech’s BNT111 FixVac product candidate and Libtayo® (cemiplimab), a fully human anti-PD-1 therapy, for the treatment of melanoma. The companies plan to jointly conduct a randomized Phase 2 study in patients with anti-PD1-refractory/relapsed, unresectable Stage III or IV cutaneous melanoma. Melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer and estimated to kill more than 63,000 people around the world this year.1

BNT111 is the most advanced of five clinical stage FixVac product candidates within BioNTech’s broader development pipeline. It is an mRNA cancer immunotherapy targeting four antigens frequently expressed in the tumors of patients with melanoma – NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, tyrosinase, and TPTE. BNT111 has demonstrated clinical anti-tumor activity as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in an ongoing Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced melanoma after prior checkpoint blockade.

“We believe our FixVac platform represents a powerful new drug class of mRNA immunotherapies against cancer. We look forward to working together with Regeneron to advance this product candidate into potentially registrational clinical trials,” said Ugur Sahin, CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

The two companies plan to pursue a clinical trial for the combination in the second-line treatment setting for advanced melanoma. The companies plan to disclose more details related to the planned Phase 2 study in the third quarter of 2020, with the goal of initiating the trial in the fourth quarter of 2020.

“Despite recent treatment advances with anti-PD-1 therapies for patients with melanoma, most patients fail to obtain a durable benefit. The combination of Libtayo and BNT111 FixVac has the potential to augment the immune system’s ability to effectively recognize melanoma in multiple ways and hopefully improve immune targeting to control the cancer,” said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational Science and Oncology, at Regeneron.

Under the terms of the agreement, development costs for the clinical trial will be shared equally and both companies will contribute their products for the trial. Each party will retain full commercial rights for its respective product and record revenues related to its own product.

Libtayo is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi.

37772,Roche's Rozlytrek Receives EC's Conditional Marketing Authorization for NTRK Fusion-Positive Solid Tumors and ROS1-Positive Advanced NSCLC,"Rozlytrek, Roche’s first tumour-agnostic therapy, approved in Europe for people with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours and for people with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer","The approval is based on integrated analysis including data from 74 people with LA/ m-NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors (14 tumor types) & 161 people with ROS1+ NSCLC of the pivotal P-II STARTRK-2, P-I STARTRK-1 and P-I ALKA-372-001 trials, and data from the P-I/II STARTRK-NG study in pediatric patients
 Result: in NTRK fusion+ solid tumors, ORR (63.5%); mDoR (12.9mos.); In ROS1+ advanced NSCLC, shrank tumors in 73.4% of patients; DoR of 16.5mos. (14.6-28.6mos.); ORR (67.1%); in patients with CNS metastases with an intracranial ORR (62.5% & 77.8%); In pediatric patients, Rozlytrek shrank tumors in all children and adolescents who had NTRK gene fusions with two achieving a CR
 Rozlytrek (entrectinib, qd) is a tumor-agnostic treatment for LA/m-solid tumors harboring NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions and has received EMA’s PRIME designation to treat NTRK fusion-positive, LA/m- solid tumors in adult and pediatric patients who have either progressed following prior therapies or who have no acceptable standard therapies","Rozlytrek has shown durable responses across multiple tumour types, including cancer that has spread to the brain
This approval shows the value of combining genomic profiling with precision medicine to offer patients with rare and hard-to-treat cancers a personalised treatment option
Basel, 03 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorisation for Rozlytrek® (entrectinib) for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older with solid tumours expressing a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor, who have no satisfactory treatment options. The European Commission has also approved Rozlytrek for the treatment of adults with ROS1-positive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors.1

“We are excited to announce the approval of Rozlytrek in Europe for two indications, bringing patients with NTRK and ROS1 gene fusions a new effective treatment even when their cancer has spread to the brain,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “This advance represents another important step forward in cancer care by allowing us to treat certain genetic drivers of cancer irrespective of the location of the tumour within the body. Roche is deeply committed to driving personalised healthcare and addressing the high unmet need in patients around the world with rare cancers.”

The approval is based on results from the integrated analysis of the pivotal phase II STARTRK-2, phase I STARTRK-1 and phase I ALKA-372-001 trials, and data from the phase I/II STARTRK-NG study. These studies demonstrate that Rozlytrek has durable responses across several NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours, including sarcoma, non-small cell lung, salivary MASC, secretory and non-secretory breast, thyroid, colorectal, neuroendocrine, pancreatic, ovarian, endometrial carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gastrointestinal cancers and neuroblastoma, as well as ROS1-positive NSCLC.1 Results showed:

Rozlytrek shrank tumours in more than half of people with NTRK fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours (overall response rate [ORR]=63.5%; N=74), and objective responses were observed across 14 tumour types (median duration of response [DoR]=12.9 months [9.3 months – not reached], N=21 out of 47 patients defined by ORR).1
In ROS1-positive, advanced NSCLC, Rozlytrek shrank tumours in 73.4% of people with the disease (ORR; N=94 with a minimum of 12 months follow up), with a median DoR of 16.5 months (14.6 – 28.6 months). In a group of 161 patients with a minimum of 6 months follow up, including 29% of patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline, ORR was observed to be 67.1%.1
Objective responses to Rozlytrek were seen in people with CNS metastases at baseline, with an intracranial ORR of 62.5% and 77.8% in both NTRK and ROS1 populations, respectively.1
In paediatric patients, Rozlytrek shrank tumours (ORR) in all children and adolescents who had NTRK gene fusions (N=5), with two achieving a complete response (CR). Two patients with primary high-grade tumours in the CNS had objective responses, including one patient with a CR.1 Rozlytrek was well tolerated.
The most common adverse reactions (≥20 percent) with Rozlytrek were fatigue, constipation, altered sense of taste (dysgeusia), swelling (oedema), dizziness, diarrhoea, nausea, nervous system disorders (dysaesthesia), shortness of breath (dyspnoea), anaemia, increased weight, increased blood creatinine, pain, cognitive disorders, vomiting, cough, and fever (pyrexia).1
Rozlytrek has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation by the EMA for the treatment of NTRK fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours in adult and paediatric patients who have either progressed following prior therapies or who have no acceptable standard therapies.1 NTRK gene fusions have been identified in a range of solid tumour types, and are present in up to 90% of some rare cancer types and less than 1% of other more common tumours, including lung and colorectal.2 ROS1 gene fusions account for 1-2% of NSCLC, the most common type of lung cancer that accounts for up to 85% of all diagnoses.3,4

Biomarker testing for these fusions is the most effective way to identify people who are most eligible for treatment with Rozlytrek. Roche is leveraging its expertise in developing personalised medicines and advanced diagnostics, in conjunction with Foundation Medicine, to develop a companion diagnostic that will help identify people with NTRK and ROS1 gene fusions.

About the integrated analysis
The approval in Europe is based on an integrated analysis including data from 74 people with locally advanced or metastatic NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours (14 tumour types) and 161 people with ROS1-positive NSCLC from the phase II STARTRK-2, phase I STARTRK-1 and phase I ALKA-372-001 trials.1 It is also based on data from the phase I/II STARTRK-NG study in paediatric patients. The studies enrolled people across 15 countries and more than 150 clinical trial sites. Safety was assessed from an integrated analysis of 504 people across these four trials.1

About NTRK fusion-positive cancer
NTRK fusion-positive cancer occurs when the NTRK1/2/3 genes fuse with other genes, resulting in altered TRK proteins (TRKA/TRKB/TRKC) that can activate signalling pathways involved in the proliferation of certain types of cancer.5 NTRK gene fusions are present in tumours irrespective of site of origin. These fusions have been identified in a broad range of solid tumour types, including sarcoma, non-small cell lung, salivary MASC, secretory and non-secretory breast, thyroid, colorectal, neuroendocrine, pancreatic, ovarian, endometrial carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gastrointestinal cancers and neuroblastoma.1

About ROS1-positive NSCLC
ROS1 is a tyrosine kinase, which plays a role in controlling how cells grow and proliferate. When a ROS1 gene fusion occurs, cancer cells grow and proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. Blocking this abnormal signalling can cause tumour cells to shrink or die.3
ROS1 gene fusions account for 1-2% of NSCLC.3 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death across the world.6 Each year, more than one and a half million people die as a result of the disease globally, equating to more than 4,000 deaths every day.6 NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer and accounts for up to 85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.4 While the ROS1 gene fusion can be found in any patient with NSCLC, young never-smokers with NSCLC have the highest incidence of ROS1 gene fusions.3

About Rozlytrek
Rozlytrek® (entrectinib) is a tumour-agnostic once-daily oral medicine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours that harbour NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions. It is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit the kinase activity of the TRKA/B/C and ROS1 proteins, whose activating fusions drive proliferation in certain types of cancer.7,8 Rozlytrek can block NTRK and ROS1 kinase activity and may result in the death of cancer cells with NTRK or ROS1 gene fusions.7,8

Rozlytrek was granted accelerated approval in August 2019 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), following receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation, for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older with solid tumours that have a NTRK gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation, are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and have progressed following treatment or have no satisfactory alternative therapy, and was approved for the treatment of adults with ROS1-positive, metastatic NSCLC. In June 2019, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) also approved Rozlytrek for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with NTRK fusion-positive, advanced recurrent solid tumours, and later approved Rozlytrek in ROS1-positive NSCLC in February 2020. Rozlytrek has also received approvals by health authorities in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan.

About Opioid-Induced Constipation (OIC)
OIC is a condition caused by prescription opioid pain medicines. Opioids play an important role in chronic pain relief and work by binding to mu-receptors in the central nervous system, but they can also bind to mu-receptors in the bowel, which can result in patients suffering from OIC. OIC is the most prevalent and disabling adverse effect associated with opioid therapy, estimated to affect between 40-80% of the millions of patients taking chronic opioid therapy each year4.

37810,Novartis Reports Results of Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) in P-II ELARA Study for Follicular Lymphoma,Novartis announces Kymriah meets primary endpoint at interim analysis of pivotal study in follicular lymphoma,"The P-II ELARA study involves assessing the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in adult patients with r/r FL across 12 countries in 30 sites globally
 At the interim analysis, the study met its 1EPs of CRR, as assessed by IRC. The company will include the results in regulatory submissions, with anticipated filing to the US FDA in 2021, and then in EU, while the results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting
 Kymriah has received FDA’s RMAT designation in r/r FL based on preliminary ELARA trial findings, reflecting the unmet need for additional treatment options for FL. The Therapy was developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania","Global ELARA trial demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL) as measured by complete response rate
Kymriah previously received FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation in r/r FL based on preliminary ELARA trial findings, reflecting the unmet need for additional treatment options for this cancer type
ELARA trial findings will be included in regulatory submissions, with filing in the US anticipated in 2021, and the EU following. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting
Interim analysis comes alongside milestones of 3,000th batch of CAR-T cells manufactured for patients worldwide and approval for commercial manufacturing at two additional sites in Europe
Basel, August 4, 2020 — Novartis today announced positive results from the Phase II ELARA trial of Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL). At the interim analysis, the global study met its primary endpoint of complete response rate (CRR), as assessed by independent review committee. CRR is a standard measure of patient response to therapy in FL. No new Kymriah safety signals were observed. Results from the ELARA trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and included in US and EU regulatory submissions.

Kymriah was the first-ever FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, and the first-ever CAR-T to be approved in two distinct indications. It is a one-time treatment designed to empower patients’ immune systems to fight their cancer. Kymriah is currently approved for the treatment of r/r pediatric and young adult (up to 25 years of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)1.

“We are pleased that Kymriah is showing meaningful results and may provide a potentially definitive treatment option for patients with relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “These results further support our efforts to reimagine medicine in this incurable malignancy and reach this underserved patient population, who are historically burdened with several years of various treatments.”

Kymriah was developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a strategic alliance between industry and academia, which was first-of-its-kind in CAR-T research and development.

Kymriah is currently approved for use in at least one indication in more than 25 countries and at more than 250 certified treatment centers, with the ambition for further expansion to help fulfill the ultimate goal of bringing CAR-T cell therapy to every patient in need. As Novartis prepares for the launch of a potential third indication for Kymriah, manufacturing capacity continues to ramp up. The Novartis global CAR-T manufacturing footprint spans seven facilities total, across four continents. This comprehensive, integrated footprint strengthens the flexibility, resilience and sustainability of the manufacturing and supply chain. With recent approvals from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), commercial manufacturing of Kymriah is now ongoing at the Novartis-owned facilities in Stein, Switzerland and Les Ulis, France, joining the Novartis-owned facility in Morris Plains, New Jersey, USA.

About Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma, the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is an indolent lymphoma, and represents approximately 22% of NHL cases2,3. Despite new treatments that improve overall survival, FL is regarded as an incurable malignancy with a relapsing and remitting pattern4,5. Throughout the lifetime of a patient with relapsing FL, they may be exposed to a median of five lines of prior treatment, with an upper range of 12 lines6,7. Although patients in third or later line treatment for FL have multiple systemic therapies available, the efficacy of these regimens drops off rapidly in later lines5. Additionally, because of this relapsing and remitting pattern, patients who are refractory to treatment or quickly relapse may exhaust available treatment options5.

About the ELARA trial
ELARA is a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in adult patients with r/r FL. This international trial has enrolled patients from over 30 sites in 12 countries worldwide.

In Q2 2020, the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to Kymriah in r/r FL, based on preliminary results from the ELARA trial. RMAT designation is intended to expedite the development and review of Kymriah as a regenerative therapy for this underserved patient population.

About Novartis Commitment to Oncology Cell & Gene
Novartis has a mission to reimagine medicine by bringing curative cell & gene therapies to patients worldwide. Novartis has a deep CAR-T pipeline and ongoing investment in manufacturing and supply chain process improvements. With active research underway to broaden the impact of cell therapy in oncology, Novartis is going deeper in hematological malignancies, reaching patients with other cancer types and evaluating next-generation CAR-T cell therapies that focus on new targets and utilize new technologies.

Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to significantly invest in pioneering CAR-T research and initiate global CAR-T trials. Kymriah, the first approved CAR-T cell therapy, developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is the foundation of Novartis’ commitment to CAR-T cell therapy.

Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety information
Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications.

Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities.

Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.

Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.

Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient’s healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding.

Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah, and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine.

After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer.

Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures.

Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.

Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy.

Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.

37867,AstraZeneca Signs a License Agreement with Redx Pharma for RXC006 to Treat Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Redx signs out licensing agreement with AstraZeneca,"Redx to receive $17M in early payment by the time of successful commencement of a P-I study, $360M as development, a regulatory and commercial milestone along with royalties on sales of the RXC006
 AstraZeneca to get an exclusive global license to further develop & commercialize RXC006 targeting fibrotic diseases including IPF
 Redx continues to progress its lead oncology asset, RXC004 (porcupine inhibitor) targeting Wnt-driven tumors, currently being evaluated in P-I/II clinical trial, and RXC007, the oral Rock 2 inhibitor targeting fibrosis where first in human studies are expected in 2021","Alderley Park, 4 August 2020 Redx Pharma plc (AIM: REDX) announces it has signed a significant out licensing agreement for its porcupine inhibitor, RXC006, with AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will take RXC006 forward into clinical development, targeting fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Porcupine inhibition is a novel anti-fibrotic approach that suppresses Wnt ligand secretion from pro-fibrotic cells. Wnt ligands are known to be strong drivers of fibrotic mechanisms and are highly expressed in diseases such as IPF. Wnt ligands regulate multiple aspects of disease biology so porcupine inhibition presents a potentially powerful anti-fibrotic approach. IPF is a life-threatening and progressive lung disease with a high mortality rate and a prognosis worse than many cancers.

Under the terms of the exclusive global agreement, AstraZeneca will pay Redx several early milestones that amount to $17 million, by the time of successful commencement of a phase 1 study.  In addition, Redx is eligible to receive up to a further $360 million from AstraZeneca in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments throughout the course of the programme should it successfully reach these milestones.  Redx is also eligible for tiered royalties of mid-single digit percentages, based on any future net sales.

Redx continues to execute on its strategy, progressing its lead oncology and fibrosis programmes. These include the oral porcupine inhibitor, RXC004, targeting Wnt-driven tumours, which is in an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial in oncology patients, and the oral ROCK2 inhibitor, RXC007, which targets fibrosis, where first in human studies are expected in 2021.

Lisa Anson, Chief Executive Officer of Redx Pharma, commented: “We are excited by the potential of porcupine inhibition as a novel approach to tackling fibrotic-associated diseases where there is a real patient need.  This agreement, where AstraZeneca will license this first in class porcupine inhibitor for IPF and progress it into development, highlights, once again, Redx’s ability to generate molecules that have significant potential as novel medicines.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca said: “Fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have significant impact on patients’ lives and new therapies are urgently needed. We look forward to progressing this porcupine inhibitor into clinical trials as a novel approach to supress Wnt signalling and potentially modify fibrotic disease processes.”

37876,LEO Pharma Receives the US FDA's Fast Track Designation for Delgocitinib Cream to Treat Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Hand Eczema,LEO Pharma Announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration Fast Track Designation for delgocitinib Cream for the Treatment of Adults With Moderate-to-severe Chronic Hand Eczema,"The US FDA has granted FT designation to LEO’s delgocitinib cream as the potential treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe CHE. There are currently no treatment options available in the US specifically developed and approved for CHE
 The FDA’s FT designation facilitates the development and expedites the regulatory review of drugs to treat serious conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need
 Delgocitinib (bid, topical formulation) acts by inhibiting the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, currently being evaluated in two P-IIb studies for mild-to-severe CHE & AD. The company plans to submit the results of P-IIb CHE study in late 2020","The purpose of the Fast Track process is to get important potential new drugs to patients earlier1

August 04, 2020 08:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time
BALLERUP, Denmark & MADISON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–LEO Pharma A/S, a global leader in medical dermatology, today announced that delgocitinib cream, an investigational topical pan-Janus kinase (JAK)-inhibitor, has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe chronic hand eczema (CHE). There are currently no treatment options available in the U.S. specifically developed and approved for the treatment of CHE.2,3,4

CHE is defined as hand eczema (HE) that lasts for more than three months or relapsing twice or more within a year.5,6 HE is the most common skin disorder of the hands7 that affects an estimated 1 – 5% of the general population8 with a one-year prevalence rate of approximately 10%.9 It is an inflammatory, non-infectious skin disorder of the hands and wrists5,10 and can cause itching, blisters, swelling and pain so severe that it can impair the ability to work.5,7,11 In a substantial number of patients, HE can develop into a chronic condition.7 There is an unmet need for well-tolerated, effective and safe treatments for long-term control of CHE.8,12,13,14

“Moderate-to-severe CHE can be a disabling skin disease that can disrupt the ability for people to work and be self-sufficient because their hands can feel so raw and painful,” said Kim Kjøller, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, LEO Pharma. “We are delighted that topical delgocitinib cream has been granted Fast Track designation and look forward to collaborating with the FDA during the development process as we aim to accelerate bringing this potential new treatment option to patients.”

Delgocitinib inhibits activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which plays a key role in the immune system in driving the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory skin diseases.15,16 The cream formulation of delgocitinib is not currently approved by any regulatory authorities.

About Fast Track

The FDA Fast Track process facilitates the development and expedites regulatory review of drugs to treat serious conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need.1 According to the FDA, filling an unmet medical need is defined as ‘providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy’.1

The frequency of communication during the FDA Fast Track process allows for questions to be addressed quickly, often leading to earlier drug approval and access by patients.1

 Voyager is not obligated to repay the upfront payment it received from AbbVie in connection with the Tau & ASN agreement but is no longer eligible to receive option payments, milestone payments, or royalties thereunder","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 03, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: VYGR), a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing treatments for severe neurological diseases, today announced the termination of its tau and alpha-synuclein vectorized antibody collaborations with AbbVie. Voyager retains full rights to the vectorization technology and certain novel vectorized antibodies developed as part of the collaborations.

“Our efforts to harness AAV-based gene therapy to produce antibodies directly in the brain and overcome major limitations with delivery of current biologics across the blood-brain barrier have been highly productive,” said Omar Khwaja, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&D at Voyager. “Through the tau and alpha-synuclein collaborations, we believe we have made considerable progress against targets for neurodegenerative diseases with this novel approach, reinforcing our enthusiasm for its potential to deliver therapeutically efficacious levels of biologics to the brain and central nervous system. We believe our continued work on discovery and design of novel AAV capsids with substantially improved blood-brain barrier penetrance will also considerably broaden the potential of AAV-based gene therapy, including vectorized antibodies or other biologics, for the treatment of severe neurological diseases.”

The tau and alpha-synuclein research collaborations were formed in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Under the terms of the collaboration agreements, Voyager received upfront payments to perform research and preclinical development of vectorized antibodies directed against tau and alpha-synuclein. With the conclusion of the collaborations, Voyager has regained full clinical development and commercialization rights to certain product candidates developed within the context of the collaboration for the tau program. Voyager is free to pursue vectorized antibody programs for tau and alpha-synuclein alone or in collaboration with another partner.

Voyager does not anticipate any changes to its cash runway guidance due to the termination of the agreements. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of $250.9 million, which, along with amounts expected to be received for reimbursement of development costs from Neurocrine Biosciences, is expected to be sufficient to meet Voyager’s projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2022.

37898,Roche's cobas Epstein-Barr Virus Test Receives the US FDA's Authorization for Transplant Patients,Roche announces FDA authorisation for the first Epstein-Barr virus quantitative test on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems to improve care for transplant patients,"The US FDA has granted de novo class II for cobas EBV test, providing HCPs a tool for monitoring transplant patients at risk for complications from infections or reactivations of EBV
 The cobas EBV test is a PCR viral load test that runs on the fully automated and widely available cobas 6800/8800 systems and has been calibrated to WHO’s international standard
 The test has received the FDA’s BDD and has robust coverage with a limit of detection of 18.8 IU/mL and an expanded linear range from 35 IU/mL-1E+08 IU/mL in EDTA plasma","FDA granted de novo class II for cobas EBV test following the agency’s Breakthrough Device designation
Accurate monitoring of Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels is critical, as they are  associated with a range of life threatening-diseases including cancer in transplant patients
Test meets World Health Organization standards for consistent result reporting among laboratories across the U.S., allowing for results to be easily comparable across hospitals and labs
 

Basel, 5 August 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised the cobas® EBV test. This is the first quantitative in vitro diagnostic test for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the United States. This authorisation gives healthcare professionals a key tool in monitoring transplant patients at risk for complications from infections or reactivations of EBV, by providing the ability to run a large number of patient tests for this virus in a short period of time.

“Monitoring of Epstein-Barr virus DNA can help prevent progression of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer in transplant patients,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “The EBV test helps set a new standard of care for patients, as healthcare professionals now can act early in the management of this virus with best-in-class monitoring tools and can make more informed decisions when treating patients.”

The cobas EBV test is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral load test that runs on the fully automated and widely available cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems. The test has been calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard. This means that test results are reported in international measures, making it possible for laboratories anywhere in the U.S. to obtain comparable results when measuring levels of EBV DNA.

The test was previously granted FDA Breakthrough Device designation, which enables an expedited review process for medical devices that provide improved treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening diseases or conditions.

About the cobas EBV test
The cobas EBV test is a real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) viral load test with dual target technology, which provides quantitative accuracy and guards against the risk of sequence variations that may be present in the Epstein-Barr virus. The cobas EBV test has robust coverage with a limit of detection of 18.8 IU/mL and an expanded linear range from 35 IU/mL to 1E+08 IU/mL in EDTA plasma.

The test offers an alternative to lab-developed tests (LDTs) or Assay Specific Reagents (ASR) combinations, potentially minimising variability and complexity in testing, reducing workload and alleviating risk for laboratories. The test supports the goal of result standardisation across institutions by providing reproducible, high-quality results for clinical decision-making.

The fully automated cobas EBV test can be run on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems providing absolute automation with proven performance and flexibility. Simultaneous testing with CMV or other virology tests leads to time savings and increased efficiency.

About Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
Epstein-Barr virus is a member of the herpes virus family and has been associated with a range of cancers in transplant patients, such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Once infection with EBV occurs, the virus establishes as a latent form and can remain in the body. Most people harbor EBV with no long-term clinical ramifications.

EBV spreads most commonly through bodily fluids, primarily saliva. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems, including transplant patients, are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates.1

About the cobas 6800/8800 Systems
When every moment matters, the fully automated cobas 6800/8800 Systems offer the fastest time to results with the highest throughput and the longest walk-away time available among automated molecular platforms. The systems provide up to 96 results in about 3 hours and 384 results for the cobas 6800 System and 1,056 results for the cobas 8800 System in an 8-hour shift.*

Both systems make it possible for labs to perform up to three tests in the same run with no pre-sorting required. The systems also enable up to eight hours (cobas 6800 System) and four hours (cobas 8800 System) of walk-away time with minimal user interaction.*

These real-time PCR systems serve the areas of infectious disease, donor screening, sexual health, transplant, respiratory and antimicrobial stewardship.

Through an ever-increasing worldwide install base of cobas 6800/8800 Systems, labs are quickly and easily processing millions of tests per month to meet the changing demands of their communities, their customers and the patients relying on the results of each assay. Globally, labs know and trust that a Roche assay guarantees high precision, accuracy and traceability to World Health Organization standards.

Clinical supply from BioNTech’s GMP-certified mRNA production facilities in Europe
MAINZ, Germany, and SHANGHAI, China, Aug. 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd (“Fosun Pharma” or “Group”; Stock Symbol: 600196.SH, 02196.HK), today announced that the first 72 participants have already been dosed with BNT162b1 following IND approval by the Chinese regulatory authority, National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). BioNTech and Fosun Pharma are jointly developing the COVID-19 vaccine candidate in China. The trial is part of BioNTech’s global development program aimed at supporting a global supply upon regulatory approval.

The randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded Phase 1 clinical trial in China will enroll 144 healthy subjects to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine as well as to confirm dose selection. The first group of subjects immunized in Stage 1 of the study will be healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, followed by elderly healthy participants (>55 years). As part of the two-dose cohort design, subjects will receive two injections (prime-boost), 21 days apart, of 10µg or 30µg of the vaccine candidate or placebo. The dose range selection was determined based on early data from clinical trials conducted in Germany and the United States. The participants will be dosed in Taizhou Clinical Phase1 Center, Jiangsu province.

The study is designed to support the regulatory approval process for the Chinese market and intends to confirm that the safety and immunogenicity profile observed in participants from the German and US trials is comparable to that of Chinese participants. The ongoing clinical studies conducted in Germany and the United States will continue to support studies in China.

“We are proud to be among the first international biopharmaceutical companies to initiate a clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate in China as part of our effort to make our vaccine available globally, if approved. This is an important step toward our goal to reach marketing authorization and ensure vaccine supply in China to help prevent new COVID-19 outbreaks in the most populous country in the world,” said CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin.

Ai-Min Hui, President of Global R&D, and Chief Medical Officer of Fosun Pharma said: “Dosing the first Chinese subject with BNT162b1 marks a milestone of the global co-development program in China. We are closely working with BioNTech and regulatory authorities to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BNT162b1 and other mRNA vaccine candidates, in order to synchronize the development process in China with other countries, and to bring the vaccine to public as soon as possible, if the vaccine succeeds.”

Following on from the ongoing Phase 1/2 studies in Germany and the United States, the Chinese study will initially evaluate nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) candidate BNT162b1, one of two vaccine candidates based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology to have received FDA Fast Track designation in the United States. Meanwhile, BNT162b2, the other vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 2b/3 trial conducted by BioNTech and Pfizer which commenced on July 27th. The companies also intend to explore the possibility of initiating clinical development of other vaccine candidates based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology in China.

During the clinical development stage, BioNTech will provide the clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe. If the vaccine receives marketing authorization in China, Fosun Pharma will exclusively commercialize the vaccine in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau Special Administration Regions and in Taiwan.

Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) announces the decision to discontinue the phase II proof of concept clinical study of Lu AF11167 in patients with schizophrenia, who are experiencing persistent negative symptoms (NCT03793712). The decision to stop the trial is based on the results of a futility interim analysis, which concluded that the trial is unlikely to achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint, mean change from baseline to week 12 on the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). The recommendation to stop the trial is not based on safety concerns.

Lundbeck is incredibly grateful to all the patients with schizophrenia, their families and the investigators who participated in the trials and contributed greatly to this research.

Dr. Johan Luthman, Executive Vice President, R&D at Lundbeck said:

“Negative symptoms are a symptomatology of schizophrenia, for which there is no approved medical treatment today. It is disappointing that Lu AF11167 did not show the efficacy needed to treat this area which impacts many patients and represents a huge unmet medical need. We are very grateful for the patients and the clinical study sites that participated in this proof of concept study. The outcome from this interim analysis helps us to prioritize Lundbeck´s resources towards opportunities that have the highest promise for our patients. We will now close the study in a responsible manner and ensure that valuable knowledge gathered is made accessible to researchers globally.”

The study results are planned to be submitted for scientific publication at a later date.

About the study

The primary objective of the phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy on negative symptoms of two doses of Lu AF11167 versus placebo as monotherapy in patients with schizophrenia and persistent prominent negative symptoms. The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Lu AF11167 on patients’ functioning as well as the safety and tolerability of the compound. This 3-arm study was planned to randomize a total of 240 patients (80 patients per arm) from various European countries.

 

About Lu AF11167

Lu AF11167 is a small molecule and a potent and selective inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase 10A enzyme (PDE10Ai). PDE10Ai modulates dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-mediated intraneuronal signaling without binding to these receptors. PDE10Ai is believed to reduce negative symptoms and to keep positive symptoms stabilized.

 

About schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is caused by an imbalance in the neurotransmitters facilitating the communication between neurons in the brain, leading to the perception (seeing/hearing/thinking) of things that are not real. The factors that create this imbalance are not fully understood. Schizophrenia is a common form of severe mental illness that carries a notable ‘stigma’ and is often misunderstood. People with schizophrenia experience disturbed thoughts, emotions and behavior, and they find it difficult to judge reality[i]. This can have a major impact on the life of the individual and his/her family. Negative symptoms, a diminution or absence of normal behaviors related to motivation and interest or expression, are a core component of schizophrenia and they account for a large part of the long-term morbidity and poor functional outcome in patients with the disorder.

The World Health Organization estimates that over 21 million people suffer from schizophrenia, making it one of the top 20 causes of disability worldwide[ii]. Schizophrenia affects people regardless of race, culture or social class. It typically starts in early adulthood (from age 20)[iii], but it can develop at any age. Schizophrenia affects both men and women, although men tend to develop the condition slightly earlier in life[iv]. The risk of an individual developing schizophrenia during his or her lifetime is approximately 1 percent.

37991,UCB's Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) Receives the EMA's Approval for a Reduced Maintenance Dose in Patients with Axial Spondyloarthritis Spectrum,CIMZIA is the First and Only Biologic Approved in Europe with the Option for a Reduced Maintenance Dose for Patients Across the Full Axial Spondyloarthritis Spectrum,"The P-IIIb C-OPTIMISE study assessing Cimzia (200mg, q2w with a loading dose of 400mg @ 0, 2 & 4wks.) vs PBO during 48wks. open-label induction period in adults with early active axSpA. At 48wks., patients in sustained remission (ASDAS <1.3 @wks. 32/36 & 48) were randomized to Cimzia 200mg, q2w (full maintenance dose) & 200mg q4w (reduced maintenance dose) or PBO (withdrawal) for an additional 48wks.
 The EMA label extension is based on the results of the C-OPTIMISE study that demonstrated @48wks. 43.9% of patients achieved sustained remission, @96wks. 84%, 79% & 20% of patients receiving the full maintenance dose, reduced maintenance dose or PBO respectively remained flare-free
 The approval makes Cimzia the only biologic in EU with a dose reduction option in its label for patients in the broad axSpA population","· European label extended to include a dose reduction option for the treatment of adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including non-radiographic and radiographic axSpA, who are in sustained remission after one year of CIMZIA[®] (certolizumab pegol) treatment,[1] underpinned by results of the Phase 3b C-OPTIMISE study
· C-OPTIMISE showed that, once axSpA patients are in sustained remission, it is possible to benefit from a reduced CIMZIA dosing regimen without compromising clinical efficacy[2]

Brussels, Belgium – 5 August 2020 – UCB today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved a label extension for CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol) for use in adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) at a reduced maintenance dose of 200 mg every four weeks (Q4W), once sustained remission is achieved after one year of CIMZIA 200 mg every two weeks (Q2W) or 400 mg Q4W.1 The approval makes CIMZIA the only biologic in Europe with a dose reduction option in its label for patients in the broad axSpA population.1 

Clinical remission is recommended as a major treatment target in the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for axSpA and treat-to-target recommendations for spondyloarthritis.3,4 Additionally, strategies for the maintenance of remission are necessary to prevent future deterioration in disease status.5

Maintenance dose reduction supports the long-term management of patients with axSpA, when sustained disease remission has been achieved.2 This approach offers an additional option that preserves the clinical benefits to patients of remaining on treatment, while responding to specific patient needs, and can optimise the cost of their therapy.2 The extension of CIMZIA’s label in Europe1 addresses an under-recognised unmet need6,7 by providing the first validated dose reduction strategy for patients across the broad axSpA spectrum who have achieved sustained remission.

“AxSpA patients typically experience symptom onset in their mid-twenties and may therefore be concerned about lifelong continuation of therapy. The CIMZIA label extension now offers healthcare providers a validated dose reduction strategy that can meet the needs of patients. Furthermore, the option to reduce the maintenance dose may provide cost reductions, benefiting the wider healthcare system,” said Robert Landewé, MD, PhD, Amsterdam Rheumatology & Clinical Immunology Center, and lead author of the C-OPTIMISE study.

“C-OPTIMISE is the first and only randomised controlled trial to compare both maintenance dose continuation and dose reduction versus placebo in a broad axSpA population. Taken with previous clinical evidence showing that early treatment of axSpA with CIMZIA provides improved clinical outcomes, axSpA patients have a treatment option that can help address their symptoms at every stage of their disease: from initiation of biologic therapy, to remission and maintenance. Our clinical study package in axSpA showed that r-axSpA and nr-axSpA are part of the same disease entity. If treated early, remission is a realistic target and patients can have the flexibility to reduce their dose once they have achieved sustained remission,” said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President Immunology Solutions and Head of US, UCB.

The EMA label extension is based on data from the Phase 3b C-OPTIMISE trial in adults with early active axSpA.2  At week 48 of the induction period, 43.9 percent (323/736) of patients achieved sustained remission (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) <1.3 at weeks 32 or 36 and 48). Of those patients, 313 were randomised to full maintenance dose (CIMZIA 200 mg Q2W), reduced maintenance dose (CIMZIA 200 mg Q4W), or placebo.2 At week 96, 84 percent, 79 percent and 20 percent of patients receiving the full maintenance dose, reduced maintenance dose, or placebo, respectively, remained flare-free.2  Of patients who flared in the reduced maintenance dose arm, 60 percent regained remission after 12 weeks of treatment with the full maintenance dose of CIMZIA.2 

There were no differences in responses between radiographic axSpA (r-axSpA) and non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) patients in both the induction and maintenance periods.2 No new safety signals with CIMZIA were observed over the course of the study compared to previous studies.1,2 In patients who achieve sustained remission, dose reduction is an option, but treatment should not be withdrawn, because of the high risk of flare.2

About Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA)
Non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) and radiographic axSpA (r-axSpA, also known as ankylosing spondylitis or AS) comprise the axial spondyloarthritis, or axSpA, spectrum of disease, which typically starts in patients in their mid-twenties. Nr-axSpA and r-axSpA share similar symptomology and disease burden. In r-axSpA, there is a definitive structural damage in the sacroiliac joints detectable by x-ray. In nr-axSpA, there is no definitive radiographic sacroiliitis, though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing often shows evidence of active sacroiliitis, visible as inflammation in the sacroiliac joints. Historically, nr-axSpA has not been well-recognised due to a lack of understanding of the disease history, progression, and prognosis, resulting in substantial diagnostic delay. As a result, nr-axSpA is often misdiagnosed and undertreated.

Axial spondyloarthritis is estimated to affect up to 1.4 percent of adults.8,9 Roughly two thirds of nr-axSpA patients are women.10 Yet, axSpA is often overlooked in women, with 89 percent being initially misdiagnosed, leading to a significantly longer time to diagnosis in women compared to men, on average more than two years. Underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis can have long-term consequences for patients with axSpA.11

About the C-OPTIMISE Study2
C-OPTIMISE was a two-part, multicentre Phase 3b trial in adults with early active axSpA (radiographic and non-radiographic). During the 48-week open-label induction period, patients received CIMZIA 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) with loading dose of CIMZIA 400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4. At week 48, patients in sustained remission (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) <1.3 at weeks 32 or 36 and 48) were randomised to CIMZIA 200 mg Q2W (full maintenance dose), CIMZIA 200 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W; reduced maintenance dose) or placebo (withdrawal) for an additional 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients remaining flare-free (flare: ASDAS ≥2.1 at two consecutive visits or ASDAS >3.5 at any time point) during the maintenance period.

C-OPTIMISE is the first and only randomised, interventional, placebo-controlled study in the full axSpA spectrum with three arms (full dose, reduced dose and placebo) that provides strong evidence on the dosing options for healthcare professionals to manage axSpA patients that have achieved sustained remission with CIMZIA treatment.

About CIMZIA® in the EU/EEA
In the EU, CIMZIA® in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients inadequately responsive to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including MTX.

CIMZIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. CIMZIA in combination with MTX is also indicated for the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs.

CIMZIA has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with MTX.

CIMZIA, in combination with MTX, is also indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. CIMZIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

CIMZIA is also indicated in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with severe active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), comprising:

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) – adults with severe active AS who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) without radiographic evidence of AS – adults with severe active axSpA without radiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to NSAIDs.
CIMZIA is also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.

Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) EU/EEA* Important Safety Information 

Cimzia® was studied in 4,049 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in controlled and open label trials for up to 92 months. The commonly reported adverse reactions (1-10 percent) in clinical trials with Cimzia® and post-marketing were viral infections (includes herpes zoster, papillomavirus, influenza), bacterial infections (including abscess), rash, headache (including migraine), asthenia, leukopenia (including lymphopenia, neutropenia), eosinophilic disorder, pain (any sites), pyrexia, sensory abnormalities, hypertension, pruritus (any sites), hepatitis (including hepatic enzyme increase), injection site reactions, and nausea. Serious adverse reactions include sepsis, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis (including miliary, disseminated and extrapulmonary), herpes zoster, lymphoma, leukaemia, solid organ tumours, angioneurotic oedema, cardiomyopathies (includes heart failure), ischemic coronary artery disorders, pancytopenia, hypercoagulation (including thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism), cerebrovascular accident, vasculitis, hepatitis/hepatopathy (includes cirrhosis), and renal impairment/nephropathy (includes nephritis). In RA controlled clinical trials, 4.4 percent of patients discontinued taking Cimzia® due to adverse events vs. 2.7 percent for placebo.

Cimzia® was initially studied in 325 patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in the AS001 clinical study for up to 4 years, which includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and a 156-week open-label treatment period. Cimzia® was subsequently studied in 317 patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in a placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks (AS0006). Cimzia® was also studied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in a clinical study for up to 96 weeks, which included a 48-week open-label run-in phase (N=736) followed by a 48-week placebo-controlled phase (N=313) for patients in sustained remission (C-OPTIMISE). In all 3 studies, the safety profile for these patients was consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous experience with Cimzia®.

Cimzia® was studied in 409 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in a clinical study for up to 4 years which included a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and a 168-week open-label treatment period.

The safety profile for axSpA and PsA patients treated with Cimzia® was consistent with the safety profile in RA and previous experience with Cimzia®.

Cimzia® was studied in 1112 patients with psoriasis in controlled and open-label studies for up to 3 years. In the Phase III program, the initial and maintenance periods were followed by a 96-week open-label treatment period. The long-term safety profile of Cimzia® 400 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia® 200 mg every 2 weeks was generally similar and consistent with previous experience with Cimzia.

Cimzia® is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients, active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis or opportunistic infections, and moderate to severe heart failure.

Serious infections including sepsis, tuberculosis and opportunistic infections (e.g. histoplasmosis, nocardia, candidiasis) have been reported in patients receiving Cimzia®. Some of these events have been fatal. Before initiation of therapy with Cimzia®, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection. If active tuberculosis is diagnosed prior to or during treatment, Cimzia® therapy must not be initiated and must be discontinued. If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy must be started before initiating treatment with Cimzia®.

Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Cimzia® who are chronic carriers of the virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Cimzia®. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Cimzia® should be closely monitored and in the case of HBV reactivation Cimzia® should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.

TNF antagonists including Cimzia® may increase the risk of new onset or exacerbation of GL-P-CZ-axSpA-1900034 Important Safety Information Cimzia Revised April 2020 * EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic Area clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis; of formation of autoantibodies and uncommonly of the development of a lupuslike syndrome; of severe hypersensitivity reactions. If a patient develops any of these adverse reactions, Cimzia® should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF antagonist cannot be excluded. Rare cases of neurological disorders, including seizure disorder, neuritis and peripheral neuropathy, have been reported in patients treated with Cimzia®.

Adverse reactions of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia, have been reported with Cimzia®. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Cimzia®. Consider discontinuation of Cimzia® therapy in patients with confirmed significant haematological abnormalities.

The use of Cimzia® in combination with anakinra or abatacept is not recommended due to a potential increased risk of serious infections. As no data are available, Cimzia® should not be administered concurrently with live vaccines. The 14-day half-life of Cimzia® should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on Cimzia® should be closely monitored for infections.

Please consult the full prescribing information in relation to other side effects, full safety and

Forward looking statements UCB
This press release may contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “will”, “continue” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and beliefs of management. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial information, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results, financial condition, performance or achievements of UCB, or industry results, to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19, changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB’ efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB’s products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB’s data and systems.

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.

UCB is providing this information, including forward-looking statements, only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release, either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

Additionally, information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

37998,Moderna Prices its COVID-19 Vaccine at $32-$37 per Dose for Smaller Volume Agreements,Moderna prices COVID-19 vaccine at $32-$37 per dose for smaller volume deals,"For smaller volume agreements, the company has priced its COVID-19 vaccine ranging from $32-$37/ dose, higher than the price of Pfizer’s vaccine candidate
 The company is in talks with several countries for supply agreements of its vaccine, adding that it had already received about $400M for supply. The P-III study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted in collaboration with NIH and BARDA with an anticipated completion of enrollment in Sept’2020
 Moderna has received $1B from the US government under a plan to ramp up vaccine development. The company’s vaccine candidate is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing","(Reuters) – Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) said on Wednesday smaller volume agreements for its experimental coronavirus vaccine have been priced in the range of $32 to $37 per dose, higher than the price set by the U.S. deal for Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) vaccine candidate.

 

As the race to develop COVID-19 vaccines reach a decisive stage, with several candidates being tested in pivotal late-stage studies, pricing has come under increasing scrutiny.

“We will be responsible on price well below (its) value during the pandemic,” Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said on a conference call, adding that larger volume agreements for its vaccine will be priced lower.

Last month, the U.S. government struck a deal for an experiment vaccine being developed by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.F) that secures enough vaccine to inoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person. Moderna’s two-dose vaccine regimen would cost between $64 and $74 per person.

Moderna, which has no drugs on the market, has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government under a plan to speed up vaccine development. It has not struck a supply agreement with the United States.

The company said on Wednesday it was in talks with several countries for supply agreements for its vaccine, adding that it had already received about $400 million in deposits for eventual supply.

Moderna said enrolment for its late-stage vaccine study that aims to include 30,000 people is on track to be completed in September.

The company’s vaccine candidate is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing. Effective vaccines are seen as essential to halting a pandemic that has claimed more than 700,000 lives worldwide.

Moderna said last month it plans to price its coronavirus vaccine in a way that ensures broad access and that it did not intend to conduct late-stage trials of the vaccine outside the United States.

Moderna shares fell 5% in early trading on Wednesday.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/moderna.png,Biotech|COVID-19,Moderna,Covid-19 Vaccine,covid-19 | biotech | $32-$37|Covid-19 Vaccine|Dose|Moderna|Prices|Smaller Volume Agreements,publish,6/8/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/moderna-prices-covid-19-vaccine-at-32-37-per-dose-for-smaller-volume-deals/,https://pharmashots.com/37998/moderna-prices-its-covid-19-vaccine-at-32-37-per-dose-for-smaller-volume-agreements/
