– Companies Complete Non-Exclusive Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement for the Development and Commercialization of Alnylam’s Lumasiran and Dicerna’s Nedosiran Investigational Programs for Primary Hyperoxaluria –

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & LEXINGTON, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 6, 2020– Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(Nasdaq: ALNY), and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: DRNA), both leaders in the field of ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapeutics, announced today the formation of a development and commercialization collaboration on investigational RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency-associated liver disease (alpha-1 liver disease). In addition, the companies have completed a cross-license of their respective intellectual property for Alnylam’s lumasiran and Dicerna’s nedosiran investigational programs for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (PH). These agreements will enhance and accelerate Alnylam’s and Dicerna’s ability to bring these orphan product candidates to market.

“We are excited to bring our two leading RNAi therapeutics companies together in our efforts to advance potentially transformative medicines for the treatment of two rare diseases with significant unmet medical need. Specifically, the new agreements allow for Alnylam and Dicerna to join forces in areas of common interest, namely alpha-1 liver disease and primary hyperoxaluria,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “We look forward to collaborating with Dicerna to advance treatments for patients living with alpha-1 liver disease, where Dicerna will lead development and U.S.commercialization while Alnylam retains an ex-U.S. commercialization option, where the company already has the resources and experience to hit the ground running. Moreover, our cross-license agreement for primary hyperoxaluria puts the needs of patients and the patient community first, and ensures freedom to operate for both companies for their respective RNAi therapeutic programs in this ultra-rare orphan disease.”

“These agreements between Alnylam and Dicerna represent biopharma collaboration at its best, unifying the strengths of two leaders in RNAi innovation to rally behind the common goal of delivering much-needed new therapies to patients with rare diseases,” said Douglas M. Fambrough, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Dicerna. “By joining our efforts in alpha-1 liver disease, we believe we can be more strongly assured of bringing forward the therapy with the greatest potential to benefit patients. At the same time, our agreement related to lumasiran and nedosiran clears a path for each company to offer a new and differentiated treatment to patients with PH.”

Under the development and commercialization agreement, Alnylam’s ALN-AAT02 and Dicerna’s DCR-A1AT, investigational RNAi therapeutics, each in Phase 1/2 development, will be explored for the treatment of alpha-1 liver disease. Under the agreement, Dicerna assumes responsibility for both ALN-AAT02 and DCR-A1AT at its cost, and may progress one or both of these investigational medicines through clinical development. Dicerna will select which product candidate(s) to advance in development for the treatment of patients with alpha-1 liver disease. At the completion of Phase 3, Alnylam has the no-cost opportunity to opt-in to commercialize the selected candidate in countries outside the U.S., where it already has a commercialization infrastructure in place. If Alnylam exercises its opt-in right, each party shall pay tiered royalties to the other party based on net product sales generated in its territory at rates dependent on which candidate is commercialized. In the event Alnylam waives its commercialization option, Dicerna will retain worldwide rights to commercialize the selected candidate(s) in exchange for milestones and royalties payable to Alnylam, also at a rate dependent on which candidate is ultimately commercialized.

In a separate agreement, Alnylam and Dicerna granted each other a non-exclusive cross-license to their respective intellectual property related to their PH treatment investigational programs to ensure that each party has the freedom to develop and commercialize its respective product candidate: Alnylam’s lumasiran targeting glycolate oxidase (GO) for the treatment of PH type 1 and Dicerna’s nedosiran targeting lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) for the treatment of PH types 1, 2, and 3. Alnylam’s lumasiran has achieved positive Phase 3 results in the ILLUMINATE-A study and is currently the subject of a rolling new drug application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dicerna’s nedosiran is currently being evaluated in the PHYOX™ clinical development program in patients with PH. The cross-license agreement provides for Alnylam to pay mid- to high-single-digit royalties to Dicerna based on global net sales of lumasiran and for Dicerna to pay low-single-digit royalties to Alnylam on global net sales of nedosiran.

The transaction related to alpha-1 liver disease is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions.

About ALN-AAT02 and DCR-A1AT

ALN-AAT02 and DCR-A1AT are investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutics targeting alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) in development for the treatment of A1AT deficiency-associated liver disease (alpha-1 liver disease). ALN-AAT02 utilizes Alnylam’s enhanced stabilization chemistry plus (ESC+)-GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased selectivity and a wide therapeutic index. DCR-A1AT utilizes Dicerna’s GalXCTM technology, which enables subcutaneous delivery and optimizes the activity of the RNAi pathway so that it operates in the most specific and potent fashion. The safety and efficacy of ALN-AAT02 and DCR-A1AT have not been evaluated by the FDA, EMA or any other health authority.

About Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Liver Disease

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an autosomal disorder that results in disease of the lungs and liver. A1AT is a liver-produced serine proteinase inhibitor with the primary function of protecting the lungs from neutrophil elastase and other irritants that cause inflammation. About 95 percent of people with A1AT deficiency are homozygous and carry two copies of the abnormal Z allele (PiZZ) which expresses the Z-AAT protein. In the liver, misfolding of the mutant Z-AAT protein hinders its normal release into the blood thereby causing it to aggregate in hepatocytes, leading to liver injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are estimated to be approximately 120,000 individuals with the PiZZ mutation in the U.S. and major European countries, and of these, 10 percent or more have an associated liver pathology (alpha-1 liver disease) caused by the aggregates of the misfolded Z-AAT protein. The only treatment options presently available for alpha-1 liver disease patients are supportive care and, in the case of advanced cirrhosis, liver transplantation. RNAi-mediated inhibition of A1AT in people with alpha-1 liver disease may represent a promising new way to treat this rare disease.

About Lumasiran

Lumasiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase (GO), in development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), an ultra-rare life threatening disease. GO is encoded by the hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) gene. Thus, by silencing HAO1and depleting the GO enzyme, lumasiran inhibits production of oxalate – the metabolite that directly contributes to the pathophysiology of PH1. Lumasiran utilizes Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables quarterly subcutaneous maintenance dosing with increased potency and durability and a wide therapeutic index. Lumasiran has received both U.S. and EU Orphan Drug Designations, a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and pediatric rare disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The safety and efficacy of lumasiran have not been evaluated by the FDA, EMA or any other health authority.

About Nedosiran

Nedosiran (formerly referred to as DCR-PHXC) is the only RNAi drug candidate in development for primary hyperoxaluria (PH) types 1, 2 and 3 and is Dicerna’s most advanced product candidate utilizing the proprietary GalXC™ RNAi technology platform. Nedosiran is designed to inhibit the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) enzyme – an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in a common pathway resulting in oxalate overproduction in patients with PH1, PH2 and PH3. Dicerna is evaluating the safety and efficacy of nedosiran in patients with all known forms of PH as part of its PHYOX clinical development program.

About Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH)

PH is an ultra-rare disease with three known types (PH1, PH2 and PH3), each resulting from a mutation in one of three different genes. In patients with PH, excessive oxalate production results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of painful and recurrent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones. Compromised kidney function exacerbates the disease as the excess oxalate can no longer be effectively excreted, resulting in subsequent accumulation and crystallization in bones, eyes, skin, and heart, especially in patients with PH1 and PH2, leading to severe illness and death. Current treatment options are very limited and include frequent renal dialysis or combined organ transplantation of liver and kidney, a procedure with high morbidity that is limited due to organ availability. Although a minority of patients are fully responsive to Vitamin B6 therapy, there are no approved pharmaceutical therapies for PH.

About RNAi

RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s and Dicerna’s RNAi therapeutic platforms, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals

Alnylam (Nasdaq: ALNY) is leading the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare genetic, cardio-metabolic, hepatic infectious, and central nervous system (CNS)/ocular diseases.

GSK to make equity investment of $250 million in Vir
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced they have signed a binding agreement to enter into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
The collaboration will use Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies will leverage GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They will also apply their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.
Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Vir’s unique antibody platform has precedented success in identifying and developing antibodies as treatments for multiple pathogens, and it is highly complementary with our R&D approach to focus on the science of immunology. I am very excited that the talent and passion of our two companies will come together to develop solutions for multiple diseases, including the very promising antibody candidates targeting COVID-19.”
Due to the urgent patient need for COVID-19 solutions, the initial focus of the collaboration will be to accelerate the development of specific antibody candidates identified by the Vir platform, VIR-7831 and VIR-7832, that have demonstrated high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are highly potent in neutralising SARS-CoV-2 in live virus-cellular assays. Subject to regulatory review, the companies plan to proceed directly into a phase 2 clinical trial within the next three to five months.
The collaboration will also utilise Vir’s CRISPR screening and machine learning approach to identify cellular targets whose inhibition can prevent viral infection. Vir has identified multiple potential targets against flu and other respiratory pathogens, as well as hepatitis B virus, and will now focus on SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, the companies have also agreed to conduct research into SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines by coupling GSK’s vaccines technologies and expertise with Vir’s ability to identify neutralising epitopes that are present across entire viral families. These efforts will be additive to other initiatives GSK is advancing to develop a potential vaccine for COVID-19.
George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO, Vir Biotechnology, said: “It is becoming increasingly clear that multiple therapeutic approaches, used in combination or in sequence, will be necessary to stop this coronavirus pandemic. It is likely that the current coronavirus outbreak will not be the last.

– Expanded Indication Provides Additional First-Line Treatment Option for the Approximately 10,000 People with ALK+ NSCLC in Europe –

April 06, 2020 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & OSAKA, Japan–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced that the European Commission (EC) extended the current marketing authorization of ALUNBRIG (brigatinib) to include use as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously not treated with an ALK inhibitor. This decision follows a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on February 27, 2020.

“Patients with ALK+ NSCLC, particularly those who have developed brain metastases, have been in need of additional treatment options that are proven effective in the first-line setting,” said Professor Sanjay Popat, Consultant Medical Oncologist, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. “As brigatinib has shown superiority compared to crizotinib in this setting, including in patients whose disease has spread to the brain, this approval is an important advancement for these patients and gives physicians in the European Union another choice when addressing the needs of ALK+ NSCLC patients.”

“At Takeda, our commitment to patients drives us as we seek to advance care and address the unmet needs of the lung cancer community,” said Teresa Bitetti, President, Global Oncology Business Unit, Takeda. “We are proud of the positive results ALUNBRIG has demonstrated in the first-line setting, including strong overall and intracranial efficacy, and look forward to making ALUNBRIG available to newly diagnosed ALK+ NSCLC patients in Europe.”

“ALK+ NSCLC is a complex and nuanced disease, and people with this form of lung cancer may benefit from the availability of a variety of treatment options,” said Stefania Vallone, President of Lung Cancer Europe (LUCE). “We welcome the availability of additional treatment options that may benefit the European cancer community and patients with this serious and rare form of the disease, with the hope that they will soon be accessible to patients across Europe.”

The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 ALTA-1L trial, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of ALUNBRIG compared to crizotinib in patients with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have not received prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Results from the trial showed ALUNBRIG demonstrated superiority compared to crizotinib with significant anti-tumor activity observed in patients with baseline brain metastases. After more than two years of follow-up, ALUNBRIG reduced the risk of intracranial disease progression or death by 69% in patients with brain metastases at baseline (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.17–0.56), as assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC), and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 76% in patients with brain metastases at baseline (HR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.12–0.45), as assessed by investigators. ALUNBRIG also demonstrated consistent overall efficacy (intent to treat population), with a median progression-free survival (PFS) more than two times longer than that with crizotinib at 24.0 months (95% CI: 18.5–NE) versus 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.2–12.9) for crizotinib, as assessed by BIRC, and 29.4 months (95% CI: 21.2–NE) versus 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4–12.9), as assessed by investigators.

The safety profile of ALUNBRIG in the ALTA-1L trial was generally consistent with the existing European summary of product characteristics (SmPC). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) Grade ≥3 in the ALUNBRIG arm were increased CPK (24.3%), increased lipase (14.0%) and hypertension (11.8%); and for crizotinib were increased ALT (10.2%), AST (6.6%) and lipase (6.6%).

This decision by the European Medicines Agency means that ALUNBRIG is now approved for marketing of this indication in all European Union member states, in addition to Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.

About the ALTA-1L Trial

The Phase 3 ALTA-1L (ALK in Lung Cancer Trial of BrigAtinib in 1st Line) trial of ALUNBRIG in adults is a global, ongoing, randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter trial, which enrolled 275 patients (ALUNBRIG, n=137, crizotinib, n=138) with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have not received prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Patients received either ALUNBRIG, 180 mg once daily with seven-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily, or crizotinib, 250 mg twice daily.

The median age was 58 years in the ALUNBRIG arm and 60 years in the crizotinib arm. Twenty-nine percent of patients had brain metastases at baseline in the ALUNBRIG arm versus 30% in the crizotinib arm. Twenty-six percent of patients received prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease in the ALUNBRIG arm versus 27% in the crizotinib arm.

Blinded independent review committee (BIRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, intracranial ORR, intracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability.

The safety profile of ALUNBRIG in the ALTA-1L trial was generally consistent with the existing European summary of product characteristics (SmPC).

About ALUNBRIG® (brigatinib)

ALUNBRIG is a potent and selective next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that was designed to target and inhibit anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genetic alterations. In April 2017, ALUNBRIG received Accelerated Approval from the U.S. FDA for ALK+ metastatic NSCLC patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. This indication is approved under Accelerated Approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

ALUNBRIG is currently approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Canada and the European Union, for the treatment of people living with ALK+ metastatic NSCLC who have taken the medicine crizotinib, but their NSCLC has worsened or they cannot tolerate taking crizotinib.

ALUNBRIG received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with ALK+ NSCLC whose tumors are resistant to crizotinib and was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC, ROS1+ and EGFR+ NSCLC.

About ALK+ NSCLC

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of the estimated 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed each year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.1,2 Genetic studies indicate that chromosomal rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are key drivers in a subset of NSCLC patients.3Approximately three to five percent of patients with metastatic NSCLC have a rearrangement in the ALK gene.4,5,6

Takeda is committed to continuing research and development in NSCLC to improve the lives of the approximately 40,000 patients diagnosed with this serious and rare form of lung cancer worldwide each year.7

ALUNBRIG® (brigatinib): GLOBAL IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of ALUNBRIG is contraindicated

SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE

Pulmonary Adverse Reactions: Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions, including those with features consistent with ILD/pneumonitis, has been reported with ALUNBRIG. Most pulmonary adverse reactions were observed within the first 7 days of treatment. Grade 1-2 pulmonary adverse reactions resolved with interruption of treatment or dose modification. Increased age and shorter interval (less than 7 days) between the last dose of crizotinib and the first dose of ALUNBRIG were independently associated with an increased rate of these pulmonary adverse reactions. Consider these factors when initiating treatment with ALUNBRIG. Some patients experienced pneumonitis later in treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.) in the first week of treatment. Promptly investigate signs of pneumonitis in any patient with worsening respiratory symptoms. If pneumonitis is suspected, withhold ALUNBRIG, and evaluate patient for other symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia).

Hypertension has been reported with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure regularly during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Treat hypertension according to standard guidelines to control blood pressure. Monitor heart rate more frequently in patients if concomitant use of a medicinal product known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided. For severe hypertension (≥ Grade 3), ALUNBRIG should be withheld until hypertension has recovered to Grade 1 or to baseline. The dose should be modified accordingly.

Bradycardia has been reported with ALUNBRIG. Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If symptomatic bradycardia occurs, withhold ALUNBRIG and evaluate concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia. If a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified and discontinued or dose adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia; otherwise, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia. In case of life-threatening bradycardia, if no contributing concomitant medication is identified or in case of recurrence, discontinue ALUNBRIG.

Visual Disturbance was reported with ALUNBRIG. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with new or worsening visual symptoms.

Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation has been reported with ALUNBRIG. Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Monitor CPK levels regularly during treatment. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, and if associated with muscle pain or weakness, treatment with brigatinib should be withheld, and the dose modified accordingly.

Pancreatic Enzyme Elevation: Elevations of amylase and lipase have been reported with ALUNBRIG. Monitor lipase and amylase regularly. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Based on the severity of the laboratory abnormalities, treatment with brigatinib should be withheld, and the dose modified accordingly.

Hyperglycemia: Elevations of serum glucose have occurred in patients treated with ALUNBRIG. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of ALUNBRIG and monitor periodically thereafter. Antihyperglycemic medications should be initiated or optimized as needed. If cannot control hyperglycemia with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved. Upon recovery, consider reducing the ALUNBRIG dose or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 25%) reported in patients treated with ALUNBRIG at the recommended dosing regimen were increased AST, increased CPK, hyperglycaemia, increased lipase, hyperinsulinaemia, anaemia, diarrhea, increased ALT, increased amylase, anemia, nausea, fatigue, hypophosphatemia, decreased lymphocyte count, cough, rash, increased alkaline phosphatas, increased APTT, myalgia, headache, hypertension, white blood count decreased, dyspnea and vomiting.

The most common serious adverse reactions (2%) reported in patients treated with ALUNBRIG at the recommended dosing regimen other than events related to neoplasm progression included pneumonitis, pneumonia, and dyspnoea.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of ALUNBRIG with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG. After discontinuation of strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume ALUNBRIG dose tolerated prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. No dose adjustment is required for ALUNBRIG in combination with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Monitor patients closely when coadminister ALUNBRIG with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice as it may also increase plasma concentrations of ALUNBRIG. Concomitant use of ALUNBRIG with moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, resume ALUNBRIG at the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the moderate CYP3A inhibitor.

CYP2C8 Inhibitors: No dose adjustment is required for ALUNBRIG when coadministered with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors

P-gp and BCRP Inhibitors: No dose adjustment is required for ALUNBRIG coadministered with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors.

CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of ALUNBRIG with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, the dose of ALUNBRIG may be increased in 30 mg increments after 7 days of treatment with the current dose as tolerated, up to a maximum of twice the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the moderate CYP3A inducer. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inducer, resume the dose of ALUNBRIG to the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the moderate CYP3A inducer.

CYP3A Substrates: Clinical drug-drug interaction studies with sensitive CYP3A substrates have not been conducted. ALUNBRIG may reduce plasma concentrations of coadministered and induce other enzymes and transporters (e.g., CYP2C, P-gp).

Transporter Substrates: ALUNBRIG inhibits P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1, and MATE2K in vitro. Coadministration of ALUNBRIG Transporter substrates may increase their plasma concentrations. Monitored patients closely when coadminister ALUNBRIG with substrates of these transporters with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, methotrexate).

SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS

Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females: Advised women of childbearing age not to become pregnant and advise men not to father a child during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Advised women of reproductive potential to use effective non hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advised men with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG.

Pregnancy: ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. ALUNBRIG should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment. If used during pregnancy, or if patient becomes pregnant while taking ALUNBRIG, advise patient of the potential harm to fetus.

Breast feeding: There are no data regarding the secretion of ALUNBRIG in human milk. Breastfeed should be stopped during treatment with ALUNBRIG.

Infertility: ALUNBRIG may cause reduced fertility in males.

Elderly Patients: The limited data on the safety and efficacy of ALUNBRIG in patients aged 65 years and older suggest that a dose adjustment is not required in elderly patients. There are no available data on patients over 85 years of age.

Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment of ALUNBRIG is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class A) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class B). Reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG by approximately 50% (i.e., from 180 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg) for patients with severe renal impairment

Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment of ALUNBRIG is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min). The dose of brigatinib should be reduced by approximately 40% (i.e., from 180 mg to 120 mg, 120 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg) for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C

Pediatric Patients: The safety and efficacy of ALUNBRIG in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

ALUNBRIG IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (U.S.)

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have occurred with ALUNBRIG. In Trial ALTA (ALTA), ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group (90 mg once daily) and 9.1% of patients in the 90→180 mg group (180 mg once daily with 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily). Adverse reactions consistent with possible ILD/pneumonitis occurred early (within 9 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG; median onset was 2 days) in 6.4% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.7%. Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.), particularly during the first week of initiating ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG in any patient with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis or other causes of respiratory symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia). For Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis, either resume ALUNBRIG with dose reduction after recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis or recurrence of Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis.

Hypertension: In ALTA, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients in the 90 mg group who received ALUNBRIG and 21% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 5.9% of patients overall. Control blood pressure prior to treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy. Upon resolution or improvement to Grade 1 severity, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose. Consider permanent discontinuation of treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 hypertension or recurrence of Grade 3 hypertension. Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with antihypertensive agents that cause bradycardia.

Bradycardia: Bradycardia can occur with ALUNBRIG. In ALTA, heart rates less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) occurred in 5.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 7.6% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 2 bradycardia occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient in the 90 mg group. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor patients more frequently if concomitant use of drug known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided. For symptomatic bradycardia, withhold ALUNBRIG and review concomitant medications for those known to cause bradycardia. If a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified and discontinued or dose adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia; otherwise, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia. Discontinue ALUNBRIG for life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified.

Visual Disturbance: In ALTA, adverse reactions leading to visual disturbance including blurred vision, diplopia, and reduced visual acuity, were reported in 7.3% of patients treated with ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 10% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 macular edema and cataract occurred in one patient each in the 90→180 mg group. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with new or worsening visual symptoms of Grade 2 or greater severity. Upon recovery of Grade 2 or Grade 3 visual disturbances to Grade 1 severity or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose.

VANCOUVER, Washington, April 07, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — CytoDyn Inc. (OTC.QB: CYDY), (“CytoDyn” or the “Company”), a late-stage biotechnology company developing leronlimab (PRO 140), a CCR5 antagonist with the potential for multiple therapeutic indications, announced today that it is collaborating with the U.K.’s Department
of Health to provide emergency access to leronlimab, the Company’s investigational medicine for COVID-19. The submission to Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA), an executive agency of the U.K. government sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Care, is expected to be made soon to include clinical trial sites in the
U.K. Representatives from the U.K. are coordinating with CytoDyn’s full-service international clinical research organization, Amarex Clinical Research, to prepare the requisite clinical
agreements and to prepare for timely delivery of leronlimab.
The FDA recently cleared the Company to initiate a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients for which enrollment is now underway. The Phase 2b/3 trial for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients is for 390 patients, double blinded with 2:1 ratio (active drug to placebo ratio). Patients enrolled in this trial are expected to be administered leronlimab for two weeks with the primary endpoint being the mortality rate at 28 days and a secondary endpoint of mortality rate at 14 days. The Company will perform an interim
analysis on the data from 50 patients.
CytoDyn has initiated enrollment in a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 population in the U.S. and is enrolling in a Phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial for severe and critically ill COVID-19 population.
Nader Pourhassan, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of CytoDyn said, “We are humbled by the outpouring of inquiries and requests for access to leronlimab and are
working around the clock with our many partners to facilitate access to a potential therapeutic benefit for COVID-19 patients.” Pourhassan concluded that, ”We are working
with our CRO partner, Amarex Clinical Research, to establish similar expanded access (emergency use) programs for leronlimab for the treatment of COVID-19 with other
governmental regulatory authorities. The Amarex team is leading the clinical trial management and conduct of both Phase 2 and Phase 2b/3 projects and has done an exceptional job leading our clinical development initiative for leronlimab for the treatment of
COVID-19.”
Separately, Dr. Pourhassan will appear on Fox Business Network on April 7 at 11:00 am PT to provide a full update on the CytoDyn’s two clinical trials for COVID-19, a Phase 2 trial for
those patients with mild-to-moderate indications and a Phase 2b/3 trial for severe and critically ill patients.
About Coronavirus Disease 2019
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 disease is uncertain,
and the virus is highly contagious. COVID-19 typically transmits person to person through respiratory droplets, commonly resulting from coughing, sneezing, and close personal
contact. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals. For confirmed COVID-19 infections, symptoms have
included fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Clinical manifestations in patients
have ranged from non-existent to severe and fatal. At this time, there are minimal treatment options for COVID-19.
About Leronlimab (PRO 140)
The FDA has granted a “Fast Track” designation to CytoDyn for two potential indications of leronlimab for deadly diseases. The first as a combination therapy with HAART for HIVinfected patients and the second is for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Leronlimab is an investigational humanized IgG4 mAb that blocks CCR5, a cellular receptor that is important in HIV infection, tumor metastases, and other diseases, including NASH. Leronlimab has completed nine clinical trials in over 800 people, including meeting its primary endpoints in a pivotal Phase 3 trial (leronlimab in combination with standard antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected treatment-experienced patients).
In the setting of HIV/AIDS, leronlimab is a viral-entry inhibitor; it masks CCR5, thus protecting healthy T cells from viral infection by blocking the predominant HIV (R5) subtype
from entering those cells. Leronlimab has been the subject of nine clinical trials, each of which demonstrated that leronlimab could significantly reduce or control HIV viral load in
humans. The leronlimab antibody appears to be a powerful antiviral agent leading to potentially fewer side effects and less frequent dosing requirements compared with daily
drug therapies currently in use.
In the setting of cancer, research has shown that CCR5 may play a role in tumor invasion, metastases, and tumor microenvironment control. Increased CCR5 expression is an
indicator of disease status in several cancers. Published studies have shown that blocking CCR5 can reduce tumor metastases in laboratory and animal models of aggressive breast
and prostate cancer. Leronlimab reduced human breast cancer metastasis by more than 98% in a murine xenograft model. CytoDyn is, therefore, conducting a Phase 1b/2 human
clinical trial in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and was granted Fast Track designation in May 2019.
The CCR5 receptor appears to play a central role in modulating immune cell trafficking to sites of inflammation. It may be crucial in the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and other inflammatory conditions. Clinical studies by others further support the concept that blocking CCR5 using a chemical inhibitor can reduce the clinical impact of acute GvHD without significantly affecting the engraftment of transplanted bone marrow stem cells. CytoDyn is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical study with leronlimab to support further the concept that the CCR5 receptor on engrafted cells is critical for the development of acute GvHD, blocking the CCR5 receptor from recognizing specific immune
signaling molecules is a viable approach to mitigating acute GvHD. The FDA has granted “orphan drug” designation to leronlimab for the prevention of GvHD.
About CytoDyn
CytoDyn is a late-stage biotechnology company developing innovative treatments for multiple therapeutic indications based on leronlimab, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CCR5 receptor. CCR5 appears to play a critical role in the ability of HIV to enter and infect healthy T-cells. The CCR5 receptor also appears to be implicated in tumor metastasis and immune-mediated illnesses, such as GvHD and NASH. CytoDyn has successfully completed a Phase 3 pivotal trial with leronlimab in combination with standard
antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected treatment-experienced patients. CytoDyn plans to seek FDA approval for leronlimab in combination therapy and plans to complete the filing of
a Biologics License Application (BLA) in April of 2020 for that indication. CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 3 investigative trial with leronlimab as a once-weekly monotherapy for HIV-infected patients. CytoDyn plans to initiate a registration-directed study of leronlimab monotherapy indication. If successful, it could support a label extension. Clinical results to date from multiple trials have shown that leronlimab can significantly reduce viral burden in people infected with HIV with no reported drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs).
Moreover, a Phase 2b clinical trial demonstrated that leronlimab monotherapy can prevent viral escape in HIV-infected patients; some patients on leronlimab monotherapy have
remained virally suppressed for more than five years. CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 2 trial to evaluate leronlimab for the prevention of GvHD and a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial with leronlimab in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. More information is at www.cytodyn.com.

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted and granted priority review for a new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy. The application seeks accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA monotherapy for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with tissue tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) ≥10 mutations/megabase, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of June 16, 2020.

“From the start, biomarker research has been a critical aspect of our clinical program evaluating KEYTRUDA monotherapy,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “TMB has been an area of scientific interest to help identify patients most likely to benefit from KEYTRUDA. We look forward to working with the FDA throughout the review process to help bring KEYTRUDA monotherapy to patients with cancer in the second-line or higher treatment setting, where options remain limited.”

The application was based in part on results from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial, which also supported Merck’s 2017 FDA approval for KEYTRUDA as the first cancer treatment based on a biomarker, regardless of cancer type, in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors. MSI-H is on the highest end of the TMB spectrum. Data from KEYNOTE-158 on the TMB-H patient population were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 Congress.

About KEYNOTE-158

KEYNOTE-158 (NCT02628067) is a multicenter, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label trial evaluating KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks) in patients with solid tumors. Tissue TMB status was determined using the Foundation Medicine, Inc. FoundationOne®CDx assay. Tumor response was assessed every nine weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by independent, central, blinded radiographic review. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Roche has submitted filing applications for risdiplam in seven countries with submission in China imminent
Risdiplam is being investigated in infants, children and adults with Type 1, 2 or 3 SMA

Basel, 07 April 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for its review of the New Drug Application (NDA) of risdiplam with a decision expected by August 24, 2020. The extension is a result of the recent submission of additional data by Roche, including data from the pivotal SUNFISH Part 2 study, in close collaboration with the FDA. These data were recently presented at the 2nd International Scientific and Clinical Congress on Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

In November 2019, the FDA granted Priority Review for risdiplam with a decision for approval expected by May 24, 2020. In February 2020, based on discussions with the FDA, Roche submitted additional data which could help ensure access to risdiplam for a broad range of people living with the condition, if approved. This included 12-month efficacy and safety data from the pivotal SUNFISH Part 2 study (n=180), the only placebo-controlled study ever undertaken in people aged 2-25 years with Type 2 or 3 SMA. Given the volume of additional data submitted, the FDA requires more time for review.

“We strongly believe in the potential of risdiplam as a new therapeutic option and recognize that unmet need remains in the treatment of SMA,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We are working closely with the FDA to support the review of risdiplam. Our goal is to bring this therapy to infants, children and adults living with SMA as quickly as possible.”

As part of our continued commitment to people living with SMA, Roche is pleased to announce that we have also submitted in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan. Filing in China is imminent and we are currently on track to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency in mid-2020 as well as other international markets.

Roche leads the clinical development of risdiplam, an investigational, orally administered survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA, as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics. Risdiplam is being studied in a broad clinical trial programme in SMA, with patients ranging from birth to 60 years old, and includes patients previously treated with other SMA-targeting therapies. The clinical trial population is designed to represent the broad, real-world spectrum of people living with this disease with the aim of ensuring access for all appropriate patients.

About SMA
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications. It is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately one in 11,000 babies. SMA leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

SMA is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that results in a deficiency of SMN protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests SMA is a multi-system disorder and the loss of SMN protein may affect many tissues and cells, which can stop the body from functioning.

About risdiplam
Risdiplam is an investigational survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA and is an orally administered liquid. It is designed to durably increase and sustain SMN protein levels both throughout the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues of the body. It is being evaluated for its potential ability to help the SMN2 gene produce more functional SMN protein throughout the body.

Risdiplam is currently being evaluated in four multicentre trials in people with SMA:

SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.
FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants. The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 24 months, followed by an open-label extension. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 is to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds).
JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial in people with SMA aged 6 months–60 years who have been previously treated with SMA-directed therapies. The study has completed recruitment.RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.

 The ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 vaccine is anticipated to be the UK’s first COVID-19 vaccine in clinical studies to be initiated in later Apr’2020. The consortium has recruited individuals aged 18-55yrs. from the Thames Valley area in the UK to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine
 Oxford Biomedica will allow the consortium access to its large scale GMP manufacturing facilities for viral vectors, including its new Oxbox facility. ChAdOx1 is based on adenoviral vector technology and has demonstrated positive results in pre/ clinical studies conducted to date","Consortium led by Jenner Institute, University of Oxford 
Fast-tracked clinical trial of ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 vaccine candidate starts this month

Oxford, UK – 8th April, 2020: Oxford Biomedica plc (LSE:OXB) (“Oxford Biomedica” or “the Group”), a leading gene and cell therapy group, announced today it has joined a Consortium led by the Jenner Institute, Oxford University, to rapidly develop, scale-up and manufacture a potential vaccine candidate for COVID-19, called ChAdOx1 nCov-19. This vaccine candidate is one of the leading vaccine candidates currently in development globally, and is expected to be the UK’s first COVID-19 vaccine in clinical trials later this month. The Consortium is led by the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford and also includes the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), Pall Life Sciences, Cobra Biologics and Halix BV.

The Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group have recruited individuals aged 18-55 from the Thames Valley area in the UK to study the vaccine’s safety and efficacy (see https://www.covid19vaccinetrial.co.uk/). Oxford Biomedica will provide access to its large scale GMP manufacturing facilities for viral vectors, including its new Oxbox facility, to the Consortium as required, which, along with other Consortium manufacturing partners in the UK and internationally, would allow for scaled manufacturing capacity should the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate be confirmed in clinical trials.

The Oxford vaccine candidate relies on adenoviral vector technology, ChAdOx1, developed at the Jenner Institute, in Oxford. It is seen as one of the most promising vaccine technologies for COVID-19 as ChAdOx1 has been shown to generate a strong immune response from one dose and it has demonstrated a good safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical trials conducted to date. No financial terms were disclosed.

John Dawson, Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Biomedica, said: “As an established clinical and commercial manufacturer of viral vectors, we are very pleased to be in a strong position in terms of capacity and capabilities to support the important and urgent efforts of the Consortium led by the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, to develop and scale up manufacturing of this promising vaccine candidate for COVID-19.

“While our current activities on this vaccine candidate are just initiating, should the Consortium confirm there is promise for this candidate in the clinical trial initiating this month, we will play our role within the Consortium to scale up manufacturing as fast as possible. This will help to provide significant access to the vaccine candidate for further clinical trials and potentially, if approved for use, for many people in the UK and beyond.”

30484,Bayer Launches Eylea (aflibercept) Pre-Filled Syringe in Europe,Bayer launches pre-filled syringe to administer eye medication Eylea in Europe,"The EMA has approved Bayer’s Eylea® (aflibercept) injection pre-filled syringe with the EC’s decision applies to all 27 EU member states as well as the UK, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein
 The P-IV ALTAIR study assessing Eylea (aflibercept) with T&E dosing regimens in patients with wet AMD, demonstrated a reduction in injection burden, i.e. up to 60% patients were able to achieve injection intervals of @3mos. (12wks. interval) or >40% achieved injection intervals of 4mos.(16wks. interval)
 Eylea is a VEGF inhibitor targeting VEGF-A and PLGF, formulated as an injection for the eye, act by blocking the growth of new blood vessels and by decreasing vascular permeability in the eye and is approved therapy for wet AMD, macular edema following RVO, DME and myopic CNV","Berlin, April 8, 2020 – The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted approval for the new Eylea® (aflibercept) injection pre-filled syringe. This new presentation provides ophthalmologists with a more efficient and convenient way to administer EYLEA across all approved indications, as the pre-filled syringe requires fewer steps to prepare compared to the intravitreal injection procedure of the existing vial. The EC decision is applicable to all 27 European Union member states as well as the UK, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

“Eylea is the only approved anti-VEGF therapy successfully extended up to four-month (16 weeks) treatment intervals in clinical trials, and consistently delivers excellent outcomes to reduce preventable vision loss,” said Dr. Michael Devoy, Head of Medical Affairs & Pharmacovigilance of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceuticals Division and Bayer Chief Medical Officer. “Together with the new pre-filled syringe presentation, which promises to benefit both physicians and patients, Bayer maintains its position as a leader in this field”.

Bayer has recently published the results from the Phase IV ALTAIR study, which confirmed the effectiveness of Eylea® (aflibercept) with Treat and Extend (T&E) dosing regimens in wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The promising results demonstrated a considerable injection burden reduction, since up to 60% patients were able to achieve injection intervals of three-months (12-week interval) or more whilst more than 40% achieved injection intervals of four-months (16-week interval). Eylea is the only approved anti-VEGF to successfully extend to 16-week treatment intervals in clinical trials.

Bayer and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating on the global development of aflibercept. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to Eylea in the U.S. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of Eylea, except for Japan where Regeneron receives a percentage of net sales. In August 2019, Regeneron received U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the pre-filled syringe for Eylea.

About Eylea® (aflibercept solution for injection into the eye) and VEGF
Eylea has been approved in approximately 100 countries (ex U.S.) for five indications for adults, which includes the treatment of neovascular wet AMD and the treatment of visual impairment due to: macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO; branch RVO or central RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (myopic CNV). Over 31 million vials of Eylea have been sold since its launch worldwide, resulting in over four million patient-years of experience.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a naturally occurring protein in the body. Its normal role in a healthy organism is to trigger formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) supporting the growth of the body’s tissues and organs. It is also associated with the growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the eye, which exhibit abnormal increased permeability that leads to edema.

Aflibercept solution for injection is a recombinant fusion protein, consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 and formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and Placental Growth Factor (PGF) and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of their cognate VEGF receptors.

Additionally, if REGN1979 is approved, Zai Lab will leverage its capabilities to commercialize REGN1979 in this region. REGN1979 is the most advanced investigational bispecific monoclonal antibody from Regeneron’s bispecific platform and is designed to trigger tumor killing by linking and activating a cytotoxic T-cell (binding to CD3) to a lymphoma cell (binding to CD20).

Under the terms of the agreement, Regeneron will receive a $30 million upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $160 million in additional regulatory and sales milestones. Zai Lab will contribute to the global development costs for REGN1979 for certain trials and will receive the rights to develop and exclusively commercialize REGN1979 in oncology in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Additionally, Zai Lab will make payments to Regeneron based on net sales, such that Regeneron shares in a significant portion of any potential profits. Regeneron will be responsible for the manufacture and supply of REGN1979 for development and commercialization in the region.

“Zai Lab is an ideal collaborator for us, with an established and respected track record that aligns with our mission to use the power of science to repeatedly bring new medicines to patients with serious diseases,” said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Clinical and Translational Sciences for Oncology at Regeneron. “Zai’s support will not only help bolster enrollment into global REGN1979 trials, but will also enable this promising investigational medicine to reach patients faster in this key region, if approved.”

“Regeneron is a global leader in the research and development of innovative medicines, and we are delighted to collaborate on the investigational bispecific antibody REGN1979 as we expand our oncology franchise into hematologic cancers,” said Samantha Du, Ph.D., Founder, Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer at Zai Lab. “Zai looks forward to contributing significantly to the success of REGN1979 with our regulatory and clinical expertise, and commercial footprint in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. We are committed to collaborating with Regeneron to expand its global effort and bring innovative medicines to patients with unmet medical needs.”

REGN1979 was granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). REGN1979 is currently being investigated as a treatment for late stages of FL, DLBCL and other lymphomas in a Phase 1 trial as well as a potentially registrational Phase 2 trial. Positive data for REGN1979 from the Phase 1 trial were last shared at the 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.

About the Regeneron Bispecific Antibody Platform
All of Regeneron’s bispecifics are designed to closely resemble natural human antibodies and bind to two different targets. They are derived from a next-generation version of Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology that utilizes a proprietary genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human antibodies and further created using the company’s Veloci-Bi® platform. These allow for the creation of bispecifics with no linkers or artificial sequences. Additionally, Regeneron bispecifics are manufactured using similar approaches used for human antibody medicines, with similar pharmacokinetics.

VelocImmune has been used to create multiple antibodies including Dupixent® (dupilumab), Praluent® (alirocumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) and Kevzara® (sarilumab), which are approved in multiple countries around the world. Regeneron previously used these technologies to rapidly develop a treatment for Ebola virus infection, which is currently under review by the FDA, and is now being used in efforts to create prophylactic and treatment medicines for COVID-19.

There are six Regeneron investigational bispecific antibodies currently in ongoing clinical trials for multiple blood cancers and solid tumors. These bispecifics fall into three categories:

CD3 bispecifics are designed to bridge T-cells and tumor cells. At the tumor site, they activate T-cells via their CD3 receptors and promote T-cell killing of the cancer cells. Investigational candidates include:
° CD20xCD3 (REGN1979) for non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas;
° Two distinct BCMAxCD3s (REGN5458 and REGN5459) for multiple myeloma;
° MUC16xCD3 (REGN4018) for ovarian cancer.
CD28 costimulatory bispecifics are also designed to bridge T-cells and tumor cells. At the tumor site, they costimulate T-cells via their CD28 receptors and may synergize with PD-1 inhibitors and/or CD3 bispecifics. Investigational candidates include:
° PSMAxCD28 (REGN5678) in combination with Libtayo for prostate cancer.
Tumor-targeted bispecifics are designed to target proteins only on the cancer cell. In this way, they may affect various signaling pathways to hamper the cancer cell’s ability to survive and proliferate. Investigational candidates include:
° METxMET (REGN5093) for non-small cell lung cancer that is driven by MET mutations and/or amplifications. REGN5093 targets two different parts of the MET receptor on cancer cells to degrade the receptor and block its ability to trigger cell proliferation.
Regulatory Status of Regeneron Oncology Programs
The bispecifics mentioned in this press release are currently under clinical development, and their safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Libtayo in combination with REGN5678 is currently under clinical development for prostate cancer, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority for this use. Libtayo is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation, and in other countries for similar indications. In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

As part of a global collaboration agreement, Regeneron and Sanofi are jointly developing Libtayo, as well as Regeneron’s BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 bispecific programs.

About B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in China
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) represent a diverse group of cancers that originate from B-, T- or natural killer-cells, with annual incidence and death rates in China of more than 88,000 and 48,000, respectively, as of 2018. NHL originating in B-cells (B-NHL) make up 85% of all NHL cases, with the two most common subtypes being DLBCL and FL.

DLBCL is an aggressive form of B-NHL with up to 50% of patients with advanced stage disease progressing after first-line treatment (e.g., relapsing or becoming refractory to treatment). For patients with R/R DLBCL, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor.

FL is a slow-growing (indolent) form of B-NHL with most cases diagnosed in advanced stages. Although median survival ranges from 8 to 15 years in advanced FL, current therapeutic options are not curative, and most patients relapse within 5 years regardless of the regimen. In some cases, FL can transform into DLBCL, at which point it is often treated in the same way as DLBCL.

30505,The US FDA will Approve a New Pathway for Biosimilars,Insulin Gains New Pathway to Increased Competition,"The EMA’s CHMP has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Nepexto, a biosimilar referencing Enbrel (etanercept), for all indications of the reference product including RA, JIA, PsA, axSpA (including AS and nr-axSpA), PsO and pediatric PsO
 The positive opinion is based on biosimilarity assessment which included pre/ clinical studies demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference product. Additionally, the P-III clinical study demonstrated the equivalence of Nepexto to the Enbrel in patients with mod. to sev. RA
 The EC will review the CHMP’s positive opinion with its anticipated approval in May’2020. In Jun’2018, the companies collaborated to commercialize Nepexton in multiple global markets","Today is a historic day and a landmark moment for patients with diabetes and other serious medical conditions, as insulin and certain other biologic drugs transition to a different regulatory pathway. This regulatory transition, mandated by Congress and implemented by the FDA, is incredibly important for patients. For the first time, a pathway will be open for products that are proposed as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, the transitioned products. The availability of safe and effective biosimilar and interchangeable versions of these treatments, including insulin, is expected to increase patient access, adding more choices and potentially reducing costs of these vital therapies.
Biologic drugs, including insulin, treat some of the most serious diseases and conditions. The drugs transitioning today are used in the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of many of these conditions, including diabetes, respiratory distress syndrome, fertility conditions, Cushing’s syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, Gaucher disease and many more. But these life-saving drugs often also contribute significantly to drug costs. Historically, it was more difficult to develop generic versions of these drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act due to scientific challenges and limitations on the scope of data that can be relied upon in a generic drug application. This framework contributed to limited competition for these drugs, resulting in fewer choices and higher prices for patients. Today’s transition opens a new pathway for manufacturers to seek FDA approval of and bring biosimilar and interchangeable versions of insulin and other transitioning products to market, facilitating greater competition.
When Congress created the biosimilars pathway in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, Congress also created a 10-year timeline for stakeholders to prepare for the regulatory transition of biological products that were historically regulated under the FD&C Act; now that the day has arrived, the FDA can begin receiving applications for proposed biosimilars to these licensed transition biological products, including insulin products that millions of Americans rely on every day to maintain stable blood glucose. Approved biosimilars will be able to come to market, where there is incredible potential to reduce health care costs, as has been seen with increased generic drug offerings. On the generic drugs side, we know from an FDA analysis that even with one generic on the market, prices are 31 to 39% lower than before the generic competition. Similarly, biosimilars marketed in the U.S. typically have launched with initial list prices 15 to 35% lower than comparative list prices of the reference products.
Over the last 10 years, the FDA has worked hard to establish a strong framework for the biosimilar and interchangeable regulatory pathway, as well as providing clarity to all involved on what the transition means to them and how it may affect our many stakeholders. Our Biosimilars Action Plan was established to improve the efficiency of the biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval process and to maximize scientific and regulatory clarity for the biosimilar product development community. Through this action plan, we’ve worked to support robust competition from biosimilars, including supporting market competition and providing clear direction to industry on many relevant topics leading up to the transition.
In just the last six months, we’ve taken several important actions on biosimilars, and in preparation for this transition, including partnering with the Federal Trade Commission regarding efforts to address false or misleading statements and promotional communications by biologic product manufacturers, deter anti-competitive business practices and support a competitive marketplace for biosimilars; issuing a final rule, draft guidance and final guidances to provide clarity to industry; providing information for patients and health care providers about what the transition means to them; and expanding and digitizing the FDA’s database of FDA-licensed biological products, otherwise known as the Purple Book.
These actions, among the many others we’ve taken in this space, reflect the tireless work of our dedicated workforce to ensure a smooth regulatory transition and provide clarity for biosimilar developers. We stand ready to review incoming applications from industry. We will also continue to work closely with those interested in producing biosimilar and interchangeable products to support efficiency in development, review and approval of these medicines.
Today is a milestone for the future of insulin and other important treatments – potentially a new era of proposed biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. We expect this regulatory transition to enable a vibrant competitive market for transitioning products, ultimately empowering patients by increasing choices and potentially lowering prices of safe, effective, high-quality medications.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Internal research efforts

More than 50 virology, protein engineering, clinical and bioprocess experts across BioPharmaceuticals R&D and Operations are working on this effort, using proprietary antibody discovery technology that was previously developed under an agreement with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of the Pandemic Preparedness Platform programme. As part of the DARPA programme, the technology enabled AstraZeneca scientists to rapidly discover potential therapeutic antibodies for influenza-A in less than 60 days.

Through our scientific expertise in infectious disease and antibody discovery and development, we have rapidly mobilised our research efforts to help respond to the COVID-19 global pandemic. By partnering with government and academia, our ambition is to accelerate the discovery and development of a safe and effective antibody treatment to help fight COVID-19.

Collaborating with government and academia

In addition to internal research and development, AstraZeneca is collaborating with government and academic experts to evaluate additional promising candidates for future clinical use.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences (China) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (US) are providing AstraZeneca with genetic sequences for antibodies they have discovered against SARS2-CoV-2 for further in silico and in vitro assessment.

Via collaborations with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine, promising antibodies from AstraZeneca, discovered through its internal research efforts and collaborations, will undergo preclinical safety and efficacy assessment in the organisations’ biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories.

The company is also in discussion with governments to support clinical development and manufacturing capabilities.
Researching treatments for COVID-19

There are currently no specific treatments for COVID-19. Researchers across the world, including AstraZeneca, are investigating preventative approaches and treatment options for COVID-19, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and antivirals, as well as investigating the repurposing of existing drugs to treat the infection.

A vaccine is a prophylaxis, or preventative, approach against disease. Vaccines require an immunisation and a healthy immune system; they have the potential to provide long-term protection against the virus, though it is estimated that it could take at least a year before a vaccine against COVID-19 is approved.

Monoclonal antibodies synthesised in the laboratory mimic natural antibodies. It is hoped that an antibody-based treatment could neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus, in theory, be given as a preventative option for those exposed to the virus, as well as treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected by the virus. An antibody-based treatment has the potential to provide immediate effect in the patient.

At AstraZeneca, we have a long history of, and deep expertise in discovering and developing antibody-based treatments for a range of diseases. The proprietary technology we are using to identify novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies has already been pressure-tested against influenza-A in response to the DARPA P3 programme. Harnessing these capabilities, our scientists are working tirelessly and collaboratively, hoping we can contribute to putting an end to this crisis as fast as we can.

Mark EsserVice President, Microbial Sciences, BioPharmaceuticals R&D
The process of discovering an antibody-based treatment

AstraZeneca scientists are exploring three potential sources for antibodies against the SARS CoV-2 virus – patients who have recovered from COVID-19, immunised humanised mice and laboratory techniques such as phage display.

The spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the primary target being explored for potential COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies. The aim is that by targeting the spike protein, the antibody will be able to neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus and affect its capacity to infect healthy cells.

AstraZeneca is harnessing its proprietary immune replica technology, developed as part of the abovementioned agreement with DARPA, which can capture and screen antibodies from millions of primary B cells. The company is also utilising hybridoma technology, which is a method for producing large numbers of monoclonal antibodies through a culture of hybrid cells that results from the fusion of B cells and immortal myeloma cells.

Once identified, the monoclonal antibodies are screened against their ability to bind to the spike protein before further developability tests are carried out. AstraZeneca is aiming for clinical evaluation in the next 3 to 5 months.

 BOTOX is a neurotoxin therapy injected in the muscles to treat increased muscle stiffness & eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm)","NEWARK, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: RVNC), a biotechnology company pioneering new innovations in neuromodulator products for aesthetic and therapeutic indications, today provided a corporate and product pipeline update and shared anticipated milestones for 2020. The company also announced that its unaudited January 3, 2020 cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance was $306.1 million.
Corporate Updates

Acceptance of BLA Submission for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (DAXI) in Glabellar Lines Expected Q1 2020 – In November 2019, Revance submitted its Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for DAXI in the treatment of moderate-to-severe frown lines. In the Phase 3 pivotal program, the median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity was 24 weeks and the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity was approximately 28 weeks. Revance anticipates acceptance of the submission in the first quarter and projects potential approval in the fourth quarter of 2020. Subject to approval, the company plans to initiate commercialization activities before year end.
New Phase 2 Trial Initiated for Treatment of Full Upper Face – In December 2019, Revance initiated a new open-label Phase 2 trial for treatment of the full upper face – glabellar (frown), lateral canthal (crow’s feet), and forehead lines combined. This trial is being conducted to understand the safety and efficacy, including potential dosing and injection patterns, of DAXI, covering the full upper face. The company expects completion of enrollment in first quarter, with topline results in fourth quarter of 2020. This trial is in addition to the existing open-label Phase 2 clinical trials that the company has already fully enrolled in forehead lines and crow’s feet.
Enrollment Completed in Phase 2 Plantar Fasciitis Trial – In December 2019, Revance enrolled the last of 155 subjects in its Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial of DAXI for the management of plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is characterized by inflammation and sharp, constant pain in the heel that can become incapacitating. The company expects to report topline results for the Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2020.
Close of Public Offering of Common Stock – Revance closed its underwritten public offering of 7,475,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $17.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 975,000 additional shares. The gross proceeds to the company from the offering, before deducting the underwriters’ discounts, commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by Revance, were approximately $127.1 million, which is reflected in the unaudited January 3, 2020 cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $306.1 million. The company’s common shares outstanding was 53.4 million as of January 3, 2020.
“This is a very exciting and pivotal year for Revance, with not only a number of significant clinical data read-outs, but also the expected U.S. approval and launch of our next-generation neuromodulator product, DAXI,” said Mark Foley, President and Chief Executive Officer of Revance. “Our near-term focus is on completing the BLA approval process and finalizing our launch strategies to garner a meaningful share in the $1.4 billion* U.S. neuromodulator market. DAXI will create a new, long-lasting neuromodulator product category, delivering a premium experience that could require as few as two treatments per year and potentially provide patients with lasting, natural-looking frown line correction all year long. Although DAXI will be commercialized first in an aesthetics indication, we plan to unlock the long-term value of DAXI in an array of therapeutic indications, with clinical trials currently underway in cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity and plantar fasciitis.”

In preclinical studies, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated high immunogenicity and stimulated high levels of neutralizing antibodies
First-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial accelerated to mid-May with preliminary results in July
GMP clinical production initiated at Emergent BioSolutions with ability to leverage capacity for large scale manufacturing
GAITHERSBURG, Md., April 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced it has identified a coronavirus vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, a stable, prefusion protein made using Novavax’ proprietary nanoparticle technology, and will initiate a first-in-human trial in mid-May. Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M™ adjuvant will be incorporated with NVX-CoV2373 in order to enhance immune responses and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies.

NVX-CoV2373 was shown to be highly immunogenic in animal models measuring spike protein-specific antibodies, antibodies that block the binding of the spike protein to the receptor and wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies. High levels of spike protein-specific antibodies with ACE-2 human receptor binding domain blocking activity and SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies were observed after a single immunization. In addition, the already high microneutralization titers seen after one dose increased eight fold with a second dose. High titer microneutralizing antibodies are generally accepted evidence that a vaccine is likely to be protective in humans.

“Our scientists identified an ideal vaccine candidate selected from a number of constructs and, in partnership with Dr. Matthew Frieman, demonstrated that NVX-CoV2373 produces high levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in animal studies,” said Gregory Glenn, M.D., President of Research and Development at Novavax. “In addition, we have worked closely with our colleagues at Emergent BioSolutions to transfer our production technology that allows the manufacture of GMP vaccine for clinical trials. With preliminary CEPI funding, these heroic efforts, combined with the candidate’s excellent early results, put us in position to have preliminary human data in July.”

“We validated that NVX-CoV2373 generates high titer neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 virus,” said Matthew Frieman, Ph.D., Associate Professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “This is strong evidence that the vaccine created by Novavax has the potential to be highly immunogenic in humans which could lead to protection from COVID-19 and helping to control the spread of this disease.”

The NVX-CoV2373 clinical development plan combines a Phase 1/Phase 2 approach to allow rapid advancement during the current coronavirus pandemic. The Phase 1 clinical trial is a placebo-controlled observer blinded study of ~130 healthy adults and includes assessment of dosage amount and number of vaccinations. The trial is expected to begin in mid-May with preliminary immunogenicity and safety results in July.

As previously announced, in March, Novavax entered into an agreement with Emergent BioSolutions to provide contract development and manufacturing services, supplying Novavax with GMP vaccine product for use in its clinical trials. This agreement offers the potential to leverage Emergent’s rapid deployment capabilities and expertise that provide Novavax scalability and capacity to produce vaccine product. Also in March, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) awarded an initial funding of $4 million to support Novavax’ efforts, with additional funding discussions ongoing.

“Because of the tireless efforts and commitment of the Novavax team and our collaborators, we are preparing to initiate the NVX-CoV2373 Phase 1 trial in mid-May, weeks ahead of schedule,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novavax. “This progress demonstrates the ability of our recombinant nanoparticle technology to rapidly create vaccine candidates for emerging viruses like SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the performance of NVX-CoV2373 in multiple preclinical studies and testing gives us increased confidence in its potential to protect against COVID-19 disease.”

About Coronavirus

A new strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in late 2019 in China before beginning its rapid spread across the globe. The disease, named COVID-19, continues to cause severe pneumonia-like symptoms in many of those infected. Coronaviruses, so named for their “crown-like” appearance, are a large family of viruses that spread from animals to humans and include diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS in addition to COVID-19. While much remains unknown about the new coronavirus, it is known that the virus can spread via human-to-human transmission before any symptoms appear.

30596,The US FDA to Waive Interchangeability Standard for Insulin Biosimilars,Physicians Urge FDA to Waive Interchangeability Standard for Insulin Biosimilars,"Two doctors called for interchangeability requirements for biologics to be waived for insulin products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009
 The FDA guidance is a reminder that the rules of BPCIA should be carefully reinterpreted in order to maximize benefit, affordability, and access to insulin for all patients with diabetes in the US. The FDA streamlined the approval process for biosimilar insulins by removing the interchangeability requirement
 Switching insulins to the biologic pathway means that biosimilar insulin manufacturers will have to conduct extra clinical trials to prove interchangeability with existing insulin products. The policy plays a major role in robust generic competition and ensuring access to high quality and affordable insulin","Two doctors call for interchangeability requirements for biologics to be waived for insulin products under the new regulatory pathway under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009.
The new biologics pathway for insulins could complicate the process of getting a greater supply to patients in need, according to a position paper in the New England Journal of Medicine. Two doctors called for biosimilar insulins that meet the basic tests for approval to automatically be granted interchangeability without the need for immunogenicity testing.
The authors noted that “the FDA guidance is a reminder that the rules of the [Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009] should be carefully reinterpreted in order to maximize benefit, affordability, and access to insulin for all Americans with diabetes.” They note that the FDA has indicated an interest in streamlining the approval process for biosimilar insulins by removing the interchangeability requirement.
For a patient with type 1 diabetes, the cost of insulin in the US market nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, from $2864 to $5705, while the overall cost, including ancillary care, rose from $12,467 to $18,494 during that time, according to a study by the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute published in early 2019 (Figure).

“This policy could play a major role in enabling robust generic competition and ensuring access to high quality, affordable insulin,” Mariana P. Socal, MD, PhD, and Jeremy A. Greene, MD, PhD, wrote.
Under the current provision in the BPCIA, certain “small molecule” drugs previously approved as generics, including insulins, may be approved under the biologic regulatory pathway, but insulin biosimilars would be subject to the same rules for demonstrating interchangeability with reference medicines as other types of biosimilars.
“Regulation of insulin products has become more complicated” amid the growth of the biotech industry and the establishment of new biologic approval pathways, the authors said.
Under the small molecule pathway, proof of similarity was considered proof of interchangeability, which means pharmacists could use non-reference products without consulting physician prescribers. However, switching insulins to the biologic pathway means that biosimilar insulin manufacturers will have to conduct extra clinical trials to prove interchangeability with existing insulin products.
Years of Evidence Justify a Smoother Pathway
The authors argue that years of experience with insulins approved as generics indicate they can be safely switched without these immunogenicity tests, and further, they contend, “the complications and death caused by lack of affordable insulin are a more material threat to public health and welfare than potential differences in immunogenicity profiles” making the exception all the more critical.
Although insulin products consist of just 50 amino acids (compared with large molecule agents, which can consist of about 1300), insulin products are able to be called biologics because they require a genetically modified living organism, usually yeast or bacteria, for production.
The policy of granting interchangeability upon proof of bioequivalence has been shown to yield average price reductions of 80% within 5 years after introducing generic alternatives to the market. Insulin products currently have this designation and may lose it with the transition to the biologics approval pathway, which will make switching products to save money much more difficult for patients, the authors write.
“We believe it is crucial for an exception to be made for insulin products such that proof of similarity will be considered proof of interchangeability [under the biologics pathway],” the authors wrote.
Lowering barriers for market entry and reducing drug-development costs by forgoing extra clinical trials would promote competition among insulins and lower drug prices would help make the US insulin supply more secure, the authors said. The rise in insuling costs has been attributed to higher insulin prices in general and a shift toward more expensive insulin products.
“These benefits would accrue even if the [BPCIA pathway revision] is met with opposition from reference-product manufacturers, including those that don’t manufacture insulin but may be concerned about the precedent-setting nature of this exemption,” the authors said.
Fewer Problems With Insulin Products
One of the reasons the authors feel that interchangeability requirements should be waived is that the interchangeability difficulties for large molecule drugs, such as the potential for immunogenicity and the loss of efficacy, have not been observed with insulin products.
Additionally, antibodies that can develop for insulin users have not been observed to be associated with worrisome clinical outcomes such as changes in glucose control or dose requirements, hypoglycemia, or long-term diabetic complications, they said.
“Any harms that might stem from considering biosimilar insulins to be interchangeable with reference insulin products remain entirely theoretical,” the authors noted.
In fact, the American Diabetes Association guidelines “already acknowledge that insulin products within the same range of therapeutic onset and duration of effect…are similarly effective and can be selected at the physician’s discretion.”
Although, patients with diabetes may prefer certain products or brands, clinical research supports equivalence among treatments. Changes in insurance policies have also led to large-scale switching between insulin products, the authors note.
Another reason for an interchangeability exception for insulin is that if problems do occur, patients with diabetes will easily and quickly be able to tell. “If a biosimilar insulin product didn’t provide an adequate clinical effect, patients could identify this failure within an hour and correct it,” the authors said.
The nature of diabetes with the constant management of blood glucose levels, “mitigates any possibility of clinical failure going unnoticed.” Issues with other biologics could take months or years to notice and even when they are found, significant damage may already have been done, they said.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FDA-2.jpg,Biosimilars,-,Insulin,Biosimilars|Interchangeability|Standard|the US FDA|Waive,publish,4/9/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/physicians-urge-fda-to-waive-interchangeability-standard-for-insulin-biosimilars/,https://pharmashots.com/30596/the-us-fda-to-waive-interchangeability-standard-for-insulin-biosimilars/
30609,EMD Serono and Pfizer's Bavencio (avelumab) Receive the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation as 1L Maintenance Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma,EMD Serono and Pfizer Receive US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Submit Application for BAVENCIO for First-Line Maintenance Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma,"The companies have completed the submission of sBLA to the US FDA as 1L maintenance therapy for patients with LA/m-UC and have received FDA’s BT designation for the same indication. The sBLA is being reviewed under the FDA’s RTOR pilot program
 The sBLA is based on P-III JAVELIN Bladder 100 study assessing Bavencio + BSC vs BSC as monothx. in 700 patients with UC with no disease progression after platinum-based induction CT
 The study resulted in meeting 1EPs of OS in each of the co-primary populations of all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1-positive tumors. Bavencio is a PD-L1 antibody, acts by blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors","ROCKLAND, Mass. and NEW YORK, April 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in the US and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced completion of the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BAVENCIO® (avelumab)* for first-line maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC). The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to BAVENCIO for this indication, and the sBLA is being reviewed by the FDA under its Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program.

The application is based on positive results from an interim analysis of the Phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial, which met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). In this study, BAVENCIO plus best supportive care (BSC) as first-line maintenance therapy significantly extended the survival of patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic UC whose disease did not progress on induction chemotherapy, compared with BSC only. A statistically significant improvement was demonstrated in both co-primary populations: all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1–positive tumors. The safety profile for BAVENCIO in the trial was consistent with that in the JAVELIN monotherapy clinical development program. Detailed results from the JAVELIN Bladder 100 study will be presented at an upcoming medical congress.

“BAVENCIO is the first immunotherapy to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in a Phase III clinical trial in the first-line setting for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma,” said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “Participation in the Real-Time Oncology Review program, coupled with the Breakthrough Therapy Designation, reflect the potential impact of BAVENCIO in this patient setting and provide the opportunity to work towards bringing this treatment option to patients as quickly as possible.”

The RTOR program is intended to create a more efficient review process to bring safe and effective treatments to patients earlier, including drugs that are likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over currently available therapy. It allows the FDA to review clinical trial data from certain applications before the complete application is formally submitted. Review under the program does not guarantee or influence the approvability of the application.1

Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a program created by the FDA to accelerate the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases where the new treatment may be a substantial improvement over available therapy. In order to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation, preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the drug may demonstrate a significant improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint.2

“Given the poor prognosis for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, there is an urgent need for additional treatment options that improve overall survival,” said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&D for EMD Serono. “Our data highlight the potential for a first-line maintenance treatment approach with BAVENCIO to advance the current standard of care for previously untreated patients, and we are working with urgency toward our goal of bringing this regimen to patients.”

“For the past 30 years, chemotherapy has been the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. While this is an effective short-term option for many patients, most will ultimately experience disease progression, underscoring a need for additional treatment options,” said Petros Grivas, M.D., Ph.D., one of the principal investigators in the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial. “Based on the positive overall survival results from JAVELIN Bladder 100, I believe avelumab has the potential to be practice-changing.”

In 2017, the FDA approved BAVENCIO for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response and duration of response. JAVELIN Bladder 100 is the confirmatory study for the conversion to full approval.

*BAVENCIO is under clinical investigation for the first-line maintenance treatment of advanced UC. There is no guarantee that BAVENCIO will be approved for first-line maintenance treatment of advanced UC by any health authority worldwide.

About JAVELIN Bladder 100 
JAVELIN Bladder 100 (NCT02603432) is a Phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study investigating first-line maintenance treatment with BAVENCIO plus BSC versus BSC alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. A total of 700 patients whose disease had not progressed after platinum-based induction chemotherapy as per RECIST v1.1 were randomized to receive either BAVENCIO plus BSC or BSC alone. The study achieved its primary endpoint of OS in each of the co-primary populations of all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1-positive tumors. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, anti-tumor activity, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, predictive biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes in the co-primary populations. The safety profile for BAVENCIO in the trial was consistent with that in the JAVELIN monotherapy clinical development program.

About Urothelial Carcinoma 
Bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer worldwide.3 In 2018, there were over half a million new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed, with around 200,000 deaths from the disease globally.3 UC accounts for about 90% of all bladder cancers.4 This subtype becomes harder to treat as it advances, spreading through the layers of the bladder wall.5For patients with metastatic UC, the five-year relative survival rate is 5%.6 Combination chemotherapy is currently the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced disease, and while a majority of patients experience high initial response rates, most patients will ultimately experience disease progression within nine months after initiation of treatment.7,8 Given the poor prognosis for patients with advanced bladder cancer whose disease progresses after first-line chemotherapy, there is an urgent need for additional treatment options that improve overall survival.9

About BAVENCIO® (avelumab)
BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.10-12 In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.

BAVENCIO Approved Indications 
BAVENCIO® (avelumab) in combination with axitinib is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

In the US, the FDA granted accelerated approval for BAVENCIO for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in 50 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.

BAVENCIO can result in other severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions involving any organ system during treatment or after treatment discontinuation. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate to confirm or rule out an immune-mediated adverse reaction and to exclude other causes. Depending on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and initiate hormone replacement therapy, if appropriate. Resume BAVENCIO when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or lower following a corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for any severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 1738 patients treated with BAVENCIO as a single agent or in 489 patients who received BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib: myocarditis including fatal cases, pancreatitis including fatal cases, myositis, psoriasis, arthritis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, hypopituitarism, uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and systemic inflammatory response.

BAVENCIO can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to the first 4 infusions and for subsequent infusions based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25% of patients, including three (0.2%) patients with Grade 4 and nine (0.5%) with Grade 3.

BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib can cause major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including severe and fatal events. Consider baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular events. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue BAVENCIO and axitinib for Grade 3-4 cardiovascular events. MACE occurred in 7% of patients with advanced RCC treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib compared to 3.4% treated with sunitinib. These events included death due to cardiac events (1.4%), Grade 3-4 myocardial infarction (2.8%), and Grade 3-4 congestive heart failure (1.8%).

BAVENCIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus including the risk of fetal death. Advise females of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BAVENCIO and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO. It is not known whether BAVENCIO is excreted in human milk. Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

 In 2018, Astellas and Kotobuki Pharmaceutical collaborated to develop, manufacture and commercialize gilteritinib","TOKYO, Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) announced today a new drug application (NDA) for the oral once-daily therapy XOSPATA® (gilteritinib), for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed (disease that has returned) or refractory (resistant to treatment) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation (FLT3mut+), has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for regulatory review in China.

AML is a cancer that impacts the blood and bone marrow,1 and its incidence increases with age.2 It is estimated that every year, around 80,000 people in China are diagnosed with leukemia.3 AML is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults.4

AML patients with a FLT3 mutation have a particularly poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than six months following treatment with salvage chemotherapy.5 The status of FLT3 mutation can change over the course of AML treatment, even after relapse. As such, a patient’s mutation status should be determined to help inform the best treatment approach.6

About Gilteritinib
Gilteritinib was discovered through a research collaboration with Kotobuki Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Astellas has exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize gilteritinib. Gilteritinib was approved in the U.S. and Japan in 2018, Europe and Canada in 2019, and Korea, Brazil and Australia thus far in 2020 for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory FLT3mut+ AML.7,8,9,10,11,12,13 As of April 2020, gilteritinib is available in the U.S., Japan and selected countries in Europe.

Gilteritinib is a FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and has demonstrated inhibitory activity against FLT3-ITD, a type of FLT3mut+ that is seen in approximately one-third of patients with AML, as well as FLT3-TKD mutation. FLT3-ITD is a common driver mutation that presents with a high burden and poor prognosis.14

30673,Abbott's TriClip Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Repair System Receives the CE Mark for Minimally Invasive Tricuspid Valve Repair,ABBOTT’S TRICLIP™ BECOMES FIRST DEVICE OF ITS KIND TO RECEIVE CE MARK FOR MINIMALLY INVASIVE TRICUSPID VALVE REPAIR,"The CE Mark approval is based on TRILUMINATE study with positive six-month data assessing edge-to-edge repair technique using TriClip and resulted in reduced severity of TR with improvement in functional capacity, Published in Lancet 2019
 The TriClip device is based on the successful usage of Abbott’s MitraClip device which is novel transcatheter mitral valve therapy with 16+ yrs. of safety, survival and durable clinical outcomes in treating people with leaky mitral valves, or MR
 The TriClip is the first minimally invasive clip-based tricuspid valve repair device to avoid open heart surgery, delivered through the femoral vein in the leg and works with clipping leaflets of tricuspid valve with reduction in backflow of blood further enabling easy blood flow and relieving symptoms of TR. Additionally, the TriClip device is available in two different sizes (NT and XT)","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that its TriClip™ Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Repair System has received CE Mark and is now approved for use in Europe and other countries that recognize CE Mark as a non-surgical treatment for people with a leaky tricuspid valve, a condition known as tricuspid regurgitation (TR). With the CE Mark designation, Abbott’s TriClip device is the first minimally invasive, clip-based tricuspid valve repair device to be commercially available in the world. Abbott is a global leader in developing transcatheter treatments for heart valve disorders and has brought to market three first-in-class therapies for structural heart disease: MitraClip for mitral valve repair, Tendyne™ for mitral valve replacement, and now TriClip to treat the tricuspid valve.

The tricuspid valve, often referred to as the “forgotten heart valve,” has three leaflets that control the flow of blood between the two chambers on the right side of the heart. When those leaflets do not close properly, blood can flow in the reverse direction – known as regurgitation – forcing the heart to work harder. When left untreated, TR can lead to conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and ultimately, death. The condition is difficult to treat, however, and options for patients have historically been extremely limited. People with TR are typically older and suffer from multiple co-morbidities, making open-heart surgery a high-risk procedure.i

The TriClip procedure repairs the tricuspid valve without the need for open-heart surgery. The device is delivered to the heart through the femoral vein in the leg and works by clipping together a portion of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve to reduce the backflow of blood. This approach allows the heart to pump blood more efficiently, relieving symptoms of TR and improving a person’s quality of life.

“Patients suffering from severe tricuspid regurgitation are extremely ill and have very few treatment options,” said Georg Nickenig, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chief, Department of Cardiology, University Hospital, Bonn, Germany, and lead investigator of the TRILUMINATE trial, which generated strong data that helped lead to the CE Mark of TriClip. “Abbott’s TriClip could profoundly impact how physicians treat these patients. The therapy is backed by data proving safety and performance, durability, and improved patient quality of life.”

The CE Mark for TriClip follows positive six-month data from Abbott’s pivotal TRILUMINATE study examining edge-to-edge repair technique using TriClip, which was published in The Lancet in November 2019. The study demonstrated that TriClip reduced severity of TR and was associated with strong improvement in functional capacity and in quality of life at six months.

“Tricuspid regurgitation is a highly prevalent, yet seldom treated disease, which is why this approval is a significant milestone for the healthcare community. TriClip has the potential to fill a treatment gap and transform how doctors are able to help people with tricuspid regurgitation,” said Michael Dale, senior vice president of Abbott’s structural heart business. “Our clip-based technology provides clinicians a life-changing, proven safe, simple, and effective option to treat people suffering from a crippling and life-threatening disease.”

TriClip builds upon the proven success of Abbott’s MitraClip device, which treats people with leaky mitral valves, or mitral regurgitation (MR). TriClip leverages the same clip-based technology as MitraClip but has a differentiated delivery system designed specifically for delivery to the tricuspid valve. A new, steerable guiding catheter system adapts to the right side of the heart, where the tricuspid valve resides, enabling the physician to effectively grasp and clip the leaflets of the tricuspid valve. Additionally, the TriClip device is available in two different sizes (NT and XT) to accommodate different patient anatomies.

The MitraClip system is the first and only transcatheter mitral valve therapy with more than 16 years of clinical experience and proven safety, survival and durable clinical outcomes. More than 100,000 patients have been treated worldwide with the device. Abbott also recently announced CE Mark approval of its Tendyne Transcatheter Mitral Valve Implantation System, a minimally invasive valve replacement option to add to its portfolio of mitral solutions.

 In Feb 2018, Revance and Mylan signed global collaboration and license agreement for the development and commercialization of a proposed biosimilar to BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA)
 BOTOX is a neurotoxin therapy injected in the muscles to treat increased muscle stiffness & eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm)","NEWARK, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: RVNC), a biotechnology company pioneering new innovations in neuromodulator products for aesthetic and therapeutic indications, today provided a corporate and product pipeline update and shared anticipated milestones for 2020. The company also announced that its unaudited January 3, 2020 cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance was $306.1 million.
Corporate Updates

Acceptance of BLA Submission for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (DAXI) in Glabellar Lines Expected Q1 2020 – In November 2019, Revance submitted its Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for DAXI in the treatment of moderate-to-severe frown lines. In the Phase 3 pivotal program, the median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity was 24 weeks and the median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity was approximately 28 weeks. Revance anticipates acceptance of the submission in the first quarter and projects potential approval in the fourth quarter of 2020. Subject to approval, the company plans to initiate commercialization activities before year end.
New Phase 2 Trial Initiated for Treatment of Full Upper Face – In December 2019, Revance initiated a new open-label Phase 2 trial for treatment of the full upper face – glabellar (frown), lateral canthal (crow’s feet), and forehead lines combined. This trial is being conducted to understand the safety and efficacy, including potential dosing and injection patterns, of DAXI, covering the full upper face. The company expects completion of enrollment in first quarter, with topline results in fourth quarter of 2020. This trial is in addition to the existing open-label Phase 2 clinical trials that the company has already fully enrolled in forehead lines and crow’s feet.
Enrollment Completed in Phase 2 Plantar Fasciitis Trial – In December 2019, Revance enrolled the last of 155 subjects in its Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial of DAXI for the management of plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is characterized by inflammation and sharp, constant pain in the heel that can become incapacitating. The company expects to report topline results for the Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2020.
Close of Public Offering of Common Stock – Revance closed its underwritten public offering of 7,475,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $17.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 975,000 additional shares. The gross proceeds to the company from the offering, before deducting the underwriters’ discounts, commissions and other estimated offering expense payable by Revance, were approximately $127.1 million, which is reflected in the unaudited January 3, 2020 cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $306.1 million. The company’s common shares outstanding was 53.4 million as of January 3, 2020.
“This is a very exciting and pivotal year for Revance, with not only a number of significant clinical data read-outs, but also the expected U.S. approval and launch of our next-generation neuromodulator product, DAXI,” said Mark Foley, President and Chief Executive Officer of Revance. “Our near-term focus is on completing the BLA approval process and finalizing our launch strategies to garner a meaningful share in the $1.4 billion* U.S. neuromodulator market. DAXI will create a new, long-lasting neuromodulator product category, delivering a premium experience that could require as few as two treatments per year and potentially provide patients with lasting, natural-looking frown line correction all year long. Although DAXI will be commercialized first in an aesthetics indication, we plan to unlock the long-term value of DAXI in an array of therapeutic indications, with clinical trials currently underway in cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity and plantar fasciitis.”

30737,Apple and Google Collaborate on Contact Tracing Technology to Combat COVID-19,Apple and Google partner on COVID-19 contact tracing technology,"The two companies have teamed up to create a COVID-19 contact tracing technology via Bluetooth on smartphones and will notify people if they’ve met someone with the COVID-19 with an aim of combating the COVID-19 pandemic
 The technology will work on an opt-in basis without compromising user privacy. In May, the companies are expecting to release APIs, enabling the interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities. The apps can be downloaded via their respective app stores
 In the coming months, both companies plan to create a broader contact tracing tool that won’t require users to download a third-party app. Anyone who chooses to opt-in, will share their information with government health authorities and other contact tracing apps","Across the world, governments and health authorities are working together to find solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic, to protect people and get society back up and running. Software developers are contributing by crafting technical tools to help combat the virus and save lives. In this spirit of collaboration, Google and Apple are announcing a joint effort to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the virus, with user privacy and security central to the design.
Since COVID-19 can be transmitted through close proximity to affected individuals, public health officials have identified contact tracing as a valuable tool to help contain its spread. A number of leading public health authorities, universities, and NGOs around the world have been doing important work to develop opt-in contact tracing technology. To further this cause, Apple and Google will be launching a comprehensive solution that includes application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology to assist in enabling contact tracing. Given the urgent need, the plan is to implement this solution in two steps while maintaining strong protections around user privacy.
First, in May, both companies will release APIs that enable interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities. These official apps will be available for users to download via their respective app stores.
Second, in the coming months, Apple and Google will work to enable a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms. This is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities. Privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance in this effort, and we look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders. We will openly publish information about our work for others to analyse.
All of us at Apple and Google believe there has never been a more important moment to work together to solve one of the world’s most pressing problems. Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.
As part of this partnership, Google and Apple are releasing draft technical documentation including Bluetooth and cryptography specifications and framework documentation.

30744,Eli Lilly Signs a Clinical Trial Collaboration with NIH to Evaluate Baricitinib Against COVID-19,Lilly Begins Clinical Testing of Therapies for COVID-19,"The clinical research commences in NIH-led Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial and will evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19, initiating this month in the US with a planned expansion to additional sites including EU and Asia
 Additionally, Lilly will advance its LY3127804 (mAb against Ang2) to P-II study for pneumonia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who are at higher risk of ARDS with its expected initiation later this month in the US
 Baricitinib is an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor with a brand name Olumiant and is an approved therapy in 65+ countries for moderately to severely active RA. The company does not anticipate any shortage for its therapies including baricitinib amid COVID-19","– Baricitinib Research Commences in NIH-led Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial– Lilly Starts Phase 2 Trial with Anti-Ang2 in COVID-19

INDIANAPOLIS, April 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today it has entered into an agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to study baricitinib as an arm in NIAID’s Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. The study will investigate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib as a potential treatment for hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19, beginning this month in the U.S.with a planned expansion to additional sites including Europe and Asia. Results are expected within the next two months.

Baricitinib, an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor marketed as OLUMIANT®, is approved in more than 65 countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The U.S. prescribing information includes boxed warnings regarding the use of baricitinib, including warnings about risk for developing serious infections, a risk that may be related to baricitinib’s effects on the immune system. Given the inflammatory cascade seen in COVID-19, baricitinib’s anti-inflammatory activity has been hypothesized to have a potential beneficial effect in COVID-19 and warrants further study in patients with this infection.

Joining the NIAID study is just one approach Lilly is taking to tackle the COVID-19 global health crisis. Lilly is also announcing today that it will advance LY3127804, an investigational selective monoclonal antibody against Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), to Phase 2 testing in pneumonia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who are at a higher risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ang2 is known to be elevated in ARDS patients and Lilly will test whether inhibiting the effects of Ang2 with a monoclonal antibody can reduce the progression to ARDS or the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. This trial will begin later this month at several U.S. centers.

“Lilly is moving at top speed and using all available resources to help fight this pandemic,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “Developing potential therapeutic medicines for COVID-19 is part of our vital and humanitarian mission. To be successful, we must combine resources, data and expertise, with government, academia and other companies. We look forward to seeing the results of baricitinib and anti-Ang2 clinical studies.”

“There is an urgent need for new strategies to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients, many of whom will progress to respiratory failure,” said Vincent C. Marconi, M.D., professor of medicine and global health at Emory University School of Medicine, one of the U.S. sites for NIAID’s ongoing Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. “This NIAID study presents an important opportunity to test whether baricitinib can help these patients.”

Lilly currently does not anticipate shortages for any of its medicines, including baricitinib, which remains widely available in countries where it is approved. Should research efforts for baricitinib in COVID-19 prove successful, Lilly will continue to create adequate supply to support both appropriate clinical and investigational use.

Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.

Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.

MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.

GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.

Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to ≥5x and ≥10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.

Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse reactions (≥1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.
HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

30753,Terumo BCT and Marker Therapeutics Receive the US FDA's Emergency Use Authorization for their Purification Device to Treat COVID-19,Terumo BCT and Marker Therapeutics Received the First Device FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Treat Acute Respiratory Failure in COVID-19 Patients,"The US FDA has granted EUA to Terumo BCT’s Spectra Optia Apheresis System combined with Marker Therapeutics’ D2000 Adsorption Cartridge to treat patients aged ≥18yrs. with confirmed COVID-19 and are admitted to the ICU with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels
 The device works by reducing the number of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in the blood, filter it and return the filtered blood to the patient
 The two companies collaborate to combine their existing technologies for providing a unique solution for the treatment of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19","LAKEWOOD, CO. USA – April 10, 2020 – Terumo BCT, Inc. and Marker Therapeutics AG announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of Terumo BCT’s Spectra Optia™ Apheresis System combined with Marker Therapeutics’ D2000 Adsorption Cartridge to treat patients 18 years of age or older with confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.

The devices work together by reducing the number of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, i.e., small active proteins in the bloodstream that control a cell’s immune response by filtering the blood and returning the filtered blood to the patient. The proteins that are removed are typically elevated during infections and can be associated with a “cytokine storm” that occurs in some COVID-19 patients, leading to severe inflammation, rapidly progressive shock, respiratory failure, organ failure and death.

“We thank the Food and Drug Administration for their expedited review, which provides another treatment option for patients in the ICU to help reduce the severity of the disease,” say Antoinette Gawin, CEO and President of Terumo BCT, and David Cohen, Chairman of Marker.

About Terumo BCT and Marker Therapeutics Collaboration
Terumo BCT, a U.S. based leader in blood component, therapeutic apheresis and cellular technologies, and Marker Therapeutics AG, a Swiss-based diagnostic and therapeutics company, formed this collaboration to combine their existing technologies to provide an innovative approach to potentially treat severe respiratory symptoms caused by COVID-19.

“The pace of this collaboration between the companies is incredible. We are leaving no stone unturned in exploring existing and new ways for our products to mitigate the impact of COVID-19,” says Antoinette Gawin, CEO and President of Terumo BCT.

“By combining our plasma adsorption cartridge with Terumo BCT’s technology, this partnership offers the potential to develop a unique global solution for treatment of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19,” says David Cohen, Chairman of Marker.

30760,AstraZeneca and MSD's Koselugo (selumetinib) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the First Therapy for Pediatric Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Plexiform Neurofibromas,Koselugo (selumetinib) approved in US for paediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 plexiform neurofibromas,"The approval is based on P-I/II SPRINT study assessing Koselugo (bid) as monothx. in pediatric patients aged ≥2yrs. with NF1-related inoperable PNs. The trial was sponsored by NCI CTEP, conducted under a research and development agreement between NCI and AstraZeneca with additional support from NTAP
 The P-I/II SPRINT study results demonstrated 66% ORR in pediatric patients with NF1 PN. The two companies jointly develop & commercialize Koselugo globally and have submitted an MAA to EMA in Q1’20
 Koselugo is a MEK1/2 inhibitor and has received the US FDA’s BT designation in Apr’2019, RPD in Dec’2019, ODD in Feb’2018, EMA’s ODD in Aug’2018 and Swissmedic’s ODD in Dec’2018 for the treatment of pediatric patients with NF1 PN","First medicine approved to treat this rare and debilitating genetic condition
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the kinase inhibitor Koselugo (selumetinib) for the treatment of paediatric patients two years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN).1

The approval by the FDA was based on positive results from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)-sponsored Phase II SPRINT Stratum 1 trial coordinated by the NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, Pediatric Oncology Branch. This is the first regulatory approval anywhere in the world of a medicine for the treatment of NF1 PN.1

NF1 is a rare and debilitating genetic condition.2 Some 30-50% of patients with NF1 experience PN – tumours growing inside their nerve sheaths. These PN can cause clinical issues such as pain, motor dysfunction, airway dysfunction, bowel/bladder dysfunction and disfigurement.2,3

Results showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 66% (33 of 50 patients, confirmed partial response) in paediatric patients with NF1 PN when treated with Koselugo as a twice-daily oral monotherapy. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed complete or partial response of at least 20% reduction in tumour volume.

Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “For the first time, patients and families impacted by this incurable genetic condition have an approved medicine to treat the resulting plexiform neurofibromas. I would like to thank our research partners, the NCI, the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP), the Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the NF1 patient community and, most importantly, the children, parents and doctors who participated in the SPRINT clinical trial programme.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Previously there were no medicines approved for this disease. This approval has the potential to change how symptomatic, inoperable NF1 plexiform neurofibromas are treated and provides new hope for these patients.”

Brigitte C. Widemann, M.D., Principal Investigator of the SPRINT trial and Chief, National Cancer Institute Pediatric Oncology Branch, said: “Koselugo has made a difference for many children in this trial. This is an important treatment advance for patients and their families.”

AstraZeneca and MSD are jointly developing and commercialising Koselugo globally and submitted a marketing authorisation application in NF1 PN to the European Medicines Agency in the first quarter of 2020. Further global regulatory submissions are being evaluated.

Priority Review Voucher

AstraZeneca has received a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) under the Rare Pediatric Disease Designation Program intended to encourage development of new medicines for rare paediatric diseases. A PRV entitles the holder to FDA Priority Review of a single New Drug Application or Biologics License Application, which reduces the target review time and has led to an expedited approval.

Financial considerations

In accordance with the existing collaboration agreement between Merck and AstraZeneca, following approval and upcoming launch, AstraZeneca will book all monotherapy Product Sales of Koselugo; half of gross profits will be due to Merck and will be recorded under Cost of Sales. Any potential future sales-related milestone payments will be recorded under Collaboration Revenue. AstraZeneca will supply Koselugo.

NF1

NF1 is a debilitating genetic condition that affects one in every 3,000 to 4,000 individuals.4 It is caused by a spontaneous or inherited mutation in the NF1 gene and is associated with many symptoms, including soft lumps on and under the skin (cutaneous neurofibromas) and skin pigmentation (so-called ‘café au lait’ spots)2 and, in 30-50% of patients, tumours develop on the nerve sheaths (plexiform neurofibromas). These plexiform neurofibromas can cause clinical issues such as disfigurement, motor dysfunction, pain, airway dysfunction, visual impairment, and bladder/bowel dysfunction.

PN begin during early childhood, with varying degrees of severity, and can reduce life expectancy by up to 15 years.2,4

SPRINT

The SPRINT Phase I/II trial was designed to evaluate the objective response rate and impact on patient-reported and functional outcomes in paediatric patients with NF1-related inoperable PNs treated with Koselugo monotherapy.1 Results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.5 This trial sponsored by NCI CTEP was conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between NCI and AstraZeneca with additional support from NTAP.

Koselugo

Koselugo (selumetinib) is inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2). MEK1/2 proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. Both MEK and ERK are critical components of the RAS-regulated RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, which is often activated in different types of cancers.

Koselugo was granted US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation in April 2019, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in December 2019, Orphan Drug Designation in February 2018, EU orphan designation in August 2018 and Swissmedic Orphan Drug Status in December 2018 for the treatment of paediatric patients with NF1 PN.

AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparzaand Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

 The clinical study has been approved by Health Canada and is expected to initiate within the next few weeks. The company is working with multiple health authorities including the US FDA regarding additional studies to assess Virazole as a treatment for COVID-19 infection
 Virazole (ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP) aerosol is indicated only for lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV. The Bausch Foundation is working with health authorities in Italy to make Virazole for inhalation available free of charge in compassionate use in hospitals","LAVAL, Quebec, April 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC) (“Bausch Health” or the “Company”) today announced it has initiated a clinical trial program in Canada evaluating an investigational use of VIRAZOLE® (Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP) in combination with standard of care therapy to treat hospitalized adult patients with respiratory distress due to COVID-19. Because ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside that works to stop viral replication, VIRAZOLE may be effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 infection.

VIRAZOLE is currently approved in several countries around the world, including the United States and Canada, for the treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

The initial clinical study has been approved by Health Canada and is expected to begin within the next few weeks. The Company is also in discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and health authorities in multiple countries regarding additional studies to evaluate VIRAZOLE as a treatment for COVID-19 infection. The Bausch Foundation is also continuing to work directly with health authorities in Italy to make VIRAZOLE for inhalation available free of charge in compassionate use in Italian hospitals.

“VIRAZOLE has demonstrated antiviral activity in treating severe pediatric respiratory infections, and we believe it may be a valuable agent in reducing respiratory distress in adults suffering from COVID-19. We are actively pursuing approval of our trial protocol around the world to test the efficacy and safety of VIRAZOLE in this patient population,” said Joseph C. Papa, chairman and CEO, Bausch Health. “Bausch Health will remain focused – for as long as necessary – on doing our part to help end this unprecedented global health pandemic, including donating our health care products, conducting research to find new treatment options and supporting patients, health care providers and our employees.”

The initial study protocol is an open label, interventional trial that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VIRAZOLE in hospitalized adult patients, aged 18 or older, who have tested positive for COVID-19, and as a result of their infection, have significant respiratory distress. Two active study arms will compare different dosing regimens of VIRAZOLE in combination with standard of care therapy. More details on the study can be found on the Health Canada Clinical Trials Database and on Health Canada COVID-19 List of Clinical Trials.

About VIRAZOLE® 
VIRAZOLE (ribavirin for inhalation solution, USP) aerosol is indicated only for lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV. Treatment may be initiated while awaiting rapid diagnostic test results. However, treatment should not be continued without documentation of RSV infection.

VIRAZOLE is not approved by Health Canada for use in COVID-19 patients.

Limited clinical data indicate that VIRAZOLE administered as a small particle aerosol may be beneficial in the treatment of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in neonates and infants when associated with underlying cardiovascular, pulmonary or immune deficiency. Treatment should be confined to hospitalized patients, and administration should be continuous during the period of therapy apart from the time required for ancillary care of the patient. Only severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection is to be treated with VIRAZOLE aerosol.

VIRAZOLE aerosol treatment must be accompanied by and does not replace standard supportive respiratory and fluid management for infants and children with severe respiratory tract infection.

Use of VIRAZOLE aerosol is contraindicated in women or girls who are or may become pregnant during exposure to the drug. VIRAZOLE may cause fetal harm, and respiratory syncytial virus infection is self-limited in this population. VIRAZOLE is not completely cleared from human blood even four weeks after administration. Although there are no pertinent human data, VIRAZOLE has been found to be teratogenic and/or embryolethal in nearly all species in which it has been tested; however, pregnant baboons given up to 120 mg/kg/day of ribavirin over a 4-day period within the 20 days of organogenesis during gestation failed to exhibit any teratogenic effect.

WARNINGS
Close monitoring of patients and respiratory equipment must be guaranteed when VIRAZOLE is used in infants requiring assisted ventilation. Precipitation of VIRAZOLE powder in respiratory equipment may interfere with safe and effective patient ventilation.

Bronchospasm was observed in a tolerance study with ribavirin aerosol in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.

Respiratory function should be carefully monitored during treatment. If initiation of VIRAZOLE aerosol treatment appears to produce sudden deterioration of respiratory function, treatment should be stopped and only reinstituted with caution and continuous monitoring.

Although VIRAZOLE is not indicated in adults, the physician should be aware that it is teratogenic in animals.

VIRAZOLE administered by aerosol produced cardiac lesions in mice and rats after 30 and 36 mg/kg, respectively, for 4 weeks, and after oral administration in monkeys at 120 mg/kg and rats at 154 to 200 mg/kg for 1 to 6 months. VIRAZOLE aerosol administered to developing ferrets at 60 mg/kg for 10 or 30 days resulted in inflammatory and possibly emphysematous changes in the lungs. Proliferative changes were seen at 131 mg/kg for 30 days. The significance of these findings to human administration is unknown.

VIRAZOLE lyophilized in 6 gram vials is intended for use as an aerosol only.

It has been noted that ribavirin has shown some evidence of mutagenesis in some in vitro test systems. Carcinogenicity studies are incomplete and inconclusive. Some evidence for the production of benign tumors has been shown.

PRECAUTIONS
VIRAZOLE has been in use for many years in human beings without any reported adverse effects in human fetuses. However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, and there is little published evidence of its safety in the early stages of human pregnancy. Since VIRAZOLE is delivered in aerosolized form and because of known teratogenic effects in animals, pregnant women should not care for patients receiving VIRAZOLE, although human teratogenic effects have not been proven.

Patients with lower respiratory tract infection due to respiratory syncytial virus require optimum monitoring and attention to respiratory and fluid status.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
The safety data from patients treated with VIRAZOLE aerosol has been carefully evaluated in 26 studies. Bronchospasm was observed in a tolerance study with VIRAZOLE aerosol (20 mg/mL) in adults. One of six adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and two of six asthmatic adults became dyspneic during the period of VIRAZOLE aerosol administration. These patients required chronic administration of bronchodilators which were discontinued 24 hours prior to VIRAZOLE treatment. An inhalation of a bronchodilator by puffer produced symptomatic relief and return to baseline conditions.

Several serious adverse events occurred in severely ill infants with life-threatening underlying diseases, many of whom required assisted ventilation. These events include: worsening of respiratory status, bacterial pneumonia and pneumothorax. The role of VIRAZOLE in these events is indeterminate.

There were nineteen deaths during or shortly after treatment with VIRAZOLE aerosol. No death was attributed to ribavirin aerosol by the investigators.

Some subjects requiring assisted ventilation have experienced serious difficulties, which may jeopardize adequate ventilation and gas exchange. Precipitation of drug within the ventilatory apparatus, including the endotracheal tube, has resulted in increased positive end expiratory pressure and increased positive inspiratory pressure. Accumulation of fluid in tubing (“rain out”) has also been noted.

Although anemia has not been reported with use of the aerosol, it occurs frequently with oral and intravenous ribavirin, and most infants treated with the aerosol have not been evaluated 1 or 2 weeks post-treatment when anemia is likely to occur. Reticulocytosis has been reported with aerosol use.

Conjunctivitis has been reported in controlled studies with VIRAZOLE aerosol, however, no significant difference was observed between VIRAZOLE treated and control groups.

Tweet this

The deal is anchored by Blackstone’s purchase of 50 percent of the royalties owed to Alnylam on global sales of inclisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Inclisiran is a twice-a-year, subcutaneously injected RNAi therapeutic that has been shown in a comprehensive Phase 3 program to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol with an acceptable safety profile. If approved, this medicine is expected to help patients lower LDL cholesterol, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. and globally.

The strategic financing collaboration, led by Blackstone Life Sciences and GSO Capital Partners (“GSO”), Blackstone’s credit platform, is expected to enable Alnylam’s achievement of a self-sustainable financial profile without need for future equity financing, accelerating the commercial potential of Alnylam’s rapidly advancing product portfolio. The investment by multiple Blackstone businesses will support the development and delivery of promising medicines to the patients who need them and is one of the largest ever private financings of a biotech company.

The transaction includes the inclisiran royalty monetization, corporate debt, purchase of Alnylam equity, and funding for certain R&D activities related to the clinical advancement of two Alnylam investigational RNAi therapeutic programs in cardiovascular disease.

Specifically, the transaction is comprised of the following components:

$1 billion in committed payments, led by Blackstone Life Sciences, to acquire 50 percent of Alnylam’s royalties and commercial milestones for inclisiran;
Up to $750 million in a first lien senior secured term loan led by GSO;
Up to $150 million from Blackstone Life Sciences for development of Alnylam’s cardiometabolic programs vutrisiran and ALN-AGT (to be established based upon a non-binding letter of intent);
$100 million purchase of Alnylam common stock.
“Alnylam is focused on building a top-tier biopharmaceutical company, advancing RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines with transformative potential for patients around the world. This exciting new relationship with Blackstone brings us much closer to that goal, securing our bridge towards a self-sustainable financial profile that we believe can now be achieved without any need for Alnylam to access the equity markets in the future,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “A central component of this strategic relationship is a partial monetization of our royalty for inclisiran. If approved, we believe this therapy holds enormous promise as a potential game-changer in hypercholesterolemia management. We are pleased to retain half of the royalties we receive from Novartis, allowing Alnylam to benefit from inclisiran’s anticipated future success. We couldn’t be more pleased to enter into this highly innovative arrangement with Blackstone, which has shown a significant commitment to Alnylam’s future and alignment with our long-term vision.”

“Blackstone is uniquely positioned to provide customized, one-stop-shop financing solutions at scale while establishing development collaborations with the world’s leading biotech companies. Alnylam’s RNAi technology represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today, and aligns perfectly with our investment strategy,” said Nicholas Galakatos, Ph.D., Global Head of Blackstone Life Sciences. “Our collaboration with Alnylam provides non-dilutive access to capital to advance important new medicines in development across several disease indications including heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. and globally.”

“We’re thrilled to be able to partner with Blackstone Life Sciences to provide a customized solution for Alnylam, whose approved therapies provide important new options for patients,” said Dwight Scott, Global Head of GSO. “GSO’s capital will support Alnylam during a period of global growth as it continues to launch its medicines and pursue innovative RNAi approaches to bring new therapies to market and ultimately to patients around the globe.”

Alnylam, an existing tenant of Blackstone Real Estate company BioMed Realty, is also in discussions with BioMed to expand its footprint in Cambridge, MA.

About Inclisiran
Inclisiran, an investigational cholesterol-lowering treatment, was added to the Novartis pipeline via its acquisition of The Medicines Company. Inclisiran will potentially be the first and only LDL-C lowering siRNA treatment. It is intended to be administered by a healthcare professional by subcutaneous injection with an initial dose, again at 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter. Its twice-yearly dosing by subcutaneous injection may integrate seamlessly into a patient’s healthcare routine. As a siRNA, inclisiran is thought to harness the body’s natural process of clearing LDL-C from the bloodstream. Inclisiran is a double-stranded siRNA, conjugated on the sense strand with triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to facilitate uptake by hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, inclisiran increases LDL-C receptor recycling and expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, thereby increasing LDL-C uptake by hepatocytes and lowering LDL-C levels in the circulation. Data from each of the Phase III studies was recently published online, ahead of print, in The New England Journal of Medicine. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORION-4, is ongoing.

In the Phase III studies, inclisiran was reported to be well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo. The most common adverse reactions reported (≥3% of patients treated with inclisiran and occurring more frequently than placebo) were, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, dyspnea, bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Adverse events at the injection site were more frequent with inclisiran than placebo and were generally mild and none were severe or persistent.

Novartis has obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.

About RNAi
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made.

INCHEON, Korea–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Celltrion Group today announced that the company has successfully selected the most potent antibody candidates to neutralise SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.

Through a partnership with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), Celltrion initially identified and secured 300 different types of antibodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 antigen. These were then screened based on their ability to bind to the virus spike protein. Celltrion was then able to capture a total of 38 potent neutralising antibodies, of which, 14 are powerful neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Following the selection of antibody candidates which demonstrate high potency in neutralising SARS-CoV-2, Celltrion will begin cell-line development. Once this is completed, Celltrion aims to roll out mass production of the therapeutic antibody and, together with the KCDC, Celltrion will conduct efficacy and toxicity testing in mice and non-human primates.

Ki-Sung Kwon, Head of R&D Unit at Celltrion said, “We are bringing our full resources and expertise to overcome this global health crisis and are glad to have identified these antibodies sooner than previously expected. These antibodies can recognise multiple epitopes, thus increasing the probability of nonspecific antigen binding. Given the expedited development process of our antiviral antibody treatment, we anticipate moving to first-in-human clinical trials in July. We are also on track with the development of a ‘super antibody’ or ‘an antibody cocktail’ and the launch of a rapid self-testing diagnostic kit in the summer of this year.”

Apr 13, 2020

FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J., April 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for an additional molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19 that can return results in two to three hours. The new test also has been CE marked to the IVD Directive (98/79/EC).

The test, which is run on the BD MAX™ System, provides additional testing capacity for COVID-19 in the United States and in countries that recognize the CE Mark to test patients and health care workers. The test is in addition to the other tests already available on the BD MAX™ System from collaborations with BioGX and CerTest and is based on the CDC assay design. The BD MAX™ System, a molecular diagnostic platform, is already in use at thousands of laboratories worldwide, and each unit is capable of analyzing hundreds of samples over a 24-hour period.

“The new BD COVID-19 test for the BD MAX™ System will help increase availability of these much-needed tests around the world,” said Dave Hickey, president of Integrated Diagnostics for BD. “We continue to work towards a full portfolio of testing options to give health care workers choice and access to the right test for the right situation.”

The majority of BD MAX™ Systems are installed in hospital laboratories, reducing the added time and complexity of needing to send samples to a reference lab. The system is fully automated, reducing the opportunity for human error and increasing the speed to result, and can process 24 samples simultaneously. The assay is based on the same viral RNA targeting sequences and real-time PCR detection method as the test developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Hospitals and laboratories that use a BD MAX™ System can order tests through their BD sales representative.

The BD SARS-CoV-2 Reagent Kit for BD MAX™ System has been CE marked to the IVD Directive (98/79/EC), but it has not been cleared or approved by FDA. The test has been authorized by FDA under an EUA only for the detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virus to aid in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. It has not been authorized for use to detect any other viruses or pathogens. The test is authorized in the United States for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

30852,Sanofi and GSK Collaborate to Develop Adjuvanted COVID-19 Vaccine,Sanofi and GSK to join forces in unprecedented vaccine collaboration to fight COVID-19,"Sanofi will provide its S-protein COVID-19 antigen, based on recombinant DNA technology. The technology that produces an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus and the DNA sequence encoding the antigen is combined into the DNA of the baculovirus expression platform
 GSK will deploy its adjuvant technology as the use of it can reduce the amount of vaccine protein required/ dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced, thus contributing to protecting more people amid a pandemic
 The companies plan to commence the P-I clinical study in H2’20 with a goal to complete the development required for availability by H2’21. Both the companies are in discussion with governments and global institution for funding and have set-up a Joint Task Force, which will seek to mobilize resources from both companies in order to facilitate the development of vaccine candidates","PARIS and LONDON – April 14, 2020 – Sanofi and GSK today announce that they have signed a letter of intent to develop an adjuvanted vaccine for COVID-19, using innovative technology from both companies, to help address the ongoing pandemic.

Sanofi will contribute its S-protein COVID-19 antigen, which is based on recombinant DNA technology. This technology has produced an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus, and the DNA sequence encoding this antigen has been combined into the DNA of the baculovirus expression platform, the basis of Sanofi’s licensed recombinant influenza product in the US.

GSK will contribute its proven pandemic adjuvant technology. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protect more people.

“As the world faces this unprecedented global health crisis, it is clear that no one company can go it alone.” says Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. “That is why Sanofi is continuing to complement its expertise and resources with our peers, such as GSK, with the goal to create and supply sufficient quantities of vaccines that will help stop this virus.”

“This collaboration brings together two of the world’s largest vaccines companies.” says Emma Walmsley, Chief Executive Officer, GSK. “By combining our scientific expertise, technologies and capabilities, we believe that we can help accelerate the global effort to develop a vaccine to protect as many people as possible from Covid-19.”

The combination of a protein-based antigen together with an adjuvant is well-established and used in a number of vaccines available today. An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response and has been shown to create a stronger and longer- lasting immunity against infections than the vaccine alone. It can also improve the likelihood of delivering an effective vaccine that can be manufactured at scale.

The companies plan to initiate phase I clinical trials in the second half of 2020 and, subject to regulatory considerations, aim to complete the development required for availability by the second half of 2021.

As previously announced by Sanofi, development of the recombinant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate is being supported through funding and a collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The companies plan to discuss funding support with other governments and global institutions prioritising global access.

“Strategic alliances among vaccine industry leaders are essential to make a coronavirus vaccine available as soon as possible,” says BARDA Director, Rick A. Bright, Ph.D. “Development of the adjuvanted recombinant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate holds the potential to lower the vaccine dose to provide vaccine to a greater number of people to end this pandemic, and help the world become better prepared or even prevent future coronavirus outbreaks.”

The companies have set up a Joint Task Force, co-chaired by David Loew, Global Head of Vaccines, Sanofi and Roger Connor, President Vaccines, GSK. The taskforce will seek to mobilize resources from both companies to look for every opportunity to accelerate the development of the candidate vaccine.

Considering the extraordinary humanitarian and financial challenge of the pandemic, both companies believe that global access to COVID-19 vaccines is a priority and are committed to making any vaccine that is developed through the collaboration affordable to the public and through mechanisms that offer fair access for people in all countries.

These efforts mark a significant milestone in Sanofi’s and GSK’s ongoing contributions to help fight COVID-19. The companies have entered into a Material Transfer Agreement to enable them to start working together immediately. Full terms of the collaboration will be finalised over the next few weeks.

30886,Alnylam's Vutrisiran Receives the US FDA's Fast Track Designation to Treat Polyneuropathy of hATTR Amyloidosis,Alnylam Receives Fast Track Designation for Vutrisiran for the Treatment of the Polyneuropathy of hATTR Amyloidosis,"The US FDA has granted FT designation vutrisiran for treating polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. The designation allows Alnylam to submit NDA for vutrisiran
 The P-I study assessing Vutrisiran (quarterly dosing with low-volume, SC) demonstrated a reduction in the burden of care for the disease. The safety & efficacy of the therapy are being evaluated ongoing HELIOS-A and HELIOS-B P-III clinical studies with the anticipated P-III HELIOS-A results in H1’21
 Vutrisiran (SC) is an investigational, RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, which encompasses both hereditary (hATTR) and wild-type (wtATTR) amyloidosis","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 14, 2020– Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to vutrisiran, an investigational therapeutic for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis in adults. According to the FDA, Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. With this designation, Alnylam will be eligible to submit a rolling New Drug Application for vutrisiran.

“Vutrisiran has demonstrated an encouraging safety profile in the Phase 1 study, with infrequent quarterly dosing with low-volume, subcutaneous administration which potentially reduces the burden of care for this progressive, life-threatening and multisystem disease. We are therefore pleased that the FDA has granted vutrisiran Fast Track designation,” said Rena Denoncourt, Vutrisiran Program Leader at Alnylam. “After completing enrollment earlier this year, we look forward to sharing topline results of the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in early 2021. More broadly, we remain committed to developing additional therapeutic options for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis to augment the market-leading position of ONPATTRO® (patisiran), approved for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults.”

In addition to Fast Track designation, vutrisiran has been granted Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran are being evaluated in the ongoing HELIOS-A and HELIOS-B Phase 3 clinical trials. Together, these studies comprise a comprehensive clinical development program intended to demonstrate the broad impact of vutrisiran across the multisystem manifestations of disease and the full spectrum of patients with ATTR amyloidosis.

About Vutrisiran
Vutrisiran is an investigational, subcutaneously-administered RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, which encompasses both hereditary (hATTR) and wild-type (wtATTR) amyloidosis. It is designed to target and silence specific messenger RNA, blocking the production of wild-type and mutant transthyretin (TTR) protein before it is made. Quarterly administration of vutrisiran may help to reduce deposition and facilitate the clearance of TTR amyloid deposits in tissues and potentially restore function to these tissues. Vutrisiran utilizes Alnylam’s next-generation delivery platform known as the Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform. The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency or any other health authority.

About HELIOS-A Phase 3 Study
HELIOS-A is a Phase 3 global, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vutrisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The trial randomized patients 3:1 to receive either 25mg of vutrisiran subcutaneously once every 12 weeks or 0.3 mg/kg of patisiran intravenously once every three weeks. For most endpoints, results from the vutrisiran arm will be compared to results from the placebo arm of the landmark APOLLO Phase 3 study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of patisiran in people with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The co-primary endpoints of HELIOS-A are the change from baseline in the modified Neurologic Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) and in the Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) score, at 9 months. Secondary endpoints include the change from baseline in key clinical evaluations including the timed 10-meter walk test (10-MWT), modified body mass index (mBMI), and Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS). The percent reduction in serum transthyretin (TTR) levels in the vutrisiran arm will be compared to the within-study patisiran arm. Additional exploratory endpoints will be assessed to determine the effect of vutrisiran on other aspects of the multisystem nature of this disease, including manifestations of cardiac amyloid involvement.

About HELIOS-B Phase 3 Study
HELIOS-B will evaluate the efficacy of vutrisiran versus placebo toward the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular hospitalizations at 30 months, the primary study endpoint. The study protocol includes an optional interim analysis to be conducted at the Company’s discretion. HELIOS-B complements the ongoing HELIOS-A Phase 3 study in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, creating a comprehensive clinical development program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vutrisiran across the entire disease spectrum of ATTR amyloidosis.

ONPATTRO Important Safety Information
Infusion-Related Reactions
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed in patients treated with ONPATTRO® (patisiran). In a controlled clinical study, 19% of ONPATTRO-treated patients experienced IRRs, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. The most common symptoms of IRRs with ONPATTRO were flushing, back pain, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and headache.

To reduce the risk of IRRs, patients should receive premedication with a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and antihistamines (H1 and H2 blockers) at least 60 minutes prior to ONPATTRO infusion. Monitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRRs. If an IRR occurs, consider slowing or interrupting the infusion and instituting medical management as clinically indicated. If the infusion is interrupted, consider resuming at a slower infusion rate only if symptoms have resolved. In the case of a serious or life-threatening IRR, the infusion should be discontinued and not resumed.

Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation
ONPATTRO treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin A is advised for patients taking ONPATTRO. Higher doses than the RDA should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with ONPATTRO, as serum levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body.

Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g. night blindness).

Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with ONPATTRO were upper respiratory tract infections (29%) and infusion-related reactions (19%).

Indication
ONPATTRO is indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults.

For additional information about ONPATTRO, please see the full Prescribing Information.

About Transthyretin (ATTR) Amyloidosis
Transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating, and fatal disease caused by misfolded TTR proteins that accumulate as amyloid deposits in multiple tissues including the nerves, heart and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are two types of ATTR amyloidosis: hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis and wild-type (wtATTR) amyloidosis. hATTR amyloidosis is an inherited disease resulting in intractable peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy. It is estimated to affect 50,000 people worldwide. The condition can have a debilitating impact on a patient’s life and may lead to premature death within 4.7 years of diagnosis. wtATTR amyloidosis is a nonhereditary, progressive type of the disease with undefined etiology. It affects an estimated 200,000-300,000 people worldwide. It primarily manifests as cardiomyopathy, which leads to heart failure and mortality within 2 to 6 years.

About RNAi
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

About Alnylam
Alnylam (Nasdaq: ALNY) is leading the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare genetic, cardio-metabolic, hepatic infectious, and central nervous system (CNS)/ocular diseases. Based on Nobel Prize-winning science, RNAi therapeutics represent a powerful, clinically validated approach for the treatment of a wide range of severe and debilitating diseases. Founded in 2002, Alnylam is delivering on a bold vision to turn scientific possibility into reality, with a robust RNAi therapeutics platform. Alnylam’s commercial RNAi therapeutic products are ONPATTRO® (patisiran), approved in the U.S., EU, Canada, Japan, Switzerland and Brazil, and GIVLAARI® (givosiran), approved in the U.S. and EU.

30897,AstraZeneca Initiates CALAVI Study Evaluating Calquence (acalabrutinib) Against COVID-19,AstraZeneca initiates CALAVI clinical trial with Calquence against COVID-19,"The CALAVI study is a two-part trial assessing the efficacy and safety of Calquence + BSC vs BSC as monothx. in patients hospitalized with respiratory complications of COVID-19
 Part 1 randomized patients in a ratio (2:1) and evaluates Calquence + BSC in patients who are hospitalized, but not on assisted ventilation & not in the ICU while part two evaluates therapy in a cohort of patients in the ICU with more severe respiratory complications
 The goal of the study to reduce mortality and the need for assisted ventilation in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. Calquence is a BTK inhibitor act by binding covalently to BTK further inhibiting its activity in the beta-cell","AstraZeneca initiates CALAVI clinical trial with Calquence against COVID-19
Trial will assess the effect of Calquence on the exaggerated immune response of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection
AstraZeneca will initiate a randomised, global clinical trial to assess the potential of Calquence (acalabrutinib) in the treatment of the exaggerated immune response (cytokine storm) associated with COVID-19 infection in severely ill patients.

The trial design is based upon strong scientific evidence supporting the role of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) pathway in the production of inflammatory cytokines and on encouraging early clinical data. Calquence is a next-generation, highly selective BTK inhibitor currently used to treat certain types of blood cancers.

The trial, called CALAVI, is based on early clinical data with Calquence demonstrating that a decrease in inflammation caused by BTK inhibition appears to reduce the severity of COVID-19-induced respiratory distress. The goal of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding Calquence to best supportive care (BSC) to reduce mortality and the need for assisted ventilation in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms.

This large, multicentre, global, randomised trial uses a two-part patient-centric design developed in record time to accelerate data capture and analysis. Part one evaluates the addition of Calquence to BSC versus BSC alone in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who are not in the intensive care unit (ICU). Part two evaluates the addition of Calquence to BSC in a cohort of patients in the ICU.

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “With this trial we are responding to the novel insights of the scientific community and hope to demonstrate that adding Calquence to best supportive care reduces the need to place patients on ventilators and improves their chances of survival. This is the fastest launch of any clinical trial in the history of AstraZeneca.”

Louis M. Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), said: “Given the well documented role of the protein BTK in regulating inflammation, it is possible that inhibiting BTK with acalabrutinib could provide clinical benefit in patients with advanced COVID-19 lung disease. As with all new treatments, it will be necessary to gather data from clinical trials in order to understand the best and safest treatment options for patients.”

The CALAVI trial is expected to open for enrolment in the coming days in the US and several countries in Europe. Wyndham H. Wilson, MD, PhD, of NCI in the US, will serve as the principal investigator of the trial. Louis M. Staudt, MD, PhD will serve as senior investigator.

CALAVI

CALAVI is a large, randomised, open-label, multicentre, global, two-part trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Calquencewith BSC versus BSC alone in patients hospitalised with respiratory complications of COVID-19. Part one is randomised (2:1) and evaluates the addition of Calquence to current BSC in patients who are hospitalised but not on assisted ventilation and not in the ICU. Part two evaluates the addition of Calquence to BSC in a cohort of patients in the ICU with more severe respiratory complications. The trial is being conducted in multiple sites around the world. The primary endpoint measures the use of assisted ventilation or death.

COVID-19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most COVID-19 cases (~80%) are mild respiratory illnesses. However, some require hospitalisation, mostly due to pneumonia, and can progress quickly to severe acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with high mortality.1,2,3,4 A viral-induced cytokine storm or “hyperimmune response” is hypothesised to be a major pathogenic mechanism of ARDS in these patients through modulation of pulmonary macrophages and dendritic cells and/or neutrophils.5,6,7,8

Calquence

Calquence is a next-generation, selective inhibitor of BTK. Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.9,10,11,12 In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.13

Calquence (acalabrutinib) is approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in the US and a few other countries with an active global filing programme. In addition, Calquence is indicated for adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy in the US and several other countries.

BTK Inhibition

In lung macrophages, BTK is a key regulator of the production of multiple cytokines and chemokines including TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1, among others. BTK inhibition reduces the production of these cytokines and is, therefore, a promising strategy to reduce the respiratory complications of COVID-19.13

There is evidence that dysregulated BTK-dependent macrophage signalling may be central to the exaggerated inflammatory responses to SARS-COV-2 and play a role in COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS. 4,5,6,7 In macrophages, TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8 can recognise single strand RNA from viruses such as SARS-COV-2 and initiate signalling through BTK-dependent activation of NF-kB and IRF3, triggering the production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 5,6,7,8 In support of the role of BTK inhibition, therapeutic inhibition of BTK in patients with lymphoid malignancies results in decreased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Similar findings have been observed in mouse influenza models, where BTK inhibition also decreased these inflammatory mediators and rescued mice from lethal acute lung injury.

ONTRUZANT is available in both 150 mg single-dose vials and 420 mg multiple-dose vials.

ONTRUZANT will be introduced in the U.S. at a list price (wholesaler acquisition cost) of approximately $1,325 for the 150 mg single-dose vial and $3,709 for the 420 mg multiple-dose vial (prices are rounded), representing a 15% discount to the current list price of Herceptin. Wholesaler acquisition costs do not include discounts to payers, providers, distributors and other purchasing organizations.

ONTRUZANT is indicated for adjuvant treatment of HER2 overexpressing node positive or node negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature) breast cancer as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel; as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin; as a single agent following multi-modality anthracycline based therapy. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product. Serious and sometimes fatal side effects have been reported with trastuzumab products. Subclinical and clinical cardiac failure have been reported. The incidence and severity were highest in patients receiving trastuzumab with anthracycline-containing regimens. Discontinue ONTRUZANT treatment for cardiomyopathy. Administration of ONTRUZANT can result in serious and fatal infusion reactions and pulmonary toxicity. Discontinue ONTRUZANT for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Exposure to ONTRUZANT during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios, in some cases complicated by pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. Exacerbation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia can also occur. Detection of HER2 protein overexpression is necessary for selection of patients appropriate for ONTRUZANT therapy.

ONTRUZANT is being launched in the U.S. by Merck as part of a development and commercialization agreement with Samsung Bioepis. Under terms of the agreement, Samsung Bioepis is responsible for preclinical and clinical development, process development and manufacturing, clinical trials and regulatory registration. Merck will be responsible for all commercialization activities for products approved in its partnered territories, including the U.S.

ONTRUZANT was approved by the FDA in January 2019 based on the review of Samsung Bioepis’ comprehensive data package, which included extensive structural and functional analytical data, nonclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic data, and a comparative clinical study demonstrating that ONTRUZANT is highly similar to its reference product, Herceptin, in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product.

On Feb. 5, 2020, Merck announced that it intends to spin-off products from its Women’s Health, trusted Legacy Brands and Biosimilars businesses, including ONTRUZANT, into a new, independent, publicly-traded company. Merck will continue to fully support the commercialization of ONTRUZANT until the spinoff, which is intended to take place in the first half of 2021, at which time ONTRUZANT will become a product of the new company.

ONTRUZANT Indications and Usage

Adjuvant Breast Cancer

ONTRUZANT is indicated for adjuvant treatment of HER2-overexpressing node-positive or node negative (ER/PR-negative or with one high-risk feature) breast cancer:

As part of a treatment regimen containing doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel
As part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin
As a single agent following multimodality anthracycline-based therapy
Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product.

As a single agent for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease
Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product.

Metastatic Gastric Cancer

ONTRUZANT is indicated, in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease.

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product.

Selected Safety Information

Cardiomyopathy

Administration of trastuzumab products can result in subclinical and clinical cardiac failure. The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving a trastuzumab product with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. In a pivotal adjuvant breast cancer trial, one patient who developed congestive heart failure (CHF) died of cardiomyopathy.
Evaluate left ventricular function in all patients prior to and during treatment with ONTRUZANT. Discontinue ONTRUZANT treatment in patients receiving adjuvant therapy and withhold ONTRUZANT in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function.
Infusion Reactions; Pulmonary Toxicity

Administration of trastuzumab products can result in serious and fatal infusion reactions and pulmonary toxicity. Symptoms usually occur during or within 24 hours of administration. Interrupt ONTRUZANT infusion for dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension. Monitor patients until symptoms completely resolve. Discontinue ONTRUZANT for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Exposure to trastuzumab products during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.
Warnings and Precautions

Cardiomyopathy

Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death. Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

There is a 4 to 6-fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline.

Withhold ONTRUZANT for ≥ 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and ≥ 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. The safety of continuation or resumption of ONTRUZANT in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied.

Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping ONTRUZANT may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction.

Cardiac Monitoring:Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended:

Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of ONTRUZANT
LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of ONTRUZANT
Repeat LVEF measurement at 4-week intervals if ONTRUZANT is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction.
LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of ONTRUZANT as a component of adjuvant therapy.
Infusion Reactions

Infusion reactions consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and chills, and on occasion included nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, rash, and asthenia.

In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction.

Interrupt ONTRUZANT infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions.

There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications.

Embryo-fetal Toxicity

Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death.

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ONTRUZANT. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to ONTRUZANT during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of ONTRUZANT.

Pulmonary Toxicity

Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity.

Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia

In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not.

Drug Interactions

Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction because of trastuzumab’s long washout period based on population PK Analysis. If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab products. If anthracyclines are used, the patient’s cardiac function should be monitored carefully.

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity.

In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) that were increased (≥ 5% difference) in the patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia.

Use in Specific Populations

Lactation

There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother’s clinical need for ONTRUZANT treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ONTRUZANT or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months.

Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of trastuzumab products in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Trastuzumab has been studied in patients who were 65 years of age or over in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer treatment settings. The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease, or adjuvant therapy.

Ortho’s COVID-19 total antibody test can help determine who can responsibly be permitted to go back to work by aiding in the identification of currently infected or previously exposed individuals who may have developed immunity.

The test can also help screen plasma donations for convalescent plasma therapy, which helps critically ill patients fight the virus, help medical professionals and epidemiologists better understand the spread of the disease, and is an important tool for aiding vaccine development efforts to monitor immune responsiveness. When coupled with information from a molecular test, which detects active infection, it can monitor disease progression by measuring when antibodies appear in the blood.

“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact individuals, families, and communities around the world,” said Chris Smith, chief executive officer, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. “Ortho is proud to be working toward large-scale solutions that will help people return to work, reducing the strain on both employees and the economy as a whole. Our focus on improving patients’ lives through diagnostics led us to rapidly develop this test, providing the one of the key resources needed for diagnosing and treating COVID-19. We remain committed to helping laboratories deliver fast, accurate, reliable results to healthcare professionals, patients and the researchers developing the long-term, sustainable management of this disease.”

The tests can be run on Ortho’s flagship laboratory analyzer, the VITROS® XT 7600 Integrated System, the VITROS® 3600 Immunodiagnostic System, the VITROS® 5600 Integrated System and will soon be available on VITROS® ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic Systems.i VITROS Systems, already installed in more than 1,000 hospitals and reference labs in the U.S., are self-contained and do not require an external water source to run, offering labs placement flexibility.

A limited quantity of tests kits have already been shipped to areas of highest priority. Ortho will be in full production in the coming weeks and plans to manufacture several million SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests over the next month, with rapid production expansion following thereafter.

Following Ortho’s April 3 launch of the test under the FDA’s notification pathway for serology tests, Ortho further worked with the FDA to secure additional review of the data under its Emergency Use Authorization pathway, which allows the FDA to expedite review and authorization of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests to rapidly expand testing capacity during the COVID-19 public health emergency.

The VITROS® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are designed and solely intended to be performed by laboratory professionals and cannot be directly used by patients as they are not for home use.

Questions from laboratories, healthcare providers, government, or media regarding the COVID-19 antibody test can be directed to: OrthoCOVID19Test@orthoclinicaldiagnostics.com.

*High Throughput: If an instrument has high throughput, it can output a large number of test results in a short period of time. When running infectious disease tests such as our COVID-19 tests, Ortho’s instruments can process up to 150 tests per hour.

If an instrument is fully automated, it doesn’t require a lab employee to perform each test by hand. Instead, each patient tube is loaded in bulk into the instrument, and the instrument automatically mixes the patient sample with test solutions. The ensuing chemical reaction provides the patient result. That result is automatically sent to the hospital’s laboratory information systems and ultimately, the physician.

This antibody test adds to Abbott’s existing COVID-19 tests that are already being used, including its m2000™ molecular laboratory system and its ID NOW™ molecular point-of-care device.

“We continue to contribute in a significant and meaningful way by providing new solutions across our diagnostics testing platforms,” said Robert B. Ford, president and chief executive officer, Abbott. “I’m extremely proud of the many Abbott people who are working around the clock to get as many tests as we can to healthcare workers and patients.”

Antibody tests to expand testing and help healthcare workers
While molecular testing detects whether someone has the virus, antibody tests determine if someone was previously infected.

Abbott’s SARS-CoV-2 IgG test identifies the IgG antibody, which is a protein that the body produces in the late stages of infection and may remain for up to months and possibly years after a person has recovered. Abbott’s IgG antibody test will initially be available on its ARCHITECT® i1000SR and i2000SR laboratory instruments*. More than 2,000 of these instruments are in use in U.S. laboratories. These instruments can run up to 100-200 tests per hour.

Abbott is making the test available as part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notification without an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway outlined in Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency. Additionally, Abbott plans to file an EUA submission with the FDA and plans to CE Mark to the IVD Directive (98/79/EC) in the European Union.

Abbott is significantly scaling up its manufacturing for antibody testing and is expecting to immediately ship close to 1 million tests this week to U.S. customers, and will ship a total of 4 million tests in total for April. The company is ramping up to 20 million tests in the U.S. in June and beyond as it expands the tests to run on its new Alinity™ i system. Abbott also will be expanding its laboratory antibody testing to the detection of the antibody, IgM, in the near future.

Scaled using Microsoft Azure, GE Healthcare’s Mural Virtual Care Solution allows clinicians to view numerous ventilated patients simultaneously and remotely; enables early identification of patients at risk of deterioration

CHICAGO – April 15, 2020 – GE Healthcare today introduced a new software solution to support clinicians and health systems in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The company is bringing its Mural Virtual Care Solution, which is designed to give hospitals a broad view across their ventilated patient population and help identify patients at risk of deterioration, to the highly secure and trusted Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This is the latest step in the ongoing collaboration between GE Healthcare and Microsoft.

As more patients enter health systems for COVID-19 treatment, hospitals face increased demands on clinical resources. The Mural Virtual Care Solution 1,2 helps ease this pressure by enabling clinical surveillance of intensive care unit (ICU) patients – including those on mechanical ventilation – in a central place, giving a comprehensive view of each patient’s data across the hospital network.

“As both large and small hospitals treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients, the strain on healthcare providers and systems will be unprecedented,” said GE Healthcare President and CEO Kieran Murphy. “Not only is GE Healthcare providing critically important medical devices to address this global challenge, but we are also rapidly scaling technologies to aid clinicians in delivering safe, effective and efficient care. We are excited to have a partner like Microsoft to help us arm clinicians with the software tools they need.”

A Mural installation across a 100-bed multi-site ICU network is monitored by three senior nurses and two intensivists around the clock. With a potential shortage of intensivists and bedside caregivers, Mural supports these teams by enabling additional oversight of patients across the hospital network. Bringing together near real-time data3 from ventilators, patient monitoring systems, electronic medical records, labs and other systems, Mural allows one clinician to monitor several patients at once, supplementing existing monitoring devices in patients’ rooms. Remote surveillance may also reduce clinicians’ exposure to COVID-19, while maintaining a broad view of patients across the hospital.

“Now more than ever we need to manage a greater number of ventilated patients with limited resources. Mural Virtual Care on Microsoft Azure allows for remote management and surveillance of ventilated patients at scale,” said Microsoft Global Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Rhew.

In addition to real-time remote management, Mural also enables health systems to activate care protocols relevant to treating COVID-19 patients and help caregivers ensure those protocols are being followed. Customized with hospitals to provide data and calculations based on their care protocols, Mural can also help identify patients needing intervention. This includes ventilation and lung injury management for patients on extended mechanical ventilation support. The technology can be used by hospitals or health systems of any size, and Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), for example, has deployed the solution.

“Facing the daunting outlook of a COVID-19 surge, it is imperative that I and my fellow healthcare workers use virtual ICU technology to safely monitor and care for our sickest patients while preserving PPE,” said Matthias Merkel, M.D., Ph.D., OHSU’s Chief Medical Capacity Officer, Vice Chair of Critical Care Medicine, and Professor of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine. “Remaining closely connected and supported through technology enables us to progress our patients’ care across a geographic distance that we would otherwise be unable to manage.”

By powering Mural with Azure, GE Healthcare will give health systems access to an affordable and highly secure solution that can be deployed and scaled quickly. Through January 31, 2021, GE Healthcare is waiving Mural software subscription charges. More information can be found at: www.gehealthcare.com/mural.

Regeneron is now utilizing VelociSuite technology to treat COVID-19 with the expected initiation of the clinical trial in June","TARRYTOWN, N.Y., April 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ —

REGN-EB3 developed via same rapid response platform currently being leveraged to develop novel COVID-19 antibody therapy
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review a new Biologics License Application (BLA) for REGN-EB3, an investigational triple antibody cocktail treatment for Ebola virus infection. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 25, 2020.

The REGN-EB3 BLA is supported by data from the randomized, controlled PALM clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In August 2019, the trial was stopped early when preliminary results showed that REGN-EB3 crossed the pre-specified superiority threshold for preventing death compared to the control arm, ZMapp. REGN-EB3 demonstrated superior efficacy compared to ZMapp across multiple measures, including reduced mortality and fewer days until the Ebola virus was no longer detected in the bloodstream.

“Developed using Regeneron’s proprietary VelociSuite® rapid response technologies, REGN-EB3 was shown to save lives in the PALM trial, which evaluated multiple therapies against the current standard of care,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “Regeneron is now applying this same approach to develop an antibody medicine that can potentially prevent and treat COVID-19, with initial clinical trials expected to begin in June.”

Regeneron’s VelociSuite technologies enable the efficient creation and selection of potent fully-human antibodies against a specific biological target, which is particularly critical for addressing new and/or quickly-spreading pathogens such as Ebola and COVID-19. These technologies facilitate the rapid cloning and generation of optimized fully-human antibodies from both VelocImmune® mice (which are genetically-engineered to have genetically-humanized immune systems) and convalescing human volunteers, and allow for the rapid escalation of fully-human antibodies into manufacturing-quality cell line production and large-scale bioreactor manufacturing. Once strong therapeutic antibody candidates are identified, the company’s in-house preclinical, clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities allow for fast scale-up and flexibility to adapt to current need.

REGN-EB3 has received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. It is being developed under an ongoing collaboration and with funding provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USG Contract Nos. HHSO100201700016C and HHSO100201500013C).

Sanofi to leverage its global distribution network to ensure global availability, subject to relevant regulatory approvals.
 

PARIS – April 16, 2020 – Sanofi and Luminostics have signed an agreement to evaluate a collaboration on a unique self-testing solution for COVID-19, using Luminostics’ innovative technology, and further adding to Sanofi’s ongoing efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic on multiple fronts.

Luminostics would contribute its proprietary technology for consumer-diagnostics for COVID-19 testing while Sanofi would bring its clinical research testing experience and capabilities. The goal is to provide a smartphone-based solution that eliminates the current need for healthcare professional administration or laboratory tests.

“This partnering project could lead to another important milestone in Sanofi’s fight against COVID-19. The development of a self-testing solution with Luminostics could help provide clarity to an individual – in minutes – on whether or not they are infected” says Alan Main, Executive Vice President, Head of Sanofi Consumer Healthcare. “Following this week’s announcement of an unprecedented partnership with GSK in the hunt for a vaccine, our company’s ambition is to continue to find other ways to help solve this pandemic situation.” 

The goal of this collaboration is to provide a consumer-based test that can detect the COVID-19 virus with high sensitivity and specificity from respiratory samples. The total time from specimen collection to results is expected in the range of 30 minutes or less. It is based on Luminostics’ unique technology that utilizes a consumer smartphone’s optics, controlled by an iOS/Android app paired with an inexpensive adapter, in combination with “glow-in-the-dark” nanochemistry and signal processing artificial intelligence.

The diagnostic platform is composed of:

an iOS/Android app to instruct a user on how to run the test, capture and process data to display test results, and then to connect users with a telehealth service based on the results;
a reusable adapter compatible with most types of smartphones; and
consumables for specimen collection, preparation, and processing.
During the current COVID-19 crisis it became obvious that rapid, reliable mass testing is one of the key strategies for successful containment of a pandemic outbreak. While point-of-care tests were made available relatively quickly – although not in a sufficient quantity – no over-the-counter (OTC) self-testing solution is currently available. A rapid self-testing solution would come with multiple advantages, including:

easy access and availability to patients at thousands of points-of-sale including e-commerce;
no further interpersonal contact necessary to conduct the testing, thereby lowering the infection risk for patient, HCP, and laboratory staff; and
immediate availability of results allowing fast decision making, providing consumers both public health and out-of-pocket cost benefits.
As one of the leading companies in the fight against COVID-19, Sanofi is already engaged in multiple clinical trials evaluating current treatment options (Kevzara® and Plaquenil®) in patients suffering from COVID-19 as well as two vaccine programs.

Based on Luminostics’ existing technology and protypes, both companies envisage to start development activities in the coming weeks. In parallel, both parties expect to execute a final collaboration agreement including a plan for accelerated ramp up of necessary manufacturing capabilities. If development activities can be successfully conducted, the aim is to have an OTC self-testing solution ready before the end of 2020, subject to obtaining required regulatory clearances.

The detection of these antibodies could help indicate if a person has gained immunity against the virus and inform treatment decisions
Roche aims to have this test available by early May, in countries accepting the CE mark1 and is actively working with the US Food and Drug Administration for an Emergency Use Authorisation2

Basel, 17 April 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the development and upcoming launch of its Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test to detect antibodies in people who have been exposed to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the COVID-19 disease.

Antibody testing is central to help identify people who have been infected by the virus, especially those who may have been infected but did not display symptoms.³ Additionally, the test can support priority screening of high risk groups, such as healthcare workers, food supply workers who might already have developed a certain level of immunity and can continue serving and/or return to work. Once we understand more about the immunity of COVID-19, it could also help society return faster to normality.

Severin Schwan, CEO Roche Group: “Following the launch of our high-volume PCR test in mid-March to detect active infection of the disease, we are now going to launch a new antibody test in early May. Every reliable test on the market serves its purpose for healthcare systems to help us overcome this pandemic. Roche is collaborating closely with health authorities and ramping up production to ensure fast availability of the test globally.”

“Roche is deeply committed to supporting the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Timely availability and fast access to reliable, high quality tests are essential for healthcare systems. The antibody test is an important next step in the fight against COVID-19. Roche’s antibody test can be quickly scaled and made broadly available around the world as our instrument infrastructure is already in place.”

The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay is an in vitro test, using human serum and plasma drawn from a blood sample, to detect antibodies and determine the body’s immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2. The test may be used in epidemiological research to help better understand the spread of the disease and may also be used together with molecular tests to aid in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers, which are widely available in laboratories around the world.

Roche aims to have the antibody test available by early May in countries accepting the CE mark and is actively working with the FDA for an Emergency Use Authorisation. Roche is planning on an accelerated ramp up of monthly production to high double-digit million tests by June and will further scale up production as fast as possible.

About SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus)
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has not previously been identified in humans.

Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and fever. In more severe cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death can occur.

To control the spread of the infection, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness.

About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test
Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the in vitro detection of antibodies (including IgG) to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test can detect antibodies to the coronavirus, which could signal whether a person has been already infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers which are widely available around the world. These fully-automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.⁴

Under the terms of the agreement, BARDA will fund the advancement of mRNA-1273 to FDA licensure. A Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Phase 1 open-label study, which began on March 16, 2020 has completed enrollment of the original study: 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years in three dose cohorts (25 µg, 100 µg and 250 µg). The NIH recently amended the Phase 1 protocol to include an additional six cohorts: three cohorts of older adults (ages 51-70) and three cohorts of elderly adults (age 71 and above). Enrollment for these cohorts is ongoing.

If supported by safety data from the Phase 1 study, the Company intends to begin a Phase 2 study of mRNA-1273 under its own Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second quarter of 2020. Subject to data from these studies and discussions with regulators, a Phase 3 study could begin as soon as fall, 2020. BARDA funding will support these late-stage clinical development programs, as well as the scale-up of mRNA-1273 manufacture in 2020 to enable potential pandemic response.

To support the scale-up, Moderna plans to hire up to 150 new team members in the U.S. this year. This includes a significant increase in its skilled manufacturing staff to expand manufacturing capacity from two shifts per day, 5 days per week to three shifts per day, 7 days per week, engineers to manage process scale-up, and clinical and regulatory staff to support clinical development.

“We are thankful for BARDA’s support to fund the accelerated development of mRNA-1273, our vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “Time is of the essence to provide a vaccine against this pandemic virus. By investing now in our manufacturing process scale-up to enable large scale production for pandemic response, we believe that we would be able to supply millions of doses per month in 2020 and with further investments, tens of millions per month in 2021, if the vaccine candidate is successful in the clinic.”

“Vaccines are a critical tool for saving lives and stopping the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” said BARDA Director Rick Bright, Ph.D. “Delivering a safe and effective vaccine for a rapidly spreading virus requires accelerated action. BARDA’s goal is to have vaccine available as quickly as possible and preparing now for advanced stage clinical trials and production scale-up while the Phase 1 is underway could shave months off development of COVID-19 vaccines.”

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. A summary of the Company’s work to date on SARS-CoV-2 can be found here.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the Company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,400 participants have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across six Phase 1 studies, the Company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has nine development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)
RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)
Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)
Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for seven prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV and Zika). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

 Based on two P-III studies and ongoing P-Ib study, the company is planning for regulatory interactions in the US, EU and Japan. In Nov’2019, NMPA has accepted the NDA for the therapy to treat non-pancreatic NET and granted PR designation in Dec’2019
 Surufatinib is a novel, oral angio-immuno kinase inhibitor act by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity associated with VEGFR and FGFR and has received FDA’s ODD for pancreatic NET in Nov’2019","LONDON, April 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Hutchison China MediTech Limited (“Chi-Med”) (Nasdaq/AIM: HCM) today announces that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted two Fast Track Designations for the development of surufatinib, for the treatment of both advanced and progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (“NET”) and extra-pancreatic (non-pancreatic) NET in patients who are not amenable for surgery.

The FDA Fast Track Designation is one of several approaches utilized by the U.S. FDA to expedite development and review of potential medicines for serious conditions and that fulfill unmet medical needs. A potential new medicine may fill an unmet medical need by being the first therapy to address a specific serious condition, offer clinically significant advantages over available therapies, act via a different mechanism of action than available therapies, or have a benefit in patients who are unresponsive to or intolerant of available therapies. Programs that receive Fast Track Designation are entitled to more frequent interactions with the U.S. FDA on drug development plan, as well as eligibility for accelerated approval, priority review, and rolling review.1

About Surufatinib

Surufatinib is a novel, oral angio-immuno kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity associated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (“VEGFR”) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), which both inhibit angiogenesis, and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which regulates tumor-associated macrophages, promoting the body’s immune response against tumor cells. Its unique dual mechanism of action may be very suitable for possible combinations with other immunotherapies.

Chi-Med currently retains all rights to surufatinib worldwide.

Neuroendocrine tumors in the U.S., Europe and Japan: We are preparing for regulatory interactions in the U.S., Europe and Japan to confirm clinical development and path to registration, based on the encouraging data from the two positive Phase III studies of surufatinib in NET in China, and the ongoing multi-cohort Phase Ib study in the U.S. (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02549937). In addition to the aforementioned grants of Fast Track Designation in pancreatic and non-pancreatic NET in the U.S., surufatinib was granted Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic NET in November 2019.

Non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in China: In November 2019, an NDA for surufatinib for the treatment of patients with advanced extra-pancreatic (non-pancreatic) neuroendocrine tumors was accepted for review by the China NMPA and granted Priority Review status in December 2019. The NDA is supported by data from the successful SANET-ep study, a Phase III study of surufatinib in advanced neuroendocrine tumors – extra-pancreatic patients in China for whom there is no effective therapy. A 198-patient interim analysis was conducted in June 2019, leading the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (“IDMC”) to determine that the study met the pre-defined primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) and should be stopped early. The positive results of this trial were highlighted in an oral presentation at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02588170).

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in China: In 2016, we initiated the SANET-p study, which is a pivotal Phase III study in patients with low- or intermediate-grade, advanced pancreatic NET in China. A second NDA for surufatinib for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic NET is being prepared for submission, following an interim analysis review conducted in January 2020 by the IDMC that recommended that registrational study be terminated early as the pre-defined primary endpoint of PFS had already been met (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02589821). Study results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference.

Biliary tract cancer in China: In March 2019, we initiated a Phase IIb/III study comparing surufatinib with capecitabine in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer whose disease progressed on first-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS) (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03873532).

Immunotherapy combinations: In November 2018 and September 2019, we entered into collaboration agreements to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of surufatinib in combination with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies. This included global collaborations to evaluate the combination of surufatinib with Tuoyi®, approved in China by Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co. Ltd, and with Tyvyt®, approved in China by Innovent Biologics, Inc.

About Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET)

Neuroendocrine tumors form in cells that interact with the nervous system or in glands that produce hormones. They can originate in various parts of the body, most often in the gut or the lungs and can be benign or malignant. Neuroendocrine tumors are typically classified as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Approved targeted therapies include Sutent® and Afinitor® for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, or well-differentiated, non-functional gastrointestinal or lung neuroendocrine tumors.

According to Frost and Sullivan, there were 19,000 newly diagnosed cases of neuroendocrine tumors in the U.S. in 2018. Importantly, neuroendocrine tumors are associated with a relatively long duration of survival compared to other tumors. As a result, there were approximately 141,000 estimated patients living with neuroendocrine tumors in the U.S. in 2018 of which over 90%, or approximately 132,000, were non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients.

In China, there were approximately 67,600 newly diagnosed neuroendocrine tumor patients in 2018 and, considering the current incidence to prevalence ratio in China, potentially as many as 300,000 patients living with the disease in the country2. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the patients living with neuroendocrine tumors in China are non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients.

Novartis has a broad COVID-19 research and development commitment, including multiple large sponsored and investigator initiated clinical trials of its medicines
Basel, April 20, 2020 — Novartis has reached an agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to proceed with a Phase III clinical trial with approximately 440 patients to evaluate the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. The clinical trial drug supply will be provided by Sandoz, the generics and biosimilars division of Novartis.

The large trial sponsored by Novartis will be conducted at more than a dozen sites in the United States. Novartis plans to begin enrollment for this study within the next few weeks and is committed to reporting results as soon as possible. To help achieve broad access to hydroxychloroquine as quickly as possible in these extraordinary circumstances, Novartis will make any intellectual property within our control that relates to the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19 available through non-exclusive voluntary licenses, appropriate waivers, or similar mechanisms.

“We recognize the importance of answering the scientific question of whether hydroxychloroquine will be beneficial for patients with COVID-19 disease,” said John Tsai, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “We mobilized quickly to address this question in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.”

As the new virus continues to spread and claim lives around the globe, doctors and patients are eager for treatment options. In some cases, clinicians are evaluating drugs that have been approved for other diseases, hoping that these will also work against COVID-19.

Patients in the trial will be randomized into three groups. The first group or arm will receive hydroxychloroquine. The second group will receive hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, which is an antibiotic therapy. The third group will receive placebo. Patients in all treatment groups are receiving standard of care for COVID-19. Researchers at the company compressed months of work into a few weeks to design the large clinical trial in order to rapidly respond to the need for COVID-19 disease treatments.

The clinical trial complements a commitment by Novartis, through Sandoz, to donate up to 130 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine to supply global clinical research efforts in the event the medicine is proven beneficial for treatment of COVID-19. Sandoz has already donated 30 million tablets to the US Department of Health and Human Services and is dispatching futher shipments to countries based on requests from governments around the world.

“We are donating hydroxychloroquine tablets for COVID-19 patients including for use in this and other clinical trials with the hope that researchers and healthcare workers can quickly and scientifically determine whether hydroxychloroquine can help patients around the world combat this disease,” said Richard Saynor, CEO of Sandoz. “We will continue to fulfill orders for existing customers to ensure the medicine remains available to US patients who rely on it for other indicated uses.”

As part of its research and development commitment, Novartis has formed a clinical investigation team to provide rapid access for approved clinical requests and support of clinical evaluation of its medicines to be repurposed and address the needs of patients with COVID-19 infections. In addition to hydroxychloroquine, Novartis plans to sponsor or co-sponsor clinical trials to study ruxolitinib and canakinumab for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections. Requests for investigator-initiated trials have been granted for COVID-19-related clinical studies of ruxolitinib, canakinumab, imatinib mesylate, secukinumab, hydroxychloroquine and valsartan.

About hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 
The drug hydroxychloroquine has garnered interest in the medical community after showing preliminary promise in small clinical studies, including one with co-administration with the antibiotic azithromycin.1 In addition, hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory tests.2,3 Hydroxychloroquine has long been used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases.4

Novartis commitment and response to COVID-19
Novartis is deeply dedicated to the global effort to combat COVID-19 and doing our part to support the stability of global healthcare systems. We announced a broad set of measures including the creation of a global fund of USD 20 million to support communities around the world impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Novartis also has committed 130 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to support pandemic response. In addition, Novartis joined two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership organized by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis is separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines.

 The sBLA is based on ENSEMBLE PLUS study, which demonstrated comparable frequency and severity of IRRs for a 2hrs. OCREVUS infusion time vs the currently approved 3.5hrs in patients with RRMS. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given 2wks. apart and a subsequent dose single 600mg infusions were administered over a shorter, 2hrs. time
 The FDA and the EC are anticipated to make decisions on the applications by H2’20. Ocrevus is a mAb targeting CD20-positive B cells and is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including RRMS and active/ relapsing, SPMS, in addition to CIS in the US) and PPMS","Reduces infusion time to 2 hours from the current 3.5 hours for patients with relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis, if approved
Applications are based on data from the randomised, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study, showing consistent safety to the currently approved OCREVUS dosing regimen
 
Basel, 20 April 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the application for a two-hour OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab) infusion time, dosed twice yearly for relapsing or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).

“With more than 150,000 people treated with OCREVUS, the twice-yearly dosing schedule has benefited many MS patients and their physicians, as indicated by more than 90 percent* of patients continuing with treatment through one year,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We hope a shorter infusion time will further improve the experience for people living with MS while also increasing capacity in healthcare systems.”

The regulatory applications are based on data from the randomised, double-blind ENSEMBLE PLUS study, which showed comparable frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) for a two-hour OCREVUS infusion time vs. the currently approved 3.5-hour time in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). The first dose was administered per the approved dosing schedule (two 300 mg intravenous (IV) infusions separated by two weeks) and the second or later doses (600 mg IV infusion) were administered over a shorter, two-hour time. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients with IRRs following the first randomised 600 mg infusion (frequency/severity assessed during and 24-hours post infusion). No patients discontinued the study due to an IRR and no new safety signals were detected.

Detailed data will be presented at the earliest opportunity. The FDA and the European Commission are expected to make decisions on these applications by the end of 2020.

With rapidly growing real-world experience and more than 150,000 patients treated globally, OCREVUS has twice-yearly (six-monthly) dosing and is the first and only therapy approved for RMS (including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and active, or relapsing, secondary progressive MS, in addition to clinically isolated syndrome in the U.S.) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). OCREVUS is approved in 90 countries across North America, South America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, as well as in Australia, Switzerland and the European Union.

About OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab)
OCREVUS is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including RRMS and active, or relapsing, SPMS, in addition to CIS in the U.S.) and PPMS. OCREVUS is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with MS. Based on preclinical studies, OCREVUS binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, suggesting that important functions of the immune system may be preserved. OCREVUS is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions.

The study is sponsored by the Incyte in the US and Novartis outside the US
 The composite 1EP is the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure (require mechanical ventilation) or require ICU care by day 29. The 2EPs includes evaluation of clinical status using a 9-point ordinal scale, in-hospital outcomes, change in the NEWS2, change in SpO2/FiO2 ratio, proportion of patients with no oxygen therapy and safety
 Additionally, Incyte is initiating an emergency EAP in the US, allowing patients to receive ruxolitinib while it is being investigated. Jakafi is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved by the US FDA for PV in adults who have had an inadequate response to hydroxyurea, in adults with intermediate/high-risk MF, including primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF, post-essential thrombocythemia MF and for steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients aged ≥12 yrs.","– Expanded Access Program allowing additional eligible patients with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm to receive ruxolitinib is also open for enrollment in the United States

WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 17, 2020– Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced the initiation of RUXCOVID, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib (Jakafi®) plus standard-of-care (SoC) in patients aged ≥12 years with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm. The collaborative study is sponsored by Incyte in the United States and Novartis outside of the United States.

The composite primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure (require mechanical ventilation) or require intensive care unit (ICU) care by Day 29. Secondary endpoints comprise various efficacy assessments including evaluation of clinical status using a 9-point ordinal scale; in-hospital outcomes (mortality rate; proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation; duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation); change in the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2); change in SpO2/FiO2 ratio; proportion of patients with no oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation of ≥94% on room air); and safety. RUXCOVID will enroll approximately 400 patients globally.

Additionally, given the urgent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, Incyte is also initiating a separate emergency Expanded Access Program (EAP) in the United States. The protocol will allow eligible patients with severe COVID-19 associated cytokine storm to receive ruxolitinib while it is being investigated for this indication.

“There is an unprecedented unmet medical need for treatments that prevent or reduce severe COVID-19 related complications to improve outcomes for patients and alleviate the overwhelming pressure on the global healthcare system,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Incyte. “We thank the FDA for the expedited review of the RUXCOVID study and hope to enroll this important clinical trial as quickly as possible to determine the potential utility of ruxolitinib for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.”

RUXCOVID is the first Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in patients with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.

At present, there is ample commercial and clinical supply of ruxolitinib in the United States to meet the needs of U.S. patients receiving ruxolitinib in its approved indications and those participating in clinical trials. Incyte is increasing manufacturing efforts to respond to anticipated supply needs related to COVID-19 studies and working closely with distribution partners to monitor the supply of ruxolitinib.

About COVID-19 Associated Cytokine Storm
Cytokine storm is a severe immune overreaction that can be triggered by a viral infection and can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm who experience these complications often require intensive care, including intubation and the use of mechanical ventilation, and are at an increased risk of mortality.

Emerging evidence suggests that regulating overactive signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway during a cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 could be a potential treatment approach, and it is hypothesized that ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, may be able to play a role in treating these patients.

Currently, there is limited clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm, and ruxolitinib is not FDA-approved for this use.

About RUXCOVID
RUXCOVID is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 29-day, multi-center Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib plus standard of care (SoC) therapy in patients aged ≥12 years with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm compared to placebo plus SoC therapy.

The composite primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure (require mechanical ventilation), or require intensive care unit (ICU) care by Day 29. Secondary endpoints are comprised of various efficacy assessments including evaluation of clinical status using a 9-point ordinal scale; in-hospital outcomes (mortality rate; proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation; duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation); change in the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2); change in SpO2/FiO2 ratio; proportion of patients with no oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation of ≥94% on room air); and safety.

Eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral ruxolitinib 5mg twice daily (BID) or oral-matching placebo for a total of 14 days. Study treatment will be given in combination with SoC therapy according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. After 14 days of therapy, should clinical signs or symptoms not improve or worsen, and the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks, patients may receive an additional 14 days of study therapy. In total, patients will be followed on study for 29 days post-randomization.

The RUXCOVID study is sponsored by Incyte in the United States, and Novartis outside of the United States.

About the Ruxolitinib Expanded Access Program (EAP) in COVID-19
The ruxolitinib Expanded Access Program (EAP) in COVID-19 for patients with severe COVID-19 associated cytokine storm allows eligible patients to receive ruxolitinib while it is being investigated in COVID-19 patients. Patients must be unable to participate in other clinical trials of ruxolitinib in COVID-19 to qualify for this EAP.

Esperion Therapeutics’ Commitment to Patients with Hyperlipidemia

High levels of LDL-C can lead to a build-up of fat and cholesterol in and on artery walls (known as atherosclerosis), potentially leading to cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke. In the U.S., 96 million people, or more than 37 percent of the adult population, have elevated LDL-C. There are approximately 18 million people in the U.S. living with elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy — including individuals considered statin averse — leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events.1 In the United States, more than 50 percent of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) patients and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) patients who are not able to reach their guideline recommended LDL-C levels with statins alone need less than a 40 percent reduction to reach their LDL-C threshold goal.2

Esperion’s mission as the Lipid Management Company is to deliver oral, once-daily medicines that complement existing oral drugs to provide the additional LDL-C lowering that these patients need.

– Global study to enroll approximately 270 adults with COVID-19 and severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome –

– Company maintains commitment to supplying its medicines to patients for currently approved indications –

BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 20, 2020– Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced plans to initiate a global Phase 3 study to investigate ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab-cwvz) in a subset of adults with COVID-19 – those who are hospitalized with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study is expected to enroll approximately 270 patients across countries with high numbers of diagnosed cases, beginning in May, and will evaluate the impact of ULTOMIRIS, a biologic medicine, on survival, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital stay compared to best supportive care. This follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) rapid review and acceptance of Alexion’s investigational new drug (IND) application for ULTOMIRIS for severe COVID-19.

“Alexion has been in close contact with physicians and global health authorities in an effort to rapidly evaluate the potential of C5 inhibition in treating patients with severe COVID-19,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research & Development at Alexion. “Based on early anecdotal information available from compassionate use cases in multiple countries, we are launching a controlled clinical trial to evaluate the potential of ULTOMIRIS in mitigating the severe pneumonia and lung injury caused by the virus. As we move quickly to initiate this program, we also remain committed to serving the patients who currently rely on our medicines and providing continuous supply to these patients.”

The decision to begin this trial is based on a) published preclinical data suggesting that inhibition of terminal complement can lower cytokine and chemokine levels and significantly reduce lung inflammation and pathology in animal models of viral pneumoniai, and b) elevated complement biomarkers and promising preliminary clinical evidence from patients who have accessed SOLIRIS® (eculizumab) through our compassionate use program, which suggests that complement inhibition may improve coronaviral-mediated lung injury.

Independent investigators have expressed interest in studying the potential of C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and we are aware of several ongoing or planned independent studies and anecdotal results from the use of our C5 inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. While these healthcare professionals continue to aggregate data regarding the potential of terminal complement inhibition in COVID-19 pneumonia from the approximately 100 patients who have been treated so far, Alexion believes that the outcomes reported to date warrant conducting a controlled clinical program to explore the impact of C5 inhibition with ULTOMIRIS and establish clinical evidence supporting the role of terminal complement in coronaviral pneumonia. We believe ULTOMIRIS represents the future of C5 inhibition, with its weight-based dosing, reduced burden on hospital systems due to less frequent dosing and it can be manufactured at a higher capacity, providing the opportunity to better meet future supply demands.

About the Phase 3 Study

The Phase 3 open-label, randomized, controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in approximately 270 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and severe pneumonia, acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Study participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive ULTOMIRIS or best supportive care. The primary endpoint is survival at Day 29. Secondary endpoints will assess the need for mechanical ventilation, oxygenation, duration of ICU stay and hospitalization, and safety, among others.

Patients in the ULTOMIRIS arm will receive a weight-based loading dose of ULTOMIRIS on Day 1 (2400mg for patients weighing 40-60kg, 2700mg for 60-100kg, or 3000mg for ≥100kg). Follow-up dosing on Days 5, 10 and 15 will also be weight-based; patients weighing 40 to 60kg will receive 600mg of ULTOMIRIS and patients weighing 60kg or more will receive 900mg of ULTOMIRIS. All patients will continue to receive medications, therapies, and interventions per standard hospital treatment protocols for the duration of the study. Following the 4-week treatment period, there will be safety follow-up monitoring for three months.

Expanded Access Programs

In recognition of the urgent needs of some patients and in order to streamline the emergency access process, Alexion has opened emergency Expanded Access Programs (EAP) in the U.S. and France for SOLIRIS in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All requests for a hospital to be included in the EAP must be made by a treating physician and can be submitted to covid.requests@alexion.com.

Access & Supply Considerations

Alexion’s focus has always been on developing transformative medicines for patients with rare and ultra-rare diseases that typically affect several hundred to a few thousand patients worldwide. Like all of our medicines, ULTOMIRIS is a biologic medicine, which are very large complex molecules made up of genetically engineered proteins that are manufactured in living cells through a highly complicated process that requires significant time, expertise and precision. During this global health crisis, we have taken proactive measures that are designed to mitigate the risk of potential supply interruptions, and we strive to maintain sufficient inventory levels to continue serving current and new patients receiving our medicines for approved rare and ultra-rare indications as well as those participating in ongoing clinical trials.

We recognize that, should the role of C5 in treating severe respiratory complications of COVID-19 be demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial, there is the potential for significantly increased demand for our C5 inhibitors. We have taken steps to significantly increase future supply as part of our efforts to prepare for this and other potential scenarios that may arise so that we are ready to support access and the anticipated increased supply demand. In the meantime, Alexion will continue to monitor and manage the production of ULTOMIRIS, appropriately taking into consideration the needs of current and new patients, required inventory levels, anticipated potential supply needs related to COVID-19 and the time-intensive and complex manufacturing process to produce monoclonal antibodies while maintaining the company’s rigorous quality standards.

About ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab-cwvz)

ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab-cwvz) is the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor. The medication works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. For currently approved indications, ULTOMIRIS is administered intravenously every eight weeks or every four weeks for pediatric patients less than 20 kg, following a loading dose. ULTOMIRIS is approved in the United States (U.S.), European Union (EU) and Japan as a treatment for adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and in the U.S. for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients.

INDICATIONS & IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ULTOMIRIS®(ravulizumab-cwvz) AND SOLIRIS® (eculizumab)

INDICATIONS

ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS are prescription medicines called monoclonal antibodies. ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS are used to treat adults with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS are also used to treat adults and children with a disease called atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). Neither ULTOMIRIS nor SOLIRIS is for use in treating people with Shiga toxin E. coli related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS).

In addition, SOLIRIS is used to treat adults with a disease called generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive. SOLIRIS is also used to treat adults with a disease called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive.

It is not known if ULTOMIRIS is safe and effective in children with PNH or in children younger than one month of age in aHUS. It is also not known if SOLIRIS is safe and effective in children with PNH, gMG, or NMOSD.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS are medicines that affect the immune system. These medicines can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Both medicines increase the chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early.

Meningococcal vaccines must be received at least two weeks before the first dose of ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS if the patient has not already had this vaccine. If the patient’s doctor decided that urgent treatment is needed, meningococcal vaccination should be administered as soon as possible. If the patient has not been vaccinated and therapy must be initiated immediately, two weeks of antibiotics should also be administered with the vaccinations. If the patient had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, additional vaccination might be needed before starting ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS. Patients should ask their doctor if an additional meningococcal vaccination is needed. Meningococcal vaccines reduce the risk of meningococcal infection but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Patients should be instructed to call their doctor or get emergency medical care right away if any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection occur: headache with nausea or vomiting, headache and fever, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, fever, fever and a rash, confusion, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, and eyes sensitive to light. The doctor will provide a Patient Safety Card about the risk of meningococcal infection. This card must be carried at all times during treatment and for 8 months after the last ULTOMORIS dose or 3 months after the last SOLIRIS dose.

Before a patient can receive ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS, their doctor must: enroll in the corresponding ULTOMIRIS REMS or SOLIRIS REMS program; counsel the patient about the risk of meningococcal infection; give the patient information and a Patient Safety Card about the symptoms and risk of meningococcal infection (as discussed above); and make sure that the patient is vaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine.

ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. Patients should talk to their doctor right away if they have any new signs or symptoms of infection.

Patients must not receive ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS if they have a meningococcal infection, or if they have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection, unless their doctor decides that urgent treatment is needed.

Before a patient receives ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS, they should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: have an infection or fever, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS will harm an unborn baby or if these medicines pass into the breast milk.

Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS can affect how other medicines work, causing side effects.

For patients with PNH, the doctor will need to monitor the patient closely for at least 16 weeks after stopping ULTOMIRIS or 8 weeks after stopping SOLIRIS. Stopping treatment with these medicines may cause breakdown of the red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: a drop in red blood cell count, tiredness, blood in the urine, stomach-area (abdomen) pain, shortness of breath, blood clots, trouble swallowing, and erectile dysfunction (ED) in males.

For patients with aHUS, the doctor will need to monitor closely during and for at least 12 months after stopping ULTOMIRIS, or 12 weeks after stopping SOLIRIS, for signs of worsening aHUS symptoms or problems related to abnormal clotting and breakdown of red blood cells called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Symptoms or problems that can happen with TMA may include: confusion or loss of consciousness, seizures, chest pain (angina), difficulty breathing and blood clots or stroke.

ULTOMIRIS can cause serious side effects including infusion reactions. Symptoms of an infusion reaction with ULTOMIRIS may include lower back pain, pain with the infusion, feeling faint or discomfort in the arms or legs. Patients should tell their doctor or nurse right away if they develop these symptoms, or any other symptoms during their ULTOMIRIS infusion that may mean they are having a serious infusion reaction, including: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, and feel faint or pass out.

The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people treated for PNH are upper respiratory infection and headache. The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people with aHUS are upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, high blood pressure and fever.

SOLIRIS can cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions. Serious allergic reactions can happen during the SOLIRIS infusion. Patients should tell their doctor or nurse right away if they get any of these symptoms during the SOLIRIS infusion: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, and feeling faint or pass out. If a patient has an allergic reaction to SOLIRIS, the doctor may need to infuse SOLIRIS more slowly, or stop SOLIRIS.

The most common side effects in people with PNH treated with SOLIRIS include: headache, pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), back pain, and nausea. The most common side effects in people with aHUS treated with SOLIRIS include: headache, diarrhea, high blood pressure (hypertension), common cold (upper respiratory infection), stomach-area (abdominal) pain, vomiting, pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), low red blood cell count (anemia), cough, swelling of legs or feet (peripheral edema), nausea, urinary tract infections, and fever. The most common side effects in people with gMG treated with SOLIRIS include: muscle and joint (musculoskeletal) pain. The most common side effects in people with NMOSD treated with SOLIRIS include: common cold (upper respiratory infection); pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis); diarrhea; back pain; dizziness; flu like symptoms (influenza) including fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, and body aches; joint pain (arthralgia); throat irritation (pharyngitis), and bruising (contusion).

Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Call your doctor right away if you miss an ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS infusion or for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

TEL-AVIV, Israel and RALEIGH, N.C., April 20, 2020, RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDHL) (“RedHill” or the “Company”), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to provide its investigational drug, RHB-107 (upamostat, WX-671)1, for testing in non-clinical studies for activity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

RHB-107, an investigational new chemical entity, has been studied in more than 300 people across 10 clinical studies, including two completed Phase 2 studies in oncology patients and several Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and oncology patients. These studies helped establish the safety and tolerability of RHB-107 in humans. RHB-107 is a serine protease inhibitor active against a number of human trypsins and several other related serine proteases. Inhibition of serine proteases, including trypsins, may inhibit viral attachment and replication and decrease lung damage from viral pneumonia2.

RHB-107 was selected by NIAID for in vitro testing, following evaluation by NIAID of data on the drug’s possible mechanism of action and potential activity against SARS-CoV-2.

“RHB-107 is the second investigational drug that RedHill is evaluating for COVID-19, underscoring our commitment to the global efforts to develop a treatment for patients with this disease,” said Terry F. Plasse MD, Medical Director at RedHill. “This new agreement will facilitate pre-clinical evaluation of RHB-107 as a potential COVID-19 treatment.”

In parallel with the RHB-107 program, RedHill is evaluating another novel investigational drug, opaganib (Yeliva®, ABC294640), as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A compassionate use program of opaganib is underway in Israel, with several patients treated to date, with preliminary positive outcomes. In order to facilitate access to opaganib, various programs are currently under discussions in other countries and an Investigational New Drug (IND) application was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate opaganib in a clinical study in adults diagnosed with COVID-19 and pneumonia.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Cue Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: CUE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engineering a novel class of injectable biologics to selectively engage and modulate targeted T cells within the body, announced today it has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), through a subsidiary, to evaluate the combination of Cue Biopharma’s investigational product candidate CUE-101, a first-in-class biologic, with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced head and neck cancer.

Collaboration with Merck
Under the terms of the agreement, Cue Biopharma will conduct a Phase 1 study, KEYNOTE-A78, evaluating CUE-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA in first-line HPV+ advanced head and neck cancer. KEYNOTE-A78 will be conducted in parallel with the ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy study of CUE-101 post first-line treatment. The early monotherapy PK data from the first two dosing cohorts demonstrates dose-related drug exposure consistent with preclinical modeling. Subsequent to the respective dose escalations, expansion cohorts evaluating CUE-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA will be conducted at optimized dosing regimens.

“We are very pleased to collaborate in this important study with Merck, an established leader in cancer immunotherapy, with our first clinical asset, CUE-101, which represents our IL-2 variant CUE-100 Series,” said Daniel Passeri, chief executive officer of Cue Biopharma. “Through the monotherapy and combination studies, we believe we will be able to demonstrate the mechanistic advantages of our approach and platform for modulating disease-relevant T cells directly in the patient’s body to safely enhance efficacy over current standards of care.”

“Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of patients with certain types of cancers. However significant unmet need remains – particularly in those individuals who do not respond or develop resistance to checkpoint therapy,” said Ken Pienta, M.D, acting chief medical officer of Cue Biopharma. “Based on a novel mechanism of action designed to induce and expand tumor-specific T cells in the patient’s body, we believe CUE-101 may lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity in combination with KEYTRUDA.”

CUE-101 is a fusion protein comprised of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, an HPV16 E7 peptide epitope, reduced affinity human interleukin-2 (IL-2) molecules, and an effector attenuated human immunoglobulin G (IgG1) Fc domain. In preclinical studies, CUE-101 has demonstrated selective induction and expansion of HPV16 E7-specific cytotoxic T cells with both in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting its potential for clinical efficacy both as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade.

KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.

Phase 1 Trial Update
The Phase 1 CUE-101 monotherapy study is ongoing, with enrollment of patients at 13 leading centers in the United States for the treatment of post first-line metastatic and recurrent HPV+ advanced head and neck cancer. We have initiated the dosing of 3 patients in Cohort 3 and pending safety evaluation, we anticipate initiating the dosing of patients in Cohort 4 later this quarter. By design, CUE-101 includes 4 molecules of attenuated IL-2 and Cohort 2 patients were exposed to drug concentrations equivalent to those achieved with systemic IL-2 administration of aldesleukin (Proleukin) with no evidence of cytokine release syndrome. The Phase 1 monotherapy portion of the study is a standard dose escalation of CUE-101. After demonstration of safety at several dose levels, a parallel Phase 1 dose escalation of CUE-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA will be initiated in first-line patients. The primary endpoints of the dose escalation phase of the trials are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the two regimens. Monitoring of disease-relevant T cells and additional biomarkers of anti-tumor immune response and exploration of response prediction markers employing multiple methodologies are included in the study design.

Preliminary data from early patient cohorts demonstrates tolerability and drug exposure, and provides confidence for drug activity consistent with projections based on preclinical data. Cue Biopharma expects to report initial pharmacodynamic data from the Phase 1 monotherapy portion of the study in the first half of 2020. Additional information about the trial can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03978689).

Clinical Cancer Research Publication
CUE-101 preclinical data were recently published in Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. (https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/26/8/1953)

The article titled, CUE-101, a Novel HPV16 E7-pHLA-IL2-Fc Fusion Protein, Enhances Tumor Antigen Specific T Cell Activation for the Treatment of HPV16-Driven Malignancies, includes CUE-101 data that demonstrate selective binding, activation and expansion of HPV16-specific, disease-relevant, T cells. A murine surrogate molecule (mCUE-101) administered to HPV16 E7 tumor bearing mice resulted in selective expansion of disease-relevant T cells, anti-cancer efficacy and immunologic memory. In addition, mCUE-101 administered as a combination therapy with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition further enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.

About the CUE-100 Series
The CUE-100 series consists of Fc-fusion biologics that incorporate peptide-MHC (pMHC) molecules along with rationally engineered IL-2 molecules. This singular biologic is anticipated to selectively target, activate and expand a robust repertoire of tumor-specific T cells directly in the patient. The binding affinity of IL-2 for its receptor has been deliberately attenuated to achieve preferential selective activation of tumor-specific effector T cells while reducing potential for effects on regulatory T cells (Tregs) or broad systemic activation, potentially mitigating the dose-limiting toxicities associated with current IL-2-based therapies.

About Immuno-STAT
Immuno-STAT™ biologics are designed for targeted modulation of disease-associated T cells in the areas of immuno-oncology and autoimmune disease. Each of our biologic drugs is designed using our proprietary scaffold comprising: 1) a peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) to provide selectivity through interaction with the T cell receptor (TCR), and 2) a unique co-stimulatory signaling molecule to modulate the activity of the target T cells.

The simultaneous engagement of co-regulatory molecules and pMHC binding mimics the signals delivered by antigen presenting cells (APCs) to T cells during a natural immune response. This design enables Immuno-STAT biologics to engage with the T cell population of interest, resulting in highly targeted T cell modulation. Because our drugs are delivered directly in the patient’s body (in vivo), they are fundamentally different from other T cell therapeutic approaches that require the patients’ T cells to be extracted, modified outside the body (ex vivo), and reinfused.

About Cue Biopharma
Cue Biopharma, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is engineering a novel class of injectable biologics to selectively engage and modulate targeted T cells within the body to transform the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. The company’s proprietary platform, Immuno-STAT™ (Selective Targeting and Alteration of T cells) is designed to harness the body’s intrinsic immune system without the need for ex vivo manipulation.

Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we are led by an experienced management team and independent Board of Directors with deep expertise in the design and clinical development of protein biologics, immunology and immuno-oncology.

 The cobas HPV test is indicated for routine cervical cancer screening including triage of ASC-US cytology, co-testing (or adjunctive screen) with cytology, and HPV primary screening of women to assess the risk for cervical pre/ cancer. Earlier, the test was approved for the cobas 4800 System to screen primary cervical cancer without accompanying Pap cytology in 2014","More than 99 percent of cervical cancers are caused by persistent high-risk HPV infection1
Cervical cancer is nearly 100 percent preventable with proper HPV vaccination, screening and treatment; expanding access helps reach more women2,3
cobas 6800/8800 Systems deliver full automation, helping laboratories meet the throughput and efficiencies that high-volume, HPV DNA screening programs require
 
Basel, 21 April 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX:RHHBY) today announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the cobas® HPV test for use on the fully automated, high-throughput cobas® 6800/8800 Systems. The cobas® HPV test identifies women at risk for cervical cancer by detecting the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical samples. Persistent high-risk HPV infections can develop into precancerous lesions and, if left untreated, these lesions can progress to cervical cancer.

“The approval of our HPV test for the cobas 6800 and 8800 Systems enables molecular laboratories to achieve the efficiency and scale they need to meet the demands of high-volume cervical screening programs,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “This is critical as most healthcare providers in the US have adopted HPV testing as part of their cervical cancer screening protocol, with the ultimate goal of preventing cervical cancer in all women.”

The goal of cervical cancer screening is to find and treat precancer early to help stop the progression of disease. The cobas HPV test helps to protect women from the potential harms of undetected and untreated cervical disease by detecting the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers.

The cobas HPV test, previously approved for the cobas® 4800 System, is now part of the growing menu of clinically validated, FDA approved tests for use on cobas 6800/8800 Systems. Laboratories now have the ability to run HPV DNA tests simultaneously with other previously released cobas tests on these high-throughput systems.

The FDA considered data from the registrational IMPACT (IMproving Primary screening And Colposcopy Triage) trial, which enrolled almost 35,000 women in the US to clinically validate cobas HPV for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems. Study data will be broadly shared, pending publication of the key findings.

About cobas HPV test
cobas HPV is indicated for use for routine cervical cancer screening as per professional medical guidelines, including triage of ASC-US cytology, co-testing (or adjunctive screen) with cytology, and HPV primary screening of women to assess the risk for cervical precancer and cancer.

The cobas 4800 HPV Test, originally introduced in 2011 and supported by the ATHENA trial (Addressing the Need for Advanced HPV Diagnostics), helps healthcare providers identify women at risk for cervical cancer by individually identifying the presence of the DNA of HPV genotypes 16 and 18 – the two genotypes responsible for about 70 percent of all cervical cancers – and reporting the 12 other high-risk HPV types as a combined result, all in one test and from one patient sample. Roche received the first FDA approval to use an HPV test for primary cervical cancer screening without accompanying Pap cytology for the cobas HPV 4800 Test in 2014. More information about the cobas HPV tests is available at www.hpv16and18.com

About the Roche Cervical Cancer Portfolio
The Roche Cervical Cancer Portfolio enables healthcare professionals to better screen, triage and diagnose women, based on the confidence and clarity of results across a continuum of patient care. The unique combination of molecular, cellular and tissue-based tests provides healthcare professionals powerful information to make patient care decisions and minimize unnecessary treatment.

The Roche cobas 4800 HPV Test, used in combination with CINtec® PLUS Cytology and CINtec® Histology, offers clinicians and labs in the US powerful support they have not had before. The dual-stain biomarker technology included in the CINtec PLUS Cytology test, which was FDA approved in March 2020, detects the simultaneous presence within a single cell of the two biomarkers — p16 and Ki-67. This abnormality is associated with HPV infections that are transforming and can, if left untreated, progress to pre-cancer or cancer. A positive result of these two biomarkers in a single cell signals that a woman is more significantly at risk for disease. The ability of CINtec PLUS Cytology to distinguish those women who are at higher risk for cervical disease provides labs, clinicians and women, in conjunction with the physician’s assessment of patient screening history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines information, to guide patient management. This could reduce the number and frequency of follow-up visits, saving worry, time and money.

CINtec Histology is the only FDA-cleared test used as an aid to confirm the presence of cervical disease in women who have had a tissue biopsy. The CINtec Histology test uses the p16 biomarker for a more conclusive diagnosis to provide distinctive visual confirmation of precancerous cervical lesions that may be missed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) interpretation alone. Both CINtec assays are fully automated on the VENTANA BenchMark IHC/ISH instruments.

About human papillomavirus and cervical cancer
Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the principal cause of cervical cancer in women, with HPV implicated in greater than 99 percent of cervical cancers worldwide. It can take 10 to 15 years or longer for cervical cancer to develop, so knowing a woman’s individual risk and finding disease early, before cancer develops, is an important prevention strategy. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates there are more than 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer annually, and 311,000 deaths4.

About cobas 6800/8800 Systems 
Since 2014, the cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems have established the new standard for routine molecular testing by delivering fully integrated, automated solutions that serve the areas of viral load monitoring, donor screening, sexual health and microbiology. Like the cobas 4800 System, each system is based on Nobel Prize-winning polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. The cobas 6800/8800 Systems deliver proven performance with full automation, increased throughput, fast turnaround time and complete track connectivity validated for molecular testing, providing users with greater flexibility to consolidate their in vitro diagnostic (IVD) and laboratory developed testing (LDT) to a single system while increasing overall workflow efficiencies.

31369,Noxopharm Anticipates the US FDA's Approval for Evaluating Veyonda in a Clinical Study for COVID-19,Approval to be sought for COVID-19 Clinical Study in U.S.,"Noxopharm plans to seek approval to test its Veyonda (idronoxil) on COVID-19 patients in the US, following the research of Hudson Institute about the MOA of idronoxil that holds the potential to block STING signaling, which contributes to lethal self-destruction of major organs in patients with COVID-19
 The company is currently working with the FDA to obtain guidance on the regulatory approval pathway for pursuing the clinical study for COVID-19 patients in the US. Additionally, the company is pursuing the option to test Veyonda in patients with septic shock from infective agents other than the SARS-CoV-2 virus
 Indronoxil inhibits S1P & STING signaling pathways, currently being developed for end-stage PC. The company will evaluate the therapy in patients at risk of developing ARDS and multi-organ failure associated with COVID-19","Highlights:
• NOX to seek approval from U.S. FDA for clinical study of Veyonda® in COVID-19
patients
• Objective to block progression of patients with early-stage disease into multi-organ
failure and likely death
• Rationale based on inhibition of STING signaling
Sydney, 21 April 2020: Noxopharm (NOX:ASX) previously (1 April 2020) announced a discovery
by the Hudson Institute of Medical Research (Hudson Institute) about a novel mode of action of
idronoxil, the active ingredient in Veyonda®. Noxopharm now is able to reveal that this mode of
action involves inhibition of the STING signalling pathway, a discovery that leads the Company
and the Hudson Institute to believe that Veyonda® holds potential to block the hyperinflammation stemming from the infection and which is believed responsible for deaths in
patients with COVID-19 infection.
1
The current announcement provides the market with an update on the action currently being
taken by the Company to act on that discovery.
Graham Kelly PhD, Noxopharm CEO, said, “With the emerging possibility that an abnormally
high STING response is a factor in COVID-19 death, having an inhibitor of STING signaling ready
to be tested in COVID-19 patients is both a considerable responsibility and opportunity. Proving
the value of Veyonda® to COVID-19 patients is both a humanitarian and regulatory approval
opportunity that we cannot overlook.”
“The need to prevent the phenomena of cytokine storm and septic shock in COVID-19 patients
looks likely to remain for some considerable time, and may even remain a long-term need
should development of an effective vaccine prove challenging.”
For Noxopharm, Veyonda® is first and foremost an oncology drug, with end-stage prostate
cancer remaining its primary focus. Any clinical studies in non-oncology patients will require
non-dilutive funding, something that the Company believes in the current environment should
be achievable once it receives the go-ahead to conduct a clinical study.
Noxopharm Limited. ABN 50 608 966 123
Suite 3, Level 4, 828 Pacific Highway, Gordon NSW 2072 AUSTRALIA
Regulatory strategy
Noxopharm currently is moving to obtain guidance from the FDA on the appropriate regulatory
approval pathway to pursue in the U.S. in relation to COVID-19 patients. The Company also is
pursuing the option of testing Veyonda® in patients suffering septic shock from a range of
infective agents other than the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Noxopharm has been developing an oral dosage formulation of idronoxil for some time and the
Company originally considered using an oral dosage form in non-oncology patients. However,
under advice, the Company will proceed instead with Veyonda®, given that product’s current
Investigational New Drug (IND) status in the U.S., on top of the considerable clinical experience
and data amassed with this dosage form. The provisional patent lodged in relation to use in
septic shock patients covers broad drug dosage forms including oral and suppository.
Rationale
The rationale is to use Veyonda® to block a process known as STING signaling, which in some
COVID-19 patients is thought to contribute to lethal self-destruction of major organs.
STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) is part of a primitive defence mechanism that detects
the presence of invading pathogenic organisms such as viruses or bacteria. In addition, STING
plays important roles in the clearance of damaged cells and tissues. Both responses involve the
production of proteins known as cytokines whose task it is to coordinate the subsequent
immune and tissue repair (inflammatory) responses.
STING engagement in the early stages of infections can contribute positively to the body’s
immune response to some pathogens. However, STING engagement becomes a negative and
self-destructive force if the infection persists and progresses to the point of causing extensive
tissue damage.2 Under those conditions, the STING pathway contributes to the so-called
‘cytokine storm’, along with the production of blood clotting factors, all promoting further
organ damage and forming the basis of the condition known as septic shock.
2
In COVID-19 patients, a trigger for this ‘cytokine storm’ or septic shock is mounting tissue
damage associated with poor oxygen levels (hypoxia) stemming from poor lung function,
3 with
this tissue damage believed responsible for triggering a toxic STING response.4 High levels of
cytokines and clotting factors are proving to be a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients.
3
The Hudson Institute, in studies led by Dr Michael Gantier, discovered that idronoxil, the
active ingredient in Veyonda®, blocks the STING signalling pathway associated with cellular
damage of the kind caused by hypoxia.
Noxopharm Limited. ABN 50 608 966 123
Suite 3, Level 4, 828 Pacific Highway, Gordon NSW 2072 AUSTRALIA
Dr Michael Gantier, head of the Nucleic Acids and Innate Immunity laboratory, said, “We
have shown that idronoxil is a very potent inhibitor of STING signaling in cell-based assays using
STING agonists, and also in the context of cellular damage caused by a chemotherapy agent.
The inhibitory activities measured were measured in the sub-micromolar range, on par with
other inhibitors recently reported.5
Competitive landscape
To address the ‘cytokine storm’ phenomenon, clinical trials are in progress in COVID-19 patients
with drugs that block the function of individual cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Those
studies will show whether blocking individual cytokines out of the large number involved in a
‘cytokine storm’ will have any meaningful effect.
Noxopharm believes that a more rational approach is an upstream approach to block the
‘cytokine storm’ process at its roots by inhibiting the STING pathway, offering the potential of
blocking the production of a broad range of cytokines and holding the promise of halting the
rapid deterioration of COVID-19 patients once they develop poor lung function.
The infancy in understanding the critical role of STING in inflammation and septic shock has
meant that clinical studies of STING inhibitors have yet to get underway. Noxopharm is in the
position of having a clinic-ready drug candidate to test the potential value of blocking STING
signaling in COVID-19 patients.
Veyonda® also has the advantage of having addressed the issue of safety by proving to be
well-tolerated in patients with advanced cancers and poor quality of life.
About COVID-19 deaths
The danger with COVID-19 infection lies in its progression from a mild disease into an overwhelming and
fulminant condition characterised by respiratory failure, multi-organ failure (heart and kidney failure),
clotting problems and septic shock. Treatment at that end-stage is limited to supportive treatment
including antibiotics and the use of ventilators. To date there is no approved treatment for COVID-19
related disease and the death rate continues to be very high in these patients.
Cytokines are proteins secreted by immune cells and which trigger inflammation and tissue repair. These
include interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon beta (IFN). Cytokine
levels in blood rise in response to COVID-19 infection but undergo extreme rise in a small proportion of
patients in what is known as ‘cytokine storm’, with this extreme rise being highly predictive of death.3
About Idronoxil and cancer
Idronoxil is a small molecule with multiple anti-cancer mechanisms. Inhibition of the sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P) and STING signalling pathways are thought to be the two principal factors, both playing
key roles in regulating the immunological and inflammatory responses in tumours.
Noxopharm Limited. ABN 50 608 966 123
Suite 3, Level 4, 828 Pacific Highway, Gordon NSW 2072 AUSTRALIA
S1P is a key master driver of pro-survival mechanisms in all cells and is over-expressed in most tumour
cells.6
Idronoxil inhibits S1P production via inhibition of the ENOX2-sphingosine kinase axis.
The STING signalling pathway can directly contribute to cancer development and metastasis by initiating
pro-tumorigenic inflammation.7-10

“Mogrify is delighted to announce its second commercial deal with a US biopharma and the first in the exciting field of T cell immunotherapy,” said Dr. Darrin M. Disley OBE, CEO, Mogrify. “The combination of Mogrify’s proprietary systematic cell conversion technology and Sangamo’s regulatory T cell platform and proprietary ZFP platform is a natural fit. Sangamo is at the forefront of the development of a world-class engineered ZFP genome editing platform and we are very happy to be partnering with such an innovative company.”

“This license agreement provides Sangamo with access to Mogrify’s cell conversion technology, which will diversify our options as we develop off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR-Treg cell therapies,” said Jason Fontenot, SVP, Head of Cell Therapy at Sangamo. “We expect this collaboration to accelerate our development of scalable and accessible CAR-Treg cell therapies, so that we can potentially deliver treatments to patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases more rapidly.”

Mogrify’s technology enables the transformation of any human cell type into any other human cell type. This transformation is achieved using transcription factors or small molecules identified using proprietary big data technologies. iPSCs and ESCs provide an evergreen starting material for the generation of Tregs, and facilitate more complex engineering and greater manufacturing scalability, potentially enabling the resulting therapies to be more cost-effective and thus more accessible to larger patient populations.

Under the terms of the agreement, Mogrify will be responsible for the discovery and optimization of the cell conversion technology from iPSCs or ESCs to regulatory T cells, and Sangamo will be granted exclusive rights to use Mogrify’s technology to create Tregs from iPSCs or ESCs. Sangamo expects to then use its ZFP gene-engineering technology and therapeutic development capabilities to transform these Tregs into novel “off-the-shelf” allogeneic CAR-Treg cell therapy candidates and hopes to take them through clinical development through to registration for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

Under the terms of the agreement, Sangamo will pay Mogrify an upfront payment. Mogrify is also eligible to receive potential additional payments related to development and regulatory milestones, and product sales.

About Sangamo’s Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CAR-Tregs Technology

Tregs are a subset of T lymphocytes and act as the key regulators of the immune system. They ensure that the immune system does not mistakenly harm healthy organs while still protecting the body from pathogenic microorganisms.

CAR-Tregs are regulatory T cells (or Tregs) which are genetically engineered with a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) to precisely target sites of autoimmune and inflammatory pathology. Sangamo’s CAR-Treg platform aims to use CAR and zinc finger protein (ZFP) technologies to genetically engineer Tregs ex vivo to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

About Mogrify www.mogrify.co.uk

Mogrify has developed a proprietary direct cell conversion technology, which makes it possible to convert any source human cell type into any target human cell type.

31397,Novartis Reports Results of Mayzent (siponimod) in P-III EXPAND Study for Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,Novartis announces new Mayzent (siponimod) data show sustained effect in delaying disability for up to five years in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS),"The P-III EXPAND study involves assessing of Mayzent vs PBO in 1,651 patients with SPMS from 31 countries with varying levels of disability (Core Part), EDSS scores of 3·0–6·5, followed by extended treatment with open-label BAF312 to evaluate long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy
 The P-III EXPAND study: 52% reduction in ARR in Mayzent group; reduction in the risk of 3mos. & 6mos. CDP; no differences in Timed 25-Foot Walk Test; 79% reduction in T2 lesion volume; 55% reduction in ARR; patients free from Gd-enhancing lesions & enlarging T2 lesions (89% vs 67% & 57% vs 37%). Post-hoc analysis from EXPAND study demonstrated a reduction in cGM and thalamic atrophy
 Mayzent is a S1P receptor modulator targeting S1P1 and S1P5 receptors, approved in multiple countries including the US for RMS, EU, Australia, Albania for SPMS, Canada and UAE for active SPMS whereas Switzerland, Japan and China regulatory filings are in progress","Mayzent® (siponimod) experienced lower risk of disability progression and cognitive decline than patients who delayed Mayzent treatment1
Separate post-hoc analysis from EXPAND demonstrated Mayzent reduced cortical grey matter (cGM) and thalamic atrophy in patients with SPMS2, outcomes associated with long-term irreversible disability accumulation3
Mayzent is the first and only oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) studied and proven to delay disability progression in a broad range of SPMS patients
The digital press release with multimedia content can be accessed here:



Basel, April 21, 2020 — Novartis announced today new Mayzent® (siponimod) data in the April supplemental issue of Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The data build on existing clinical evidence that Mayzent has proven to slow physical disability progression and provide cognitive benefits in people living with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS)1. Although every patient’s multiple sclerosis (MS) journey is unique, 1 in 4 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients on treatment transition to SPMS within 10 years of RRMS onset*4.

Data released from the five-year EXPAND open-label extension trial assessed the long-term efficacy and safety of Mayzent in patients with SPMS who on entering the extension trial either continued on Mayzent treatment (Mayzent group) or switched from placebo to Mayzent (placebo switch group). Patients in the Mayzent group were significantly less likely to experience both three- and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) (p=0.0064 and p=0.0048, respectively) compared with the placebo switch group, which underscores advantages of early treatment initiation1. These data were included in the April supplemental issue of Neurology after the 2020 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting was cancelled due to COVID-19.

“The data continue to show that Mayzent has the ability to help patients maintain independence for longer through its long-term effect on delaying progression and cognitive impairment,” said Norman Putzki, MD, Global Head of Development Neuroscience. “Novartis is committed to reimagining medicine for patients with progressive diseases and with Mayzent, Novartis offers patients hope for improved health outcomes.”

The new data also show a 52% reduction in the annualized relapse rate (ARR) observed in the Mayzent group compared to the placebo switch group (p<0.0001). Risk of confirmed worsening of cognitive impairment (according to the Symbol Digit Modalities Test) at six-months was reduced by 23% for the Mayzent group compared with placebo switch group (p=0.0014). The benefits seen in the Mayzent group were sustained for up to five years, underscoring the advantages of early treatment initiation
with Mayzent. The incidence of adverse events was consistent with the controlled treatment period1. This EXPAND open-label extension is ongoing for up to a total of seven years.

Additional Mayzent data shared in the same Neurology issue includes a new post-hoc analysis from EXPAND, which showed Mayzent consistently reduced cortical grey matter (cGM) and thalamic atrophy in patients with SPMS, including those with less active and more advanced disease. Across the subgroups studied, Mayzent reduced cGM atrophy versus placebo by 48–116% (p<0.01 at both M12 and M24) and thalamic atrophy by 30– 68% (p<0.05 at both M12 and M24; except for ‘disease duration >15 years’ p=0.1029 at M12)2. Combined with other analyses, these findings could translate into a favorable impact on long-term clinical outcomes including disability progression and cognitive decline.

Further analysis from EXPAND, evaluating Mayzent’s effect on magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) changes in patients with SPMS, builds on existing pre-clinical evidence that suggests Mayzent may promote repair mechanisms in the central nervous system (CNS). MTR is a technique widely used for estimating myelin content in the brain. MTR results show that Mayzent significantly reduces de-myelination and substantiate previous pre-clinical findings on remyelination5.

“These data highlight the critical importance of early treatment intervention with a disease-modifying treatment, such as Mayzent, to ensure the best possible long-term outcomes for patients with MS who are experiencing progression,” said Bruce Cree, MD, PhD, MAS, Clinical Research Director and George A. Zimmermann Endowed Professor in Multiple Sclerosis, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine. “It’s never too early to stay ahead of progression in multiple sclerosis, since the early identification of physical and cognitive changes – even subtle ones – can indicate MS disease progression and therefore allow for timely intervention.”

*For specific indications of Mayzent approved in each country, see the section “About Mayzent® (siponimod)” below.
†As measured by prolonged time to wheelchair dependence for patients with SPMS by an average of 4.3 years versus placebo.
‡Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is defined as a first episode of neurologic symptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation or demyelination in the central nervous system6.

About the EXPAND Study7
EXPAND is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study, comparing the efficacy and safety of Mayzent versus placebo in people with SPMS with varying levels of disability (Core Part), EDSS scores of 3·0–6·5, followed by extended treatment with open-label BAF312 to obtain data on long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy (Extension Part)8. It is the largest randomized, controlled study in SPMS to date, including 1,651 people with a diagnosis of SPMS from 31 countries. Mayzent demonstrated a safety profile that was overall consistent with the known effects of S1P receptor modulation. It reduced the risk of three-month CDP by a statistically significant 21% (p=0.013; primary endpoint). CDP was defined as a 1-point increase in EDSS, if the baseline score was 3·0–5·0, or a 0·5-point increase, if the baseline score was 5·5–6·5. No significant differences were found in the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test. T2 lesion volume was reduced by 79% as compared to placebo. Additional secondary endpoints included a relative reduction in the ARR by 55%, and compared to placebo, more patients were free from Gd-enhancing lesions (89% vs 67% for placebo) and from new or enlarging T2 lesions (57% vs 37% for placebo). Additional exploratory analyses presented at the 35thCongress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), demonstrated Mayzent can help patients keep their mobility for over four years longer on average9†.

About Mayzent® (siponimod)
Mayzent is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that selectively binds to S1P1 and S1P5 receptors. In relation to the S1P1 receptor, it prevents the lymphocytes from egressing the lymph nodes and as a consequence, from entering the CNS of patients with MS7. This leads to the anti-inflammatory effects of Mayzent10. Mayzent also enters the CNS and binds to the S1P5 sub-receptor on specific cells in the CNS11,12,13, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and has shown pro-remyelinating and neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of MS14,15,16.

In the European Union (EU), Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with SPMS with active disease evidenced by relapsing or imaging features of inflammatory activity. In the US, Mayzent is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include clinically isolated syndrome (CIS‡), relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. The approvals are based on the Phase III EXPAND trial, the largest controlled clinical study of a broad range of SPMS patients, showing Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of disease progression, including impact on physical disability and cognitive decline7. Mayzent is also approved in Australia and Albania for adult patients with SPMS and in Canada and United Arab Emirates for adult patients with active SPMS. Novartis is committed to bringing Mayzent to patients worldwide, and additional regulatory filings are currently underway in Switzerland, Japan, China, and elsewhere.

About Multiple Sclerosis
MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss17. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide18, is often characterized into three forms: primary progressive MS (PPMS)19, RRMS, and SPMS, which follows from an initial RRMS course and is characterized by physical and cognitive changes over time, in presence or absence of relapses, leading to a progressive accumulation of neurological disability20. Approximately 85% of patients initially present with relapsing forms of MS18. There remains a high unmet need for safe and effective treatments to help delay disability progression in SPMS with active disease (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity)20.

About Novartis in MS
In addition to Mayzent, the Novartis MS portfolio includes also Gilenya®(fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is indicated in the EU for the treatment of adult patients and children and adolescents 10 years of age and older with RRMS. In the United States, Gilenya is approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with RMS, to include CIS, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease.

Ofatumumab (OMB157), a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets B-cells, is in development for treating RMS. Positive Phase III data presented in September 2019 show ofatumumab met primary endpoints to reduce the ARR in patients with RMS21. If approved, ofatumumab will potentially become a treatment for a broad RMS population and the first subcutaneous B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home.

Extavia® (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the US for RMS, to include CIS, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. In Europe, Extavia is approved to treat people with RRMS, SPMS with active disease and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS.

In the US, the Sandoz Division of Novartis markets Glatopa® (glatiramer acetate injection) 20mg/mL and 40mg/mL, generic versions of Teva’s glatiramer acetate.

The research program includes two studies that evaluate different combination therapies including Bayer’s chloroquine and interferon beta-1b
 Bayer will provide its therapies and will fund $1.08M towards the studies which added to $0.35 funded by PHRI earlier this month, enabling the development of the research program. PHRI intend to enroll 6,000 patients in the two studies from 60+ research sites across the Canadian province of Ontario and internationally
 The first study will assess the combination of chloroquine + azithromycin to test whether it can prevent deterioration leading to hospital admission, while a second study will evaluate the combination of chloroquine + azithromycin + interferon beta-1b to prevent admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation and death to combat COVID-19","Bayer partners with Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) on global clinical research evaluating COVID-19 treatments
Investigation of combination therapies including Bayer’s chloroquine and interferon beta-1b to foster much needed solutions for patients in fight against coronavirus pandemic / Bayer Canada to make CAD 1.5 million (approximately 1 million euros) financial commitment and to supply products in support of the research / Plans to include more than 60 contributing research locations involving 6.000 patients
Berlin, April 21, 2020 – Bayer announced today its Canadian organization Bayer Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, will partner with the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) in launching a major clinical research program aimed at identifying potential treatments against COVID-19. The two studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of different combination therapies including Bayer’schloroquine and interferon beta-1b.

“Treatments against COVID-19 are urgently needed as no validated options are currently available,” said Dr. Mike Devoy, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceuticals Division and Chief Medical Officer. “We want to contribute to the global fight against the coronavirus through our products and expertise and look forward to partnering with the PHRI.”

Bayer will make a financial commitment of CAD 1.5 million (approx. 1 million euros) towards the studies and will supply study drugs to support the research. This adds to the CAD 0.5 million committed by the PHRI earlier this month which enabled the development of the research program.

“Specifically, an outpatient study will evaluate the combination of chloroquine with azithromycin to see if this treatment can prevent deterioration leading to hospital admission, while a second study will evaluate the combination of chloroquine with azithromycin, as well as interferon beta-1b, to prevent admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation and/or death to combat COVID-19,” said Salim Yusuf, Executive Director of PHRI. “Our goal is to assess the value of these and other therapies rapidly so that the results can inform practice as soon as possible.”

PHRI plans to enroll 6,000 patients into the two studies from more than 60 contributing research sites across the Canadian province of Ontario and internationally.

“Ontario is home to world-class researchers who are continually furthering our understanding within the health sciences and finding new ways to keep our communities healthy and safe,” said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities of the Government of Ontario. “I want to thank Bayer, the Population Health Research Institute, and all of our research community for their critical work to limit the impact of COVID-19. I know that, because of your efforts, we will emerge from this stronger than ever.”

About the investigational treatments
Developed by Bayer in the 1930s, chloroquine (trade name: Resochin™) was used in the prevention of malaria for decades. The Chinese health authorities have included chloroquine in the treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Subsequently, many other health authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have adopted similar guidance for supervised emergency use of chloroquine outside of the established indications.

As peer-reviewed and published clinical data are currently not available for chloroquine in the COVID-19 treatment setting, Bayer is working with researchers, governments and front-line practitioners to support generation and exchange of data to help to close this knowledge gap.

In addition, Bayer is donating chloroquine tablets to health authorities in different countries to allow for coordinated and emergency use of the drug outside of the established indications under the guidance of physicians.

In addition to looking into the potential of chloroquine, Bayer is actively participating in several global coalitions supporting research for drugs and treatment strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

Interferon beta-1b in a recombinant form is one of the marketed interferon beta formulations (brand name Betaseron/Betaferon®). This was the first drug to show in multiple sclerosis (MS) a decrease in relapse rate and to reduce MS disease activity as measured by MRI in clinical studies. These findings led to its approval by the FDA as the first therapy for treatment of the former orphan’s disease MS in 1993. Approvals by other agencies around the world followed subsequently.

Azithromycin is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections including strep throat and pneumonia, as well as travellers’ diarrhea and certain other intestinal infections. Along with other medications, it may also be used for malaria. Azithromycin was first approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines.

— Collaboration to Leverage oNKo-innate’s Deep Expertise in NK Cell Tumor Biology to Discover Novel Therapies in Immuno-Oncology and Cell Therapy —

FOSTER CITY, Calif. & SANTA MONICA, Calif. & MELBOURNE, Australia–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 21, 2020–Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD), Kite, a Gilead Company, and oNKo-innate announced the companies have entered into a three-year cancer immunotherapy research collaboration to support discovery and development of next-generation drug and engineered cell therapies focused on natural killer (NK) cells.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200421005271/en/

Current cancer immunotherapy approaches primarily focus on T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity, including checkpoint inhibition and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Like T cells, NK cells are a class of lymphocytes (white blood cells) that play a critical surveillance and effector role in the immune system. NK cells and T cells each have the potential to attack cancer cells, but have different mechanisms for tumor cell killing. Thus, appropriately activated and targeted NK cells may represent a differentiated approach that would be potentially complementary and synergistic with T cell mediated anti-tumor strategies.

“Gilead is pleased to partner with oNKo-innate as a leader in this new and highly promising area of cancer immunotherapy,” said William A. Lee, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, Gilead Sciences. “We have a strategic focus of growing both our expertise and pipeline in immuno-oncology and we believe this exciting collaboration will support each of these objectives as we work to discover and develop novel cancer therapies for patients.”

“Kite is committed to building upon our leadership in cell therapy as we seek to meet the needs of patients with cancer,” said Peter Emtage, PhD, Senior Vice President of Research at Kite. “Early clinical data utilizing adoptively transferred NK cells has been encouraging and we are excited by the opportunity to scientifically expand our capabilities in this area and to identify novel NK cell therapies to advance toward clinical development.”

“With more than 20 years of collective academic expertise in NK cell biology, we have long believed in the potential for NK cells to play a role in cancer immunotherapy,” said Jai Rautela, PhD, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of oNKo-innate. “We look forward to bringing this NK cell expertise and our unique screening techniques into a collaboration with Gilead and Kite to serve a common goal of discovering new treatments for patients.”

Through this research collaboration, oNKo-innate will use genome-wide screening techniques and its proprietary technology platform to discover novel immune cell targets that enhance NK cell anti-tumor immunity and to create NK cell therapies. For Gilead, oNKo-innate will execute screens to identify and validate targets to seed internal Gilead immuno-oncology discovery programs. For Kite, oNKo-innate will create and evaluate NK constructs for Kite’s development of next-generation cell therapies.

Under the terms of the agreement, oNKo-innate will receive an upfront payment and will be eligible to receive additional payments based on achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as sales royalties across the immuno-oncology and cell therapy programs.

31440,Novartis' Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) Receives the US FDA's Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation for Follicular Lymphoma,Novartis Kymriah receives FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation in follicular lymphoma,"The US FDA has granted RMAT designation to Novartis’ Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) to treat patients with r/r FL. The designation is based on P-II ELARA study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with r/r FL
 The RMAT designation supports the advancement of Kymriah and reflects the unmet need for patients with r/r follicular lymphoma. Novartis has developed Kymriah in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania
 Kymriah is designed to be a one-time treatment and is the first FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, indicated for r/r ALL in pediatric & adult patients and r/DLBCL in adults. Novartis anticipates the US regulatory filing of Kymriah in 2021","If approved, relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma would become the third B-cell malignancy indication for Kymriah, joining approvals in children and young adults with r/r ALL, and adults with r/r DLBCL
The Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation reflects the unmet need for patients with r/r follicular lymphoma
US regulatory filing for Kymriah in r/r follicular lymphoma anticipated in 2021
Basel, April 22, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel), for an investigational new indication to treat patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL). Kymriah, which is designed to be a one-time treatment, is the first-ever FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy. The potential approval in r/r FL will be the third indication for Kymriah, which also has indications in r/r pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

“This designation supports the advancement of Kymriah, which could potentially address an unmet need in certain patients with follicular lymphoma, as we strive to reimagine medicine at Novartis. These patients are often faced with the burden of several years of various treatments as their disease continues to progress.” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis.

Follicular lymphoma, the second most common form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL)1,2, is an indolent lymphoma, and represents approximately 22% of NHL cases1. Despite new treatments that improve overall survival, FL is regarded as an incurable malignancy with a relapsing and remitting pattern3. Although patients in third or later line treatment for FL have multiple systemic therapies available, the efficacy of these regimens drops off rapidly in later lines4. Throughout the lifetime of a relapsing FL patient, they may be exposed to a median of five lines of prior treatment, with an upper range of 12 lines5,6. There also is an unmet need in people who are refractory to treatment or quickly relapse, who may exhaust treatment options while they are still healthy enough to receive active treatment4.

The RMAT designation program is part of the 21st Century Cures Act. The program was created to expedite the development and review of regenerative medicine therapies intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious condition. The FDA granted RMAT designation for Kymriah in FL based on preliminary clinical evidence from the ELARA clinical trial, an ongoing multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL.

Kymriah was developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a strategic alliance between industry and academia which was first-of-its-kind in CAR-T research and development.

Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety information
Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications.

Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities.

Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.

Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.

Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient’s healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding.

Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah, and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine.

After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer.

Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures.
Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects.

Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy.

Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.

Please see the full Prescribing Information for Kymriah, including Boxed WARNING, and Medication Guide at www.Kymriah.com

The company’s first and second FDA approvals for COVID-19 are focused on prevention while the third trial is for treatment of hospitalized patients","Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Treatment of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients

April 21, 2020 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
HOUSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Hope Biosciences announces FDA approval on their third clinical trial for COVID-19. This study will be conducted in collaboration with Advanced Diagnostics Healthcare (ADH) at River Oaks Hospital and Clinics. The hospital has an entire floor dedicated to treating COVID-19 patients, with staff specifically trained to care for these patients. The goal of this collaboration is to provide cutting-edge therapeutic interventions, like Hope Biosciences’ adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs), in a safe, efficient environment to provide the best care to COVID-19 patients.

Hope Biosciences will test its cell therapy through the entire disease timeline – from the stage of susceptibility to subclinical stages to the most severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19

Hope Biosciences’ proprietary core technology delivers high-quality, fully characterized, fresh mesenchymal stem cells, on-demand. MSCs are well-known for their immunomodulatory and regenerative potential. These characteristics make them a potential therapeutic option to fight the inflammation and lung degeneration that is known to occur in severe COVID-19 patients. In this study, patients suffering severe symptoms associated with COVID-19 will have the opportunity to receive HB-adMSCs, in addition to current standard of care. The data generated in this study will determine the role HB-adMSCs may play in decreasing the severity of illness from COVID-19 infection. “Our goal is to keep severely ill patients from needed invasive mechanical ventilation. We know that the probability of survival greatly decreases once a patient is invasively ventilated for this disease. Providing HB-adMSCs will help the patient’s immune system resist the damage associated with COVID-19 and aid in repair. If we can prevent patients from needing ventilators, we can increase the probability of survival,” said Donna Chang, Founder and President of Hope Biosciences.

This Phase II study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single center study that is expected to enroll 110 hospitalized patients into 2 separate arms. Participants taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin will be randomized into a placebo or treatment group. Likewise, patients not taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin will also be randomized into a placebo or treatment group. Those receiving treatment will receive 4 doses of 100 million HB-adMSCs over a 10-day period.

Hope Biosciences’ first and second FDA approvals for COVID-19 are focused on prevention while this trial is for patient treatment. “We chose to include patients with minimal respiratory support to those who have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require invasive mechanical ventilation. The broad range is not your typical study design, but for COVID, we felt that it was necessary to look at all stages of the disease. Through our three protocols, we will study the entire timeline – from the stage of susceptibility to subclinical stages to the most severe clinical manifestations of this condition,” said Donna Chang.

The clinical study is the first COVID-19-related trial to be initiated in Germany
 The P-I/II study’s dose-escalation portion will include ~200 healthy subjects aged 18-55yrs. and will target a dose-ranging 1-100 µg to determine the optimal dose for further studies and to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. The companies are expected to initiate the clinical study in the US
 The study will evaluate the effects of repeated immunization for 3 of the 4 vaccine candidates which utilize uRNA or modRNA. BioNTech will ensure the clinical supply of vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in the EU","First COVID-19-related clinical trial to start in Germany
Initial dose escalation phase to target dose range of 1µg to 100µg
Clinical supply from BioNTech’s GMP-certified mRNA production facilities in Europe
Four vaccine candidates to enter clinical development 
MAINZ, Germany and NEW YORK, April 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech” or “the Company”) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), have announced today that the German regulatory authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, has approved the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for BioNTech’s BNT162 vaccine program to prevent COVID-19 infection. BioNTech and Pfizer are jointly developing BNT162. The trial is the first clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate to start in Germany, and is part of a global development program. Pfizer and BioNTech will also conduct trials for BNT162 in the United States upon regulatory approval, which is expected shortly.

The four vaccine candidates are the first candidates from BioNTech’s COVID-19-focused project “Lightspeed”, each representing different mRNA formats and target antigens. Two of the four vaccine candidates include a nucleoside modified mRNA (modRNA), one includes a uridine containing mRNA (uRNA), and the fourth vaccine candidate utilizes self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA). Each mRNA format is combined with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. The larger spike sequence is included in two of the vaccine candidates, and the smaller optimized receptor binding domain (RBD) from the spike protein is included in the other two candidates. The RBD-based candidates contain the piece of the spike that is thought to be most important for eliciting antibodies that can inactivate the virus.

The dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 trial will include approximately 200 healthy subjects between the ages of 18 to 55 and will target a dose range of 1 µg to 100 µg aiming to determine the optimal dose for further studies as well as evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. The study will also evaluate the effects of repeated immunization for three of the four vaccine candidates which utilize uRNA or modRNA. Subjects with a higher risk for a severe COVID-19 infection will be included in the second part of the study.

“We are pleased to have completed pre-clinical studies in Germany and will soon initiate this first-in-human trial ahead of our expectations. The speed with which we were able to move from the start of the program to trial initiation speaks to the high level of engagement from everyone involved,” says CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin.

“Pfizer and BioNTech’s partnership has mobilized our collective resources with extraordinary speed in the face of this worldwide challenge,” said Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO. “Now that the work in Germany can commence, we are looking forward to and actively preparing for the potential start of this unique and robust clinical study program in the United States in the near future.”

During the clinical development stage, BioNTech will provide its partners clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe.

BioNTech is also collaborating with Fosun Pharma to develop BNT162 in China, where the companies expect to conduct trials.

 Valneva is leveraging its platform that was used for IXIARO, a vaccine against Japanese encephalitis and will utilize its BSL3 laboratory capabilities to rapidly leverage its large scale, Vero-based, viral GMP manufacturing facility in Scotland
 The combination of VLA2001 and CpG 1018 is expected to stimulate a strong immune response and generates high titers of neutralizing Ab. The companies will work with regulatory authorities to accelerate the clinical development path with an aim to initiate clinical studies before the end of 2020","Valneva is leveraging its technical and platform capabilities to develop an inactivated, whole virus vaccine candidate against the current coronavirus threat
Dynavax is providing CpG 1018, the adjuvant contained in U.S. FDA-approved HEPLISAV-B vaccine, to support the development of Valneva´s COVID-19 vaccine candidate
Valneva will seek grant funding to support the required investment for this program
Saint-Herblain (France), Emeryville (U.S.), April 22, 2020 – Valneva SE, a specialty vaccine company focused on prevention against diseases with major unmet needs, and Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel vaccines, today announced their collaboration to initiate a vaccine program for the current coronavirus, COVID-19.

Valneva´s scientific team has tirelessly explored opportunities to rapidly leverage Valneva´s existing technology, capabilities and infrastructure to create a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate in response to the current pandemic.

Valneva is leveraging its well-established platform for IXIARO®, the Company’s commercial vaccine product indicated for active immunization for the prevention of Japanese encephalitis. This platform operates on a highly purified Vero-cell based, inactivated, whole virus strategy for vaccine development.

Dynavax is providing technical expertise and the company’s proprietary toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist adjuvant, CpG 1018, the adjuvant used in HEPLISAV-B® [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted], an adult hepatitis B vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dynavax developed CpG 1018 to provide an increased vaccine immune response, which has been demonstrated in HEPLISAV-B. CpG 1018 provides a well‑developed technology and a significant safety database, potentially accelerating the development and large-scale manufacturing of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Valneva will use its Biosafety Level 3 laboratory capabilities to rapidly leverage its large scale, Vero-based, viral Good Manufacturing Practice manufacturing facility in Livingston, Scotland, where both IXIARO® and VLA1553, the Company’s vaccine candidate against chikungunya, are currently manufactured.

Wolfgang Bender, Ph.D., M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Valneva, commented: “Valneva aims to contribute to a world in which no one dies or suffers from a vaccine-preventable disease, such as COVID-19. Although different vaccine technologies are being deployed in the global effort to combat COVID-19, we believe that a proven approach is the best option for rapidly delivering a safe and effective vaccine. The proven approach that we are taking to develop VLA2001 has the potential to yield protection for the general population, as well as high risk groups, including the elderly, immuno-compromised and individuals suffering from other diseases.”

Ryan Spencer, Chief Executive Officer of Dynavax commented: “Now more than ever, the world is feeling the crucial role vaccines play in protecting our families, communities, and those at high risk for infectious disease. Dynavax’s mission is to investigate, innovate, and improve vaccines to provide protection for an unpredictable world. We are pleased to partner with Valneva on this important development effort to address the global health crisis spawned by COVID-19.”

Professor George Siber, MD, Member of Valneva´s Scientific Advisory Board commented: “Although many companies are advancing novel vaccine approaches to develop a vaccine against SARS-COV-2, the Scientific Advisory Board strongly supports this approach. There is a high likelihood that a modern, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine combined with an adjuvant such as CpG 1018 could be effective and safe.”

Valneva and Dynavax will work with regulatory authorities to align on the optimal strategy to execute an expedited clinical development path, with the goal to initiate clinical trials before the end of 2020.

About the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Disease
SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus identified in late 2019 and belongs to a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. The virus, which causes a disease named COVID-19, has never before been found in humans. Since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has infected over 2.5 million people and has caused over 170,000 reported deaths (as of April 22, 2020). It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, there is no vaccine available for COVID-19.

About VLA 2001
VLA2001 is a Vero-cell based, highly purified inactivated vaccine candidate against the SARS-COV-2 virus, leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine. The Company has designed a process that largely uses this platform in regards to upstream- and downstream process steps as plug-and-play with moderate adjustments. The process includes inactivation with BPL to preserve the native structure of the S protein. The combination with CpG 1018 is expected to induce a strong immune response and has the potential to generate high titers of neutralizing antibodies.

31514,The European Commission Approves the Merger of Mylan and Upjohn with Conditions,"Mergers: Commission approves the merger of Mylan and Pfizer’s Upjohn division, subject to conditions","The EC has approved the Viatris merger (a merger b/w Upjohn and Mylan) under EU merger regulations but the decision is conditional on the divestment of Mylan’s certain generic therapies
 EC ensures that the merger does not harm competition and preserves the competitive access to certain genericized therapies for national health services and the citizens of EU. The EC has investigated the vertical relationships b/w the companies concerning API, out-licensing the supply of genericized therapies
 Mylan and Upjohn overlap in multiple therapeutic areas such as CV, Genito-urinary, musculoskeletal, CNS and sensory organ treatments, but no competition concerns arise for most of the products. The concern was found for 36 molecules in certain EU countries, requiring Mylan to offload those therapies","The European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the proposed merger between the global pharmaceutical company Mylan and Upjohn, a business division of Pfizer, which operates Pfizer’s off-patent branded and generic established medicines. The decision is conditional on the divestment of Mylan’s business for certain generic medicines.

The transaction will lead to the combination of Mylan, one of the top five generic suppliers in the EEA with the originator Upjohn, whose products have lost exclusivity following patent expiries.

Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, responsible for competition policy, said: “Ensuring that patients and hospitals have access to medicines at fair and competitive prices, as well as ensuring security of supply, is always a key priority which resonates even more strongly in the current challenging context. Our decision ensures that the merger between Mylan and Upjohn does not harm competition, thus preserving competitive access to certain genericised medicines for national health services and European citizens”.

The Commission’s investigation

The Commission’s investigation focused on the market for genericised medicines, which are sold to pharmacies and hospitals. Mylan and Upjohn overlap in various therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular, genito-urinary, musculoskeletal, nervous system, and sensory organ treatments.

The Commission found that for the genericised medicines involved in this case, competition between suppliers typically takes place (i) at the national level, given the differing national regulatory/reimbursement schemes and competitive dynamics between pharmaceutical suppliers, (ii) between medicines using the same chemical molecule as an active pharmaceutical ingredient for a specific therapeutic indication. Generally, the molecules covered by the investigation are not interchangeable with other molecules for patients or health practitioners and should therefore be assessed separately.

The Commission’s investigation found that no competition concerns arise for the majority of the products supplied by both Mylan and Upjohn. However, in some countries and for some molecules, the Commission found the transaction would raise competition concerns because of the strong position of the two companies and the limited number of significant competitors on the market. In particular, concerns were found for 36 molecule-country pairs as indicated in the table below:

The Commission also investigated the vertical relationships between Mylan and Upjohn With respect to (i) active pharmaceutical ingredients and (ii) out-licensing which are both upstream to the supply of genericised medicines. The Commission concluded that no competition concerns arise in this regard.

To address these concerns, Mylan and Upjohn offered to divest to one or more suitable purchasers, Mylan’s business in the relevant markets, including the applicable marketing authorisations, contracts and brands, as well as transitory manufacturing and supply arrangements. These include certain generic medicines across 20 countries throughout the EEA and the UK.

The proposed commitments remove the entire overlaps between Mylan and Upjohn in the markets raising serious doubts and fully address all of the Commission’s competition concerns.

The Commission therefore concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns in the EEA. The decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments.

Companies and products

Mylan, based in the Netherlands, is a vertically-integrated global pharmaceutical company that develops, licenses, manufactures, markets and distributes generic, branded generic and specialty pharmaceuticals.

Upjohn, based in China, is a business division of the global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which operates Pfizer’s off-patent branded and generic established medicines business, including products sold under the brands Viagra, Xanax and Lipitor.

Merger control rules and procedures

The transaction was notified to the Commission on 28 February 2020.

The Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the EU Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the EEA or any substantial part of it.

The vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has a total of 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval or to start an in-depth investigation. This deadline is extended to 35 working days in cases where remedies are submitted by the parties, such as in this case.

More information will be available on the Commission’s competition website, in the Commission’s public case register under the case number M.9517.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/viatris.jpg,Pharma,Mylan | Pfizer | Upjohn,-,Pharma | approves | conditions | european commission | merger,publish,23/4/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/mergers-commission-approves-the-merger-of-mylan-and-pfizers-upjohn-division-subject-to-conditions/,https://pharmashots.com/31514/the-european-commission-approves-the-merger-of-mylan-and-upjohn-with-conditions/
31523,AstraZeneca and Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute to Initiate P-III DARE-19 Evaluating Farxiga Against COVID-19,AstraZeneca and Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute initiate Phase III DARE-19 trial with Farxiga in COVID-19 patients,"AstraZeneca and Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute have initiated P-III study to assess Farxiga (dapagliflozin) + SOC vs PBO in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 having a risk of developing serious complications like organ failure
 The primary outcome of the study is time to the first occurrence of death from any cause or new/worsened organ dysfunction via 30days of follow-up. The P-III DARE-19 study is enrolling patients in the US and EU with an aim to recruit ~900 patients
 Farxiga (PO, QD) is an SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monothx. and combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control, weight loss and BP reduction","Trial will assess the potential of Farxiga in reducing the risk of serious complications and organ failure
AstraZeneca and Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute have initiated a randomised, global Phase III trial to assess the potential of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) as a treatment in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who are at risk of developing serious complications, such as organ failure.

The goal of the trial, called DARE-19, is to assess whether Farxiga, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, can reduce the risk of disease progression, clinical complications, and death due to COVID-19 in patients who also have cardiovascular (CV), metabolic or kidney risk factors.

Cardiac, renal and metabolic comorbidities have been associated with poor outcomes and death in COVID-19 patients. The trial design is supported by extensive data on the protective effect of Farxiga in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), chronic kidney disease (CKD) or type 2 diabetes (T2D).1-5

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “AstraZeneca is committed to finding new solutions to fight COVID-19 by investigating the application of our new and existing medicines. With the Phase III DARE-19 trial, we aim to test whether Farxiga can prevent serious complications such as organ failure in those patients with pre-existing health conditions, a critical goal when treating COVID-19.”

Mikhail N. Kosiborod, M.D., cardiologist at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Vice President of Research at Saint Luke’s Health System, and principal investigator of DARE-19 said: “Dapagliflozin has demonstrated cardio and renal protective benefits and improved outcomes in high-risk patients with type-2 diabetes, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and chronic kidney disease. Patients with COVID-19 and underlying cardiometabolic disease appear to be at the highest risk of morbid complications. Through DARE-19, we hope to decrease the severity of illness, and prevent cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney decompensation, which are common in patients with COVID-19.”

The DARE-19 trial is open for enrolment in the US and other European countries with a high COVID-19 burden and aims to recruit approximately 900 patients.

DARE-19

DARE-19 is an international, parallel-group, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-sponsored Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Farxiga in addition to background local standard of care therapy, on the risk of all-cause death or disease progression and complications in adults who are hospitalised with COVID-19 at the time of trial enrolment. Patients enrolled in DARE-19 also have a medical history of hypertension (HTN), atherosclerotic CV disease, heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, T2D or CKD Stage III to IV. The primary efficacy outcome of the trial is time to first occurrence of death from any cause or new/worsened organ dysfunction through 30 days of follow-up.

Some of the patients at highest risk of COVID-19 complications appear to be those with cardiometabolic disease. 6,7,8 CV complications, including acute myocardial injury and heart failure (HF) are common in COVID-19, and appear to be key drivers of poor outcomes and death especially in patients with pre-existing CV disease and/or CKD. 9,10

COVID-19 and AstraZeneca Research

AstraZeneca is rapidly mobilising its COVID-19 research efforts to focus on key areas: identifying novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to prevent or treat disease progression; and investigating the application of our new and existing medicines to suppress the body’s overactive immune response, or protect from serious complications, such as organ failure caused by COVID-19 disease.

Farxiga

Farxiga is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled T2D as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction. In the DECLARE CV outcomes trial in adults with T2D, Farxiga reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of hospitalisation for HF or CV death versus placebo, when added to standard of care.

31573,Theravance Reports First Patient Dosing in P-I Study with TD-0903 to Treat Patients with Acute Lung Injury Associated with COVID-19,"Theravance Biopharma Announces First Subject Dosed in Phase 1 Study of TD-0903, in Development for the Treatment of Hospitalized Patients with Acute Lung Injury Caused by COVID-19","The company reported the dosing of a first healthy volunteer in a P-I study of TD-0903 and anticipates that TD-0903 has the potential to inhibit the cytokine storm associated with ALI and prevent progression to ARDS
 Earlier, Theravance has received approval to initiate the P-I study for assessing safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAD/MAD of TD-0903 in healthy volunteers and will enroll up to 54 volunteers in the UK. Following the regulatory review and approval, the program will move to P-II study in the same clinical setting
 TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized pan-JAK inhibitor and showed the reduction in the signaling of multiple cytokines associated with cytokine storm syndrome in its preclinical study","DUBLIN and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., April 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: TBPH) (“Theravance Biopharma” or the “Company”), a diversified biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of organ-selective medicines, today announced that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase 1 study of TD-0903. TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) in development for the potential treatment of hospitalized patients with Acute Lung Injury (ALI) caused by COVID-19. The Company believes TD-0903 has the potential to inhibit the cytokine storm associated with ALI and prevent progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

Theravance Biopharma received approval of TD-0903’s initial Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in the United Kingdom (UK) for the Phase 1 study. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-ascending doses (SAD/MAD) of TD-0903 in healthy volunteers and will enroll up to 54 volunteers. More information can be found on clinicaltrials.gov, identifier number: NCT04350736. Upon regulatory review and approval, the program will then initially move to a nested Phase 2 study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the same clinical setting in the UK.

“Theravance Biopharma’s efforts to address COVID-19 leverage years of experience in developing lung-selective medicines to treat respiratory disease. We are pleased to have received expedited approval of TD-0903’s CTA and are working to progress this potential treatment option through clinical trials as quickly as possible,” said Rick E Winningham, Chief Executive Officer. “The clinical site that we are working with has a long history of evaluating our inhaled medicines, and we are proud to be working with them to advance TD-0903 into clinical testing.”

“There is accumulating evidence that a subgroup of patients with COVID-19 develop a dysfunctional immune response resulting in a cytokine storm within the lungs. JAK inhibition could be an important intervention to treat this hyperinflammation,” said Brett Haumann, M.D., Chief Medical Officer. “TD-0903 has been shown in preclinical studies to have broad pan-JAK inhibition, reducing the signaling of multiple cytokines that have been associated with cytokine storm syndrome. Additionally, the nebulized formulation and organ-selective properties of TD-0903 have the potential to address hyperinflammation in the lung without suppressing the systemic immune system, leading to potential patient benefit and improved utilization of limited hospital critical care resources.”

About TD-0903

TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized pan-JAK inhibitor that was discovered and developed at Theravance Biopharma. TD-0903 has been shown in experimental murine models to have potent, broad inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling in the airways following challenges with multiple cytokines. By its mechanism, TD-0903 has the potential to block release of cytokines and chemokines that may be associated with acute lung injury and the initiation of a cytokine storm syndrome. Preclinical studies suggest that TD-0903 has a very high lung:plasma ratio and rapid metabolic clearance resulting in low systemic exposure, compatible with its lung selectivity. TD‑0903 is administered via nebulized inhalation solution, which further enhances its lung selectivity. Preclinical pharmacodynamic studies indicate that TD-0903 has an extended duration of action that should enable once or twice daily dosing in humans.

As disclosed initially at Theravance Biopharma’s December 2018 Research and Development Day, the Company indicated the initial clinical application of TD-0903 would be to explore its utility in preventing/delaying graft rejection among individuals receiving lung transplantation. Although this is still a potential clinical application for TD-0903, in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has prioritized activities toward assessing the potential for TD-0903 to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients who become short of breath and whose blood oxygen levels begin to drop. These patients appear to be at increased risk of respiratory complications including ALI and ARDS. They may also require prolonged hospitalization, continuous oxygen and, in the most severe cases, admission to ICU to assist their breathing with non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation. Treatment with JAK inhibition is recognized as an important anti-inflammatory mechanism to potentially reduce the hyperinflammation seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who develop ALI and ARDS.1

Following the completion of the Phase 1 study, Phase 2 will consist of two parts. The first part will assess the safety, tolerability and clinical response to treatment in sequential ascending dose cohorts of COVID-19 patients in the UK. This part of the study will not be formally powered for efficacy but will inform the selection of dose(s) for the second part. The second part of the Phase 2 study will be a larger, multi-center study conducted at hospital-based clinical sites in the UK, and potentially other clinical sites in the European Union and United States. Both of the latter territories would join the Phase 2 study program following review and approval of the relevant regulatory filings required by the relevant EU National Competent Authorities and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Further details on the program, including more on the Phase 2 study will be provided once these studies have been approved by the appropriate regulatory and ethics review authorities.

About the Inhaled JAK Inhibitor Program

JAK inhibitors function by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Limiting JAK inhibition to the lung is expected to improve therapeutic index relative to systemic inhibition. Thus, inhaled JAK inhibitors with lung-restricted exposure are of high interest as potential treatments for respiratory illness.

TD-8236 is the Company’s most advanced investigational pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor currently designed for delivery to the lungs using a dry powder inhaler (DPI). Similar to TD-0903, TD-8236 is a lung-selective agent designed to inhibit the JAK family of enzymes in lung tissue with limited systemic exposure. An extensive set of preclinical pharmacological studies and toxicological studies support its current clinical development in the primary indication of moderate to severe asthma. Insights from the ongoing clinical development of TD-8236 DPI are informing the Company’s confidence to bring TD-0903 forward for the treatment of COVID-19 acute lung injury.

In addition, Theravance Biopharma is currently assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations, including on the commercial operations associated with YUPELRI® (revefenacin inhalation solution) and on the conduct of its clinical development programs for TD-1473, ampreloxetine and TD‑8236. The situation continues to evolve as the pandemic’s effects are felt around the world. The Company has implemented a comprehensive business continuity plan to support its performance, and it remains well capitalized to advance the company despite the obstacles presented by the current environment. The Company will provide further program updates during its Q1 financial results and business update call in early May 2020.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefiting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

31653,AstraZeneca and MSD Report Results of Lynparza in P-III PROfound Study for BRCA1/2 or ATM-Mutated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,Lynparza demonstrated overall survival benefit in Phase III PROfound trial for BRCA1/2 or ATM-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,"The P-III PROfound study involves assessing of Lynparza vs enzalutamide or abiraterone in patients with mCRPC, progressed on prior treatment with NHA treatments (abiraterone or enzalutamide) along with tumor mutation in BRCA1/2, ATM or one of 12 other genes involved in the HRR pathway
 The P-III PROfound study demonstrated improvement in OS and is already met its 1EPs i.e. improvement in rPFS in men with mutations in BRCA1/2 or ATM genes in Aug’2019 and a 2EPs of rPFS in the overall HRRm population 
 Lynparza is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor acts by targeting DDR in cells/tumors harboring a deficiency in HRR (BRCA1& 2 mutation) and has received the US FDA’s PR designation for patients with HRRm mCRPC in Jan’20. Additionally, the companies are working on ongoing P-III PROpel trial with its expected results in 2021","Only PARP inhibitor to improve overall survival vs. new hormonal agent treatments for this advanced prostate cancer population with high unmet needs
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced further positive results from the Phase III PROfound trial of Lynparza (olaparib) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have a homologous recombination repair gene mutation (HRRm) and have progressed on prior treatment with new hormonal agent (NHA) treatments (e.g. enzalutamide and abiraterone).

Results from the trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the key secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with Lynparza versus enzalutamide or abiraterone in men with mCRPC selected for BRCA1/2 or ATM gene mutations, a subpopulation of HRR gene mutations.

The Phase III PROfound trial had met its primary endpoint in August 2019, showing significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in men with mutations in BRCA1/2 or ATM genes, and had met a key secondary endpoint of rPFS in the overall HRRm population.

José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Overall survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has remained extremely challenging to achieve. We are thrilled by these results for Lynparza and we are working with regulatory authorities to bring this medicine to patients as soon as possible.”

Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Lynparza has demonstrated significant clinical benefit across key endpoints in PROfound, including overall survival for patients with BRCA or ATM mutations, and this reinforces its potential to change the treatment standard for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. These data further support MSD and AstraZeneca’s commitment to uncovering the ways in which Lynparza can help patients impacted by cancer.”

The safety and tolerability profile of Lynparza was generally consistent with previous trials. The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.

Lynparza was granted Priority Review in the US for patients with HRRm mCRPC in January 2020, with regulatory reviews ongoing in the EU and other jurisdictions. AstraZeneca and MSD are exploring additional trials in prostate cancer including the ongoing Phase III PROpel trial, with first data expected in 2021, testing Lynparza as a 1st-line medicine for patients with mCRPC in combination with abiraterone acetate versus abiraterone acetate alone.

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer

Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer in men, with an estimated 1.3 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2018, and is associated with a significant mortality rate.1 Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone.2 In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones.2 Approximately 10-20% of men with advanced prostate cancer will develop CRPC within five years, and at least 84% of these men will have metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis.3 Of men with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.3 Despite advances in treatment for men with mCRPC, five-year survival is low and extending survival remains a key goal for treating these men.3

HRR gene mutations

HRR mutations occur in approximately 20-30% of patients with mCRPC.4 HRR genes allow for accurate repair of damaged DNA in normal cells.5,6 HRR deficiency (HRD) means the DNA damage cannot be repaired, and can result in normal cell death.6 This is different in cancer cells, where a mutation in HRR pathways leads to abnormal cell growth and therefore

cancer.6 HRD is a well-documented target for PARP inhibitors, such as Lynparza. PARP inhibitors block a rescue DNA damage repair mechanism by trapping PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks which leads to replication fork stalling causing their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks, which in turn lead to cancer cell death.6 

PROfound

PROfound is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of Lynparzaversus enzalutamide or abiraterone in patients with mCRPC who have progressed on prior treatment with NHA treatments (abiraterone or enzalutamide) and have a qualifying tumour mutation in BRCA1/2, ATM or one of 12 other genes involved in the HRR pathway.

The trial was designed to analyse patients with HRRm genes in two cohorts: the primary endpoint was rPFS in those with mutations in BRCA1/2 or ATM genes and then, if Lynparza showed clinical benefit, a formal analysis was performed of the overall trial population of patients with HRRm genes (BRCA1/2, ATM, CDK12 and 11 other HRRm genes; a key secondary endpoint).

Lynparza

Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.

Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. Lynparza is approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in several jurisdictions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.

The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration 

In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and Koselugo (selumetinib), a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and Koselugo in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

– Transaction further accelerates Company’s deleveraging plan

Osaka, JAPAN, April 24, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest a portfolio of select non-core over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription pharmaceutical products sold in Europe, and two manufacturing sites located in Denmark and Poland to Orifarm Group (“Orifarm”), a fast-growing Danish pharmaceutical company, for up to approximately $670 million USD subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

The portfolio to be divested to Orifarm includes a variety of OTC products and food supplements as well as select prescription products in the Respiratory, Anti-inflammatory, Cardiovascular and Endocrinology therapeutic areas sold predominantly in Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Baltics and Austria. The portfolio generated FY 2018 net sales of approximately $230 million USD, driven by strong sales of cough/cold and vitamin OTC brands, as well as prescription products Warfarin and Levaxin. While the products included in the sale address key patient needs in these countries, they are outside of Takeda’s chosen business areas – Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology, and Neuroscience – core to its global long-term growth strategy.

“These divestments will enable us to further prioritize and reinforce efforts in our core business areas” said Giles Platford, President, Europe & Canada Business Unit, Takeda. “Throughout the robust sale process we conducted for these assets, we focused on finding the right partner to maximize the value of these trusted products and maintain continuity of supply for the patients and customers who depend on them. We are confident that Orifarm is the right partner for these regions.”

“This transaction represents the continued execution of our strategy to simplify our portfolio and accelerate deleveraging. We remain focused on investing in our key business areas as we continue strengthening our position as a R&D-driven global biopharmaceutical leader and deliver enhanced value for patients and Takeda shareholders,” said Costa Saroukos, Chief Financial Officer, Takeda.

Takeda has announced a series of divestments in the past twelve months, contributing to the Company’s goal to divest approximately $10 billion USD in non-core assets and focus on its key business areas. Takeda announced last month the sale of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera Pharma for $825 million USD. Takeda also completed sales of non-core assets spanning the Russia-CIS region to STADA for $660 million USD and in countries spanning the Near East, Middle East and Africa region to Acino for over $200 million USD last month. In July 2019, Takeda completed the sale of Xiidra® to Novartis for up to $5.3 billion USD.

Takeda intends to use the proceeds from its divestitures to continue to reduce its debt towards its target of 2x net debt/adjusted EBITDA within March 2022 – March 2024.

Transaction Details
Takeda has entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of approximately 110 select OTC and prescription pharmaceutical assets sold in Europe to Orifarm for a total value of up to approximately $670 million USD subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions. Orifarm will pay approximately $505 million USD to Takeda in cash at closing, and approximately $70 million USD in non-contingent cash to be paid within four years post-closing. In addition, Takeda may receive up to an additional $95 million USD in potential milestone payments.

Two manufacturing sites in Denmark and Poland will also be transferred to Orifarm at closing. The parties will also enter into additional manufacturing and supply agreements, under which Takeda will continue to manufacture selected products on behalf of Orifarm. Under the terms of the agreement, Orifarm will acquire the rights, title and interest to the products in the portfolio exclusive to these countries.

It is anticipated that approximately 600 employees from the manufacturing sites, sales and marketing professionals, and other select professionals supporting the portfolio and manufacturing sites to be divested will transition to Orifarm at closing of the transaction.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of Fiscal Year 2020 (ending March 2021) subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, receipt of required regulatory clearances and, where applicable, compliance with local works council requirements. Until then, the products will continue to be made available to patients and manufactured and supplied by Takeda.

Takeda is being advised by J.P. Morgan as our financial advisor and White & Case is our legal advisor in this transaction.

31687,Sanofi Receives the US FDA's Approval for its MenQuadfi Meningococcal (MenACWY) Conjugate Vaccine,"FDA approves MenQuadfi, the latest innovation in meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccination","The US FDA’s approval is based on five P-II & P-III studies assessing MenQuadfi vs licensed quadrivalent meningococcal in ~5000 people aged ≥2yrs. Four studies evaluated MenQuadfi in meningococcal-naïve person and the other study evaluated MenQuadfi in persons prior to immunized with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine
 Meningococcal-naïve person showed 55.4%–97.2% vaccine induced response 30 days following vaccination with MenQuadfi while prior vaccinated group demonstrated 92.2%–98.2% immune response against each serogroup. The company is investigating the vaccine in ongoing P-III study in infants as young as 6wks. of age
 The approval marks MenQuadfi as the only US FDA approved quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine indicated for person 2-56yrs. of age and older and is the only vaccine that uses tetanus toxoid as a protein carrier","Latest innovation in quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination designed for use in persons 2 years of age and older in the U.S.
Safety and effectiveness studied in five double-blind, randomized clinical trials with nearly 5,000 individuals
Helps protect an expanded age group and elicits a high immune response across multiple ages
Under regulatory review in Europe and other countries to help support local immunization efforts
 

PARIS – April 24, 2020 – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a Biologics License Application for MenQuadfiTM Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, W) Conjugate Vaccine for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease in persons 2 years of age and older.

“Meningococcal meningitis remains a major global health challenge because it can strike quickly and with devastating effect, taking a life in less than 24 hours. With the ability to help prevent this disease through vaccination, Sanofi believes one case is one too many,” said David Loew, Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur. “Approval of this new vaccine in the U.S. represents an important milestone in the ongoing fight to help protect as many people as possible from meningococcal disease. It is our ambition to make this vaccine available to further expand protection to individuals worldwide.”

MenQuadfi is Sanofi’s Latest MenACWY Innovation

MenQuadfi was designed to elicit and demonstrated a high immune response across all four serogroups for multiple ages and was well tolerated. MenQuadfi is intended to protect an expanded age group. Licensure marks MenQuadfi as the only U.S. FDA-approved quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine indicated for persons 2 through 56 years of age and older.1 MenQuadfi is the first and only quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine in the U.S. that uses tetanus toxoid as a protein carrier. It will be available in a ready-to-use liquid formulation allowing healthcare providers to avoid vaccine reconstitution.

The ongoing Phase 3 trials are investigating use in infants as young as 6 weeks of age to better address the worldwide needs for meningococcal disease prevention throughout life.

“Given the severity and unpredictability of meningococcal disease, there is a public health need to ensure immunization across multiple ages, consistent with U.S. recommendations,” said Corey Robertson, MD, Senior Director, Scientific and Medical Affairs at Sanofi Pasteur. “MenQuadfi’s pivotal clinical trials demonstrated a high immune response across all four serogroups and provides a new vaccine option to help protect an expanded age group.”

MenQuadfi’s FDA approval is based on a robust clinical program

The FDA approval is based on clinical data from five double-blind, randomized, multicenter Phase 2 and 3 trials that assessed safety and immune responses following vaccination, with nearly 5,000 persons 2 years of age and older. Based on study objectives, immune responses elicited by MenQuadfi achieved non-inferiority compared to those induced by licensed quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Four studies evaluated MenQuadfi in meningococcal-naïve persons; the other study evaluated MenQuadfi in persons previously immunized with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. Against each of the four meningococcal serogroups (A, C, W, Y), the majority (55.4%–97.2%) of meningococcal-naïve trial participants had a vaccine-induced immune response 30 days following vaccination with MenQuadfi. Among adolescents and adults previously vaccinated, 92.2%–98.2% demonstrated an immune response against each serogroup.

The most common side effects following a first dose of MenQuadfi included injection site pain (25.5%–45.2%), muscle ache (20.1%–35.6%), headache (12.5%–30.2%), and tiredness (14.5%–26.0%). In adolescents and adults receiving a MenQuadfi booster, similar rates of these reactions were observed.

Pivotal study results demonstrating MenQuadfi’s safety and effectiveness in inducing an immune response across all four serogroups have been published, including the performance of MenQuadfi in adolescents when the vaccine was co-administered with other routinely recommended vaccines,2 and its performance as a booster.3 Additional data were presented at the 2019 European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases Annual Meeting and IDWeek 2019.

MenQuadfi is expected to be available to providers and pharmacies nationwide in the U.S. for immunization efforts in 2021.

Sanofi’s legacy includes more than 45 years at the forefront of meningococcal disease prevention

MenQuadfi builds on Sanofi’s legacy at the forefront of meningococcal disease prevention beginning with the first monovalent vaccine for Africa in 1974. Since then, Sanofi has worked to progressively extend protection against four of the most prevalent meningococcal disease serogroups with the first quadrivalent vaccine registered in the U.S. in 1981, followed by the first quadrivalent conjugate vaccine licensed in 2005.4

Meningococcal Disease is a Public Health Concern

In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends vaccination against meningococcal disease at 11-12 years of age and a second dose at 16 years of age.5 Despite strong public health recommendations, about half of teens have not received the recommended second dose of MenACWY vaccine by 17 years of age, leaving them vulnerable when they are at increased risk for the disease.6 Hundreds of cases of vaccine-preventable meningococcal disease (caused by serogroups B, C, W, Y) still occur annually in the U.S. and, despite treatment, one in five survivors suffer from permanent complications such as hearing loss, organ damage, and limb amputations.7

Around the world, meningococcal disease is highly unpredictable, and it varies widely across regions and ages. Accordingly, vaccination recommendations differ from country to country. Disease still occurs in unvaccinated individuals. MenQuadfi’s safety and effectiveness data are currently under review though not yet fully evaluated by other health authorities, including those in several other countries and the European Union, to help address their local vaccination recommendations.

 What is MenQuadfi?

MenQuadfi is a vaccine given to people 2 years of age and older to help prevent invasive meningococcal disease (including meningitis) caused by serogroups A, C, W, and Y of the bacterium N meningitidis. MenQuadfi does not prevent serogroup B disease.

Important Safety Information for MenQuadfi in the U.S.

MenQuadfi should not be given to people who have had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of MenQuadfi, any of its ingredients, or another vaccine that contains tetanus toxoid.

If MenQuadfi is given to people with a compromised immune system, including those receiving therapies that suppress the immune system, the immune response may be lower than expected. People with certain complement deficiencies and people taking certain complement inhibitors (for example, eculizumab) may still be at risk for meningococcal disease even if they receive a meningococcal vaccine, including MenQuadfi.

Fainting can occur shortly before or after injecting vaccines, including MenQuadfi.

Tell your health care provider if you ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe muscle weakness) after a previous meningococcal vaccination.

Vaccination with MenQuadfi may not protect all people who receive the vaccine.

The most common side effects after a first dose of MenQuadfi for people 2 years and older include pain where the shot is given; muscle aches, headache, and tiredness. In children 2 through 9 years of age, other common side effects include redness and swelling where the shot is given. In adolescents and adults receiving a booster dose of MenQuadfi, the most common side effects include those occurring after a first dose. Other side effects may occur.

31803,Santhera Signs a Clinical Trial Agreement with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to Evaluate Lonodelestat (POL6014) Against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Associated with COVID-19,Santhera and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to Investigate Lonodelestat (POL6014) in COVID-19-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),"Santhera to provide its lonodelestat and intellectual support for the scientists at CSHL who will conduct the non-clinical research program and validates hNE as a target and shed light on lonodelestat as a potential therapy against COVID-19
 Researchers at CSHL are part of the consortium of international non/clinical experts called the ‘NETwork to target neutrophils in COVID-19’. The NETwork will evaluate the role of neutrophils and NETs in the pathology of COVID-19 and hNE along with other targets to treat COVID-19
 Lonodelestat (POL6014) is a selective hNE inhibitor and has completed its P-I single-dose escalation studies in healthy volunteers and patients with CF and is currently investigated in a multiple ascending dose study in CF patients","Pratteln, Switzerland, April 27, 2020 – Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) has entered into a collaboration agreement with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) to investigate the potential of lonodelestat (POL6014), a potent inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase (hNE), as a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Researchers at CSHL are part of a recently formed consortium of international non-clinical and clinical experts called the ‘NETwork to target neutrophils in COVID-19’. This NETwork will study the role of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the pathology of COVID-19 as well as hNE and other targets for intervention for the purpose of treating COVID-19 [1, 2].

NETs are macromolecular structures of DNA and proteins that neutrophils can expel, for example during severe inflammation. hNE is released by neutrophils when they form NETs. There are clear similarities between the clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 and diseases known to involve NETs, such as ARDS. On this basis, the NETwork has developed the rationale that excess NETs may play a major role in COVID-19 and that inhibition of hNE may be a therapeutic strategy to antagonize NETs in COVID-19 patients.

Santhera will provide lonodelestat and intellectual support for the scientists at CSHL who will conduct the non-clinical research program. The work is expected to further validate hNE as a target and shed light on this clinical stage compound as a potential agent also in COVID-19.

“There is a strong scientific rationale that inhibition of hNE may interrupt a neutrophil-driven inflammatory cascade that leads to ARDS in COVID-19 patients” explained Mikala Egeblad, PhD, Associate Professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York. “Based on previous work with lonodelestat in models of ARDS and acute lung injury, we were very encouraged about the potential of lonodelestat. Our own research in non-clinical models will start immediately and we are delighted that Santhera has offered their support in our efforts to find a potential novel treatment that could be investigated in patients with COVID-19.”

“We would like to thank CSHL and collaborating clinicians that have approached us to support their efforts to further explore and understand the role of hNE in relation to ARDS in COVID-19,” said Kristina Sjöblom Nygren, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Development of Santhera.

About lonodolestat (POL6014)
Lonodelestat (previously known as POL6014) is a highly potent and selective peptide inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase (hNE). In preclinical studies lonodelestat was effective in animal models of neutrophil activation in lung tissue and of acute lung injury (ALI) [3, 4]. Lonodelestat is an investigational drug which completed Phase 1 single dose escalation studies in healthy volunteers and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is currently investigated in a multiple ascending dose study in CF patients. Current data demonstrated that single dose inhalation of lonodelestat can lead to high drug concentrations within the lung, resulting in inhibition of hNE in sputum of patients, an enzyme associated with lung tissue inflammation [5].

About human neutrophil elastase (hNE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19
Activated or necrotic neutrophils liberate human neutrophil elastase (hNE) in the lung which causes damage to the pulmonary microenvironment. hNE is also a critical enzyme in neutrophils and it is required for neutrophils to form NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps) as part of the body’s immune response. Under conditions of severe inflammation, neutrophils can expel NETs which can aggravate pulmonary inflammation and may contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inhibition of hNE activity may therefore display a dual action: it may block the toxicity of hNE in the lung tissue, prevent the formation of NETs and therefore may allow combating ARDS in patients with COVID-19.

 The focus of the study is to evaluate PK safety & efficacy of the therapy in pediatric pJIA patients and the data of pJIA patients were compared to its P-III GO-FURTHER study of SIMPONI ARIA in adult patients with RA and the data of jPsA patients was compared to the results of P-III GO-VIBRANT study in adults patients with PsA
 SIMPONI ARIA is an anti-TNF-alpha mAb targeting both soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-alpha and is administered via a 30-min infusion, approved for moderately to severely active RA, active PsA or active AS","Submissions demonstrate Janssen’s commitment to developing new options
for young patients
HORSHAM, PA, April 24, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of
Johnson & Johnson today announced the submission of two supplemental Biologics
License Applications (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking
approval of SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and juvenile psoriatic arthritis (jPsA), in patients two years
of age and older in combination with methotrexate. If approved for these indications,
SIMPONI ARIA would be the first anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha biologic
agent administered by intravenous infusion available for the treatment of these
juvenile arthritides.
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a group of disorders characterized by arthritis
Page 2 of 8
persisting for at least six weeks before the age of 16 years.i
Approximately 300,000
children suffer from some form of JIA in the United States.ii The polyarticular form of
JIA is most common and is characterized by inflammation in more than four joints
and resembles adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA).iii Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is
one of the rarest subtypes of JIA and is characterized by both joint inflammation and
skin lesions associated with psoriasis resembling adult PsA.iv,v
“All forms of JIA can be debilitating for children who live with the disease, and their
parents and physicians often have a difficult time establishing a treatment plan given
the limited options currently available for pediatric patients,” said Alyssa Johnsen,
M.D., Ph.D., Vice President and Rheumatology Disease Area Leader, Janssen
Research & Development, LLC. “At Janssen, we are focused on addressing unmet
needs for all patients and are especially pleased to be taking these positive steps that
could make a new treatment option available for these young patients.”
The submissions are based on results from the GO-VIVA Phase 3 clinical trial, which
was an open-label study conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and
efficacy of SIMPONI ARIA in children with pJIA ages two to 17 years who had active
arthritis in five or more joints, despite receiving treatment with methotrexate for at
least two months. The trial also included patients with jPsA.
GO-VIVA was designed to extrapolate data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical
development program for SIMPONI ARIA. Data extrapolation is the process of
estimating future trends or effects based on previous observations. With limited
pediatric patients available for clinical trial inclusion, researchers can extrapolate data
from adult patient trials to determine the potential efficacy and tolerability of a
treatment for the pediatric population.
About the GO-VIVA Clinical Trial
GO-VIVA is a Phase 3, open-label, single arm, multicenter study conducted across
nine countries with treatment received by 127 patients with active pJIA, despite
current treatment with methotrexate. GO-VIVA is included as a post-marketing
requirement under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) following the initial
Page 3 of 8
approval of SIMPONI ARIA for adults with moderately to severely active RA in 2013.
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics safety and efficacy of
SIMPONI ARIA in pJIA in pediatric patients aged two to 17 years. The
pharmacokinetic and efficacy data in pJIA patients were compared to adult RA
patients from the SIMPONI ARIA Phase 3 GO-FURTHER trial and the
pharmacokinetics and efficacy results in jPsA patients were compared to adult PsA
patients from the Phase 3 GO-VIBRANT trial.
About Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
JIA is a group of disorders characterized by arthritis persisting for at least six weeks
before the age of 16 years.i
Approximately 300,000 children in the U.S. suffer from
some form of JIA.ii

The polyarticular form of JIA causes inflammation in more than four joints and can be
rheumatoid factor-positive or negative, with rheumatoid factor-positive polyarticular
arthritis closely resembling adult RA.iii About 25 percent of children with JIA have the
polyarticular form.vi Polyarticular JIA poses challenges given the number of joints
involved in the condition and the refractory nature of the disease which can increase
the risk of joint damage.vi Weight-bearing joints and the jaw can be affected,
although the disease more commonly affects the small joints of the fingers and
hands.vii

Juvenile PsA is one of the rarest subtypes of JIA with an estimated 2 to 11 percent of
JIA patients affected by the disease.iv,v Juvenile patients experience many of the same
PsA symptoms as adults, including pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the
joints.iii
About SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) infusion
SIMPONI ARIA is the only fully human anti-TNF-alpha therapy administered via a 30-
minute infusion approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely
active RA, active PsA or active AS.
Page 4 of 8
SIMPONI ARIA® is a human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody that targets
both soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-alpha, a

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
SERIOUS INFECTIONS
SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) is a prescription medicine. SIMPONI ARIA® can
lower your ability to fight infections. There are reports of serious infections
caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that have spread throughout the body,
including tuberculosis (TB) and histoplasmosis. Some of these infections
have been fatal. Your doctor will test you for TB before starting SIMPONI
ARIA® and will closely monitor you for signs of TB during treatment. Tell
your doctor if you have been in close contact with people with TB. Tell your
doctor if you have been in a region (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River
Valleys and the Southwest) where certain fungal infections like
histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis are common.
You should not receive SIMPONI ARIA® if you have any kind of infection. Tell your
doctor if you are prone to or have a history of infections or have diabetes, HIV or a
weak immune system. You should also tell your doctor if you are currently being
treated for an infection or if you have or develop any signs of an infection such as:
• fever, sweat, or chills
• muscle aches
• warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
• diarrhea or stomach pain
• cough
• shortness of breath
• blood in phlegm
• weight loss
• burning when you urinate or urinate more than normal
• feel very tired
Page 5 of 8
Your doctor will examine you for TB and perform a test to see if you have TB. If your
doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicine for TB
before you begin treatment with SIMPONI ARIA® and during treatment with SIMPONI
ARIA®. Even if your TB testis negative, your doctor should carefully monitor you for
TB infections while you are taking SIMPONI ARIA®. People who had a negative TB skin
test before receiving SIMPONI ARIA® have developed active TB. Tell your doctor if you
have any of the following symptoms while taking or after taking SIMPONI ARIA®:
• cough that does not go away
• low grade fever
• weight loss
• loss of body fat and muscle (wasting)
CANCER
Unusual cancers have been reported in children and teenage patients taking
Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blocker medicines. For children and adults
receiving TNF blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA®, the chances for getting lymphoma
or other cancers may increase. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare and fatal
lymphoma, has occurred mostly in teenage or young adult males with Crohn’s disease
or ulcerative colitis who were taking a TNF blocker with azathioprine or 6-
mercaptopurine. You should tell your doctor if you have had or develop lymphoma or
other cancers.
Some people treated with SIMPONI ARIA® developed skin cancer. Tell your doctor if
any changes in the appearance of your skin or growths on your skin occur during or
after your treatment with SIMPONI ARIA®. Your doctor should periodically examine
your skin, especially if you have a history of skin cancer.
USE WITH OTHER DRUGS
Tell your doctor about all the medications you take including ORENCIA® (abatacept),
KINERET® (anakinra), ACTEMRA® (tocilizumab), RITUXAN® (rituximab), or another
TNF blocker, or if you are scheduled to or recently received a vaccine. People
receiving SIMPONI ARIA® should not receive live vaccines or treatment with a
weakened bacteria (such as BCG for bladder cancer).
HEPATITIS B INFECTION
Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has been reported in patients who are carriers of this
virus and are receiving TNF-blocker medicines, such as SIMPONI ARIA®. Some of

31841,Chugai Reports Results of P-III SAkuraStar Study of Satralizumab for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder,Positive Results from the Second Phase III SAkuraStar Study for Chugai’s Satralizumab in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) Published in The Lancet Neurology,"The P-III SAkuraStar study involves assessing of satralizumab (120mg, SC) vs PBO in 95 patients aged 20-70yrs. in a ratio (2:1) @0, 2, and 4wks. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4wks. intervals in patients with NMOSD
 The P-III SAkuraStar study results: 55% reduction in risk of relapse in overall population, met its 1EPs of time to first protocol-defined relapse, relapse free patients @ 48, 96 & 144wks. (76.1%, 72.1% & 62.8% vs 61.9%, 51.2% and 34.1)
 Satralizumab is an anti-IL-6 receptor recycling Ab, evaluated in two P-III study in NMO and NMOSD patients and has achieved 1EPs as an add-on therapy to immunosuppressant or as monothx. The US FDA and EMA has accepted the regulatory application of the therapy and the company has filed the regulatory application in Japan in 2019","Satralizumab monotherapy significantly reduced risk of relapse in patients with NMOSD, following a previous positive study where satralizumab was added to baseline immunosuppressant therapy.  The patient population examined in the satralizumab monotherapy study represents a broad, real-world spectrum of adults with NMOSD.

TOKYO, April 24, 2020 — Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced today that the results of the SAkuraStar Study (NCT02073279), a global phase III clinical study of satralizumab (development code: SA237) were published on April, 22 (local time) in The Lancet Neurology. Satralizumab is an anti-IL6 receptor humanized recycling antibody under development for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).

The phase III study examined the efficacy and safety of satralizumab as monotherapy for adults with NMOSD.

Article: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30078-8

“The longer-term efficacy in satralizumab monotherapy study reinforces the important role of IL-6 inhibition in treating NMOSD following the previous combination therapy study,” said Chugai’s President and COO, Dr. Osamu Okuda. “We are collaborating with Roche to obtain global regulatory approval this year so that we can bring satralizumab as a new treatment option to patients as soon as possible.” In the SAkuraStar Study, satralizumab significantly reduced the risk of relapse by 55% (hazard ratio=0.45 [95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.89], p=0.018 [stratified log-rank test]) in the overall population, representative of the broad real-world spectrum of NMOSD patients (including AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative patients), achieving the primary endpoint of time to first protocol-defined relapse in the double-blind period. Importantly, 76.1%, 72.1% and 62.8% of patients on satralizumab were relapse-free at weeks 48, 96 and 144 compared to 61.9%, 51.2% and 34.1 with placebo, respectively. In a prespecified subgroup analysis for time to relapse, hazard ratio of satralizumab to placebo in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients was 0.26 (N=64, 95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.63). The proportion of serious adverse events was similar between the satralizumab and placebo treatment groups. The most common adverse events in the satralizumab group were urinary tract infection and upper respiratory tract infection. 2 / 4 SAkuraStar Study (NCT02073279) Summary: A phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of satralizumab administered to patients with NMOSD Time to first protocol-defined relapse adjudicated by an independent review committee in the doubleblind period Study design:  95 male and female patients aged from 20 to 70 years were randomized.  Patients were randomized to satralizumab or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Satralizumab (120 mg) or placebo was subcutaneously administered at Week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4- week intervals.  The double-blind treatment period ended when the total number of protocol-defined relapse (PDR) had reached 44 or at 1.5 years after the enrollment of the last patient, whichever occurred first. After experiencing a PDR or completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with satralizumab in an open-label extension period.  Patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive or seronegative neuromyelitis optica (NMO)* and those with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD were enrolled. *NMO defined in 2006 About neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) NMOSD is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammatory lesions in the optic nerves and spinal cord, and cause continual and significant decrease in quality of life due to permanent neurologic disorders Patients with NMOSD frequently experience a relapsing disease course with repeated attacks leading to accumulating neurological damage and disability.

Symptoms may include visual impairment, motor disability, and loss of quality of life. In some cases, attacks of NMOSD result in death. Aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG), pathogenic antibodies, are detected in at least two-thirds of NMOSD patients. AQP4-IgG is known to target and damage a specific central nervous cell type called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory demyelinating lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain 1-4 . The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is now emerging as an important factor in NMOSD pathogenesis 5-9 . Diagnostic criteria introduced in 2006 for NMO were characterized by inflammation of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). These were revised in 2007 with the definition of NMOSD, proposed for diseases with either optic neuritis or myelitis. In 2015, the definition of NMOSD further revised to include a broader spectrum of disease. The diagnostic term NMOSD is now widely used 10. About satralizumab Satralizumab, created by Chugai, is an anti-IL-6 receptor recycling antibody. The drug is expected to prevent relapse of NMOSD by inhibiting IL-6 signal transduction which is deeply related to the pathology. In two global phase III clinical studies in NMO and NMOSD patients, the primary endpoint was achieved with satralizumab either as an add-on therapy to baseline immunosuppressant treatment (NCT02028884) 3 / 4 or as monotherapy (NCT02073279). T

These studies represent one of the largest clinical trial programs undertaken for this rare disease. Satralizumab is designated as an orphan drug for the treatment of NMO and NMOSD in Japan, and for the treatment of the same disease group in Europe and the U.S. In addition, it has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2018. The regulatory applications were accepted for review by EMA and FDA in 2019. The regulatory application in Japan was filed in 2019. Sources 1. Jarius S, Ruprecht K, Wildemann B et al.

The P-III study also be amended discontinue lower-dose of Kevzara (200 mg) with all new patients to receive either Kevzara (400 mg) or placebo
 The ongoing portion of P-III study will enroll ~600 patients in the critical group with its anticipated results in June. Additionally, Regeneron is advancing a targeted anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab cocktail and plans to initiate the clinical study in Jun’2020
 The results of P-II study includes exploratory clinical endpoints for the “critical” group, which is the focus of ongoing P-III study. Additionally, the companies are conducting second P-III study assessing Kevzara in ~400 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, currently enrolling in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada, Russia, Israel and Japan with anticipated results in Q3’20","Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended continuing ongoing Phase 3 trial only in the more advanced “critical” group with Kevzara higher-dose versus placebo and discontinuing less advanced “severe” group

Phase 3 trial will be amended to enroll only “critical” patients

Phase 3 trial also be amended to discontinue lower-dose Kevzara (200 mg); all new patients to receive either higher-dose Kevzara (400 mg) or placebo

No new safety findings were observed for Kevzara use in COVID-19 patients

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the preliminary results from the Phase 2 portion of an ongoing Phase 2/3 trial evaluating Kevzara® (sarilumab), an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody, in hospitalized patients with “severe” or “critical” respiratory illness caused by COVID-19. Following a review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) of all available Phase 2 and Phase 3 data, the trial will be immediately amended so that only “critical” patients continue to be enrolled to receive Kevzara 400 mg or placebo.

The randomized Phase 2 portion of the trial compared intravenously-administered Kevzara higher dose (400 mg), Kevzara lower dose (200 mg) and placebo. It assessed 457 hospitalized patients, who were categorized at baseline as having either “severe” illness (28% of patients), “critical” illness (49% of patients) or “multi-system organ dysfunction” (MSOD) (23% of patients). Patients were classified as “severe” if they required oxygen supplementation without mechanical or high-flow oxygenation; or “critical” if they required mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygenation or required treatment in an intensive care unit.

Preliminary analysis of the Phase 2 portion of the trial demonstrated that Kevzara rapidly lowered C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of inflammation, meeting the primary endpoint (see table below). Baseline levels of IL-6 were elevated across all treatment arms, with higher levels observed in “critical” patients compared to “severe” patients. Additionally, no new safety signals were observed with the use of Kevzara in COVID-19 patients.

Analysis of clinical outcomes in the Phase 2 trial was exploratory and pre-specified to focus on the “severe” and “critical” groups. In the preliminary Phase 2 analysis, Kevzara had no notable benefit on clinical outcomes when combining the “severe” and “critical” groups, versus placebo. However, there were negative trends for most outcomes in the “severe” group, while there were positive trends for all outcomes in the “critical” group (see table below). Subsequent to the IDMC review, Regeneron and Sanofi reviewed the discontinued “severe” group data, which revealed that the negative trends in the Phase 2 trial (n=126) were not reproduced in Phase 3 trial (n=276), and that clinical outcomes were balanced across the Kevzara and placebo treatment arms. Outcomes for the “severe” group were better than expected based on prior reports, regardless of treatment assignment: for example, in the Phase 2 portion, approximately 80% were discharged, 10% of patients died and 10% remain hospitalized.

“Even in a pandemic setting, it’s both crucial and possible to obtain controlled data in adequately-sized trials to provide the evidence needed to inform optimal medical care,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Regeneron Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer. “Emerging evidence with Kevzara and other repurposed drugs in the COVID-19 crisis highlight the challenges of making decisions about existing medicines for new viral threats using small, uncontrolled studies. We await results of the ongoing Phase 3 trial to learn more about COVID-19, and better understand whether some patients may benefit from Kevzara treatment. In addition, there is an acute need for tailored approaches that specifically target this virus. To that end, Regeneron is rapidly advancing our targeted anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail and we plan to initiate clinical trials in June.”

The Kevzara trial was designed after a small (n=21), single-arm study in China (Xu et al) among mostly severe, febrile hospitalized COVID-19 patients found elevated IL-6 levels and suggested that inhibiting this pathway with the IL-6 blocker tocilizumab rapidly reduced fever and improved oxygenation in severe patients, allowing for successful hospital discharge. These uncontrolled findings require confirmation in adequately-sized and well-controlled trials. Last month, Regeneron and Sanofi moved rapidly to evaluate Kevzara in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled adaptively-designed U.S. Phase 2/3 trial in collaboration with U.S. groups including the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA, part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and hospitals across the country.

“At Sanofi, we are committed to help combat the global COVID-19 pandemic. As we quickly follow the science to better understand this disease and explore how to best treat patients, these initial results from the randomized clinical trial setting provide physicians much needed insights and information regarding the potential of Kevzara for patients with COVID-19 treatment,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Sanofi’s Global Head of Research and Development. “While our evaluation of the use of Kevzara for COVID-19 treatment remains an investigational approach, Sanofi continues to stay at the forefront of multiple initiatives to fight this disease, including researching other potential treatment options, developing vaccine candidates that can be manufactured at large-scale, and a potential collaboration for an innovative SARS-CoV-2 smartphone-based self-testing solution.”

The Phase 2 numerical results are presented in the table below, including exploratory clinical endpoints for the “critical” group, which is the focus of the ongoing Phase 3 trial.

The ongoing portion of the Phase 3 trial, which is continuing to enroll, currently includes more than 600 patients in the “critical” group. Regeneron and Sanofi remain blinded to the ongoing portion of the Phase 3 trial and expect to report results by June.

In addition, the companies are also conducting a second trial in countries outside of the U.S. The Phase 3 trial of Kevzara in approximately 400 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection is currently enrolling in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada, Russia, Israel and Japan. Initial results from this second trial are expected in the third quarter of 2020. The findings from the U.S. trial will be shared immediately with the IDMC and similar amendments to the trial outside the U.S. will be considered.

The U.S. Kevzara trial has been funded in part with Federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; and BARDA, under OT number: HHSO100201700020C.

The use of Kevzara to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 is investigational and has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Kevzara was jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology that utilizes a genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human antibodies. VelocImmune technology has been used to create multiple antibodies including Dupixent® (dupilumab), Praluent® (alirocumab) and Libtayo® (cemiplimab), which are approved in multiple countries around the world. Regeneron previously used its VelociSuite® technologies to rapidly develop an investigational treatment for Ebola virus infection (currently under review by the FDA) and is now using these same technologies to create novel preventative and therapeutic antibodies for COVID-19.

About Kevzara® (sarilumab) Injection
Kevzara is currently approved in multiple countries to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded to or tolerated previous therapy.

Kevzara binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity, joint destruction and other systemic problems. Kevzara is being investigated for its ability to reduce the overactive inflammatory immune response associated with COVID-19 based on evidence of markedly elevated levels of IL-6 in severely ill patients infected with coronaviruses.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KEVZARA® (sarilumab) INJECTION

KEVZARA can cause serious side effects including:

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: KEVZARA is a medicine that affects your immune system. KEVZARA can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have serious infections while using KEVZARA, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting KEVZARA. Your healthcare provider should monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with KEVZARA.
Before starting KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you:
think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, with or without a fever. Symptoms may include sweats or chills, muscle aches, a cough, shortness of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, if you feel very tired, or if you are being treated for an infection, get a lot of infections or have repeated infections
have diabetes, HIV, or a weakened immune system
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance of getting certain fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis)
have or have had hepatitis
After starting KEVZARA, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection.
CHANGES IN CERTAIN LABORATORY TEST RESULTS: Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before and after starting KEVZARA to check for low neutrophil (white blood cells that help the body fight off bacterial infections) counts, low platelet (blood cells that help with blood clotting and stop bleeding) counts, and an increase in certain liver function tests. Changes in test results are common with KEVZARA and can be severe. You may also have changes in other laboratory tests, such as your blood cholesterol levels. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests 4 to 8 weeks after starting KEVZARA and then every 6 months during treatment to check for an increase in blood cholesterol levels.
TEARS (PERFORATION) OF THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES: Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines. Some people using KEVZARA had tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go away.
CANCER: KEVZARA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS: Serious allergic reactions can happen with KEVZARA. Get medical attention right away if you have any of the following signs: shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling dizzy or faint; swelling of your lips, tongue or face; moderate or severe stomach (abdominal) pain or vomiting; or chest pain.
Do not use KEVZARA if you are allergic to Sarilumab or any of the ingredients of KEVZARA.
Before using KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you
have an infection
have liver problems
have had stomach (abdominal) pain or a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines
recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People who take KEVZARA should not receive live vaccines
plan to have surgery or a medical procedure
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if KEVZARA will harm your unborn baby
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you use KEVZARA. It is not known if KEVZARA passes into your breast milk
take any prescription or nonprescription medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements. It is especially important to tell your healthcare provider if you use any other medicines to treat your RA. Using KEVZARA with these medicines may increase your risk of infection
medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these
The most common side effects include:
injection site redness
upper respiratory tract infection
urinary tract infection
nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose
These are not all the possible side effects of KEVZARA. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. You are encouraged to report side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA at www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

WHAT IS KEVZARA?

Kevzara is an injectable prescription medicine called an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blocker. Kevzara is used to treat adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after at least one other medicine called a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) has been used and did not work well or could not be tolerated.

31862,Capital Health Launches Antibody Testing Initiative for COVID-19,Clinical trial approved to help the NHS treat COVID-19 patients using plasma,"Capital Health has started an IgG Ab research initiative in mid-Apr with 1200+ employee volunteers contributing blood samples for the study and then collaborated with FlowMetric to create a screening program following the industry’s exacting protocols and high ethical standards
 The collaboration has demonstrated how regional medical centers have important roles in the development of new diagnostics and treatments. The focus of the study is to inform the medical community about the existence of immunity to COVID-19 in health care settings and eventually at the large population
 An infected person produces specific IgG Ab that can be detected in blood samples while the presence of specific Ab indicates that a person has produced an immune response to COVID-19","If effective, a national programme will deliver up to 10,000 units of plasma a week to the NHS to help treat coronavirus (COVID-19) patients.

Published 25 April 2020
From:
Department of Health and Social Care
Woman doing research in lab
A clinical trial has been given approval to determine if plasma donated by patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can help those battling the illness
If effective, a scaled-up national programme will deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS
This would provide enough convalescent plasma to treat 5,000 patients each week
Up to 5,000 severely ill patients with COVID-19 could soon be treated each week with plasma from those who have recovered from the illness as part of a new approach to treating the virus.

The national randomised clinical trial will help to determine if plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19, known as ‘convalescent plasma’, is an effective treatment for patients who are severely unwell with the illness. Plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients can be transfused to patients who are struggling to produce their own antibodies against the virus.

In parallel with the trial, the government is scaling up the national programme for collecting plasma so the treatment can be widely rolled out if it is shown to be effective. The collection of plasma would be ramped up over April and May to deliver up to 10,000 units of plasma to the NHS every week, enough to treat 5,000 COVID-19 patients per week.

Matt Hancock, Health and Social Care Secretary, said:

This global pandemic is the biggest public health emergency this generation has faced and we are doing absolutely everything we can to beat it.

The UK has world-leading life sciences and research sectors and I have every hope this treatment will be a major milestone in our fight against this disease.

Hundreds of people are participating in national trials already for potential treatments and the scaling up of convalescent plasma collection means thousands could potentially benefit from it in the future.

Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said:

The UK is leading the world’s largest trials to find a treatment for COVID-19, with over 7,000 people so far involved testing a range of medicines; we hope to add convalescent plasma to this list shortly.

Convalescent plasma has been used as an effective treatment for emerging infections in the past, and this step forward underpins our science-backed approach to fighting this virus.

Dr Gail Miflin, Chief Medical Officer, NHS Blood and Transplant, said:

As well as continuing to collect enough blood throughout this outbreak, we are also heavily involved in the national research response including major trials of this potential treatment.

We are rapidly building our capability to collect plasma so that we can quickly move into supplying hospitals at scale, should the proposed trial demonstrate patient benefit.

Northern Ireland Health Minister, Robin Swann MLA, said:

Two of the greatest strengths of the UK as we face this emergency are our world-leading health research capacity and the selflessness of our citizens.

The Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service and the wider Health and Social Care family are working with their colleagues across the UK to progress and participate in clinical trials on COVID-19.

Minister for Public Health in Scotland, Joe FitzPatrick, said:

The potential for convalescent plasma to aid those suffering from COVID-19 has to be confirmed through clinical trials. I am delighted to see the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Scottish donors will be playing a key part.

The wellbeing of donors, recipients and staff is a priority so there are strict conditions to protect everyone participating in the trial.

It is also important to recognise that this means that not everyone who recovers from Covid-19 will be able to donate.

Welsh Government Health Minister, Vaughan Gething, said:

I’m very pleased to see clinical trials are now underway and to see Wales sharing expertise with the other UK nations on this programme. It has the potential to significantly improve patient recovery and save lives.

Plasma taken from recovered patients contains antibodies that recognise the virus and can reduce its growth. We will be using plasma from patients at least 28 days after recovery as by that time, antibody levels will have increased.

NHS Blood and Transplant will contact people in England who have recovered from confirmed COVID-19 infection and could be a possible plasma donor, and the plasma will be collected at their centres. Blood will be taken from donors from one arm, which is circulated through a machine that separates out the plasma, and returned into the other arm. The process takes about 45 minutes and provides 2 units of plasma per donation, which can also be frozen and stored ahead for any future need.

Convalescent plasma was used as an effective treatment during the SARS outbreak.

If people have a confirmed positive test result and they are willing to donate, they can also provide details to us through NHSBT’s website.

Background information
DHSC is working in collaboration with NHS Blood and Transplant and the other UK blood services, Public Health England and NHS Digital to deliver the programme.
Ongoing national clinical trial as part of REMAP-CAP – with the possibility of another trial later on if the results of the first trial are shown effective will investigate whether transfusions may improve a patient’s speed of recovery and chances of survival.
We will be prioritising donors who are best placed to help so we there may be a short delay in responding to some people.

“This collaboration with Merck provides critical support for the recently launched scientific trial being co-led by ISB and Swedish Medical Center, both part of the Providence St. Joseph Health network. We launched this trial with the urgent need to improve our understanding of COVID-19,” said Dr. Jim Heath, President, ISB. “By applying the full power of our systems biology capabilities, we hope to gain important insights into the molecular basis for the dramatically contrasting outcomes observed for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.”

Through this collaboration, scientists from ISB, health workers from the Swedish Medical Center, and a consortium of research organizations and biomedical companies will analyze blood samples and nasal swabs from Swedish Medical Center patients with SARS-CoV-2 using samples from several time points (initial presentation, acute illness and convalescence). Blood samples will be examined using proteomic, metabolomic, transcriptomics and genetic techniques to evaluate the impact of infection on different organs, and to identify potential biomarkers to predict the risk of severe disease. In addition, samples will be analyzed to create a profile of the immune response, including quantitative changes in immune cells in patients following SARS CoV-2 infection and characterization of neutralizing antibodies in samples from convalescent patients. These insights can be used to inform vaccine design and antibody therapy. Under the agreement, Merck will provide research funding and work with researchers at ISB to characterize targets for potential therapeutic intervention and vaccine development. The study will initially analyze samples from 200 patients with the potential to expand to 300.

“Understanding the molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of the immune response to this virus, is essential to the development of effective interventions,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are eager to advance this work with ISB, and to share our findings with the broader scientific community. Interdicting the COVID-19 pandemic presents a daunting global health challenge, demanding unprecedented collaboration across the international scientific and medical communities to which we are proud to contribute.”

The principal investigators of the study are ISB’s Heath and Dr. Jason D. Goldman, Swedish Medical Center. Initial funding support for the study came from the Wilke Family Foundation, M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, Swedish Foundation, Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and Washington State Andy Hill CARE Fund. Other research collaborators on the study include Stanford University, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Bloodworks Northwest, Isoplexis, Metabolon, Nanostring, Olink, Providence Molecular Genomics Laboratory, Scisco Genetics and 10x Genomics.

31899,Roche and PTC Therapeutics Report Results of Risdiplam in FIREFISH Part 2 Study for Infants with Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy,Roche’s risdiplam shows significant improvement in survival and motor milestones in infants with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA),"The FIREFISH Part 2 study involves assessing risdiplam in 41 infants aged 1-7mos. with Type 1 SMA treated for 24mos., followed by an open-label extension
 The study met its 1EPs with 29% of infants sitting without support for 5sec by 12mos. as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of BSID-III, 43.9% infants were able to hold their head upright, 31.7% were able to roll to the side, 4.9% infants were able to stand with support as measured by HINE-2. In exploratory endpoint, 95% were alive @12mos. maintained the ability to swallow and 89% were able to feed orally
 Risdiplam is an SMN2 splicing modifier, designed to durably increase and sustain SMN protein levels both throughout the CNS and PNS and has received the FDA’s ODD in 2017, EMA’s PRIME designation in 2018 and FDA’s PR in Nov’2019 with its anticipated decision on approval by Aug 24, 2020","FIREFISH Part 2 study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a significant increase in motor milestones in infants aged 1-7 months after 12 months of treatment
Large, pivotal global study confirms clinically meaningful efficacy seen in the dose-finding Part 1 of the trial
Safety was consistent with the safety profile observed to date and no new safety signals were identified

Basel, 28 April 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today presented 1-year data from FIREFISH Part 2, a pivotal global study evaluating risdiplam in infants aged 1 – 7 months old with symptomatic Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The study met its primary endpoint with 29% of infants (12/41; p<0.0001) sitting without support for five seconds by month 12, as assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III). No infants achieve this milestone in the natural history of Type 1 SMA. In addition, 18 (43.9%) infants were able to hold their head upright, 13 (31.7%) were able to roll to the side and 2 (4.9%) infants were able to stand with support, as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination 2 (HINE-2). Safety for risdiplam in the FIREFISH study was consistent with its known safety profile.

“These results confirm the clinically meaningful efficacy of risdiplam in infants with an advanced and difficult-to-treat disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph. D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We thank the SMA community for their partnership and especially the 62 families from around the world who participated in Parts 1 and 2 of the FIREFISH study.”

The data were selected for the 72nd American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting and will be made available online via virtual presentation in the coming weeks (in lieu of an in-person event). Roche leads the clinical development of risdiplam, an investigational, orally administered survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA, as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.

At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment was 15.2 months and the median age was 20.7 months. Ninety-three percent (38/41) of infants were alive and 85.4% (35/41) were event-free. Without treatment, the median age of death or permanent ventilation was 13.5 months in a natural history cohort. Three infants experienced fatal complications of their disease within the first three months of treatment. None of these has been attributed by the investigator as related to risdiplam. Ninety per cent (37/41) had a CHOP-INTEND* score increase of at least 4 points, with 56% (23/41) achieving a score above 40; the median increase was 20 points. Without treatment, infants with Type 1 SMA show a decrease in CHOP-INTEND scores over time.

In an exploratory endpoint, 95% of infants who were alive at 12 months (36/38) maintained the ability to swallow and 89% (34/38) were able to feed orally. In contrast, in a natural history cohort, all infants with Type 1 SMA older than 12 months required feeding support.

“These results are particularly encouraging given the median age at enrolment was 5.3 months, so these infants already had progressed disease,” said Professor Laurent Servais, FIREFISH investigator and Professor of Paediatric Neuromuscular Diseases at the MDUK Oxford Neuromuscular Centre. “Maintaining the ability to swallow is particularly important as it helps infants to feed and suggests risdiplam has a major effect on bulbar function.”

Safety for risdiplam in the FIREFISH study was consistent with its previously reported safety profile and no new safety signals were identified. The most common adverse events (AE) were upper respiratory tract infection (46.3%), pneumonia (39%), pyrexia (39%), constipation (19.5%) nasopharyngitis (12.2%), rhinitis (12.2%) and diarrhoea (9.8%). The most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (31.7%), bronchiolitis (4.9%), respiratory failure (4.9%) and hypotonia (4.9%).

Risdiplam is being studied in a broad clinical trial programme in SMA, with patients ranging from birth to 60 years old, and includes pre-symptomatic patients and those previously treated with other SMA-targeting therapies. The clinical trial programme was designed to represent the broad, real-world spectrum of people living with this disease with the aim of ensuring access for all appropriate patients.

In November 2019, the U.S Food and Drug Administration granted Priority Review for risdiplam with an expected decision on approval by August 24, 2020.

About SMA
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications. It is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately one in 11,000 babies. SMA leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.

SMA is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that results in a deficiency of SMN protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests SMA is a multi-system disorder and the loss of SMN protein may affect many tissues and cells, which can stop the body from functioning.

About risdiplam
Risdiplam is an investigational survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA and is an orally administered liquid. It is designed to durably increase and sustain SMN protein levels both throughout the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues of the body. It is being evaluated for its potential ability to help the SMN2 gene produce more functional SMN protein throughout the body.

Risdiplam was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in 2017. At this time, we have filed in Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan.

Risdiplam is currently being evaluated in four multicentre trials in people with SMA:
● FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants. The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 24 months, followed by an open-label extension. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 is to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds).
● SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – SUNFISH is a two part, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal study in people aged 2-25 years with Types 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 (n=51) determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. Part 2 (n=180) evaluated motor function using total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. MFM-32 is a validated scale used to evaluate fine and gross motor function in people with neurological disorders, including SMA. The study met its primary endpoint.
● JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial in people with SMA aged 6 months–60 years who have been previously treated with SMA-directed therapies. The study has completed recruitment (n=174).
● RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study, investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in babies (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.

Partnership becomes ninth global COVID-19 vaccine development project that CEPI has signed since Jan 23, 2020.
April 27, 2020 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
OSLO, Norway–(BUSINESS WIRE)–CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, today announced a ninth worldwide collaboration to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. CEPI will invest an initial US$3.5 million in a partnering agreement with Clover Biopharmaceuticals AUS Pty Ltd (“Clover Australia”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Inc (China) (“Clover Biopharmaceuticals”), bringing the organisation’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine research & development to US$39.6m.

“We are delighted to partner with Clover Australia on their innovative COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine candidate. They produced their vaccine within a month of the virus sequence becoming available, and they have rapidly advanced toward a first in human trial. ”

Tweet this

This initial CEPI investment will support Clover Australia in its efforts to initiate a phase 1 clinical trial in Australia of its COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine candidate. This innovative vaccine candidate is based on Clover Biopharmaceutical’s proprietary Trimer-Tag© vaccine technology platform, which is a novel way to produce the spike proteins of the COVID-19 virus in a native trimeric form for use in a vaccine. If successful in clinical trials, Clover Biopharmaceuticals has the capacity to rapidly scale up the production of the vaccine using its in-house biomanufacturing capabilities.

Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI said:

“We are delighted to partner with Clover Australia on their innovative COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine candidate. They produced their vaccine within a month of the virus sequence becoming available, and they have rapidly advanced toward a first in human trial.

“This vaccine candidate is an important new addition to the CEPI portfolio. CEPI has invested in a diverse range of innovative vaccine platforms, as well as more established vaccine technologies, to maximise our chances of success as we pursue our ambition of making COVID-19 vaccines available for broad use.”

Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer of Clover Biopharmaceuticals and co-inventor of COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine candidate said:

“At Clover Biopharmaceuticals, we are proud to receive CEPI’s funding and support for Clover Australia, which are critical to enabling the ongoing development and acceleration of our COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine program that utilizes our innovative Trimer-Tag© platform technology. We have been working tirelessly and hope to contribute significantly to global efforts in fighting this pandemic that has affected us all.”

To date, CEPI has provided initial support and funding to Curevac, Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna, Inc., Novavax, Inc., The University of Hong Kong, The University of Oxford, The University of Queensland and a consortium led by Institut Pasteur to develop COVID-19 vaccine candidates1.2,3,4,5

This investment is the result of a recent global call for proposals that CEPI issued in early February,6 which invited funding applications for vaccine technology that could be used to rapidly develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus, and most importantly at scale and with the necessary equitable access provisions.

CEPI recently officially announced that it has opened a Representative Office in Shanghai. Through its Shanghai Representative Office，CEPI will seek cooperation with China in the prevention and control of pandemic diseases, including funding of public health research projects, technical research and development of vaccines, and international scientific, technology and development cooperation and exchanges.

COVID-19 S-Trimer vaccine

Utilizing Clover’s proprietary Trimer-Tag© technology, S-Trimer is a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein subunit vaccine candidate. Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry, making it the primary target antigen for vaccine development. S-Trimer resembles the native trimeric viral spike protein and is produced via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system.

31928,Takeda's Mobocertinib (TAK-788) Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for NSCLC Patients with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations,Takeda Announces U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Mobocertinib (TAK-788) for the Treatment of NSCLC Patients with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations,"The BT designation is based on P-I/II study assessing the safety and efficacy of mobocertinib (160mg, qd) in patients with LA/ m NSCLC, harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, prior treated with systemic CT
 The P-I/II ongoing study results: mPFS (7.3mos.); ORR (43%); safety profile was manageable. The mobocertinib development program began in the NSCLC population and is expected to expand to additional underserved populations in other tumor types
 Mobocertinib is a potent, small-molecule TKI, designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations and has received the US FDA’s ODD in 2019","April 27, 2020
– Designation Represents Positive Progress for a Unique Patient Population in Need of Targeted Therapy Options

Cambridge, MASS. & Osaka, JAPAN, April 27, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for its investigational drug mobocertinib (TAK-788) for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. There are currently no approved therapies designed to treat this specific form of NSCLC. Mobocertinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed to selectively target EGFR and human EGFR 2 (HER2) exon 20 insertion mutations.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on the overall response rate (ORR) and the long-term benefit seen in patients who responded in a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of mobocertinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and have been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy. This signals a potential advancement in addressing the needs of patients for whom no targeted therapies exist and current treatment options provide limited benefit.

“We are pleased that the FDA has recognized the therapeutic potential mobocertinib offers for patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutant NSCLC who are desperately in need of effective treatment options,” said Christopher Arendt, Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “At Takeda, we are committed to developing novel medicines for hard-to-treat diseases. Establishing Breakthrough Therapy Designation for mobocertinib is one step forward in our efforts to help change the current standard of care for this underserved population.”

“Although most EGFR mutations can be targeted by currently available TKIs, people with exon 20 insertion mutations often suffer and feel forgotten since available EGFR inhibitors don’t work well in their cancer,” said Jill Feldman, Lung Cancer Patient, Advocate, and Co-Founder of the EGFR Resisters. “We are excited by the potential this treatment has to extend the lives of people who have had no approved treatment options to target their disease.”

Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. FDA is granted to accelerate the development and regulatory review of investigational drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening ailments. Agents with this designation have shown preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.

Takeda will present for the first time the development of mobocertinib, including the first public disclosure of the structure, during the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Virtual Annual Meeting I in a New Drugs on the Horizon session on Tuesday, April 28, from 11:14-11:34 a.m. ET.

About EGFR Exon 20 Insertion-Mutant NSCLC
NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of the estimated 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed each year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.1,2 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations make up only about 1-2% of patients with NSCLC.3,4 This disease carries a worse prognosis than other EGFR mutations because there are currently no FDA-approved therapies that target exon 20 mutations, and current EGFR TKIs and chemotherapy provide limited benefit for these patients.

About Mobocertinib (TAK-788)
Mobocertinib is a potent, small-molecule TKI specifically designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. In 2019, the U.S. FDA granted mobocertinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of lung cancer with HER2 mutations or EGFR mutations including exon 20 insertion mutations.

Results from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of mobocertinib, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of mobocertinib at 160 mg once daily in previously treated patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions, showed mobocertinib yielded a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.3 months and a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 43% (n=12/28) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutant NSCLC. The safety profile of mobocertinib was manageable (N= 72). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (85%), nausea (43%), rash (36%), vomiting (29%) and decreased appetite (25%). These results were presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.

The mobocertinib development program began in the NSCLC population and is expected to expand to additional underserved populations in other tumor types. Mobocertinib is an investigational drug for which efficacy and safety have not been established.

600 participant Phase 2 study to begin upon IND acceptance and safety data from ongoing NIH-led Phase 1 study

Planning underway for Phase 3 study; study expected to begin in the fall of 2020

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 27, 2020– Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced that it has submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the company’s mRNA vaccine candidate (mRNA-1273) against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to evaluate mRNA-1273 in Phase 2 and late-stage studies if supported by safety data from the Phase 1 study led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Moderna has received initial feedback from the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 2 study, which is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2020. This study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. Each subject will be assigned to receive placebo, a 50 μg or a 250 μg dose at both vaccinations. The company intends to enroll 600 healthy participants across two cohorts of adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300). Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination.

“Submitting this IND is an important next step in the clinical development of our mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and we are moving rapidly to potentially address this global health emergency,” said Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Moderna. “We look forward to launching this Phase 2 study as soon as possible, which will provide important information about the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.”

Subject to data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and discussions with regulators, a Phase 3 study could begin in the fall of 2020. Funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, supported the planning for these studies and also will support the late-stage clinical development programs, as well as the scale-up of mRNA-1273 manufacturing.

“Safe, effective vaccines are critical to ending this pandemic and preventing future outbreaks of SARS-COV-2,” said BARDA Acting Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “The next steps announced today for this particular vaccine highlight the value of collaboration among government agencies including BARDA and NIAID, and the private sector, to move vaccines and other medical countermeasures forward as rapidly as possible.”

About the NIAID-led Phase 1 Study

An open-label Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under its own Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The Phase 1 study, which began on March 16, 2020, completed enrollment of 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years in the original three dose cohorts (25 µg, 100 µg and 250 µg). The study is enrolling an additional six cohorts: three cohorts of older adults (ages 56-70) and three cohorts of elderly adults (ages 71 and above). Data from the original cohort of healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years will be reported once available.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. A summary of the company’s work to date on SARS-CoV-2 can be found here.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,400 participants have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has nine development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)
RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)
Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)
Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for seven prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV and Zika). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

32007,Novartis' Cosentyx (secukinumab) Receives EC's Approval for Axial Spondyloarthritis Spectrum Marking its Fourth Indication in EU,Novartis Cosentyx gains fourth indication in EU with first-in-class approval in axial spondyloarthritis spectrum,"The approval is based on P-III PREVENT study involve assessing Cosentyx (150mg, SC with loading dose and 150mg with no loading dose) vs PBO in 555 adult patients with active nr-axSpA (with onset before 45yrs. of age, spinal pain rated as >=40/100 on a VAS and BASDAI >=4), who had treated with at least two different NSAIDs at the highest dose up to 4wks. prior to study start
 The P-III PREVENT study resulted in meeting its 1EPs i.e. reduction in disease activity (41.5% vs 29.2%), as measured by at least a 40% improvement in ASAS40 @16wks. with improvements continued through 52wks. and demonstrated improvements in 2EPs including pain, disease burden and health-related QoL
 Cosentyx is the first and only fully human biologic targeting IL-17A and is an approved therapy for PsO, PsA and AS. The company is working with the US FDA and PMDA for reviewing Cosentyx to treat adults with nr-axSpA","Cosentyx® is the first fully-human IL-17A inhibitor indicated for patients in Europe with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), which forms part of the axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) disease spectrum
There are approximately 1.7 million patients with nr-axSpA in the top five EU countries and US1
Cosentyx is also approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)2-4
This approval underlines Cosentyx leadership in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology, with plans to expand to 10 indications over the next 10 years 
Basel, April 29, 2020 — Novartis, a leader in rheumatology and immuno-dermatology, today announced the European Commission (EC) has approved Cosentyx® (secukinumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA).

“This approval of Cosentyx for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis means clinicians across Europe now have an effective new treatment option to help patients gain relief from the burden of this painful, debilitating disease and achieve a better quality of life both at home and at work,” said Atul Deodhar, MD, Professor of Medicine and Medical Director of Rheumatology Clinics at Oregon Health & Science University, USA, and an investigator in the PREVENT clinical trial.

The approval is based on data from the Phase III PREVENT study, in which Cosentyx met the primary endpoint. In the study, 41.5% of nr-axSpA patients treated with Cosentyx 150 mg showing a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in disease activity versus placebo (41.5% vs 29.2%: p<0.05), as measured by at least a 40% improvement in ASAS40 at week 165, with improvements continued through week 52. Statistically significant improvements in secondary endpoints were also demonstrated, including pain, disease burden and health-related quality of life5. PREVENT is the largest ever study of a biologic in patients with nr-axSpA5.

“Whether a patient has nr-axSpA or AS, the condition has a significant impact on their everyday life. We therefore welcome the news that Cosentyx has gained approval for the treatment of this form of axial spondyloarthritis because it enables patients to realize relief from their symptoms earlier in the spectrum of disease,” said Eric Hughes, Global Development Unit Head, Immunology, Hepatology & Dermatology at Novartis. “This is a firm demonstration of our commitment to reimagine medicine for patients and a step forward in our plans to expand Cosentyx across ten indications over the next ten years.”

Novartis is working closely with all stakeholders to ensure that eligible European patients can start benefitting from Cosentyx as quickly as possible. Novartis has also submitted Cosentyx for review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the treatment of adults with nr-axSpA.

About axSpA
AxSpA is a spectrum of long-term inflammatory disease characterized by chronic inflammatory back pain6. The axSpA spectrum includes AS, in which joint damage is generally visible on x-ray, and nr-axSpA, in which joint damage is not visible on x-ray6,7. Both parts of the disease spectrum have a comparable symptom burden, including nocturnal waking caused by pain, spinal pain, morning stiffness, fatigue and functional disability8. If left untreated, axSpA impairs activity, leads to lost work time and has a significant impact on quality of life, including family relationships8.

About Cosentyx
Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits IL-17A, a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of PsO, PsA and AS9-12.

Cosentyx is backed by robust clinical evidence, including five-year data across three indications of PsO, PsA and AS, as well as data from real world evidence3-5. These data strengthen the unique position of Cosentyx as a rapid and long-lasting comprehensive treatment across axSpA, PsA and psoriatic disease, with more than 300,000 patients treated worldwide with Cosentyx since launch13.

About PREVENT
PREVENT is an ongoing two-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (with a two-year extension phase) to investigate the efficacy and safety of Cosentyx, in patients with active nr-axSpA. The study enrolled 555 male and female adult patients with active nr-axSpA (with onset before 45 years of age, spinal pain rated as >=40/100 on a visual analog scale (VAS) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) >=4) and who had been taking at least two different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the highest dose up to 4 weeks prior to study start. Patients may have previously taken a TNF inhibitor (not more than one) but had an inadequate response. Of the 555 patients enrolled in the study, 501 (90.3%) were biologic naïve. Patients were allocated to one of three treatment groups: Cosentyx 150 mg subcutaneously with loading dose (induction: 150 mg secukinumab subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, then maintenance with 150 mg secukinumab monthly); Cosentyx 150 mg no loading dose (150 mg secukinumab subcutaneously monthly), or placebo (induction of subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance of once-monthly)14.

The primary endpoints are the proportion of patients achieving an ASAS40 response with Cosentyx 150 mg at Weeks 16 and 52 in TNF-naive patients. Secondary endpoints include among others change in BASDAI over time and change in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with CRP (ASDAS-CRP)14.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

32066,Gilead Reports Results of Remdesivir in P-III SIMPLE Studies for Patients with Severe COVID-19,Gilead Announces Results From Phase 3 Trial of Investigational Antiviral Remdesivir in Patients With Severe COVID-19,"The first SIMPLE study involves assessing of Remdesivir (5/10days dosing regimen, 200mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg each day until day 5 or 10, IV) + SOC in 397 patients in a ratio (1:1) with severe manifestations of COVID-19. An expansion study will enroll ~5600 patients including patients on mechanical ventilation
 The second SIMPLE study involves assessing Remdesivir (5/10days dosing regimen, IV) vs SOC in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19 with expected results from the first 600 patients at the end of May
 The study demonstrated that patients receiving remdesivir (10days) achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5days regimen. Patients achieving clinical recovery @14day (64.5%/53.8%), time to clinical improvement for 50% patients (10days in the 5day treatment group and 11 days in the 10day treatment group)","— Study Demonstrates Similar Efficacy with 5- and 10-Day Dosing Durations of Remdesivir —

FOSTER CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 29, 2020– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from the open-label, Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease. The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 – 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.

“Unlike traditional drug development, we are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving global pandemic. Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 and how to best utilize the drug,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “These study results complement data from the placebo-controlled study of remdesivir conducted by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and help to determine the optimal duration of treatment with remdesivir. The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir. This is particularly important in the setting of a pandemic, to help hospitals and healthcare workers treat more patients in urgent need of care.”

Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.

In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50 percent of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5 percent (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8 percent (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery.

Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7 percent (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64 percent (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61 percent (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.

Impact of Earlier Treatment

In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62 percent of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital, compared with 49 percent of patients who were treated late.

“These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. “While additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, if proven safe and effective.”

Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10 percent of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3 percent (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0 percent (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.

About the SIMPLE Trials

Gilead initiated two randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials for remdesivir, the SIMPLE studies, in countries with high prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

The first SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing regimens of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. The initial phase of the study randomized 397 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir 200 mg on the first day, followed by remdesivir 100 mg each day until day 5 or 10, administered intravenously, in addition to standard of care. An expansion phase of the study was recently added and will enroll an additional 5,600 patients, including patients on mechanical ventilation. The study is being conducted at 180 trial sites around the world, including sites in the United States, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.

32078,AstraZeneca Signs a Worldwide Development and Distribution Agreement with Oxford University for Vaccine Against COVID-19,AstraZeneca and Oxford University announce landmark agreement for COVID-19 vaccine,"The collaboration will bring Oxford’s recombinant adenovirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 to the patients and will enable AstraZeneca to be responsible for the development and WW manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine
 The alliance will combine Oxford’s expertise in vaccinology and AstraZeneca’s global development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities to combat the pandemic
 ChAdOx1 is based on adenoviral vector technology and has entered P-I clinical study last week to evaluate its safety and efficacy in healthy volunteers aged 18-55yrs., across five centers in Southern England with its anticipated results in next month and the expected advancement to late-stage studies by the middle of the year","Collaboration will enable global development, manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine
AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford today announced an agreement for the global development and distribution of the University’s potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2.

The collaboration aims to bring to patients the potential vaccine known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, being developed by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, at the University of Oxford. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca would be responsible for development and worldwide manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “As COVID-19 continues its grip on the world, the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent. This collaboration brings together the University of Oxford’s world-class expertise in vaccinology and AstraZeneca’s global development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation.”

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, said: “The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have a longstanding relationship to advance basic research and we are hugely excited to be working with them on advancing a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 around the world. We are looking forward to working with the University of Oxford and innovative companies such as Vaccitech, as part of our new partnership.”

Alok Sharma, UK Business Secretary, said: “This collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca is a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a coronavirus vaccine. It will also ensure that, should the vaccine being developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute work, it will be available as early as possible, helping to protect thousands of lives from this disease.”

Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, said: “Our partnership with AstraZeneca will be a major force in the struggle against pandemics for many years to come. We believe that together we will be in a strong position to start immunising against coronavirus once we have an effective approved vaccine. Sadly, the risk of new pandemics will always be with us and the new research centre will enhance the world’s preparedness and our speed of reaction the next time we face such a challenge.”

Professor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, said: “Like my colleagues all across Oxford, I am deeply proud of the work of our extraordinarily talented team of academics in the Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group. They represent the best tradition of research, teaching and contributing to the world around us, that has been the driving mission of the University of Oxford for centuries. Like people all across the country, we are wishing them success in developing an effective vaccine. If they are successful, our partnership with AstraZeneca will ensure that the British people and people across the world, especially in low and middle income countries, will be protected from this terrible virus as quickly as possible.”

The potential vaccine entered Phase I clinical trials last week to study safety and efficacy in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, across five trial centres in Southern England. Data from the Phase I trial could be available next month. Advancement to late-stage trials should take place by the middle of this year.

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

Developed at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, and working with the Oxford Vaccine Group, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 uses a viral vector based on a weakened version of the common cold (adenovirus) containing the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, which primes the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.

The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to generate a strong immune response from a single dose and it is not replicating, so cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as a temperature, flu-like symptoms, headache or sore arm.

32103,GSK's Zejula (niraparib) Receives the US FDA's Approval as 1L Monotherapy Maintenance Treatment for Women with Advanced Ovarian Cancer Regardless of Biomarker Status,FDA approves Zejula (niraparib) as the only once-daily PARP inhibitor in first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment for women with platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer regardless of biomarker status,"The approval is based on P-III PRIMA study assessing Zejula (300/200mg, qd) vs PBO in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer following complete or partial response to platinum-based CT regardless of biomarker status
 The P-III PRIMA study resulted in a 57% improvement in PFS in HRd population and a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression in the overall population. The new individualized starting dose is based on the patient’s weight and/or platelet count; lower rates of hematological AEs were observed with the individualized dosing group
 Zejula (qd) is a PARP inhibitor, currently being evaluated in multiple pivotal studies and is an approved therapy in the US as monothx. for women with advanced OC beyond those with BRCAm disease in the 1L and recurrent maintenance treatment settings, as well as late-line primary treatment settings","a and investors only
Issued: London, UK

Zejula is the only oral monotherapy available as first-line maintenance treatment for women regardless of BRCA mutational status, addressing a high unmet need in ovarian cancer
New individualised starting dose based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count approved for first-line maintenance treatment; lower rates of haematological adverse events were observed with the individualised dosing group
The supplemental New Drug Application was approved under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Zejula (niraparib), an oral, once-daily poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, as a monotherapy maintenance treatment for women with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, regardless of biomarker status. Until now, only 20% of women with ovarian cancer, those with a BRCA mutation (BRCAm), were eligible to be treated with a PARP inhibitor as monotherapy in the first-line maintenance setting.[i]

Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Women with advanced ovarian cancer have a five-year survival rate of less than 50%. This expanded indication means that many more women with this devastating disease can receive earlier treatment with Zejula, which can extend the time it takes for their cancer to progress.”

Zejula is the only once-daily PARP inhibitor approved in the US as monotherapy for women with advanced ovarian cancer beyond those with BRCAm disease in the first-line and recurrent maintenance treatment settings, as well as late-line primary treatment settings.

This new indication is supported by data from the phase III PRIMA study (ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012), which enrolled patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer following a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status. The PRIMA study enrolled women who had higher risk of disease progression, a population with high unmet needs and limited treatment options.

Dr. Bradley Monk, PRIMA investigator, US Oncology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix Creighton University School of Medicine at St. Joseph’s Hospital Phoenix, said: “PRIMA was designed for patients with ovarian cancer who have a high unmet need. The positive data observed regardless of biomarker status in this study is extremely encouraging and suggests benefit beyond the BRCAm population. This approval is an important step forward in the treatment of ovarian cancer. In my opinion, maintenance treatment with niraparib should be considered an option for appropriate patients who responded to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy versus active surveillance.”

The primary endpoint in the PRIMA study was progression-free survival (PFS) analysed sequentially, first in the homologous recombination deficient (HRd) population, then in the overall population. The PRIMA study significantly improved PFS for patients treated with Zejula, regardless of biomarker status. In the HRd population, Zejula resulted in a 57% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs. placebo (HR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.59; p<0.0001), and a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs. placebo in the overall population (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; p<0.0001).

Zejula’s safety profile, as demonstrated by the PRIMA results, was consistent with clinical trial experience. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events with Zejula included thrombocytopenia (39%), anaemia (31%) and neutropenia (21%).

At initiation of the PRIMA study, patients received a fixed starting dose of 300 mg of Zejula once-daily. The study was later amended to incorporate an individualised starting dose of either 200 mg or 300 mg of Zejula once-daily based on the patient’s baseline weight and/or platelet count. Lower rates of grade 3 and 4 haematologic treatment-emergent adverse events were observed with an individualised starting dose, compared to the overall population, including thrombocytopenia (21% compared to 39%), anaemia (23% compared to 31%) and neutropenia (15% compared to 21%).

The Zejula US prescribing information has been updated to include the individualised starting dose of 200 mg or 300 mg once-daily based on patients’ baseline weight and/or platelet count for the first-line maintenance treatment indication. The starting dose for recurrent ovarian cancer and late-line treatment settings is 300 mg once-daily.

“It’s so important for patients with ovarian cancer to have treatment options, and this approval is positive news for our community,” said Audra Moran, President and CEO, Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance. “PARP inhibitors represent a major advancement in the fight against ovarian cancer, and having a new first-line maintenance option for platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer patients — regardless of BRCA mutation status — is especially exciting. We are determined to keep funding research and partnering with scientists who are on the frontline of finding new treatments like this one to help those impacted by this disease.”

PRIMA study results were previously presented at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Zejula is not approved for use in first-line maintenance treatment outside the US.

About Ovarian Cancer
In the US, ovarian cancer impacts nearly 222,000 women annually,[ii] and it is the fifth most frequent cause of cancer death among women.[iii] Despite high response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy in the front-line setting, approximately 85% of patients will experience disease recurrence.[iv] Once the disease recurs, it is rarely curable, with decreasing time intervals to each subsequent recurrence.

About Zejula (niraparib)
Niraparib is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in multiple pivotal trials. GSK is building a robust niraparib clinical development programme by assessing activity across multiple tumour types and by evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other therapeutics. The ongoing development programme for niraparib includes several combination studies, including a phase III study as a first-line triplet maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer (FIRST).

GSK in Oncology
GSK is focused on maximising patient survival through transformational medicines. GSK’s pipeline is focused on immuno-oncology, cell therapy, cancer epigenetics and synthetic lethality. Our goal is to achieve a sustainable flow of new treatments based on a diversified portfolio of investigational medicines utilising modalities such as small molecules, antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and cell therapy, either alone or in combination.

Indications and Important Safety Information for ZEJULA
Indications

ZEJULA is indicated:

for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
for the treatment of adult patients with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with three or more prior chemotherapy regimens and whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status defined by either:
a deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation, or
genomic instability and who have progressed more than six months after response to the last platinum-based chemotherapy.
Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for ZEJULA.

Important Safety Information

Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML), including some fatal cases, was reported in 15 patients (0.8%) out of 1785 patients treated with ZEJULA monotherapy in clinical trials. The duration of therapy in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML varied from 0.5 months to 4.9 years. These patients had received prior chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents including radiotherapy. Discontinue ZEJULA if MDS/AML is confirmed.

Hematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia) have been reported in patients receiving ZEJULA. The overall incidence of Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 31%, and 21% of patients receiving ZEJULA in PRIMA; 29%, 25%, and 20% of patients receiving ZEJULA in NOVA; and 28%, 27%, and 13% of patients receiving ZEJULA in QUADRA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred, respectively, in 4%, 2%, and 2% of patients in PRIMA; 3%, 1%, and 2% of patients in NOVA; and 4%, 2%, and 1% of patients in QUADRA. In patients who were administered a starting dose of ZEJULA based on baseline weight or platelet count in PRIMA, Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia were reported, respectively, in 22%, 23%, and 15% of patients receiving ZEJULA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred, respectively, in 3%, 3%, and 2% of patients. Do not start ZEJULA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by prior chemotherapy (≤ Grade 1). Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first month, monthly for the next 11 months, and periodically thereafter. If hematological toxicities do not resolve within 28 days following interruption, discontinue ZEJULA, and refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations.

Hypertension and hypertensive crisis have been reported in patients receiving ZEJULA. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 6% of patients receiving ZEJULA vs 1% of patients receiving placebo in PRIMA, with no reported discontinuations. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 9% of patients receiving ZEJULA vs 2% of patients receiving placebo in NOVA, with discontinuation occurring in <1% of patients. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 5% of ZEJULA-treated patients in QUADRA, with discontinuation occurring in <0.2% of patients. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate at least weekly for the first two months, then monthly for the first year, and periodically thereafter during treatment. Closely monitor patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Manage hypertension with antihypertensive medications and adjustment of the ZEJULA dose, if necessary.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity and Lactation: Based on its mechanism of action, ZEJULA can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after receiving their final dose of ZEJULA. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ZEJULA in breastfed infants, advise lactating women to not breastfeed during treatment with ZEJULA and for 1 month after receiving the final dose.

Bemcentinib selected as first candidate to be tested through new ACCORD study
The Phase II clinical trial initiative to rapidly investigate bemcentinib’s efficacy and safety in hospitalised COVID-19 patients 
Study to be funded by the UK Department of Health and Social Care and UK Research and Innovation
Study to be managed by CRO, IQVIA
BerGenBio will be hosting a webcast at 10.00 CEST tomorrow (see details below)
Bergen, Norway, 28 April 2020 – BerGenBio ASA (OSE:BGBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, selective AXL kinase inhibitors for unmet medical need, announces that bemcentinib has been selected as the first potential treatment to be fast-tracked in a new UK national multi-centre randomised Phase II clinical trial initiative that aims to save lives and get an early indication of bemcentinib’s effectiveness in treating the most vulnerable patients with COVID-19.

The ACcelerating COVID-19 Research & Development platform (ACCORD) study is being funded by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). ACCORD brings together a single, UK-wide clinical trial platform provided by the clinical research company IQVIA and the UK’s leading research expertise through the National Institute for Health Research, to rapidly test potential drugs through early stage clinical trials and feed them into the UK’s large-scale COVID-19 studies such as the RECOVERY trial, currently the world’s largest randomised controlled clinical trial for COVID-19 treatment.

ACCORD COVID-19 trial

The ACCORD study is a multicentre, seamless, Phase II adaptive randomisation platform trial to assess the efficacy and safety of multiple candidate agents, the first of which is bemcentinib, for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalised UK NHS patients.

The study, with drug material and trial resources provided by BerGenBio, will rapidly commence testing in 120 subjects (60 hospitalised COVID-19 patients and 60 control group patients receiving standard of care treatment) across 6 UK NHS hospital trusts, with the first patients due to be treated imminently. BerGenBio anticipates that top line data will readout within a few months. Data will be open source and freely available to enable global knowledge sharing and collaboration. If positive results are seen, bemcentinib will advance rapidly into the large-scale Phase III trials currently in progress across the UK.

Bemcentinib’s applicability to treat COVID-19

COVID-19 is the clinical disease manifested as a result of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Preclinical data suggest that bemcentinib is potentially useful for the treatment of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are currently no approved medical treatments for, or vaccines against, COVID-19.

Bemcentinib is a once-a-day, oral, highly selective and potent inhibitor of AXL kinase being developed by BerGenBio. Bemcentinib has previously demonstrated a key role in cancer treatment: preventing immune evasion, drug resistance and metastasis in a variety of cancer trials. The drug has to date been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in hundreds of patients and in many cases taken daily for several years.

Bemcentinib has previously been reported to exhibit potent anti-viral activity in preclinical models against several enveloped viruses, including Ebola and Zika virus. Recent data have expanded this to SARS-CoV-2.1, 2

Bemcentinib selectively inhibits AXL kinase activity, blocking viral entry and enhancing the anti-viral type I interferon response, a key cellular defence mechanism against viral infection.

Richard Godfrey, Chief Executive Officer of BerGenBio, commented: “We are delighted to be part of this initiative which is a ground-breaking partnership between government, academia and industry. We are hopeful that bemcentinib can play a significant role in the global effort to find suitable treatment options for COVID-19 patients, which has had such serious implications for so many people and thereby ease pressures on hospital intensive care units, and ultimately treat thousands of patients. We are poised to commence dosing in the coming days and will provide results as soon as is practically possible.”

Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, said:“Currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat Covid-19. But our Therapeutics Taskforce has identified a number of promising candidates. Currently, six different treatments have been entered into national clinical trials and the first is ready to enter the next stage: a new early phase clinical trial platform that we are launching today. This is a national effort made possible by government, academia and industry working together.”

Professor Tom Wilkinson, ACCORD clinical academic lead based at the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, said: “There has been a tremendous effort to pull this initiative together so rapidly. ACCORD is a national effort and will be key to developing effective new treatments which are needed so desperately. The ACCORD platform will be able to rapidly test potential new treatments, advancing the most promising through Phase 2 clinical trials into the NHS. This unique national platform for developing new COVID-19 drug candidates will access the world-class expertise and resources of the NIHR Respiratory Translational Research Collaboration and allied centres nationwide.”

ACCORD is part of a co-ordinated therapeutic development pathway that the Government has put in place, overseen by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and delivered by UKRI, as part of the overall Therapeutics Taskforce.

32135,Rockwell's Triferic AVNU Receives the US FDA's Approval to Replace Iron and Maintain Hemoglobin Hemodialysis Patients,"Rockwell Medical, Inc. Receives FDA Approval for Triferic® AVNU (Ferric Pyrophosphate Citrate), Intravenous Formulation of Triferic for Replacement of Iron and Maintenance of Hemoglobin in Hemodialysis Patients","The approval is based on the study assessing Triferic in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and has resulted in steady and consistent bioavailable iron to replace the iron that is lost at every dialysis treatment and hemoglobin is maintained
 The company will launch Evaluation Programs for evaluating Triferic and with expected launch in Q3’20
 Triferic AVNU (ferric pyrophosphate citrate) is a IV formulation of Triferic and a novel treatment for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients","WIXOM, Mich., Rockwell Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RMTI) (“Rockwell Medical” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming anemia management and improving outcomes for patients around the world, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has approved its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for its intravenous formulation of Triferic, Triferic AVNU. With this approval, Triferic AVNU joins Triferic Dialysate as the only FDA-approved products indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.

Triferic is a novel, physiologic iron maintenance therapy that provides bioavailable iron to replace iron lost during every dialysis treatment and maintain hemoglobin. While Triferic Dialysate is designed to be administered via liquid bicarbonate, Triferic AVNU is designed for direct intravenous infusion, which provides hemodialysis patients with greater access to the Triferic platform and expands administration options for clinicians. Triferic AVNU can be administered regardless of a dialysis center’s mode of bicarbonate delivery. Many dialysis centers in international markets and an increasing number of dialysis centers in the U.S. have converted to the use of dry bicarbonate cartridges or bags and on-line dialysate generation, which is not compatible with Triferic Dialysate.

“The approval of Triferic AVNU is a major milestone as we further progress toward our goal of transforming anemia management across the globe. With Triferic AVNU, more adult hemodialysis patients in the U.S will have access to the benefits of this unique therapeutic, regardless of the way their clinic generates bicarbonate. Clinicians will now have the added flexibility to administer Triferic intravenously to a broader group of patients who can benefit from physiologic iron maintenance therapy to manage their anemia,” stated Stuart Paul, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Medical.

“Clinical trials have demonstrated that patients treated with Triferic receive steady and consistent bioavailable iron to replace the iron that is lost at every dialysis treatment and hemoglobin is maintained. Now, even in clinics where delivering Triferic through the dialysate is not operationally possible, Triferic AVNU is an option. This may be especially important for patients who are difficult to manage, or for other special patient populations,” added Dr. Steven Fishbane, Chief of Nephrology of Northwell Health and Professor of Medicine at the Zucker School of Medicine.

Over the next several months, the Company plans to initiate a commercial strategy that leverages the experience gained from the 2019 launch of Triferic Dialysate and lays the groundwork for the commercial introduction of Triferic AVNU. The Company expects to launch Evaluation Programs during the third quarter of 2020 to allow clinics to gain direct experience with Triferic AVNU, and the Company expects Triferic AVNU to be available commercially following the completion of the initial Evaluation Programs.

About Rockwell Medical

Rockwell Medical is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming anemia management in a wide variety of therapeutic areas and across the globe, improving the lives of very sick patients. The Company’s initial focus is the treatment of anemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Rockwell Medical’s exclusive renal drug therapy, Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate), is the only FDA-approved therapeutic indicated for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients. Rockwell Medical is also an established manufacturer, supplier and leader in delivering high-quality hemodialysis concentrates/dialysates to dialysis providers and distributors in the U.S. and abroad.

About Triferic

Triferic is the only FDA-approved therapy in the U.S. indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients during each dialysis treatment. Triferic has a unique and differentiated mechanism of action which has the potential to benefit patients and health care economics. Triferic represents a potential innovative medical advancement in hemodialysis patient iron management– with the potential to become the future standard of care. The Company has two FDA-approved formulations of Triferic (1) Triferic Dialysate and (2) Triferic AVNU.

Triferic delivers between 5-7 mg iron with every hemodialysis treatment to the bone marrow and maintains hemoglobin without increasing iron stores (ferritin). Triferic donates iron immediately and completely to transferrin (carrier of iron in the body) upon entry into the blood and is then transported directly to the bone marrow to be incorporated into hemoglobin, with no increase in ferritin (stored iron and inflammation) and no reports of anaphylaxis in over 1,000,000 patient administrations, addressing a significant medical need in overcoming Functional Iron Deficiency (FID) in ESRD patients.

Important Safety Information

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in patients receiving parenteral iron products. Patients may present with shock, clinically significant hypotension, loss of consciousness, and/or collapse. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after hemodialysis until clinically stable. Personnel and therapies should be immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in 1 (0.3%) of 292 patients receiving Triferic in two randomized clinical trials.

Iron status should be determined on pre-dialysis blood samples. Post dialysis serum iron parameters may overestimate serum iron and transferrin saturation.

The most common adverse reactions (≥3% and at least 1% greater than placebo) in controlled clinical studies include: procedural hypotension (21.6%), muscle spasms (9.6%), headache (9.2%), pain in extremity (6.8%), peripheral edema (6.8%), dyspnea (5.8%), back pain (4.5%), pyrexia (4.5%), urinary tract infection (4.5%), asthenia (4.1%), fatigue (3.8%), arteriovenous (AV) fistula thrombosis (3.4%), and AV fistula site hemorrhage (3.4%).

 VLA15 is a multivalent protein subunit vaccine targeting OspA of Borrelia and covers six serotypes that are prevalent in North America and EU","April 30, 2020
Phase 2 vaccine candidate, VLA15, is being evaluated for adult and pediatric indications in North America and Europe.

Saint Herblain (France) and New York, NY, April 30, 2020 – Valneva SE (“Valneva”), a specialty vaccine company, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced a collaboration to develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15, which is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies.

VLA15 is the only active Lyme disease vaccine program in clinical development today, and covers six serotypes that are prevalent in North America and Europe. The investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine, VLA15, targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia, an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. VLA15 has demonstrated strong immunogenicity and safety data in pre-clinical and Phase 1 studies. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20171. Valneva has completed patient enrolment and follow-up for two Phase 2 studies of its Lyme disease vaccine candidate, in more than 800 people. Valneva expects to report the first Phase 2 results in mid-2020.

Valneva and Pfizer will work closely together throughout the development of VLA15. Valneva is eligible to receive a total of $308 million cash payments consisting of a $130 million upfront payment, $35 million in development milestones and $143 million in early commercialization milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva will fund 30% of all development costs through completion of the development program, and in return Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties starting at 19%. Pfizer will lead late-stage development and have sole control over commercialization.

Thomas Lingelbach, Chief Executive Officer, Valneva, commented “This collaboration is extremely exciting as it provides the opportunity for the rapid development and launch of a vaccine that has the potential to address a major unmet medical need. It validates Valneva’s strong vaccine R&D capabilities. We believe that

Pfizer is the best partner for our Lyme disease vaccine given their outstanding development and commercial capabilities. Our team is thrilled about the prospect of working with such a successful partner.”

“Lyme disease is the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in the United States and is growing in its prevalence and geographic reach. We look forward to working closely with Valneva to continue advancing the VLA15 program and potentially bring a new solution to patients for this significant unmet need,” said Nanette Cocero, Global President, Pfizer Vaccines. “As both a research company, and a manufacturer of pediatric and adult vaccines including a vaccine for tick-borne encephalitis in Europe, we believe that Pfizer’s vaccine heritage, scientific expertise, and global commercial capabilities will help allow the VLA15 program to reach its maximum potential in helping protect children and adults from Lyme disease.”

This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and clearances under antitrust law, including the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

Lazard served as exclusive financial advisor to Valneva and Dechert LLP served as Valneva’s legal counsel for the collaboration.

About Lyme Disease

Lyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks2. It is considered the most common vector borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 300,000 Americans3 are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year with at least a further 200,000 cases in Europe4. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue, fever, headache, mild stiff neck, arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated, the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis), the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the disease footprint widens5.

Under the terms of the agreement, the companies plan to establish manufacturing suites at Lonza’s facilities in the United States and Switzerland for the manufacture of mRNA-1273 at both sites. Technology transfer is expected to begin in June 2020, and the companies intend to manufacture the first batches of mRNA-1273 at Lonza U.S. in July 2020. Over time, the parties intend to establish additional production suites across Lonza’s worldwide facilities, ultimately allowing for the manufacture of material equivalent to up to 1 billion doses of mRNA-1273 per year for use worldwide assuming the currently expected dose of 50 µg. The manufacturing facilities at Lonza complement Moderna’s ongoing U.S. manufacturing efforts, which continue to ramp up to prepare for the further clinical development and commercialization of mRNA-1273.

A portion of the funding for the establishment of manufacturing operations at Lonza U.S. is covered by Moderna’s contract with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which was announced April 16, 2020. BARDA will support late-stage clinical development programs of mRNA-1273. Lonza’s experience in scaling manufacturing of innovative medicines, including support for more than 50 commercial approvals across regulatory jurisdictions, will support Moderna for global supply.

“We are very pleased to partner with Lonza, which shares our commitment to rapidly addressing this pandemic which has created a global health crisis,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “This long-term strategic collaboration agreement will enable Moderna to accelerate, by 10-times, our manufacturing capacity for mRNA-1273 and additional products in Moderna’s large clinical portfolio. Lonza’s global presence and expertise are critical as we scale at unprecedented speed. Our common goal is to potentially enable manufacturing of up to 1 billion doses of mRNA-1273.”

“Moderna’s technology represents a significant opportunity to change the way we protect people against disease,” said Albert M. Baehny, Lonza’s Chairman and CEO ad interim. “The current pandemic illustrates the need to combine the best science with resilient supply chains that can scale. We are fully committed to leveraging our global network and experience in manufacturing technologies to support Moderna’s manufacture of mRNA-1273 as well as collaborating on future Moderna products.”

On April 27, 2020, Moderna announced that it submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Phase 2 and late stage studies of mRNA-1273 if supported by safety data from the Phase 1 study. Moderna has received initial feedback from the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 2 study, which is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2020. This study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. Each subject will be assigned to receive placebo, a 50 μg or a 250 μg dose at both vaccinations. The company intends to enroll 600 healthy participants across two cohorts of adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300). Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. A summary of the company’s work to date on SARS-CoV-2 can be found here.

About the NIAID-led Phase 1 Study

An open-label Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 is being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under its own Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the U.S. The Phase 1 study, which began on March 16, 2020, completed enrollment of 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years in the original three dose cohorts (25 µg, 100 µg and 250 µg). The study is enrollingan additional six cohorts: three cohorts of older adults (ages 56-70) and three cohorts of elderly adults (ages 71 and above). Data from the original cohort of healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years will be reported once available.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,400 participants have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has nine development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)
RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)
Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)
Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for seven prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV and Zika). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

32228,"Novartis' Enerzair Breezhaler (QVM149, IND/GLY/MF) Receives CHMP's Recommendation for Approval as a Treatment for Uncontrolled Asthma","Novartis receives CHMP positive opinion for Enerzair Breezhaler (QVM149), a potential first-in-class inhaled LABA/LAMA/ICS combination for uncontrolled asthma","The CHMP’s recommendation is based on P-III IRIDIUM study assessing IND/GLY/MF (150/50/160 μg & 150/50/80 μg) vs IND/MF doses (150/320 μg & 150/160 μg) in 3,092 patients in a ratio (1:1:1) with uncontrolled asthma, as determined by pulmonary function testing and effects on asthma control
 The P-III IRIDIUM study resulted in improvements in lung function and ACQ-7 score. Both the treatment showed improvement in symptoms @26wks. but 2EPs was not met. In the secondary analyses, therapy showed a reduction in mod.-to-sev. and sev. asthma exacerbation rate with high-dose IND/GLY/MF vs high-dose Sal/Flu
 Novartis is working with multiple regulatory authorities, including Switzerland, Japan and Canada to bring IND/GLY/MF and IND/MF to patients. QVM149 will be administered via the dose confirming Breezhaler device, if approved, it will be the first asthma treatment that can be prescribed together with a digital companion with app and a sensor in the EU","CHMP positive opinion advances efforts to provide first-in-class LABA/LAMA/ICS combination for patients whose asthma is uncontrolled with LABA/ICS standard-of-care treatment in the EU. 
Digital companion with app and sensor that provide inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data to better support therapeutic decisions also covered by positive opinion for Enerzair® Breezhaler® (QVM149; IND/GLY/MF).
Decision supported by robust efficacy and safety data from over 3,000 patients with asthma in Phase III IRIDIUM study, in which once-daily IND/GLY/MF demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function compared with once-daily IND/MF (QMF149).1
In secondary analyses of the Phase III IRIDIUM study, statistically significant improvements in lung function and reductions in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates were observed with high-dose IND/GLY/MF compared to high-dose Sal/Flu.1
Basel, May 1, 2020 — Novartis today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Enerzair®Breezhaler® (QVM149; indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate [IND/GLY/MF]) as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long‑acting beta2‑agonist (LABA) and a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. If approved, this will be the first once-daily LABA/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/ICS fixed-dose combination for these patients. The European Commission (EC) reviews the CHMP recommendation and usually delivers its final decision in approximately two months.

“This is an important development for patients with uncontrolled asthma because IND/GLY/MF has been shown to improve lung function and symptoms versus a LABA/ICS standard-of-care,” said Professor Huib Kerstjens, Head, Department of Pulmonology at the University Medical Center Groningen. “In secondary analyses of the Phase III IRIDIUM study statistically significant reductions in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates were observed with high-dose IND/GLY/MF compared to high-dose salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate.”

IND/GLY/MF will be administered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device, which enables once-daily inhalation using a single inhaler. If approved, IND/GLY/MF will be the first asthma treatment in the EU that can be prescribed together with a digital companion; a Propeller Health sensor and app custom-built for the Breezhaler® device. This companion will provide patients with inhalation confirmation, medication reminders and access to objective data that can be shared with their physician in order to help them make better therapeutic decisions.

“Today’s news is a key milestone in our journey to reimagine asthma care by bringing innovative medicines and a digital companion to patients with uncontrolled asthma,” said Linda Armstrong, MD, Respiratory Development Unit Head, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Once-daily IND/GLY/MF has the potential to improve asthma control for patients whose lives are still impacted by their disease, despite existing inhaled therapies. Additionally, we are pleased to bring an innovative sensor and app companion supplied with IND/GLY/MF to patients to help support enhanced adherence.”

The CHMP recommendation is based on robust efficacy and safety data from over 3,000 patients with asthma from the Phase III IRIDIUM study, in which IND/GLY/MF demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function compared with indacaterol acetate/mometasone furoate (IND/MF).1

In the IRIDIUM study, the key secondary endpoint was improvement in Asthma Control Questionnaire score (ACQ-7) for IND/GLY/MF versus IND/MF. Both treatments delivered clinically meaningful improvements in this measure of symptoms from baseline at Week 26, but the key secondary endpoint was not met. Among other secondary analyses, IRIDIUM explored asthma exacerbation rates, where statistically significant reductions were observed in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates with IND/GLY/MF compared with an established LABA/ICS standard-of-care (twice-daily salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate). Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of the monocomponents.1

Last month the CHMP also recommended the approval of Atectura®Breezhaler® (IND/MF) as a maintenance treatment of asthma for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting beta-agonists.2 Novartis is committed to bringing IND/GLY/MF and IND/MF to patients, with additional regulatory filings currently underway in multiple countries, including Switzerland, Japan and Canada.

In keeping with the Novartis commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our asthma combinations, IND/GLY/MF and IND/MF will both be available in the Breezhaler® device which is hydrofluoroalkane/chlorofluorocarbon (HFA/CFC)-free.

About Uncontrolled Asthma 
Asthma affects an estimated 358 million people worldwide and can cause a significant personal, health and financial burden when not adequately controlled.3,4 Despite current therapy, over 40% of patients with asthma at Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 3, and over 45% at GINA Steps 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled.5,6 Patients with uncontrolled asthma may downplay or underestimate the severity of their disease and are at a higher risk of exacerbation, hospitalization or death.7,8,9 Barriers, such as treatment mismatch, safety issues with an oral corticosteroid and ineligibility for biologics, have created an unmet medical need in asthma.10,11

About Enerzair® Breezhaler®
Enerzair® Breezhaler® (QVM149; IND/GLY/MF) is intended as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long‑acting beta2‑agonist and a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. This formulation combines the bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA) and the antimuscarinic effects of glycopyrronium bromide (a LAMA) with mometasone furoate (high-dose ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device. Glycopyrronium bromide certain use and formulation intellectual property were exclusively licensed to Novartis in April 2005 by Sosei Heptares and Vectura. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in IND/GLY/MF (worldwide excluding the U.S.).

The sensor for the Breezhaler® device was developed by Propeller Health and is a CE marked Medical Device, designed and licensed to Novartis exclusively for use with the Breezhaler® inhaler worldwide. The sensor includes a microchip, a microphone, Bluetooth capabilities, an antenna and a battery. The sensor does not alter the drug delivery characteristics of the Breezhaler®inhaler itself but produces a recording of each administered dose. Based on the patient’s recorded medication usage, personalized content is presented within the app to help the patient better self-manage their asthma.

About Atectura® Breezhaler® 
Atectura® Breezhaler® (QMF149; IND/MF) is the combination of indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate intended as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older not adequately controlled with ICS and inhaled short-acting beta-agonists. IND/MF combines the bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA) with the anti-inflammatory mometasone furoate (an ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in IND/MF.

About the PLATINUM Clinical Development Program
The PLATINUM program, containing over 7,500 patients worldwide, is the Novartis Phase III clinical development program supporting the development of IND/GLY/MF and IND/MF. It includes four studies: the QUARTZ study, which compared a low-dose of IND/MF with MF alone; the PALLADIUM study, which compared IND/MF with MF and salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu); the IRIDIUM study, which compared IND/GLY/MF with IND/MF and Sal/Flu; and the ARGON study, which compared IND/GLY/MF with a combination of Sal/Flu and tiotropium.

IRIDIUM was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY/MF with IND/MF in patients with asthma.

The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of IND/GLY/MF (High: 150/50/160 μg and Medium:150/50/80 μg), versus two respective IND/MF doses (High: 150/320 μg and Medium: 150/160 μg) in patients with uncontrolled asthma, as determined by pulmonary function testing and effects on asthma control.

All patients were required to be symptomatic at screening despite being on treatment with medium or high stable doses of LABA/ICS. Approximately 3,092 male and female adult patients with asthma were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 (approximately 618 patients in each of the treatment groups) to receive either:

IND/GLY/MF 150/50/80 μg (once-daily)
IND/GLY/MF 150/50/160 μg (once-daily)
IND/MF 150/160 μg (once-daily)
IND/MF 150/320 μg (once-daily)
Sal/Flu 50/500 μg (twice-daily, via Accuhaler®)
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate superiority of both high-dose IND/GLY/MF versus high-dose IND/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF versus medium-dose IND/MF, all delivered once-daily, in improving trough FEV1 (volume of air that can be forced out in the first second of expiration approximately 24 hours post-administration of study drug) after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.

The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of both doses of IND/GLY/MF versus respective doses of IND/MF, in improving Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score after 26 weeks of treatment in patients with asthma.

Other secondary analyses also included reduction of exacerbation rate, comparing high-dose IND/GLY/MF with high-dose IND/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF with medium-dose IND/MF. Secondary analyses included efficacy comparisons for both doses of IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu (50/500 μg).

The study showed that IND/GLY/MF was superior to IND/MF in improving trough FEV1 after 26 weeks, meeting the primary endpoint. The key secondary endpoint, improvement in ACQ-7 score for IND/GLY/MF versus IND/MF was not met but tested treatments showed clinically meaningful improvements in this measure of symptoms from baseline at Week 26. Among other secondary analyses, a substantial reduction was observed in moderate-to-severe and severe asthma exacerbation rates with IND/GLY/MF compared with twice-daily Sal/Flu (50/500 µg).

IND/GLY/MF was generally well tolerated, and safety was comparable across treatment arms.

Full information on all of the endpoints measured in the study can be accessed at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02571777).

About the PALLADIUM study13
PALLADIUM (NCT02554786) was a multicenter, randomized, 52-week treatment, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of IND/MF compared with MF alone in patients with asthma.

PALLADIUM included 2,216 male and female patients (including 107 adolescents, aged ≥12 to <18 years old) with medium or high-dose ICS or low-dose ICS/LABA use 3 months prior to screening, a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥50% and less than 80% of the predicted normal value for the patient and an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score of greater than 1.5.

Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive either high-dose IND/MF (150/320 μg) once-daily delivered via Breezhaler® (n=445); medium-dose IND/MF (150/160 μg) once-daily delivered via Breezhaler® (n=439); MF 400 μg once-daily delivered via Twisthaler® (n=444); MF 800 μg administered as 400 μg twice-daily delivered via Twisthaler® (n=442); or salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu) 50/500 μg twice-daily delivered via Accuhaler® (n=446).

The study showed that medium and high doses of IND/MF demonstrated significant improvements compared with MF in trough FEV1 at Week 26 (Medium: 0.211 L; p<0.001) (High: 0.132 L; p<0.001). The key secondary endpoint of improvement in ACQ-7 at Week 26 was also met for combined doses of IND/MF compared with combined doses of MF (-0.209; p<0.001). These positive results were also observed at Week 52.

Analyses of other lung function endpoints showed greater improvements for IND/MF compared with MF in both morning and evening Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). Reductions in daily rescue medication use and exacerbation rates were also observed. Patients demonstrated a 12% increase in FEV1 and 200 mL within 30 minutes following administration of 400 µg salbutamol/360 µg albuterol (or equivalent dose) at the first visit or from historical data.

In the secondary analyses of comparison to Sal/Flu, high-dose IND/MF showed improvements in trough FEV1 (0.048 L; p=0.040) at 52 weeks. In asthma control, high-dose IND/MF and Sal/Flu were comparable with a difference in ACQ-7 score of 0.010 (p=0.824). Improvements were observed in both morning and evening PEF (Morning: 13.8 L/min; p<0.001) (Evening: 9.1 L/min; p=0.002), and percentage of rescue medication free days over 52 weeks (4.3; p=0.034) in patients treated with high-dose IND/MF versus Sal/Flu. High-dose IND/MF also showed faster onset of action over Sal/Flu as demonstrated by FEV1 measurement at 5 minutes on Day 1 (0.055 L; p<0.001).

IND/MF was generally well tolerated, and safety was comparable across treatment arms.

About the QUARTZ study14
The QUARTZ Study (NCT02892344) was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, 12-week treatment, double-blind study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of IND/MF (150/80μg) compared with MF (200 μg) delivered via the Twisthaler® device in adult and adolescent patients with asthma.

All patients were required to be on a stable low dose of ICS (with or without LABA) for at least one month prior to entering the run-in period. During the run-in period, all patients received open-label fluticasone propionate 100 μg twice-daily delivered via Accuhaler®. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria at the end of the run-in period were equally randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment groups IND/MF 150/80 μg once-daily delivered via the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device, or MF 200 μg once-daily, delivered via Twisthaler®.

802 male and female patients (including 64 adolescents, aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years old) were randomized to receive IND/MF (n=398) or MF (n=404). The mean age was 45.6 years with a mean asthma duration of 14.0 years.

Mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (% predicted of normal) was 75.1% at baseline and the mean FEV1 reversibility after inhalation of short acting beta agonist was 20.7%. The majority of patients were treated with low-dose ICS (42.9%) or low-dose LABA/ICS (56.0%) prior to the study.

Spirometry was performed at the end of the treatment period. The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of IND/MF 150/80 μg once-daily (in the evening) compared with MF 200 μg once-daily in terms of trough FEV1after 12 weeks of treatment in adults and adolescents. The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of IND/MF 150/80 μg to MF 200 μg (once-daily) in terms of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) after 12 weeks of treatment.

IND/MF demonstrated statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1compared with MF after 12 weeks of treatment in adult and adolescent patients with inadequately controlled asthma (least squares [LS] mean treatment difference: 0.182 L, 95% CI: 0.148, 0.217; p<0.001). In addition, clinically meaningful lung function benefit for IND/MF was supported by improvements in evening PEF of 26.1 L/min compared with MF alone (95% CI, 21.0, 31.2).

IND/MF also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in asthma control compared with MF, as measured by ACQ-7 after 12 weeks of treatment (LS mean treatment difference: -0.218, 95% CI: -0.293, -0.143; p<0.001). In addition, a clinically meaningful improvement in ACQ-7 was supported by a responder analysis, in which the IND/MF group had a greater proportion of responders (improvement in ACQ-7 >=0.5) compared with the MF group (74.7% vs 64.9%, respectively (odd ratio: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.33).

IND//MF was generally well tolerated, and safety was comparable across treatment arms.

About the ARGON study15
ARGON (NCT03158311) is a Phase IIIb, multicenter, randomized, 24-week, parallel-group, non-inferiority, open-label (blinded for the two IND/GLY/MF tested strengths), active-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY/MF with a free combination of salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate (Sal/Flu) plus tiotropium in patients with uncontrolled asthma. The ARGON study has completed in the field and its Clinical Study Report is currently being finalized.

The purpose of this trial was to demonstrate that the efficacy of two strengths of the fixed-dose combination product IND/GLY/MF (High: 150/50/160 μg and Medium: 150/50/80 μg) is non-inferior to the efficacy of the free combination of Sal/Flu (50/500 μg) plus tiotropium (5 μg) in patients with uncontrolled asthma.

All patients were symptomatic at screening despite treatment with medium or high stable doses of LABA/ICS as defined by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score ≥ 1.5.

Approximately 1,251 male and female patients with uncontrolled asthma (aged 18 and above) were randomized 1:1:1 (approximately 417 patients in each of the treatment groups) to receive either:

IND/GLY/MF 150/50/80 μg (once-daily)
IND/GLY/MF 150/50/160 μg (once-daily)
Open label Sal/Flu 50/500 μg (twice-daily) delivered via Diskus® plus tiotropium delivered via Respimat®
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of both high-dose IND/GLY/MF and low-dose IND/GLY/MF to comparator Sal/Flu plus tiotropium after 24 weeks of treatment based on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire.

Secondary objectives included:

To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus tiotropium based on trough FEV1 after 24 weeks of treatment
To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus tiotropium based on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire over 24 weeks of treatment.
To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus tiotropium based on ACQ-7 over 24 weeks of treatment.
To evaluate efficacy of high-dose IND/GLY/MF and medium-dose IND/GLY/MF compared with Sal/Flu plus tiotropium based on lung function over 24 weeks of treatment.

 WuXi Biologics will be responsible for biologics discovery, process development, and manufacturing, whereas Aravive will be responsible for pre/ clinical development
 In 2018, Aravive and WuXi Biologics expanded their manufacturing collaboration for development and manufacturing of AVB-500 following the US FDA’s IND filing of AVB-500","ANGHAI and HOUSTON, April 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — WuXi Biologics (“WuXi Bio”) (2269.HK), a global company with leading open-access biologics technology platforms, and Aravive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARAV), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced a strategic collaboration agreement granting Aravive the right to use the proprietary WuXiBody™ platform to develop high-affinity bispecific antibodies for a target implicated in cancer and fibrosis.

WuXi Biologics and Aravive will collaborate to discover antibodies against CCN2, a multidomain protein also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). CCN2 was identified from a similar target discovery screen that identified the significance of the AXL/GAS6 pathway in cancer. Preclinical data identified CCN2 as important for tumor growth and progression.

WuXi Biologics will be responsible for biologics discovery, process development, and manufacturing. Aravive will be responsible for preclinical and clinical development. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the collaboration.

“Aravive’s proficiency in development of anti-cancer and fibrotic drugs and WuXi Biologics’ expertise with biological discovery and manufacturing is a powerful combination,” said Gail McIntyre, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Aravive. “We look forward to further expanding our collaboration to identify high affinity antibodies that can be exploited as anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents.”

In 2018, and following the successful filing of a U.S. Investigational New Drug application (IND) for AVB-500, WuXi Biologics and Aravive announced expansion of their biologics manufacturing collaboration based on the rapid success achieved in the process development, scale-up and cGMP manufacture of Aravive’s lead drug candidate, AVB-500.

“We are glad to once again collaborate with Aravive as a trusted partner to accelerate the discovery, development and manufacturing of biologics through our innovative technology platforms,” said Chris Chen, Ph.D., chief executive officer of WuXi Biologics. “WuXi Biologics’ proprietary antibody platforms including WuXiBody™, are uniquely positioned to expedite development of novel bispecifics to benefit global patients.”

About WuXiBody™

WuXiBody™ is a leading proprietary bispecific antibody platform developed by WuXi Biologics. It can effectively break through the CMC barriers for many bispecific antibodies development with high expression yield, high stability, good solubility, and easy purification to homogeneity, expedite the process by 6-18 months and significantly reduce manufacturing costs, a limitation still faced by many other current bispecific platforms. WuXiBody™ Platform enables almost any mAb sequence pairs to be assembled into bispecific constructs, which are expected to have low immunogenicity risk and longer in vivo half-life. WuXiBody™ Platform also has a unique structural flexibility, which makes it convenient to build various formats with different combination of valencies (1+1, 1+2, 2+2) to meet the requirements of different target biologies.

About Aravive

Aravive, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARAV) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments designed to halt the progression of life-threatening diseases, including cancer and fibrosis. Aravive’s lead product candidate, AVB-500, is an ultra-high affinity decoy protein that targets the GAS6-AXL signaling pathway. By capturing serum GAS6, AVB-500 starves the AXL pathway of its signal, potentially halting the biological programming that promotes disease progression. AXL receptor signaling plays an important role in multiple types of malignancies by promoting metastasis, cancer cell survival, resistance to treatments, and immune suppression. The GAS6-AXL signaling pathway also plays a significant role in fibrogenesis. Aravive is evaluating AVB-500 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and kidney fibrosis and intends to expand development into additional oncology and fibrotic indications. Aravive is based in Houston, Texas and received a Product Development Award from the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) in 2016.

 The EUA will expedite broader use of remdesivir to treat hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, enabling access to remdesivir at additional hospitals across the US","— Authorization Enables Broader Use of Remdesivir to Treat Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19 Disease in the United States —

— Based on Patients’ Severity of Disease, Authorization Allows 5-day and 10-day Treatment Durations —

FOSTER CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–May 1, 2020– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational antiviral remdesivir to treat COVID-19. The EUA will facilitate broader use of remdesivir to treat hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to remdesivir at additional hospitals across the country. Allocation of the currently limited available supply of remdesivir will be made based on guiding principles that aim to maximize access for appropriate patients in urgent need of treatment, with direction from and in collaboration with the government.

Remdesivir is authorized for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease. The optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials. Under the EUA, both 5-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorization is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process. The EUA allows for the distribution and emergency use of remdesivir only for the treatment of COVID-19; remdesivir remains an investigational drug and has not been approved by FDA.

The U.S. government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities most heavily impacted by COVID-19. Given the severity of illness of patients appropriate for remdesivir treatment and the limited availability of drug supply, hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority in the distribution of remdesivir. Gilead is working with the U.S. government on the logistics of remdesivir distribution and will provide more information when the company begins shipping the drug under the EUA.

“This EUA opens the way for us to provide emergency use of remdesivir to more patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences. “We will continue to work with partners across the globe to increase our supply of remdesivir while advancing our ongoing clinical trials to supplement our understanding of the drug’s profile. We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility.”

The EUA is based on available data from two global clinical trials – the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19, including those who were critically ill, and Gilead’s global Phase 3 study evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with severe disease. Multiple additional clinical trials are ongoing to generate more data on the safety and efficacy of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19.

Remdesivir must be administered intravenously. The optimal dosing and duration of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 is still unknown. Under this EUA, the 10-day dosing duration is suggested for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the 5-day dosing duration is suggested for patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. If a patient on the 5-day dosing duration does not demonstrate clinical improvement after five days, treatment may be extended for up to five additional days (10 days total).

As previously announced, Gilead has donated the entirety of its existing supply of finished and unfinished product to help address the urgent medical needs posed by this pandemic around the world. Assuming a 10-day treatment course, Gilead’s donation of 1.5 million individual doses of remdesivir equates to more than 140,000 treatment courses that will be provided at no cost to treat patients following potential emergency authorizations and regulatory approvals, including this EUA. Gilead will continue to support clinical trials, and expanded access and compassionate use programs for remdesivir. In addition, Gilead will evaluate global allocation of supply on an ongoing basis using multiple, independent data sources to track the incidence and severity of the outbreak.

An EUA is intended to provide availability of a medicine during an emergency; an EUA is not the equivalent of an FDA approval. See below for important information about remdesivir.

Scale-Up of Remdesivir Supply

Gilead has aggressively implemented a multipronged approach to scale up production and rapidly build supply of the investigational antiviral remdesivir. The company has invested significant capital, at risk, to meet the supply needs for clinical trials and emergency treatment programs, and to prepare for even greater demand following regulatory authorizations, should these occur.

Through process refinements, Gilead has substantially shortened the manufacturing lead time from raw materials through to finished product. Gilead has also supplemented internal manufacturing with significant additional capacity from multiple partners in North America, Europe and Asia. The company has set a goal of producing at least 500,000 treatment courses by October, 1 million treatment courses by December 2020 and millions more in 2021, if required. These goals were based on a 10-day treatment course. Gilead now anticipates being able to cover significantly more patients based on the SIMPLE study results, which demonstrated similar efficacy with 5-day and 10-day dosing durations in patients with severe disease. Looking ahead, Gilead is building a geographically diverse consortium of leading pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing companies to help reach and exceed manufacturing goals, and go above and beyond what any company could do individually. More details about these efforts are available here.

Important Information about Remdesivir

Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is authorized for use under an EUA only for the treatment of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease. Severe disease is defined as patients with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen or requiring mechanical ventilation or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Remdesivir is authorized for adult or pediatric patients who are admitted to a hospital and for whom use of an IV agent is clinically appropriate, as remdesivir must be administered intravenously.

Remdesivir is an investigational drug that has not been approved by the FDA for any use. It is not yet known if remdesivir is safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19.

There are limited clinical data available for remdesivir. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with remdesivir use. Warnings: In clinical studies with remdesivir, infusion-related reactions and liver transaminase elevations have been observed. Remdesivir should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to any ingredient of remdesivir. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant infusion reaction occur, immediately discontinue administration of remdesivir and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients should have appropriate clinical and laboratory monitoring to aid in early detection of any potential adverse events. Monitor renal and hepatic function prior to initiating and daily during therapy with remdesivir; additionally monitor serum chemistries and hematology daily during therapy. The decision to continue or discontinue remdesivir therapy after development of an adverse event should be made based on the clinical risk benefit assessment for the individual patient.

Healthcare providers and/or their designee are responsible for mandatory FDA MedWatch reporting of all medication errors and serious adverse events or deaths occurring during remdesivir treatment and considered to be potentially attributable to remdesivir. These events must be reported within 7 calendar days from the onset of the event. MedWatch adverse event reports can be submitted to FDA online at www.fda.gov/medwatch or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.

This is not all of the important information for remdesivir. The FDA has authorized distribution of this medicine with accompanying Fact Sheets, which can be accessed at www.gilead.com/remdesivir. Healthcare providers should review the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers for more information on the authorized use of remdesivir and mandatory requirements of the EUA.

If approved, Remdesivir would become Japan’s first recognized therapy for COVID-19
 For remdesivir, the health ministry will apply a special approval system to shorten the screen-time for the therapy. In late Apr, the government reported that remdesivir needs to be introduced for emergency use and fast-track the procedures to greenlight domestic sales of the therapy, under the pharmaceuticals and medical devices law
 Remdesivir was previously failed as an Ebola treatment and is being evaluated against COVID-19 due to its ability to disable the mechanism by which the viruses replicate itself. According to a study published by NEJM, the therapy is effective in ~70% patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19","The health ministry will apply a special approval system to shorten the screening time for the antiviral Ebola drug remdesivir, which has just been approved for emergency use in coronavirus patients in the U.S. | POOL / AFP-JIJI
JIJI, REUTERS, KYODO

The health ministry is moving to approve the antiviral drug remdesivir to treat domestic coronavirus patients.

The move on Satuday followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement the previous day that the Food and Drug Administration had authorized the emergency use of the drug for COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir was originally developed by Gilead Sciences Inc. as an Ebola remedy but failed.

If given the go-ahead, remdesivir would become Japan’s first recognized remedy for the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

To greenlight remdesivir, the health ministry will apply a special approval system that allows screening to be substantially shortened on condition that the drug in question has been approved overseas.

On Saturday afternoon, the government, at a round-robin-style Cabinet meeting, revised a related ordinance in such a way to make it possible to apply the special approval system to remdesivir.

“I heard that the company will file an application for approval in a few days,” health minister Katsunobu Kato said. “I’ve instructed officials to be prepared to be able to grant an approval in about a week once the application is made.”

Japan’s approval process usually takes about a year based on domestic clinical trials. Expectations are especially high that remdesivir will help severely ill patients.

In late April, the government said remdesivir needs to be introduced for emergency use and that fast-track procedures to greenlight domestic sales were being prepared under the pharmaceuticals and medical devices law.

After receiving the application from Gilead Sciences, the health ministry will collect opinions on safety and other aspects of the drug at a meeting of its Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council.

Remdesivir, which previously failed as a Ebola treatment, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the coronavirus, copy themselves to overwhelm the host’s immune system.

According to a recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, the drug was effective in nearly 70 percent of 53 coronavirus patients with severe symptoms, but caused serious side effects, including deterioration of kidney and liver functions, in a quarter of them.

The government, however, has not applied the special approval system to the flu drug Avigan, because its sales prospects overseas are unclear. Instead, the government is proceeding with clinical trials.

Avigan is widely viewed as a potential treatment for COVID-19. It was developed by Tokyo-based Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co., an affiliate of Fujifilm Holdings Corp.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gilead-20.jpg,Regulatory,Gilead | MHLW,Remdesivir,COIVD-19| regulatory | expedites | Japan | patients | reviews | treat,publish,5/4/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/japan-health-ministry-expediting-remdesivir-for-covid-19-patients/,https://pharmashots.com/32413/mhlw-expedites-the-reviews-of-gileads-remdesivir-to-treat-patients-with-covid-19-in-japan/

The high specificity of the test is crucial to determine reliably if a person has been exposed to the virus and if the patient has developed antibodies
Roche will provide high double-digit millions of tests already in May for countries accepting the CE mark and in the U.S. under Emergency Use Authorization, further ramping up capacities thereafter
The test is available on Roche’s cobas e analysers which are widely available around the world

Basel, 03 May 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)1 for its new Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. The test is designed to help determine if a patient has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and if the patient has developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Roche has already started shipping the new antibody test to leading laboratories globally and will ramp up production capacity to high double-digit millions per month to serve healthcare systems in countries accepting the CE mark2 as well as the U.S.

“Thanks to the enormous efforts of our dedicated colleagues we are now able to deliver a high-quality antibody test in high quantities, so we can support healthcare systems around the world with an important tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis,” said Severin Schwan, CEO Roche Group. ”I am in particular pleased about the high specificity and sensitivity of our test, which is crucial to support health care systems around the world with a reliable tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis.”

“Our best scientists have worked 24/7 over the last few weeks and months to develop a highly reliable antibody test to help fight this pandemic,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Roche is committed to helping laboratories deliver fast, accurate, and reliable results to healthcare professionals and their patients.”

Roche’s SARS-CoV2 antibody test, which has a specificity greater than 99.8% and 100% sensitivity3 (14 Days post-PCR confirmation), can help assess patients’ immune response to the virus. As more is understood about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the test may help to assess who has built up immunity to the virus.

With extensive global manufacturing capabilities, Roche will be able to deliver high double-digit millions of tests per month. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers, which are widely available around the world.

For countries with specific regulatory requirements, local approval timelines apply. In addition there may be other country-specific regulations, such as import requirements, which will determine when the test becomes available locally. Roche will work closely with the respective regional representatives to ensure we appropriately support local registration efforts.

About antibody testing
An antibody test, also called a serology test, is used to determine whether a person might have gained immunity against a pathogen or not. The human body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses. In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, antibody tests need to be able to specifically detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to other similar coronaviruses, which could generate a false positive result and thus wrongly indicate potential immunity. A false positive result happens when a person receives a positive test result, when they should have received a negative result. False positives are particularly critical when we do not know how many people in a given population have had COVID-19. As of 24 April 2020, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans4.

About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test
Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the in-vitro qualitative detection of antibodies (including IgG) to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test, which is based on an in-solution double-antigen sandwich format, can detect antibodies to the new coronavirus causing COVID-19, which could signal whether a person has already been infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. Based on the measurement of a total of 5272 samples, the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has 99.81% specificity and shows no cross-reactivity to the four human coronaviruses causing common cold. This means it can lower the chance of false positives due to the detection of similar antibodies that may be present in an individual, but are specific for coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2. Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 detected antibodies with 100% sensitivity in samples taken 14 days after a PCR-confirmed infection. The importance of specificity and sensitivity of a particular test will be dependent on its purpose and disease prevalence within a given population.

Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers, which are widely available around the world. These fully automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes for one single test, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.

TRUXIMA is the only biosimilar to the reference product Rituxan®1 (rituximab) available to treat rheumatoid arthritis in the United States. See important safety information below including Boxed Warning regarding fatal infusion-related reactions, severe mucocutaneous reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

“We are proud to make TRUXIMA available to patients and providers as a treatment option for these indications, especially as this is the only rituximab biosimilar indicated for rheumatoid arthritis,” said Brendan O’Grady, Executive Vice President, North America Commercial, Teva. “Following the launch of our other biosimilar earlier this year, we remain focused on our commitment to lower healthcare costs and increase price competition through the availability of biosimilars.”

Celltrion Healthcare and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. entered into an exclusive partnership in October 2016 for Teva to commercialize TRUXIMA in the U.S. and Canada. In May 2019, TRUXIMA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to match all of the reference product’s oncology indications described below.

“We are pleased that patients in the United States can now have access to TRUXIMA for these new indications,” said Mr. Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare. “We believe that the continued use of biosimilars in the U.S. market will contribute to addressing unmet needs for patients and providers.”

Important Safety Information

WARNING: FATAL INFUSION-RELATED REACTIONS, SEVERE MUCOCUTANEOUS REACTIONS, HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION and PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY

 

Infusion-Related Reactions: Administration of rituximab products, including TRUXIMA, can result in serious, including fatal, infusion-related reactions. Deaths within 24 hours of rituximab infusion have occurred. Approximately 80% of fatal infusion-related reactions occurred in association with the first infusion. Monitor patients closely. Discontinue TRUXIMA infusion for severe reactions and provide medical treatment for Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions

 

Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: Severe, including fatal, mucocutaneous reactions can occur in patients receiving rituximab products

 

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: HBV reactivation can occur in patients treated with rituximab products, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Screen all patients for HBV infection before treatment initiation, and monitor patients during and after treatment with TRUXIMA. Discontinue TRUXIMA and concomitant medications in the event of HBV reactivation

 

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal PML, can occur in patients receiving rituximab products

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Infusion-Related Reactions – Rituximab products can cause severe, including fatal, infusion-related reactions. Severe reactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30-120 minutes. Rituximab product-induced infusion-related reactions and sequelae include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, anaphylactoid events, or death

Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to dosing. For RA, GPA, and MPA patients, methylprednisolone 100 mg intravenously or its equivalent is recommended 30 minutes prior to each infusion. Institute medical management (e.g. glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or oxygen) for infusion-related reactions as needed. Depending on the severity of the infusion-related reaction and the required interventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue TRUXIMA. Resume infusion at a minimum 50% reduction in rate after symptoms have resolved. Closely monitor the following patients: those with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000/mm3)

Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions – Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, can occur in patients treated with rituximab products. These reactions include paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The onset of these reactions has been variable and includes reports with onset on the first day of rituximab exposure. Discontinue TRUXIMA in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. The safety of re-administration of rituximab products to patients with severe mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation – Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs classified as CD20-directed cytolytic antibodies, including rituximab products. Cases have been reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive. Reactivation also has occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive)

HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA levels or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels. In severe cases increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur

Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with TRUXIMA. For patients who show evidence of prior hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy before and/or during TRUXIMA treatment

Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following TRUXIMA therapy. HBV reactivation has been reported up to 24 months following completion of rituximab therapy

In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on TRUXIMA, immediately discontinue TRUXIMA and any concomitant chemotherapy, and institute appropriate treatment. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming TRUXIMA treatment in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Resumption of TRUXIMA treatment in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing HBV

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) – JC virus infection resulting in PML and death can occur in rituximab product-treated patients with hematologic malignancies. The majority of patients with hematologic malignancies diagnosed with PML received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of their last infusion of rituximab

Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture

Discontinue TRUXIMA and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML

Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) – Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hyperphosphatemia from tumor lysis, sometimes fatal, can occur within 12-24 hours after the first infusion of rituximab products in patients with NHL. A high number of circulating malignant cells ( ≥25,000/mm3) or high tumor burden, confers a greater risk of TLS

Administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti-hyperuricemic therapy in patients at high risk for TLS. Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated

Infections – Serious, including fatal, bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following the completion of rituximab product-based therapy. Infections have been reported in some patients with prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia (defined as hypogammaglobulinemia >11 months after rituximab exposure). New or reactivated viral infections included cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B and C. Discontinue TRUXIMA for serious infections and institute appropriate anti-infective therapy. TRUXIMA is not recommended for use in patients with severe, active infections

Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions – Cardiac adverse reactions, including ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock may occur in patients receiving rituximab products. Discontinue infusions for serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Perform cardiac monitoring during and after all infusions of TRUXIMA for patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias, or who have a history of arrhythmia or angina

Renal Toxicity – Severe, including fatal, renal toxicity can occur after rituximab product administration in patients with NHL. Renal toxicity has occurred in patients who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients with NHL administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials. The combination of cisplatin and TRUXIMA is not an approved treatment regimen. Monitor closely for signs of renal failure and discontinue TRUXIMA in patients with a rising serum creatinine or oliguria

Bowel Obstruction and Perforation – Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases leading to death, can occur in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. In postmarketing reports, the mean time to documented gastrointestinal perforation was 6 (range 1-77) days in patients with NHL. Evaluate if symptoms of obstruction such as abdominal pain or repeated vomiting occur

Immunization – The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab product therapy has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment

Prior to initiating TRUXIMA physicians should ensure patients’ vaccinations and immunizations are up-to-date with guidelines. Administration of any non-live vaccines should occur at least 4 weeks prior to a course of TRUXIMA

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity – Based on human data, rituximab products can cause fetal harm due to B-cell lymphocytopenia in infants exposed to rituximab in-utero. Advise pregnant women of the risk to a fetus. Females of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while receiving TRUXIMA and for 12 months following the last dose of TRUXIMA

Concomitant Use With Other Biologic Agents and DMARDS Other Than Methotrexate

Observe patients closely for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used concomitantly as limited safety data is available.

Use of concomitant immunosuppressants other than corticosteroids has not been studied in GPA or MPA patients exhibiting peripheral B-cell depletion following treatment with rituximab products

Use in RA Patients Who Have Not Had Prior Inadequate Response to TNF Antagonists

TRUXIMA should only be used in patients who have had a prior inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist

Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of NHL (≥25%) were: infusion-related reactions, fever, lymphopenia, chills, infection, and asthenia

Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of CLL (≥25%) were: infusion-related reactions and neutropenia

Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of RA (≥10%) were: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and bronchitis (other important adverse reactions include infusion-related reactions, serious infections, and cardiovascular events)

Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of GPA and MPA (≥15%) were: infections, nausea, diarrhea, headache, muscle spasms, anemia, peripheral edema, and infusion-related reactions

Nursing Mothers – There are no data on the presence of rituximab in human milk, the effect on the breastfed child, or the effect on milk production. Since many drugs including antibodies are present in human milk, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of TRUXIMA due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants

About TRUXIMA® 
TRUXIMA (rituximab-abbs) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biosimilar to RITUXAN® (rituximab) for the treatment of: adult patients with CD20-positive, B-cell NHL to be used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or CLL in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC); for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with methotrexate in adult patients with moderately-to severely-active RA who have inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies; and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in adult patients in combination with glucocorticoids

TRUXIMA has the same mechanism of action as Rituxan and has demonstrated biosimilarity to Rituxan through a totality of evidence.

 VIR-2703 is an inhaled siRNA targeting SARS-CoV-2 genome and is the first DC selected in Vir’s expanded collaboration with Alnylam for up to four RNAi potential therapeutics for COVID-19","− Highly Potent and Broadly Cross-Reactive RNAi Therapeutic Development Candidate Selected Only Three Months After Program Initiation −

− Companies Expect to Start Human Clinical Trials at or Around Year-End 2020 –

May 04, 2020 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
SAN FRANCISCO & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY) today announced the selection of a development candidate (DC) for VIR-2703 (also referred to as ALN-COV), an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The companies plan to soon meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to discuss a potential accelerated path for filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) or IND equivalent application at or around year-end 2020, less than a year since program initiation. The companies plan to advance VIR-2703 as an inhalational formulation for the potential treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19.

“As this pandemic continues to unfold, we are committed to acting with the utmost urgency to broaden and accelerate our efforts to develop investigational RNAi therapeutics against COVID-19, and potentially future coronavirus-mediated diseases.”

In its discovery efforts, Alnylam synthesized over 350 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) – the molecules that mediate RNAi – targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were then analyzed bioinformatically and assessed in in vitro potency assays. Multiple highly potent siRNAs were identified that demonstrated a 3-log reduction of viral replication in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 live virus model conducted by Vir. In dose-response assays, VIR-2703 was shown to have an effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC50) of less than 100 picomolar and an EC95 of less than 1 nanomolar in the SARS-CoV-2 live virus model measuring inhibition of infectious virion production. Further, VIR-2703 has predicted reactivity against greater than 99.9 percent of the over 4300 SARS-CoV-2 genomes currently available in public databases that meet analysis requirements, and is also predicted to have reactivity toward the SARS-CoV genome from the 2003 SARS outbreak. With this DC selection, Vir and Alnylam will work closely together to generate the data required to enable rapid commencement of clinical studies.

“Vir is committed to applying industry-leading technologies in our fight against COVID-19. Our fruitful and expansive collaboration with Alnylam has rapidly led to identification of a development candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2,” said George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO of Vir. “With this candidate now in hand, we will further accelerate our efforts and plan to begin studies in humans at or around year-end. Our ultimate goal would be to provide rapid worldwide access, if approved, to an effective therapeutic to combat COVID-19.”

“I’m very proud of the quality and pace of work done by our scientists and with our collaborators at Vir to identify an RNAi therapeutic development candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome. To our knowledge, this is one of the most potent direct-acting antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2 reported to date,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “As this pandemic continues to unfold, we are committed to acting with the utmost urgency to broaden and accelerate our efforts to develop investigational RNAi therapeutics against COVID-19, and potentially future coronavirus-mediated diseases.”

In addition to the development candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the companies will utilize Alnylam’s recent advances in lung delivery of siRNAs, with widespread silencing of gene targets in the respiratory tract in multiple cell types, including cells in the respiratory tract that may be the targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the companies will employ Vir’s infectious disease expertise and established capabilities to bring forward up to three additional host factor-targeting development candidates to treat COVID-19, and potentially other coronavirus diseases.

About VIR-2703 (ALN-COV)

VIR-2703 is an inhaled SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNA that may have utility for prevention or for treatment. It leverages Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s latest advances in lung delivery of siRNAs and may have applicability to other coronaviruses as well. VIR-2703 is the first development candidate selected in the company’s expanded collaboration with Alnylam for up to four RNAi potential therapeutics for COVID-19.

About RNAi

RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) announced today that the first participants have been dosed in the U.S. in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the BNT162 vaccine program to prevent COVID-19. The trial is part of a global development program, and the dosing of the first cohort in Germany was completed last week.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200505005474/en/

The Phase 1/2 study is designed to determine the safety, immunogenicity and optimal dose level of four mRNA vaccine candidates evaluated in a single, continuous study. The dose level escalation portion (Stage 1) of the Phase 1/2 trial in the U.S. will enroll up to 360 healthy subjects into two age cohorts (18-55 and 65-85 years of age). The first subjects immunized in Stage 1 of the study will be healthy adults 18-55 years of age. Older adults will only be immunized with a given dose level of a vaccine candidate once testing of that candidate and dose level in younger adults has provided initial evidence of safety and immunogenicity. Sites currently dosing participants include NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine, with the University of Rochester Medical Center/Rochester Regional Health and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center to begin enrollment shortly.

“With our unique and robust clinical study program underway, starting in Europe and now the U.S., we look forward to advancing quickly and collaboratively with our partners at BioNTech and regulatory authorities to bring a safe and efficacious vaccine to the patients who need it most. The short, less than four-month timeframe in which we’ve been able to move from pre-clinical studies to human testing is extraordinary and further demonstrates our commitment to dedicating our best-in-class resources, from the lab to manufacturing and beyond, in the battle against COVID-19,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO, Pfizer.

Pfizer and BioNTech’s development program includes four vaccine candidates, each representing a different combination of mRNA format and target antigen. The novel design of the trial allows for the evaluation of the various mRNA candidates simultaneously in order to identify the safest and potentially most efficacious candidate in a greater number of volunteers, in a manner that will facilitate the sharing of data with regulatory authorities in real time.

“It is encouraging that we have been able to leverage more than a decade of experience in developing our mRNA platforms to initiate a global clinical trial in multiple regions for our vaccine program in such a short period. We are optimistic that advancing multiple vaccine candidates into human trials will allow us to identify the safest, most effective vaccination options against COVID-19,” said CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin.

During the clinical development stage, BioNTech will provide clinical supply of the vaccine from its GMP-certified mRNA manufacturing facilities in Europe.

In anticipation of a successful clinical development program, Pfizer and BioNTech are working to scale up production for global supply. Pfizer plans to activate its extensive manufacturing network and invest at risk in an effort to produce an approved COVID-19 vaccine as quickly as possible for those most in need around the world. The breadth of this program should allow production of millions of vaccine doses in 2020, increasing to hundreds of millions in 2021. Pfizer-owned sites in three U.S. states (Massachusetts, Michigan and Missouri) and Puurs, Belgium have been identified as manufacturing centers for COVID-19 vaccine production, with more sites to be selected. Through its existing mRNA production sites in Mainz and Idar-Oberstein, Germany, BioNTech plans to ramp up its production capacity to provide further capacities for a global supply of the potential vaccine.

BioNTech and Pfizer will work jointly to commercialize the vaccine worldwide upon regulatory approval (excluding China, where BioNTech has a collaboration with Fosun Pharma for BNT162 for both clinical development and commercialization).

32555,NeoGenomics Collaborates with Bayer to Provide NTRK Testing for Patients with Colorectal and Thyroid Cancer,NeoGenomics and Bayer Collaborate to Offer NTRK Testing for Certain Colorectal and Thyroid Cancer Patients,"The companies enter into a collaboration to test RNA-based NTRK gene fusions in colorectal and thyroid cancer patients, enrolled in the Sponsored Testing Program
 The sponsored Test4TRK program will provide RNA-based NTRK gene fusions test along with Pan-TrK IHC test in mCRC patients (high MSI-H status/deficient DNA MMR) as wells as in patients with RAIR DTC
 The study shows >3% NKTR gene fusion prevalence in mCRC patients and 2.4-12% prevalence in RAIR DTC patients with less favorable disease outcomes, irrespective of the results Bayer will be responsible for the total cost of NKTR gene fusions test","FT. MYERS, FL / ACCESSWIRE / May 5, 2020 / NeoGenomics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEO), a leading provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services, today announced a collaboration with Bayer (BAYN) to facilitate an RNA-based Neurotrophic Tropomyosin-Receptor Kinase (NTRK) testing for certain colorectal and thyroid cancer patients. All eligible patients who enroll and opt-in to a Sponsored Testing Program will receive testing at no cost to themselves or their insurance. Bayer will cover the total cost of this test regardless of the results and treatment decision.

The Sponsored Testing Program is for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with high Microsatellite Instability (MSI-H) status or deficient DNA mismatch repair (MMR-), as well as patients with radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (RAIR DTC). All eligible patients who enroll in the Sponsored Testing Program will receive an RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) test (NTRK NGS Fusion Profile) from NeoGenomics and patients will also receive a NeoGenomics Pan-Tropomyosin receptor kinase (TrK) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) test. For more information onthe Sponsored Testing Program and its no-cost testing, or to download the Test Request Form, healthcare professionals should visit https://www.neogenomics.com/ntrk-sponsored-testing-program.

A higher prevalence of NTRK gene fusions are found among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with prior high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) status. Studies suggest NTRK gene fusions are greater than 3% among these patients. NTRK rearrangements are also found to occur in 2.4-12% of radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (RAIR DTC) patients with less favorable disease outcomes. Genomic cancer tests that detect an NTRK gene fusion provide actionable information for patients that harbor the genomic alteration and may be appropriate for therapy.

“Our collaboration with Bayer to provide eligible colorectal and thyroid cancer patients with no-cost testing for NTRK gene fusions will help facilitate critical therapy for these patients,” said Douglas M. VanOort, NeoGenomics’ Chairman and CEO. “As a leading provider of oncology testing for clinical trials and patient care, NeoGenomics is in a unique position to provide access to genomic tests enabling patients to access important therapies without delay. This is one of several initiatives we expect to bring forward in our collaboration with Bayer that offer patients access to innovative testing approaches for approved cancer therapies.”

Business Highlights

Key Pipeline Progress

Regeneron has more than 20 product candidates in clinical development, including five marketed products for which it is investigating additional indications. Updates from the clinical pipeline include:

EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection

In February 2020, the Company announced positive two-year results from the Phase 3 PANORAMA trial evaluating EYLEA in patients with moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). The two-year data demonstrated that EYLEA reduced the likelihood of developing vision-threatening events by at least 75% in patients with NPDR.
In March 2020, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved EYLEA for the treatment of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) in Japan.
Dupixent® (dupilumab)

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, with a target action date of May 26, 2020. In addition, a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis has also been submitted in the European Union (EU).
In March 2020, the MHLW approved Dupixent for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in Japan.
The sBLA for the 300 mg auto-injector is under review by the FDA, with a target action date of June 20, 2020.
Oncology Program

In April 2020, the Company and Sanofi announced that the primary endpoint was met in the Phase 3 trial of Libtayo® (cemiplimab) as monotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the trial be stopped early due to highly significant improvement in overall survival. The data from the trial will form the basis of regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EU in the second half of 2020.
Patient enrollment in the Libtayo Phase 3 first-line NSCLC chemotherapy combination study is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020.
In May 2020, the Company and Sanofi announced that Libtayo demonstrated clinically-meaningful and durable responses in a pivotal, single-arm, open-label trial in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma and plan regulatory submissions in 2020.
The Company now has 6 bispecific antibodies in clinical development for various blood cancers and solid tumors. These include multiple classes of bispecifics including CD3 bispecifics, a CD28 costimulatory bispecific, and other classes of bispecifics.
Praluent® (alirocumab)

In March 2020, the Company announced that the Phase 3 trial in adult patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) met its primary endpoint and plans to submit an sBLA in mid-2020.
Evinacumab, an antibody to ANGPTL3

In March 2020, the Company presented positive, detailed results from the Phase 3 trial in patients with HoFH. The Company has also initiated a rolling BLA submission for HoFH and plans to submit an MAA in the EU in the second half of 2020.
Pozelimab, an antibody to C5

A Phase 2 study in the ultra-rare disease CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy was initiated.
REGN-EB3, a multi-antibody therapy to Ebola virus infection

The FDA accepted for priority review the BLA submission for Ebola, with a target action date of October 25, 2020.
COVID-19 Update

The Company is advancing REGN-COV2, a novel investigational antibody “cocktail” treatment designed to prevent and treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In April, Regeneron moved its leading neutralizing antibodies into pre-clinical and clinical-scale cell production lines and plans to begin clinical studies in June 2020. The Company is working to rapidly scale-up manufacturing, with a goal to have hundreds of thousands of preventative doses available by the end of August 2020.
In April 2020, the Company provided an update on the adaptively-designed Phase 2/3 U.S. study evaluating Kevzara® (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended continuing the ongoing Phase 3 trial only in the more advanced “critical” group with the 400 mg dose of Kevzara and discontinuing the study in the less advanced “severe” group, based on initial Phase 2 results.
The Company announced an expanded agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to fund certain research and development activities related to COVID-19 treatments, including REGN-COV2 and the U.S. Kevzara study.
The Company continues to monitor the potential impact on product sales. For EYLEA in the United States, there was limited impact on net product sales in the first quarter of 2020. In the month of April 2020, overall U.S. EYLEA demand was lower compared to the same period of 2019 with relative improvement seen by the end of the month. The Company expects to see continued adverse impact on new patient starts for all products while social distancing guidelines remain in place.
Regeneron maintains adequate market supply for all commercialized products. The Company’s raw material supplies and contract manufacturing support have also remained stable. In order to enable the U.S. manufacturing site to produce large-scale quantities of REGN-COV2, the Company is working with the FDA to accelerate licensing of additional commercial products manufactured at its Ireland facility.
Regeneron expects fully-recruited clinical studies to remain generally on track. The Company has paused new enrollment in certain studies in light of the pandemic and continues to monitor the evolving situation across global trial sites.
Business Development Update

The Company and Sanofi entered into an agreement, effective April 1, 2020, to restructure its collaboration for Praluent. In the United States, the Company will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of Praluent and will record net product sales. Sanofi will have sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of Praluent outside the United States, and will pay the Company a 5% royalty on Praluent net product sales.
In December 2019, the Company and Sanofi also announced their intent to restructure their antibody collaboration for Kevzara. The companies continue to assess potential terms of this restructuring in light of the recently launched clinical programs evaluating Kevzara in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

In April 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Zai Lab Limited to develop and commercialize REGN1979 (bispecific antibody targeting CD20 and CD3) in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. Under the terms of the agreement, Zai is obligated to make a $30 million up-front payment, and we are eligible to receive up to $160 million in additional regulatory and sales milestone payments. The Company will continue to lead global development activities for REGN1979, and Zai will be responsible for funding a portion of the global development costs for certain clinical trials.
First Quarter 2020 Financial Results

Effective January 1, 2020, Regeneron has implemented changes in the presentation of its financial statements related to certain reimbursements and other payments for products developed and commercialized with collaborators. The Company made these changes in presentation to better reflect the nature of the Company’s costs incurred and revenues earned pursuant to arrangements with collaborators and to enhance the comparability of Regeneron’s financial statements with industry peers. The change in presentation has been applied retrospectively. See Note (4) below for further information.

Revenues

Total revenues increased by 33% to $1.828 billion in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $1.373 billion in the first quarter of 2019.

EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $1.172 billion in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $1.074 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Overall distributor inventory levels for EYLEA in the United States remained within the Company’s one-to-two-week targeted range.

Total revenues also include Sanofi and Bayer collaboration revenues(2) of $528 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $246 million in the first quarter of 2019. Sanofi collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2020 included the Company’s share of profits from collaboration antibodies (Dupixent, Praluent, and Kevzara) of $171 million, while Sanofi collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2019 included the Company’s share of losses from collaboration antibodies of ($28) million. The change in the Company’s share of profits (losses) from collaboration antibodies was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits.

Refer to Table 4 for a summary of collaboration revenue.

Other operating (income) expense, net $ (40) $ (57) (30) % * * n/a 
* GAAP and non-GAAP amounts are equivalent as no non-GAAP adjustments have been recorded
 

The higher GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2020 were principally due to additional costs incurred in connection with our earlier-stage pipeline, higher headcount and headcount-related costs, and an increase in clinical manufacturing activities.
The higher GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2020 were primarily due to higher headcount and headcount-related costs, an increase in commercialization-related expenses for EYLEA, and higher contributions to independent not-for-profit patient assistance organizations. In addition, GAAP SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2020 increased partly due to additional accruals for loss contingencies associated with ongoing litigation.
The increase in COCM was primarily due to the recognition of manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of Dupixent and manufacturing costs in connection with our BARDA Ebola agreement.
Other operating (income) expense, net, includes recognition of a portion of amounts previously deferred in connection with up-front and development milestone payments, as applicable, received in connection with the Company’s collaborative arrangements.
Other Financial Information

GAAP other (expense) income, net, includes the recognition of net losses on equity securities of $57 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to net gains of $43 million in the first quarter of 2019.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Company’s GAAP effective tax rate was 6.6%, compared to 15.6% in the first quarter of 2019. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted, compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily by stock-based compensation, and, to a lesser extent, income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate and federal tax credits for research activities. In the first quarter of 2020, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.5%, compared to 16.0% in the first quarter of 2019.

GAAP net income per diluted share was $5.43 in the first quarter of 2020, compared to GAAP net income per diluted share of $3.99 in the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $6.60 in the first quarter of 2020, compared to non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $4.45 in the first quarter of 2019. A reconciliation of the Company’s GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.

During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased 719,167 shares of Common Stock under the Company’s share repurchase program and recorded the cost of the shares received, or $273 million, as Treasury Stock. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had $473 million which remained available for share repurchases under the original $1.0 billionprogram.

(1) This press release uses non-GAAP R&D, non-GAAP SG&A, non-GAAP COGS, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, and free cash flow, which are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain non-cash and/or other items from the related GAAP financial measure. The Company also includes a non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated income tax effect of reconciling items.
The Company makes such adjustments for items the Company does not view as useful in evaluating its operating performance. For example, adjustments may be made for items that fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within the Company’s control (such as the Company’s stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued or changes in the fair value of the Company’s equity investments) or items that are not associated with normal, recurring operations (such as restructuring-related expenses, including employee separation costs). Management uses these non-GAAP measures for planning, budgeting, forecasting, assessing historical performance, and making financial and operational decisions, and also provides forecasts to investors on this basis. Additionally, such non-GAAP measures provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company’s core business operations. However, there are limitations in the use of these and other non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain expenses that are recurring in nature. Furthermore, the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Any non-GAAP financial measure presented by Regeneron should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company’s historical GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.

(2) The Company’s collaborators provide it with estimates of the collaborators’ respective sales and the Company’s share of the profits or losses from commercialization of products for the most recent fiscal quarter. The Company’s estimates for such quarter are reconciled to actual results in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and the Company’s share of the profit or loss is adjusted on a prospective basis accordingly, if necessary.
(3) The Company’s 2020 financial guidance does not assume the completion of any significant business development transactions not completed as of the date of this press release.
(4) Applicable amounts previously reported for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and as of December 31, 2019 have been revised to reflect a change in presentation of cost reimbursements from collaborators who are not deemed to be the Company’s customers from collaboration revenue to a reduction of the corresponding operating expense. The Company also changed the presentation of amounts recognized in connection with up-front and development milestone payments received from collaboration revenue to Other operating income, as well as the presentation of the corresponding balance sheet accounts. The revisions were reclassifications only and had no impact on the Company’s previously reported GAAP and non-GAAP net income and net income per share. Refer to the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020 (Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) for further details.
(5) Corresponding reimbursements from collaborators and others for manufacturing of commercial supplies is recorded within revenues.

A final agreement is expected to be consummated within the next two months
 Following the execution of the final license agreement, AdaptVac to receive upfront, development & commercial milestones along with royalties on sales. The agreement will have no impact on Bavarian’s financial guidance for 2020
 Bavarian will support the consortium called the PREVENT-nCoV to achieve clinical proof-of-concept and will be responsible for clinical development and global commercialization of vaccine with the anticipated initiation of clinical study in late 2020","COPENHAGEN, Denmark, May 6, 2020 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA, OTC: BVNRY) today announced that it has entered into an exclusive head of terms agreement with AdaptVac, a joint venture established by ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies and NextGen Vaccines spun out of the University of Copenhagen, to license AdaptVac’s proprietary capsid virus like particle (VLP) based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine. The parties seek to enter into the final license agreement within the next two months.

AdaptVac is a member of the international PREVENT-nCoV consortium that includes several European universities and earlier this year received an EU Horizon grant to rapidly advance AdaptVac’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19 into the clinic. The members of the consortium hold preclinical and clinically validated experience from working with similar coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS, as well as malaria vaccines, using AdaptVac’s capsid VLP technology and ExpreS2ion’s ExpreS2 technology. AdaptVac’s technology has the potential to mimic a virus to the body’s immune system, giving the optimal stimulus to generate a fast, long-lasting immune response that offers a highly efficacious protection. Importantly, the production of the vaccine technology can be readily scaled to commercial quantities and AdaptVac is working with AGC Biologics for the manufacture and scale-up of the vaccine. Bavarian Nordic will support the consortium to achieve clinical proof of concept and takes responsibility for clinical development and global commercialization of the vaccine. Current plan is to initiate a clinical study later this year.

Paul Chaplin, President & CEO of Bavarian Nordic said: “We have been interested in the capsid VLP technology for some time and are pleased to support and rapidly advance this highly promising vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. This technology should lead to a strong protective immune response, even in high risk populations to COVID-19 and together with its high scalability in production make this a winning combination in the fight against this pandemic. We are excited to join forces with Danish biotech companies AdaptVac and ExpreS2ion, as well as the University of Copenhagen and other members of the PREVENT-nCoV consortium in rapidly advancing this differentiated vaccine to the clinic and subsequently leading further development activities.”

“AdaptVac and the PREVENT-nCoV consortium are delighted to have Bavarian Nordic join our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts. Bavarian Nordic perfectly complements our pre-clinical and early stage clinical capabilities with their extensive late-clinical stage and market expertise. This partnership further validates our capsid VLP display platform as a break-through technology to combat infectious and chronic diseases.” said Wian de Jongh, AdaptVac’s CEO, “Critically, Bavarian Nordic’s support ensures the vaccine can reach vulnerable populations in the shortest possible timeline.”

Upon execution of a final license agreement, Bavarian Nordic will make an initial upfront payment to Adaptvac in addition to future development and sales milestones and royalties. This agreement has no impact on Bavarian Nordic’s financial guidance for 2020.

32597,Sanofi and Regeneron Report Results of Libtayo (cemiplimab) in a P-II Study as 2L Treatment for Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma,Libtayo (cemiplimab) shows clinically meaningful and durable responses in second-line advanced basal cell carcinoma,"The ongoing P-II study involves assessing Libtayo (300mg, IV, q3w) for up to 93 wks. or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or confirmed complete response in 132 patients with advanced BCC who were intolerant to prior HHI therapy
 The P-II study results: ORR (29% in patients with LA disease) with an estimated DOR exceeding one year in 85% of responders; in a preliminary analysis, ORR (21% in patients with mBCC) with an estimated DOR exceeding one year in 83% of responders
 Libtayo is a mAb targeting the PD-1 on T-cells and acts by blocking the cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. Both the companies plan the regulatory submission of the therapy in 2020","Libtayo® (cemiplimab) shows clinically meaningful and durable responses in second-line advanced basal cell carcinoma

Objective responses seen in 29% of patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
In a preliminary analysis, objective responses seen in 21% of patients with metastatic BCC
Approximately 85% of patients who responded to Libtayo maintained their response for at least one year
Sanofi and Regeneron plan regulatory submissions in 2020
Paris and Tarrytown, NY – May 5, 2020 – Topline data for a pivotal, single-arm, open-label trial for Sanofi and Regeneron’s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who had progressed on or were intolerant to prior hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI) therapy were announced today. Libtayo demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable responses in this group of patients for whom there are no approved treatments. Sanofi and Regeneron plan regulatory submissions in 2020.

BCC is a skin cancer and is the most common cancer worldwide, with approximately two million new cases diagnosed every year in the U.S. alone. While the vast majority of BCCs are caught early and cured with surgery or radiation, a small proportion of tumors can become advanced and penetrate deeper into surrounding tissues (locally advanced), which is more difficult to treat. Approximately 20,000 U.S. patients have advanced BCC and it is estimated that about 3,000 die each year. BCC marks the second non-melanoma skin cancer for which Libtayo has demonstrated first-in-class data and follows its initial U.S. approval in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) in 2018.

In the trial, the objective response rate (ORR) for patients (n=84) with locally advanced disease was 29% (95% CI: 19%-40%), with an estimated duration of response (DOR) exceeding one year in 85% of responders. The durable disease control rate (DCR —response or stable disease lasting at least 6 months) was 60% (95% CI: 48%-70%). In a preliminary analysis of patients (n=28) with metastatic disease, the ORR was 21% (95% CI: 8%-41%), with an estimated DOR exceeding one year in 83% of responders. The durable DCR was 46% (95% CI: 28%-66%). All data were assessed by an independent central review. Data are expected to continue to evolve with further follow-up across both patient groups.

“While PD-1 inhibitors have transformed the outlook for many patients with melanoma, progress for patients with non-melanoma skin cancers has not been as rapid,” said Peter C. Adamson, M.D, Global Head of Oncology Development at Sanofi. “We are continuing to address this unmet need by first bringing Libtayo to patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and now, with this second trial, as a potential therapy for patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma. These important new results further demonstrate Libtayo’s potential in patients with difficult-to-treat, non-melanoma skin cancers.”

There were no new safety signals in this trial. Among the 132 patients assessed for safety (84 locally advanced and 48 metastatic), 95% of patients experienced an adverse event (AE), 32% had a serious AE and 13% discontinued due to an AE. There were 10 deaths in the locally advanced group and nine deaths in the metastatic group; none of the deaths were considered treatment-related. Sanofi and Regeneron will present additional trial findings at an upcoming medical meeting.

“Libtayo is being investigated as a monotherapy treatment and as a foundation therapy for combinations with novel therapeutic approaches being developed by Regeneron and our collaborators,” Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. “These data in advanced BCC provide the third instance where Libtayo monotherapy has demonstrated robust and clinically meaningful outcomes in advanced cancer, and follows last week’s announcement in advanced non-small cell lung cancer where the pivotal trial was stopped early for positive overall survival.”

In this ongoing global Phase 2 trial, patients received Libtayo 350 mg intravenously every three weeks for up to 93 weeks or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or confirmed complete response. ORR is the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints include overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, safety and quality of life.

Libtayo is being jointly developed and commercialized by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.

The use of Libtayo to treat advanced BCC is investigational and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About Libtayo
Libtayo is a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.

Libtayo is the first and only immunotherapy approved in the U.S., EU, and other countries for adults with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. In skin cancer, this includes trials in adjuvant and neoadjuvant CSCC. Libtayo is also being investigated in potentially registrational Phase 3 trials in non-small lung cancer and cervical cancer, as well as in trials combining Libtayo with novel therapeutic approaches for both solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., May 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTCT) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Censa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of CNSA-001 (sepiapterin), a clinical-stage investigational therapy for orphan metabolic diseases, including phenylketonuria (PKU) and other diseases associated with defects in the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biochemical pathways diagnosed at birth. The transaction was approved by the Boards of both companies.

“Results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of CNSA-001 demonstrated significant and clinically relevant reductions in phenylanaline levels compared to current first-line treatment,” said Stuart W. Peltz, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. “We believe that CNSA-001 has the potential to address the majority of PKU patients whose condition is not adequately managed by current treatments. We look forward to initiating a Phase 3 study in PKU so that patients diagnosed with this devastating condition can have a new oral treatment option as soon as possible.”

CNSA-001 has been pursued as a possible treatment for orphan metabolic diseases associated with defects in the tetrahydrobiopterin biochemical pathways. CNSA-001 is an oral formulation of synthetic sepiapterin, a precursor to intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin, which is a critical enzymatic cofactor involved in the metabolism and synthesis of numerous metabolic products. The Phase 2 trial evaluating CNSA-001 for PKU met its primary and secondary endpoints in December 20191, and the program is Phase 3 ready.

“I am proud of the team at Censa and its achievements to date demonstrating the potential role of CNSA-001 in treating diseases of the BH4 pathway,” said Jonathan Reis M.D., M.B.A., President and Chief Executive Officer of Censa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “It is the right time to have an excellent fully integrated, patient-focused biotechnology organization like PTC Therapeuticstake over the late-stage development of CNSA-001 so that this promising compound becomes available to patients in the near future.”

About Phenylketonuria (PKU)
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused predominantly by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and resulting in toxic buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) in the brain. Gene mutations of PAH result in inefficient Phe metabolism leading to hyperphenylalaninemia. There are at least 1,000 unique mutations in the PAH gene, resulting in phenotypic variation in the amount of enzyme produced and/or enzyme activity. With the near universal adoption of newborn screening for high plasma phenylalanine PKU is typically diagnosed at birth. PKU has been described in all ethnic groups, and its incidence worldwide varies widely, but is estimated that there are 16,500 patients in the U.S. If left untreated, severe and irreversible disability can occur to include permanent intellectual disability, seizures, delayed development, behavioral problems, and possibly psychiatric disorders. It has been shown that administration of tetrahydrobiopterin improves the function of PAH resulting in reduction in phenylalanine plasma concentration. CNSA-001 has the potential to address the metabolic and neurological signs and symptoms of a broad range of PKU patients.

About Censa Pharmaceuticals
Censa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing CNSA-001, an oral therapy for phenylketonuria (PKU) patients across all ages and disease severities.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).

This approval fills a long-recognized and urgent need among METex14 patients who have not had a treatment option approved to specifically target the driver of their lung cancer3. Tabrecta is approved for first-line and previously treated patients, regardless of prior treatment type, and is expected to be available to patients in the coming days.

The FDA also approved FoundationOne®CDx as the companion diagnostic for Tabrecta, to aid in detecting mutations that lead to MET exon 14 skipping in tumor tissue.

“Non-small cell lung cancer is a complex disease, with many different possible mutations that may encourage the cancer’s growth,” said Juergen Wolf, MD, from the Center for Integrated Oncology, University Hospital Cologne and lead investigator of the GEOMETRY study. “MET exon 14 skipping is a known oncogenic driver. With today’s decision by the FDA, we can now test for and treat this challenging form of lung cancer with a targeted therapy, offering new hope for patients with NSCLC harboring this type of mutation.”

Novartis was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for capmatinib. According to FDA guidelines, treatments that receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation must target a serious or life-threatening disease and demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more significant preliminary research endpoints.

The approval of Tabrecta is based on results from the pivotal GEOMETRY mono-1 Phase II multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort study. In the METex14 population (n=97), the confirmed overall response rate was 68% (95% CI, 48-84) and 41% (95% CI, 29-53) among treatment-naive (n=28) and previously treated patients (n=69), respectively, based on the Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) assessment per RECIST v1.11. In patients taking Tabrecta, the study also demonstrated a median duration of response of 12.6 months (95% CI, 5.5–25.3) in treatment-naive patients (19 responders) and 9.7 months (95% CI, 5.5-13.0) in previously treated patients (28 responders)1. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (incidence ≥20%) are peripheral edema, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite1.

“Today, and especially during these difficult times, we are incredibly proud that Tabrecta is the first treatment approved by the FDA specifically to treat patients diagnosed with this aggressive NSCLC associated with METex14,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, President, Novartis Oncology. “In our quest to reimagine medicine, we have worked tirelessly over the past decades to advance the understanding and treatment of NSCLC, striving to make a difference in patients’ lives, one mutation at a time. We thank all the physicians, patients and families involved in the Tabrecta clinical trials, and we remain committed to advancing innovative solutions for the patients we work to serve.”

NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of the 2 million new lung cancer diagnoses each year worldwide, including about 228,000 in the United States4-5. Nearly 70% of NSCLC patients have a genomic mutation6. METex14, a recognized oncogenic driver, occurs in approximately 3%-4% of newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC cases (about 4,000 – 5,000 patients in the US annually)7-9, 2.

“With NSCLC, understanding whether a mutation is driving the cancer is critical, and it’s important for doctors and patients to use comprehensive biomarker testing at the time of diagnosis or progression to check for mutations like those that cause METex14,” said Andrea Ferris, President and CEO of LUNGevity. “Knowing more about the molecular makeup of their tumor will help patients and their healthcare teams make informed treatment-related decisions from the start.”

Novartis is committed to providing patients with access to medicines, as well as resources and support to address a range of needs. The Novartis Oncology Patient Support Program is available to help guide eligible patients through the various aspects of getting started on treatment, from providing educational information to helping them understand their insurance coverage and identify potential financial assistance options. Patients or providers can call 800-282-7630 or visit Patient.NovartisOncology.com or HCP.Novartis.com/Access to learn more about eligibility and to enroll.

Full prescribing information for Tabrecta can be found at https://www.novartis.us/sites/www.novartis.us/files/tabrecta.pdf

About Tabrecta (capmatinib)
Tabrecta (capmatinib) is a kinase inhibitor that targets MET. Tabrecta is licensed to Novartis by Incyte Corporation in 2009. Under the Agreement, Incyte granted Novartis worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications.

About GEOMETRY mono-1
GEOMETRY mono-1 is a Phase II multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort study in adult patients with EGFR wild-type, metastatic NSCLC as measured by ORR.

The trial evaluated 97 adult patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring mutations that lead to METex14 (centrally confirmed) who were assigned to Cohorts 4 (n=69, previously treated patients) or 5b (n=28, treatment-naive), and received capmatinib tablets 400 mg orally twice daily.

The major efficacy outcome is ORR based on BIRC assessment per RECIST v1.1. An additional efficacy outcome is duration of response by BIRC.

Novartis Commitment to Lung Cancer
Worldwide, lung cancer causes more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined, and more than 2 million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year4. Despite treatment advances, many patients with NSCLC still have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options3. This includes the nearly 70% of NSCLC patients who have a genomic mutation6. To determine the most appropriate treatment, medical organizations recommend comprehensive genomic testing for patients with lung cancer as part of their upfront diagnosis7.

Novartis Oncology’s research has helped transform treatment approaches for patients living with NSCLC. Novartis continues its commitment to the global lung cancer community through ongoing studies, as well as the exploration of investigational compounds in NSCLC, including those that target genetic biomarkers and tumor promoting inflammation.

Indication 
TABRECTA™ (capmatinib) tablets is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with a kind of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery (metastatic), and whose tumors have an abnormal mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) gene.

The effectiveness of TABRECTA in these patients is based on a study that measured 2 types of response to treatment (response rate and duration of response). There is no clinical information available to show if patients treated with TABRECTA live longer or if their symptoms improve. There are ongoing studies to find out how TABRECTA works over a longer period of time.

It is not known if TABRECTA is safe and effective in children.

Important Safety Information 
TABRECTA may cause serious side effects, such as lung or breathing problems. TABRECTA may cause inflammation of the lungs during treatment that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider right away if they develop any new or worsening symptoms, including cough, fever, trouble breathing, or shortness of breath.

TABRECTA may cause abnormal blood test results, which may be a sign of liver problems. Patients should be advised that their health care provider will do blood tests to check their liver before starting and during treatment with TABRECTA. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider right away if they develop any signs and symptoms of liver problems including the skin or the white part of their eyes turning yellow (jaundice), dark or “tea-colored” urine, light-colored stools (bowel movements), confusion, loss of appetite for several days or longer, nausea and vomiting, pain, aching, or tenderness on the right side of the stomach area (abdomen), or weakness or swelling in the stomach area.

The skin may be sensitive to the sun (photosensitivity) during treatment with TABRECTA. Patients should be advised to use sunscreen or wear clothes that cover their skin during treatment with TABRECTA to limit direct sunlight exposure.

For women of reproductive potential, TABRECTA can harm their unborn baby. They should use an effective method of birth control during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose. Men who have partners who can become pregnant should use effective birth control during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose.

Before taking TABRECTA, patients should tell their health care provider about all their medical conditions, including if they have or have had lung or breathing problems other than lung cancer, have or have had liver problems, or if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, as TABRECTA can harm their unborn babies. Females who are able to become pregnant should have a pregnancy test before they start treatment with TABRECTA and should use effective birth control during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of TABRECTA. Patients should be advised to talk to their health care provider about birth control choices that might be right for them during this time and to tell their health care provider right away if they become pregnant or think they may be pregnant during treatment with TABRECTA. Males who have female partners who can become pregnant should use effective birth control during treatment and for 1 week after their last dose of TABRECTA.

Patients should tell their health care provider about all the medicines they take or start taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

The most common side effects of TABRECTA include swollen hands, ankles, or feet (peripheral edema); nausea and/or vomiting; tiredness and/or weakness (fatigue, asthenia); shortness of breath (dyspnea); loss of appetite; changes in bowel movements (diarrhea or constipation); cough; pain in the chest; fever (pyrexia); back pain; and decreased weight.

32652,Amgen Reports Results of Otezla (apremilast) in P-III ADVANCE Study for Mild-To-Moderate Plaque Psoriasis,Amgen Announces Positive Top-Line Results From Otezla® (apremilast) Phase 3 ADVANCE Study In Mild-To-Moderate Plaque Psoriasis,"The P-III ADVANCE study involves assessing of Otezla (apremilast, 30mg, bid for 16wks.) vs PBO in 595 patients in a ratio (1:1) with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. Later, patients will receive Otezla during an open-label extension phase @32wks.
 The P-III ADVANCE study results: @16wks., improvement in its 1EPs of sPGA score; achieve 2EPs i.e, 75% improvement in BSA, change in PASI score 
 Otezla is a selective PDE4 inhibitor, inhibiting the production of TNF-alpha from human rheumatoid synovial cells and is an approved therapy for mod. to sev. plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, for active PsA and for with oral ulcers associated with Behçet’s Disease","Otezla Treatment Resulted in Significant Improvements in Measures of Mild-to-Moderate Psoriasis Compared With PlaceboData Will be Submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Inclusion in Otezla Prescribing Information
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., May 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced positive top-line results from the ADVANCE trial, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the efficacy of Otezla® (apremilast) in adults with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. The study showed that oral Otezla 30 mg twice daily achieved a statistically significant improvement, compared with placebo, in the primary endpoint of the static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) response (defined as an sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline) at week 16.

In addition, the week 16 secondary endpoints of achieving at least 75% improvement from baseline in the percent of affected body surface area (BSA); change in BSA total score from baseline; and change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) total score from baseline were each also statistically significant for the treatment effect of Otezla compared with placebo.

“Many patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis who use topical therapies still have challenges managing their psoriasis,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “We look forward to discussions with the FDA about the potential to bring Otezla, which has already been prescribed to hundreds of thousands of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, to more patients who may need additional therapeutic options.”

The adverse events observed in this trial were consistent with the known safety profile of Otezla. The most commonly reported adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either treatment group were diarrhea, headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection.

Detailed results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.

In the U.S., Otezla is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and for adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet’s Disease. Since its initial FDA approval in 2014, Otezla has been prescribed to more than 250,000 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or active psoriatic arthritis in the U.S.[1]

About ADVANCE (PSOR-022)

ADVANCE (PSOR-022) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Otezla in patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis (defined as BSA involvement of 2% to 15%, PASI score of 2 to 15, sPGA score of 2 to 3). The study randomized 595 patients 1:1 to receive Otezla 30 mg twice daily or placebo for the first 16 weeks. All patients then received Otezla during an open-label extension phase through week 32.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with sPGA response [defined as a sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline] at week 16.

About Psoriasis

Psoriasis is a serious, chronic inflammatory disease that causes raised, red, scaly patches to appear on the skin, typically affecting the outside of the elbows, knees or scalp, though it can appear on any location.[2] Approximately 125 million people worldwide have psoriasis, including around 14 million people in Europeand more than 7.5 million people in the United States.[3],[4] About 80% of those patients have plaque psoriasis.[5]

About Otezla® (apremilast)

Otezla® (apremilast) 30 mg tablets is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which Otezla exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined.

Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. INDICATIONS

Otezla® (apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.

Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.

Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet’s Disease.

Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Contraindications

Otezla® (apremilast) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulation
Warnings and Precautions

Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting
Depression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occur
Psoriasis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.3% (12/920) of patients reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) on placebo. Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/506). Suicidal behavior was observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients on Otezla, compared to 0.2% (1/506) on placebo. One patient treated with Otezla attempted suicide; one patient on placebo committed suicide
Psoriatic Arthritis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.0% (10/998) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. Suicidal ideation and behavior was observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients on Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients. Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/495). Two patients who received placebo committed suicide compared to none on Otezla
Behcet’s Disease: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During the clinical trial, 1% (1/104) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 1% (1/103) treated with placebo. No instances of suicidal ideation or behavior were reported in patients treated with Otezla or treated with placebo
Weight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of Otezla
Psoriasis: Body weight loss of 5-10% occurred in 12% (96/784) of patients treated with Otezla and in 5% (19/382) of patients treated with placebo. Body weight loss of ≥10% occurred in 2% (16/784) of patients treated with Otezla compared to 1% (3/382) of patients treated with placebo
Psoriatic Arthritis: Body weight loss of 5-10% was reported in 10% (49/497) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.3% (16/495) of patients taking placebo
Behçet’s Disease: Body weight loss of >5% was reported in 4.9% (5/103) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.9% (4/102) of patients taking placebo
Drug Interactions: Apremilast exposure was decreased when Otezla was co-administered with rifampin, a strong CYP450 enzyme inducer; loss of Otezla efficacy may occur. Concomitant use of Otezla with CYP450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommended
Adverse Reactions

Psoriasis: Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients were (Otezla%, placebo%): diarrhea (17, 6), nausea (17, 7), upper respiratory tract infection (9, 6), tension headache (8, 4), and headache (6, 4)

Forward-Looking Statements

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company, including Adaptive Biotechnologies (including statements regarding such collaboration’s ability to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19), BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla®(apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, or effects relating to studies of Otezla as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations.

32662,Laurent Receives Health Canada's Approval to Initiate P-II RESOLUTION Study Evaluating LAU-7b for COVID-19,"Laurent Pharmaceuticals Receives Health Canada’s Approval to Initiate COVID-19 Clinical Trial MONTREAL, QC, Canada – May 6th, 2020","The company plans to initiate a P-II RESOLUTION study assessing LAU-7b in multiple hospitals in Canada and will enroll ~200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients for a treatment duration of 14 days and is expected to initiate the enrollment soon
 The focus of the study is to evaluate LAU-7b’s dual pro-resolving inflammation and antiviral activity against COVID-19. The company anticipates that the treatment has the potential to reduce the severity of the disease and to prevent its progression towards ARDS
 The RESOLUTION study follows the recommendations of WHO Master Protocol for COVID-19 clinical studies and will measure the patient’s health status on a 7-point ordinal scale as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes include disease progression, duration of hospitalization and QoL","Company to test LAU-7b’s dual pro-resolving inflammation and antiviral properties against COVID-19

Laurent Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Montreal-based biopharmaceutical company, today announced that it has obtained the approval from Health Canada to initiate RESOLUTION, a Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trial testing once-a-day oral LAU-7b as a potential drug candidate to help combat the COVID-19 disease. The trial, which is planned to start imminently in multiple hospitals in Canada, will enroll approximatively 200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients for a treatment duration of 14 days.

« We are really pleased by the expedited review by Health Canada and we are working closely with clinical sites in Montreal to start enrolling the first patients very soon,» said Radu Pislariu, MD, President and CEO of Laurent Pharmaceuticals. The objective of the treatment is to reduce the severity of the disease and prevent its progression towards an acute respiratory failure known as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Ultimately, we hope the medication could help in keeping hospitalized patients off ventilators, » added Dr Pislariu.

Laurent Pharmaceuticals is developing LAU-7b for its capacity to trigger the resolution phase of inflammation, a natural mechanism that keeps the inflammatory response of the body under control without interfering with its immune role (a “pro-resolving” effect). LAU-7b is believed to interfere with coronavirus replication and host avoidance by acting on the same lipid-modulating pathways it uses for the pro-resolving effect.

« Many patients who have contracted the COVID-19 virus suffer from complications of an inflammatory response that gets out of control. Inflammation is needed to fight infection but, sometimes, the body’s ability to control an inflammatory response may be affected with age or underlying conditions, leading to an overwhelming and self‐perpetuating pro-inflammatory environment, » said Dr. Larry Lands, Pneumologist at McGill University Health Center. « Typical anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting the activation mechanisms of the inflammation process, which are also necessary and important for starting the immune defense. As opposed to these drugs, LAU-7b stimulates the natural resolution mechanisms and let’s the body decide when to reduce inflammation – a more biological way to maintain an efficient yet harmless immune-inflammatory balance, » added Dr. Lands.

The RESOLUTION trial follows the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) Master Protocol for COVID-19 clinical studies and will measure the patient health status on a 7-point ordinal scale as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include various measurements of disease progression, duration of hospitalization and quality of life..

32680,Henlius HLX02 (Trastuzumab for Injection) Receives EU GMP Certificates,Henlius Receives EU GMP Certificate for HLX02 (Trastuzumab for Injection),"Henlius has received two EU GMP certificate for drug substance (DS) line and drug product (DP) line for HLX02 (trastuzumab biosimilar) and has become the first EU certified site to self-develop an Ab drug depicting the company has commercial-scale manufacturing facility and quality management as per EU standards
 The EU GMP inspection is recognized by nearly 30 EU Member States also the inspection results may also be shared with other countries signed MRAs with the EU including the US and Canada
 HLX02 (biosimail, trastuzumab) is a developed biosimilar that has passed the EU GMP inspection in China, targeted for HER2+ve early-stage BC , HER2+ve mBC and HER2+ve mGC and showed no clinically meaningful differences terms of efficacy and safety in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer vs originator trastuzumab, also under review by the EMA for MAA. Additionally, has been evaluated in P-III trial vs originator in Mainland China, Ukraine, Poland, and the Philippines","Shanghai, China, April 23, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the company’s drug substance (DS) line and drug product (DP) line for HLX02 trastuzumab biosimilar have successfully passed the European United (EU) Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) on-site inspection and the company has received two EU GMP Certificates (Certificate of GMP Compliance of a Manufacturer) from Poland’s Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector. As one of the most authoritative and rigorous inspections globally, EU GMP inspection is recognized by nearly 30 EU Member States, and the inspection results may also be shared with other countries that have signed Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) with the EU, including the United States, Canada etc.. Therefore, EU GMP Certificate is regarded as a “passport” for drugs to be launched in international market and has significant global impact.
With the EU GMP Certificates, Henlius’ Xuhui Facility has become China’s first EU certified GMP site to manufacture a self-developed antibody drug and HLX02 trastuzumab biosimilar is the first China-developed biosimilar that has passed the EU GMP inspection. This means that the company has already built a commercial-scale manufacturing facility and a quality management system that are in line with the EU standards. This also means that China-developed antibody drug is breaking the GMP barriers to be launched on international market, laying a solid foundation for the company to further expand its global footprints.
Dr. Scott Liu, co-founder and CEO of Henlius, said, “We are very pleased with the successful pass of the EU GMP inspection. This could never be achieved without the team’s 10-year hard work, dedication and Henlius’ pursuit of high quality. We will make every effort to accelerate the global commercialisation progress of HLX02, hoping to benefit more patients and to represent China in the ‘World Cup’ to compete with the world’s top bio-pharmaceutical companies from Europe, the United States, South Korea etc.
Mr. Zhang Wenjie, President of Henlius, said, “In February 2019, the company’s first product, HLX01 (rituximab injection), was officially approved by China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), becoming the first biosimilar launched in China. Following the successful launch of HLX01, the NDA of HLX02 has been assigned to the priority review list by NMPA and HLX02 is expected to be launched this year. The EU GMP Certificates are another recognition of the company’s high-quality and independently-developed products by the world’s authoritative drug regulatory agencies.
Complying with the Highest Quality Standards, Building the World-class Platform

The EU has pioneered in the establishment of the regulations of biosimilar medicines in the world. In 2004, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued the draft biosimilar guidelines, opening up a new era for global biosimilars. Since the first biosimilar was approved in 2006, the EU has become the world’s most mature market for biosimilars. The Xuhui Facility is located in Caohejing High-tech Park, Xuhui District, Shanghai, designed and built in accordance with the standards of the EU, China and the United States. Ever since its foundation, Henlius has adhered to the highest quality standards in the world and all R&D and production activities are carried out in line with EU quality standards. Head-to-head comparisons have been conducted between biosimilars and originators in the pre-clinical and clinical stages, which has laid the foundation for the company’s globalisation strategy. The Xuhui Facility and its supporting quality management system have passed a number of on-site inspections or audits by the NMPA, EU qualified person and international business partners, and have obtained a GMP certificate from the NMPA.
China-developed Trastuzumab to Benefit Global Patients
HLX02 is a biosimilar developed and manufactured by Henlius in accordance with international standards, potentially for the treatment of HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. It was evaluated in an international multi-centre (Mainland China, Ukraine, Poland and the Philippines) Phase 3 clinical study aiming for head-to-head comparison between HLX02 and the originator, which is a key milestone of the company’s globalisation strategy. The study results were presented in the 2019 ESMO Asia Congress held in Singapore, demonstrating that HLX02 has no clinically meaningful differences from the originator trastuzumab in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer.
To fulfil the huge unmet needs of high-quality and affordable biologic medicines worldwide, Henlius has proactively expanded its global presence through continuous strategic collaboration with global leading pharmaceutical companies and has reached strategic cooperation agreements with Accord, Cipla, Mabxience and Jacobson Medical for the commercialisation of HLX02 in over 80 countries and regions around the world. With an extensive presence in North America, Europe, Australia, South Africa etc., Accord has become one of the fastest growing generic pharmaceutical companies focused on developing, manufacturing and distributing generics and biosimilars. Henlius has granted Accord exclusive commercial rights of HLX02 in over 70 countries and regions in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States. In June 2019, Accord submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA on HLX02, making HLX02 the first China-developed trastuzumab biosimilar accepted by the EMA for MAA review, and therefore HLX02 has the potential to become the first China biosimilar approved in the EU.
Looking forward, while keeping with the core values of “Affordable Innovation · Reliable Quality”, Henlius will continue its dedication in the field of oncology and deliver more innovative biologic medicines to provide affordable and effective treatment options for patients worldwide, highlighting the company’s vision of becoming the most trusted and admired biotech company in the world.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/henlius-3.jpg,Biosimilars,Henlius,HLX02 | Trastuzumab,biosimilars | certificates | EU | GMP |injection | receives,publish,23/4/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/henlius-receives-eu-gmp-certificate-for-hlx02-trastuzumab-for-injection/,https://pharmashots.com/32680/henlius-hlx02-trastuzumab-for-injection-receives-eu-gmp-certificates/
32685,"Henlius Receives NMPA's IND Approval for its HLX13 (biosimilar, ipilimumab)",Henlius Received IND Approval for Its Ipilimumab Biosimilar HLX13 from NMPA,"The approval follows the trials which involves assessing of HLX13 vs originator ipilimumab to evaluate its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics profiles, immunogenicity, and toxicity
 The study resulted in biosimilarity data in terms of in vivo and in vitro pharmacology, PK, toxicokinetics, immunogenicity and toxicity characteristics
 HLX13 is a recombinant anti-CTLA-4 fully human mAb injection resulting in T cell activation in anti-tumour immune response and is developed under Chinese Biosimilar Guidelines approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced RCC, MSI-H or dMMR Mcc and adjuvant treatment of melanoma","Shanghai, China, April 8, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that the investigational new drug (IND) application of its ipilimumab biosimilar HLX13 (a recombinant anti-CTLA-4 fully human monoclonal antibody injection) has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer and adjuvant treatment of melanoma.

Developed for patients around the globe with high similarity to originatoripilimumab 

HLX13 is a biosimilar of ipilimumab targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). The development of HLX13 is strictly in accordance with Chinese Biosimilar Guidelines. So far, originator ipilimumab has been approved and launched in the U.S. and Europe. Approved indications for ipilimumab monotherapy include adjuvant treatment of melanoma and treatment of advanced melanoma. Combination therapy of ipilimumab and PD-1 inhibitor are approved for the treatment of advanced RCC, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. According to an estimation from Datamonitor, the peak sales of ipilimumab will be more than USD 2.6 billion.

Strictly following the principles of comparability, stepwise development, consistency and similarity assessment, Henlius has conducted a series of head-to-head pre-clinical studies to compare the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics profiles, immunogenicity and toxicity profile of HLX13 and originator ipilimumab. Results from these studies showed that there is a high similarity or no significant difference between HLX13 and originator ipilimumab in terms of in vivo and in vitro pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics, immunogenicity and toxicity characteristics. Henlius is committed to provide quality biologics to benefit patients around the globe and will actively explore opportunities to bring HLX13 mono or combination therapies to the global market.

Blocking inhibitory effects on T cell activation to release the brake of anti-tumour immune response

Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that can block the inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 on the co-stimulation signal necessary to T cell activation. It is known that two signals are required to activate T cells and the co-stimulation signal generated by binding between CD28 on T cells and B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells is one of the required signals. CTLA-4, which is also expressed on T cells, has a higher affinity to B7 molecules compared with CD28, and thus can competitively bind to B7 molecule to inhibit the CD28/B7 co-stimulation signal. In addition, signals of CTLA-4 pathway can also terminate T cell activation[1]. HLX13 can specifically bind to CTLA-4 to block these inhibitory effects and as a result can help T cell activation in anti-tumour immune response.

Great clinical application potential for dual immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy

With the broad application of immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice, the potential of the combination therapy of anti-CTLA-4 mAb and anti-PD-1 mAb is becoming more and more attractive. Based on their mechanisms of action (MoA), there is probably a synergistic effect between these two immune checkpoint inhibitors. During the early phase of immune response, anti-CTLA-4 mAb can help maintain T cell activation, while in effector phase anti-PD-1 mAb can inhibit immune escape of tumour cells and restore killing of tumour cells by cytotoxic T cells.

MoA and clinical data suggest treatment with this dual immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy have significant clinical benefit for cancer patients with relatively hightumour mutation burden (TMB) or neoantigen burden, e.g. patients with intermediate- to high-risk renal cell carcinoma, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer，advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or advanced melanoma. Effective treatment options for these patient populations are usually limited and their prognosis is relatively bad. Immune combination therapies for these patients are in urgent need.

Expanding Henlius future immune combination and bispecific antibody options

The product pipeline of Henlius has a broad coverage of immune-oncology targets, anti-angiogenesis targets and tumour-specific targets. Clinical development of the company’s anti-PD-1 mAb HLX10 is progressing smoothly and its monotherapy and multiple combination therapies have entered pivotal phases. In the future, there is a great potential of HLX13 to be combined with HLX10 to form a dual immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy. Apart from the indications approved for clinical trials of HLX13 monotherapy, this immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy also has the potential to be evaluated in non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors.

Henlius has established an integrated bispecific antibody R&D and engineering platform and has accumulated extended data and insights on immune-oncology targets like PD-(L)1, OX40, LAG3, TIGIT etc… Clinical progress of HLX13 will lay the foundation for Henlius future endeavors in the development of bispecific antibodies with CTLA-4 target. Leveraging the company’s well-established innovation platform, Henlius will continue discovering and developing quality and affordable innovative therapies to benefit patients around the globe.

Despite the COVID-19, Xplore will continue the recruitment of new patients and treatment for patients currently in the study
 Xbrane will ensure the safety participants in the P-III study as well as the integrity of study data during the COVID-19 by following EMA’s and FDA’s recommendations. The company has currently recruited ~60% of the planned 580 patients
 Xbrane has agreed with the EMA and the FDA to submit MAA/ BLA, based on the interim read-out when last patient has reached month six in the treatment schedule. Xplore is expected to record its last patient by the end Q3’20","Xbrane Biopharma AB (publ) (”Xbrane” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq Stockholm: XBRANE) today announces the following update on the ongoing phase III-study Xplore:

As of today, Xlucane is still on track towards regulatory approval ahead of Lucentis® patent expiration in EU July 2022.
Despite the global Corona crisis, Xplore remains open for recruitment of new patients and treatment for patients currently in the study.
Xbrane is continuously taking all necessary steps to comply with the new COVID-19 guidance from local authorities and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) with patient and clinic personnel safety as first priority.
Currently approximately 60% of the planned 580 patients are recruited into Xplore.
However, the rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic makes forecasting of future recruitment rate challenging at this stage.
Xplore remains open for recruitment of new patients and treatment for patients currently in the trial
The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly and will have a significant impact on the global healthcare system. Xbrane will ensure the safety of Xplore study participants as well as the integrity of study data during the COVID-19 pandemic by following recommendations set by the EMA and the FDA.

Based on the circumstances below, Xbrane will maintain Xplore open for recruitment of new patients and continue treatment for all patients currently in the study.

Patients in Xplore are treated for a critical eye-disease, age related macular degeneration, which if not treated leads to significant vision impairment and in worst case blindness and despite the risk of contamination of COVID-19 and local restrictions there is a desire from patients to be treated.
Participation in Xplore does not lead to significantly more visits to a clinic than if the patients would receive standard treatment outside of a clinical trial.
Over 50% of clinics are private eye-clinics located separately from general hospitals and therefore with lower risk of contamination of patients and clinic personnel in relation to patient visits.
Xbrane is supporting the clinics to take all measures possible to ensure patient safety in relation to visits. Out of the currently recruited patients approximately 42% are based in Eastern Europe, 20% in India, 10% in Israel, 6% in Russia and Ukraine, 14% in the US and 8% in Spain.

Xlucane is still on track towards regulatory approval ahead of Lucentis® patent expiration in EU July 2022.
Currently 355 out of 580 (approximately 60%) planned patients are recruited into Xplore and recruitment of new patients have taken place even during last two weeks. COVID-19 will inevitably result in a reduced recruitment rate compared to previously communicated pre-COVID-19 recruitment rate of 60-80 patients per month. Since the situation changes so rapidly any forecasting of recruitment rates in the coming months becomes challenging. Xbrane has previously agreed with the EMA and the FDA to submit Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”)/Biologics License Application (“BLA”) on the basis of an interim read-out when last patient has reached month six in the treatment schedule. As long as Last Patient In to Xplore is recorded latest by end of third quarter 2020 and counting for a twelve month regulatory process, Xlucane is still on track towards approval ahead of Lucentis® patent expiration in EU July 2022.

Important Information about Remdesivir in the United States

Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only for the treatment of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease. Severe disease is defined as patients with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen or requiring mechanical ventilation or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Remdesivir is authorized for adult or pediatric patients who are admitted to a hospital and for whom use of an IV agent is clinically appropriate, as remdesivir must be administered intravenously.

Remdesivir is an investigational drug that has not been approved by the FDA for any use. It is not yet known if remdesivir is safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19. This use of remdesivir is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use, unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner. The FDA Letter of Authorization for the EUA is available at www.gilead.com/remdesivir.

There are limited clinical data available for remdesivir. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with remdesivir use. Warnings: In clinical studies with remdesivir, infusion-related reactions and liver transaminase elevations have been observed. Remdesivir should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to any ingredient of remdesivir. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant infusion reaction occur, immediately discontinue administration of remdesivir and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients should have appropriate clinical and laboratory monitoring to aid in early detection of any potential adverse events. Monitor renal and hepatic function prior to initiating and daily during therapy with remdesivir; additionally, monitor serum chemistries and hematology daily during therapy. The decision to continue or discontinue remdesivir therapy after development of an adverse event should be made based on the clinical risk benefit assessment for the individual patient.

Healthcare providers and/or their designee are responsible for mandatory FDA MedWatch reporting of all medication errors and serious adverse events or deaths occurring during remdesivir treatment and considered to be potentially attributable to remdesivir. These events must be reported within 7 calendar days from the onset of the event. MedWatch adverse event reports can be submitted to FDA online at www.fda.gov/medwatch or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.

Summary of Program Highlights by Modality

Core Modalities

Prophylactic Vaccines: Moderna is developing vaccines against viral diseases where there is unmet medical need – including complex vaccines with multiple antigens for common diseases, as well as vaccines against threats to global public health. The Company’s global public health portfolio is focused on epidemic and pandemic diseases for which funding has been sought from governments and non-profit organizations.

Infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647): In March, Moderna announced completion of enrollment for the Phase 2 dose-confirmation study of mRNA-1647. The first Phase 2 interim analysis is expected in the third quarter of 2020. Manufacturing and planning are underway for the pivotal Phase 3 study, which is designed to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection in women of childbearing age and is expected to start in 2021. Moderna owns worldwide commercial rights for mRNA-1647.
Zika virus vaccine (mRNA-1893): The 10 µg, 30 µg and 100 µg cohorts in the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1893 have completed enrollment. In April 2020, Moderna announced positive interim Phase 1 data showing the 10 µg and 30 µg dose levels of mRNA-1893 induced a neutralizing antibody response in both flavivirus infection-naïve (seronegative) participants and in participants with pre-existing flavivirus antibodies (seropositive) following a two-dose vaccination schedule given 28 days apart. The 10 µg and 30 µg dose levels were both generally well-tolerated, and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or adverse events of special interest (AESI). The most frequent solicited adverse reaction was local pain at the injection site. The safety profile did not appear affected by the second vaccination nor a flavivirus-positive baseline serostatus. mRNA-1893 is being developed in collaboration with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Moderna owns worldwide commercial rights to mRNA-1893.
Vaccines against respiratory infections

Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273): The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed its review of the Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for its novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) vaccine candidate (mRNA-1273) allowing it to proceed to the Phase 2 study. A 600 participant Phase 2 study is expected to begin shortly. The Company is finalizing the protocol for the Phase 3 study, which is expected to begin in the early summer of 2020.
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653): Due to the pandemic, the Company previously decided to pause new enrollment of participants in the ongoing hMPV/PIV3 study (mRNA-1653), which had been actively enrolling seropositive pediatric participants (12-36 months of age). The Company intends to work with appropriate medical and site personnel to determine when to resume new enrollment. Moderna owns worldwide commercial rights to mRNA-1653.
Pediatric respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine (mRNA-1345): mRNA-1345 is a vaccine against RSV in young children encoding for a prefusion F glycoprotein, which elicits a superior neutralizing antibody response compared to the postfusion state. The Company intends to combine mRNA-1345 with mRNA-1653, its vaccine against hMPV and PIV3, to create a combination vaccine against RSV, hMPV and PIV3. There is no approved vaccine for RSV. Moderna owns worldwide commercial rights to the combined mRNA-1345/mRNA-1653 vaccine.
RSV vaccine (mRNA-1172 or V172): The Phase 1 study of mRNA-1172 led by Merck is ongoing. Moderna has licensed worldwide commercial rights to mRNA-1172 to Merck.
Influenza H7N9 vaccine (mRNA-1851): Discussions regarding funding the Company’s influenza H7N9 vaccine program through approval are ongoing.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189): mRNA-1189 is a vaccine against EBV containing five mRNAs that encode viral proteins (gp350, gB, gp42, gH and gL) in EBV. Similar to Moderna’s CMV vaccine (mRNA-1647), the viral proteins in mRNA-1189 are expressed in their native membrane-bound form for recognition by the immune system. There is no approved vaccine for EBV. Moderna owns worldwide commercial rights to mRNA-1189.
Systemic Secreted & Cell Surface Therapeutics: In this modality, mRNA is delivered systemically to create proteins that are either secreted or expressed on the cell surface.

Antibody against the chikungunya virus (mRNA-1944): Moderna has been notified that the enrollment of further subjects in the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1944 has been paused by the site due to the impact of COVID-19. Moderna owns worldwide commercial rights to mRNA-1944.
IL-2 (mRNA-6231): mRNA-6231 is an mRNA encoding for a long-acting tolerizing IL-2. This new autoimmune development candidate is designed to preferentially activate and expand the regulatory T cell population. The Company plans to conduct a Phase 1 study of mRNA-6231 in healthy adult volunteers. mRNA-6231 uses the same LNP formulation as mRNA-1944. The Phase 1 study of mRNA-6231 will be the first clinical demonstration of subcutaneous administration of this delivery technology. Moderna owns worldwide commercial rights to mRNA-6231.
PD-L1 (mRNA-6981): mRNA-6981 is an mRNA encoding for PD-L1. This new autoimmune development candidate is designed to augment cell surface expression of PD-L1 on myeloid cells to provide co-inhibitory signals to self-reactive lymphocytes. As an initial step to addressing a range of autoimmune indications, the Company intends to pursue proof-of-concept in a Phase 1 study of mRNA-6981 in type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), a condition that involves liver inflammation and can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. mRNA-6981 uses the same LNP formulation as mRNA-1944. Moderna owns worldwide commercial rights to mRNA-6981.
Relaxin (AZD7970): Partnered with AstraZeneca, AZD7970 is in preclinical development for the treatment of heart failure. Under the terms of the collaboration, AstraZeneca would sponsor the Phase 1 trial to assess safety, tolerability and duration of systemic exposure to the Relaxin protein. Moderna shares worldwide commercial rights to AZD7970 with AstraZeneca.
Fabry disease (mRNA-3630): Given current strategic priorities, the Fabry disease program (mRNA-3630) is being discontinued.
Publication of note: In April, in collaboration with Seattle Children’s Research Institute, Moderna published preclinical data in Molecular Therapy Nucleic Acids showing administration of mRNA encoding the factor VIII (FVIII) protein led to rapid and prolonged FVIII expression in mouse models of Hemophilia A. This work is part of Moderna’s research to explore the potential of mRNA therapy across various rare diseases.
Exploratory Modalities

Cancer Vaccines: These programs focus on stimulating a patient’s immune system with antigens derived from tumor-specific mutations to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective anti-tumor response.

Cash Used for Purchases of Property and Equipment: Cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $6.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Revenue: Total revenue was $8.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $16.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The total revenue decrease in 2020 was mainly attributable to cumulative catch-up adjustments in revenue due to changes in estimated costs for our future performance obligations under the collaboration agreements with Merck and AstraZeneca, and a decrease in revenue from Merck, primarily driven by the timing of amortization of deferred revenue due to the satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation.
Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $115.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $130.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in lab supplies and materials, clinical trial and manufacturing costs, consulting and outside services, partially offset by increases in personnel related costs, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation.
General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $24.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $27.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in legal related costs and consulting and outside services.
Net Loss: Net loss was $124.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $132.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

32740,CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance to Initiate Clinical Study Evaluating Hyperimmune Therapy for COVID-19 by Summer 2020,"CoVIg-19 PLASMA ALLIANCE BUILDS STRONG MOMENTUM THROUGH EXPANDED MEMBERSHIP AND CLINICAL TRIAL COLLABORATION May 7, 2020","Takeda, CSL and NIH’s, CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance has expanded membership and CT collaborations with >10 plasma and non-plasma companies globally to develop a plasma-derived hyperimmune globulin therapy against COVID-19
 The news member to the program includes ADMA Biologics, BioPharma Plasma, GC Pharma, and Sanquin. All the organization will provide specialist advisory expertise, technical guidance to develop the treatments whereas NIH will conduct a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the hyperimmune therapy in adult patients with COVID-19
 The alliance anticipates the initiation of the global study in the summer 2020 and will form the foundation regulatory approval of the therapy. Hyperimmune globulin therapy is a collection of convalescent plasma made by purifying antibodies from donated plasma for which Microsoft and Uber Health are providing technical support including the Alliance website and the Plasmabot for donor recruitment","– Rapidly expanding support for the Alliance is increasing donations of convalescent plasma to begin clinical production, while NIH collaboration confirms clinical trial approach 
– Alliance urges anyone who has recovered from COVID-19 to consider donating today

Osaka, JAPAN, and King of Prussia, PA, USA – 7 May 2020 – The CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, an unprecedented plasma industry collaboration recently established to accelerate the development of a plasma-derived hyperimmune globulin therapy for COVID-19, is rapidly building momentum. Its membership has expanded globally to include 10 plasma companies, and now also includes global organizations from outside the plasma industry who are providing vital support to encourage more people to donate plasma.

In addition to those announced at its inception – Biotest, BPL, CSL Behring, LFB, Octapharma and Takeda – the Alliance welcomes new industry members ADMA Biologics, BioPharma Plasma, GC Pharma, and Sanquin. Together, these organizations will contribute specialist advisory expertise, technical guidance and/or in-kind support to contribute to the Alliance goal of accelerating development and distribution of a potential treatment option for COVID-19.

In parallel, the Alliance has confirmed it will work with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the NIH to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the hyperimmune therapy in adult patients with COVID-19. This global study is currently anticipated to start in the summer and will form the foundation for the potential regulatory approval of the hyperimmune therapy.

“Hyperimmune globulin therapy has the potential to be one of the earliest treatment options for COVID-19, and we look forward to working with NIAID and health authorities to bring this therapy to patients as early as possible,” said Bill Mezzanotte, Executive Vice President, Head of R&D, CSL Behring and Co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance. “One of the stated goals of the alliance is to be an effective partner for important institutions such as NIAID and also to help develop coherent regulatory strategies that can give global health authorities the confidence to streamline the approval process of hyperimmune globulin therapy for COVID-19.”

Key to developing this potential hyperimmune globulin treatment is the collection of convalescent plasma. To amplify awareness, the Alliance has gained support from large organizations outside of the plasma industry. Examples of those offering resources to the Alliance include Microsoft and Uber Health. Microsoft is providing technology support, including the Alliance website and the Plasmabot for donor recruitment. The Plasmabot streamlines the process for a potential donor to quickly gain information about their nearest collection center from across the member network. In parallel, Uber Health has agreed to donate 25,000 round-trip rides to transport potentially eligible donors to and from plasma collection centers. These rides will be coordinated by the plasma collection center directly for individuals with confirmed appointments.

“Partnership and collaboration are critical to the success of the CoVIg-19 program,” said Julie Kim, President of Plasma-Derived Therapies Business Unit, Takeda, and co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance. “We now have enough plasma to initiate clinical manufacturing, but more is needed to ensure both speed and scale. The growing and active involvement of leading companies from outside the plasma industry, who support this Alliance as well as convalescent plasma for transfusion initiatives – demonstrates the potential of convalescent plasma to fight this public health crisis. Together, we all share the same goal – to save lives by using the power of convalescent plasma in different ways.”

The success of the CoVig-19 program depends heavily right now on the support of people across the world to donate convalescent plasma. We encourage those who have recovered from COVID-19 and who are interested in contributing to our development program – or to any other – by donating their plasma to visit the websitefor more information.

Additionally, CZ’s SC formulation is more expensive than IV formulation, but ‘Remsima SC’ is expected to be a good alternative to the infliximab formulation","Corona 19 also accelerates market expansion

-Launched ‘Ramshima SC’ in the Netherlands on the 27th of last month.

-In the first week of launch, a request was made to purchase ‘Ramshima SC’ directly from a Dutch hospital … Interested by local medical staff ↑

-Signed a contract with CZ, the largest private insurance company in the Netherlands

[2020-05-07] Celltrion Healthcare expands and markets European sales of ‘Rimshima SC’ (a component name: Infliximab), a subcutaneous injection-type biopharmaceutical for the treatment of autoimmune diseases despite Corona 19 (COVID-19) We continue to strengthen our activities.

Celltrion Healthcare launched ‘Ramshima SC’ in the Netherlands on the 27th (local time) following Germany and the UK. The company held the ‘Ramshima SC launching symposium’ on the 21st to successfully expand the ‘Lamshima SC’ market in the Netherlands. The event was held online to prevent corona19 virus infection, and over 200 key medical personnel such as doctors, pharmacists, and hospital medicine purchasing managers participated to show high expectations for ‘Ramshima SC’.

Head of Rheumatology Department, Tom Huizinga, Leiden University, Netherlands, who participated as a presenter, said, “Clinical results ‘Ramshima SC’ has similar results in effectiveness and safety compared to the existing IV type (intravenous injection). “The Ramsima SC has the strength of dual formulations that can be used for treatment with the IV formulation” Ramsima “. “We will be able to selectively treat depending on the condition.” 

Medical staff who participated in the launching event also responded favorably to the transition from Infliximab IV type to ‘Ramshima SC’ and expected that ‘Ramshima SC’ would be a safe and effective treatment plan. 

Along with this, CZ, one of the largest private insurance companies in the Netherlands, decided to reimburse the entire treatment fee for ‘Ramshima SC’. CZ said that ‘Ramshima SC’ allows many patients to administer infliximab directly at home, which can be an effective treatment for patients as it minimizes hospital visits, especially in Corona19 situations. In addition, CZ’s SC formulation is usually more expensive than IV formulation, but ‘Ramshima SC’ is expected to be a good alternative to the infliximab formulation. 

An official from Celltrion Healthcare said, “The launch of ‘Ramshima SC’ is proceeding smoothly as originally planned despite the spread of Corona 19.” “The response is positive enough to request a direct purchase from a local hospital in the Netherlands in the first week, so we will do our best to help patients continue their treatment safely and effectively through” Ramshima SC. ”

32810,Fitbit Launches Heart Study to Validate its Wearable Technology for Identifying Atrial Fibrillation,Fitbit Launches Heart Study to Validate its Wearable Technology for Identifying Atrial Fibrillation,"Fitbit launched the Fitbit Heart Study, which focuses to validate the use of its wearables to detect AFib. The virtual study is open to Fitbit users aged 22yrs. + with a current Fitbit device and will enroll hundreds of thousands of people with its results supporting the Company’s regulatory submissions globally
 Fitbit’s devices use photoplethysmography technology to measure blood flow rate from a user’s wrist and those measurements can be used to identify heart rhythm, which Fitbit’s algorithm will analyze for irregularities in the study
 Participants who are notified with an irregular heart rhythm will get a free virtual appointment with a doctor and mailed with an ECG patch to confirm the notification. Additionally, With the launch of the heart study, Fitbit is giving competition to Apple which received FDA clearance in 2018 for its ECG feature and launched a study with J&J to explore whether its wearables can detect Afib","SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Fitbit (NYSE: FIT) today launched the Fitbit Heart Study, its first large-scale, virtual study to validate the use of its wearable technology to identify episodes of irregular heart rhythm suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AFib), the most common form of heart rhythm irregularity. This study is part of the Company’s broader strategy to make easy-to-use tools that accelerate detection of a range of conditions more accessible. The Fitbit Heart Study aims to enroll hundreds of thousands of people, and its results will support the Company’s regulatory submissions globally.

AFib affects nearly 33.5 million people globally1 and patients with AFib have a five times higher risk of stroke.2 3 It can also be difficult to detect, as episodes can be sporadic and asymptomatic, and some studies suggest that as many as 25 percent of people who have an AFib-related stroke only find out they have AFib after a stroke has occurred.4

“Until recently, tools for detecting AFib had a number of limitations and were only accessible if you visited a doctor,” said Steven Lubitz, M.D., M.P.H, principal investigator of the Fitbit Heart Study, cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. “My hope is that advancing research on innovative and accessible technology, like Fitbit devices, will lead to more tools that help improve health outcomes and reduce the impact of AFib on a large scale.”

Fitbit wearables have the unique potential to accelerate AFib detection because their 24/7 heart rate tracking is powered by long battery life, which allows users to wear their device for multiple days at a time. This enables long-term heart rhythm assessment, including when users are asleep. The optimal way to identify irregular rhythm through heart rate tracking technology is to screen when the body is at rest, making assessment overnight, while people sleep, ideal for detection.

“Since we first brought heart rate tracking to the wrist in 2015, we have continued to innovate and provide users with a deeper understanding of their heart health through features like Sleep Stages, Cardio Fitness Level and now Active Zone Minutes,” said Eric Friedman, Fitbit co-founder and CTO. “The Fitbit Heart Study advances our heart health efforts. Long-term passive heart rhythm assessment with our wide range of affordable devices powered by 24/7 heart rate tracking technology has the potential to improve earlier identification of AFib, which is a key to reducing the risk of a life-threatening event like stroke. By doing this important research we have the opportunity to develop and provide access to technology that may be able to improve public health and save lives.”

To track heart rate, Fitbit’s devices use photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure the rate of blood flow directly from a user’s wrist. Theoretically, these measurements can be used to determine a user’s heart rhythm, which Fitbit’s algorithm will analyze for irregularities in the Fitbit Heart Study. Study participants who receive a notification about an irregular heart rhythm will be connected with a doctor for a virtual appointment at no cost to get more information and may receive an electrocardiogram (ECG) patch in the mail at no cost to confirm the notification.

Broader commitment to heart health

The Fitbit Heart Study is part of Fitbit’s broader approach to heart health innovation, which includes industry partnerships and the development of other technologies focused on raising awareness and accelerating detection of AFib to reduce the risk of stroke and improve population health. In addition to the technology being examined in the Fitbit Heart Study, the company has made significant progress in the development of a new electrocardiogram (ECG) feature for spot detection of AFib.

Fitbit aims to provide users with both long- and short-term AFib assessment options based on their individual needs and is developing PPG and ECG tools that could offer both long-term assessment and spot-check AFib detection. The Fitbit PPG-based heart rhythm tool is designed to identify irregular rhythm episodes with no symptoms that might otherwise go undetected, and the Fitbit ECG feature is designed to support those who want to screen themselves for possible AFib and record an ECG trace they can review with their doctor. The Company has completed a pivotal clinical trial of its new ECG feature and plans to seek review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and global regulatory authorities.

Additionally, following FDA clearance for the PPG AFib algorithm, Fitbit will continue to work with the Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance to develop programs and educational content that will help identify and support people in the U.S. at increased risk for stroke to provide a continuous and supported care pathway that extends to AFib diagnosis.

How to join the Fitbit Heart Study

The study is open to people in the United States ages 22 years and older with a current Fitbit device that tracks heart rate, including Fitbit IonicTM, Fitbit VersaTM family of smart watches, Fitbit Charge 3TM, Fitbit Charge 4TM, and Fitbit Inspire HRTM. Participant data will be kept confidential and will only be shared with study partners in connection with the study. For more details on the Fitbit Heart Study or to enroll, visit the Fitbit Heart Study website. The study will support the clinical evaluation of the Company’s PPG AFib algorithm, including whether it can successfully identify episodes of irregular heart rhythm.

32837,Sorrento Collaborates with Mount Sinai Health System to Develop COVI-SHIELD Antibody Cocktail Targeting COVID-19,Sorrento And Mount Sinai Health System To Jointly Develop COVI-SHIELD Antibody Therapy Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19),"Sorrento to get access to plasma containing anti-COVID-19 Abs for identifying and produce mAbs with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. The company expects to commence the P-I study of triple Ab combination therapy in Q3’20
 The focus of the collaboration is to jointly develop Ab cocktail which will act as a protective shield against COVID-19 and potentially block the virus in naïve at-risk populations and infected individuals. The therapy is designed to be resistant to future mutations in the virus
 If approved, each dose of COVI-SHIELD will deliver a cocktail of three Abs which together would recognize three unique regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and can provide protection for up to 2mos. at a time","SAN DIEGO, May 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ –Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) and Mount Sinai Health System (“Mount Sinai”) have agreed to join forces in the investigation and development of an antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD™) to potentially treat COVID-19.

Carlos Cordon-Cardo, MD, PhD, Irene Heinz Given and John LaPorte Given Professor and Chair of Pathology, Molecular and Cell-Based Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and his team screened approximately fifteen thousand individuals who may have had and recovered from COVID-19 for the presence of anti-COVID-19 antibodies. The screening used a diagnostic test developed by Florian Krammer, PhD, Professor of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and authorized for use in Mount Sinai’s laboratory under an FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Sorrento will have access to plasma containing antibodies against COVID-19 for the purpose of identification and production of monoclonal antibodies with potential neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2.

The collaboration between Mount Sinai and Sorrento aims to generate antibody products that would act as a “protective shield” against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, potentially blocking and neutralizing the activity of the virus in naïve at-risk populations as well as recently infected individuals. It is expected that each dose of COVI-SHIELD, if approved, will deliver a cocktail of three antibodies which together would recognize three unique regions of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.

Antibody cocktail therapy establishes a high barrier to development of treatment resistance while providing a protective therapy for the population at large. If approved, it is anticipated that COVI-SHIELD will be offered for administration as a prophylactic for those returning to work and as a therapeutic to those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. COVI-SHIELD prevention and treatment is designed to be administered as often as necessary, with each dose expected to provide antiviral protection for up to two months.

“We’re working with pharma and biotech partners, such as Sorrento, to bring much needed therapies to the clinic,” said Erik Lium, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Innovation Officer of the Mount Sinai Health System. “We look forward to advancing the development of an effective antibody cocktail with Sorrento.”

“It is our belief that as we re-open the country and the economy, we will see local flare-ups of infectious spread of SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, with coronaviruses, mutations are part of the equation and could render therapies ineffective over time” stated Dr Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., before adding “It is our intention to develop a triple antibody prophylactic and therapeutic agent that would shield healthcare workers and at-risk patients. This therapy is designed to be resistant to future virus mutations and, if approved, should be made available in support of testing, tracing, vaccination and other therapeutic approaches to allow for efficient management of viral infection by protecting those most at risk for up to two months at a time”.

Sorrento is completing all IND filing requirements for the triple antibody combination therapy and expects to commence phase 1 trials of the drug candidate in the third quarter of 2020.

 The focus of the collbaortaion is to pair the sequence data with de-identified health records for aid in genomic medicine, drug discovery and personalized medicine approaches also leading to expansion of RCG’s genomics initiatives
 Additionally, the CCPM physicians will also validate any genetic findings from the RGC data enabling the return of clinically-actionable results in their CLIA-certified lab","Regeneron Genetics Center will sequence 450,000 informed and consented patients

Sequencing data will be paired with de-identified health records to aid in genomic medicine, drug discovery and personalized medicine approaches 

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine (CCPM) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus today announced a large-scale research collaboration designed to advance the field of human genetics and precision medicine through the sharing of 450,000 DNA samples and corresponding health records from de-identified, consented patient participants in the expansive UCHealth system. The Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Regeneron, has entered into the collaboration with CCPM and will sequence these samples, producing genomic data that can be used to facilitate translational medical research and ultimately enable physicians to make better decisions for their patients.

The CCPM is one of the largest health data warehouses in the United States and a pioneer in the use of a secure cloud platform with more than 8.7 million de-identified patient records. The five-year old research enterprise is also one of the first and largest programs in the country to integrate personalized genomic information with clinical data via a research biobank. CCPM physicians will validate any genetic findings from the RGC data in their CLIA-certified lab, enabling the return of clinically-actionable results to patients.

“This collaboration will take an already notable program at the CCPM and expand the depth and breadth of its capabilities, allowing us to give more back to our patient participants than ever before,” said Kathleen Barnes, Ph.D., Professor and Director of CCPM at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. “We have made tremendous strides with our work in pharmacogenomics, but having access to such a large genomic dataset that enables the return of clinically actionable results will be transformative. Our collaboration with the RGC will lead to an optimization of patient care, using personalized results to better inform clinical decision making, and potentially leading to new ways of diagnosing, preventing and treating illnesses.”

The RGC has built one of the world’s largest genetics databases, pairing the sequenced exomes and de-identified electronic health records of more than one million people, through collaborations with more than 80 global healthcare and academic institutions. Building upon Regeneron’s strengths in genetics-driven drug discovery, the information secured from this initiative will allow for the elucidation, on a large scale, of genetic factors that cause or influence a range of human diseases.

“We’re excited to collaborate with the CCPM and UCHealth to further expand the RGC’s large-scale genomics initiatives,” said Aris Baras, M.D., Senior Vice President at Regeneron and Head of the Regeneron Genetics Center. “In the search for new and improved medicines, as well as the advancement of validated and improved risk scores in medicine, both scale and quality of data matter. This partnership opens up new doors for meaningful discovery, strengthens Regeneron’s ability to speed and improve the drug development process, and allows us to work alongside other leaders in the advancement of genomic and precision medicine.”

The impressive scope of this effort is also thanks to the wide-ranging footprint of UCHealth. Large numbers of the nonprofit health care system’s patients have consented to biobank participation, more than half of whom live outside of the metro Denver area and in neighboring states like Nebraska and Wyoming.

“Our patients are already benefitting from the remarkable work of the CCPM which is allowing providers to use genomics to make more accurate diagnoses and precisely tailor treatment to individual patients,” said Richard Zane, M.D., UCHealth Chief Innovation Officer, who is also the Professor and Chair of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “This partnership will help drive the health care discoveries of tomorrow and realize the full potential of precision medicine. We so appreciate our patients who have consented to participate and without whom discovery would not be possible.”

About The RGC-Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine Research Collaboration
The RGC and CCPM will create a comprehensive, large-scale genomics database comprising approximately 450,000 fully annotated, whole exome sequences for discovery research and to support patient care at UCHealth. The goal of the partnership is to leverage de-identified genetic information from consenting patients with large sets of corresponding medical data that will ultimately build a warehouse of information useful for the discovery of genetic factors that could inform clinical care. For the newly-established CCPM, this enterprise will exponentially expand biobank research capabilities.

32854,Eli Lilly's Retevmo (selpercatinib) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the First Therapy to Treat Advanced RET-Driven Lung and Thyroid Cancers,"Lilly Receives U.S. FDA Approval for Retevmo (selpercatinib), the First Therapy Specifically for Patients with Advanced RET-Driven Lung and Thyroid Cancers","Approval is based on LIBRETTO-001 P-I/II study, which is assessing Retevmo (selpercatinib, 40 mg & 80 mg capsules) in 702 patients with both treatment-naive and heavily pre-treated solid tumour patients (incl. RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET-mutant MTC, RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer, and other solid tumors with RET alterations)
 The P-I/II study results (treatment naïve; treatment experienced): RET Fusion-Positive NSCLC (N=39; 105), ORR (85%; 64%), mDOR (NR vs 17.5 mos.); RET-mutant MTC (N=88; 55) ORR (73%; 69%), mDOR (22 mos.; NR), RET Fusion-Positive Thyroid Cancers (N= 8, 19), ORR (100%; 79%), mDOR (NR; 7.6 mos.)
 Retevmo (formerly LOXO-292) is an oral selective RET kinase inhibitor (120/160mg by -/+50kg weight) BID, and has also received the FDA ODD for RET fusion +ve NSCLC, RET fusion +ve & RET-mutant thyroid cancers, undifferentiated or anaplastic thyroid cancer, MTC aand LA or metastatic follicular or papillary thyroid cancer","Approved for metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC, advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC and advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer– Accelerated approval based on data from LIBRETTO-001 Phase 1/2, largest trial ever reported in patients with RET-driven cancers– Registrational data demonstrated durable objective responses and showed high intracranial response rate in patients with NSCLC that has spread to the brain

INDIANAPOLIS, May 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Retevmo™ (selpercatinib, 40 mg & 80 mg capsules), the first therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy, or advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate). Retevmo was approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval regulations based on the LIBRETTO-001 Phase 1/2 trial’s endpoints of objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Retevmo is a selective RET kinase inhibitor. Retevmo may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells, which can result in side effects. Retevmo is an oral prescription medicine, 120 mg or 160 mg based on weight, taken twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1

“In the clinical trial, we observed that the majority of metastatic lung cancer patients experienced clinically meaningful responses when treated with selpercatinib, including responses in difficult-to-treat brain metastases,” said Alexander Drilon, M.D., acting chief of early drug development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and lead investigator for LIBRETTO-001. “The approval of selpercatinib marks an important milestone in the treatment of NSCLC, making RET-driven cancers now specifically targetable in the same manner as cancers with activating EGFR and ALK alterations, across all lines of therapy. I am pleased that patients with these RET-driven cancers have this newly approved option.”

Retevmo was evaluated in the single-arm, multi-center Phase 1/2 LIBRETTO-001 trial, the largest trial (N=702) of patients with RET-driven cancers. The trial enrolled both treatment-naive patients and heavily pretreated patients with a variety of advanced solid tumors including RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET-mutant MTC, RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer, and certain other solid tumors with RET alterations. Major efficacy outcomes were ORR and DoR, assessed by a blinded independent review committee. Prespecified secondary endpoints included central nervous system (CNS) ORR and CNS DoR.

Thyroid cancers include: papillary, Hurthle cell, anaplastic, and poorly differentiated
Up to 50 percent of patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLCs can have tumors that metastasize to the brain.2 Among previously treated NSCLC patients with measurable brain metastases, 10 out of 11 patients observed intracranial responses (CNS ORR), with all 10 patients experiencing a CNS DoR of greater than or equal to six months.

The labeling for Retevmo contains warnings and precautions for hepatotoxicity (evidence of liver dysfunction), hypertension, QT interval prolongation, hemorrhagic events, hypersensitivity, risk of impaired wound healing, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

In the LIBRETTO-001 trial, there was a five percent discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions (ARs). The most common ARs, including laboratory abnormalities, (≥25 percent) were increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased glucose, decreased leukocytes, decreased albumin, decreased calcium, dry mouth, diarrhea, increased creatinine, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypertension, fatigue, edema (swelling in the arms or legs), decreased platelets, increased total cholesterol, rash, decreased sodium, and constipation. In addition, the most frequent serious AR (≥ 2 percent) was pneumonia.

See Important Safety Information below and full Prescribing Information for additional information, including dosing modifications.

“RET alterations account for the majority of medullary thyroid cancers and a meaningful percentage of other thyroid cancers. For patients living with these cancers, the approval of selpercatinib means they now have a treatment option that selectively and potently inhibits RET,” said Lori J. Wirth, M.D., medical director of head and neck cancers, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. “Based on the published data for this new medicine, as well as my personal experience treating patients, this may be a good treatment option.”

“We are extremely proud of how quickly the combined Loxo Oncology and Lilly Oncology teams brought Retevmo to patients, further demonstrating our commitment to delivering life-changing medicines to people living with cancer,” said Anne White, president of Lilly Oncology. “Retevmo entered clinical trials in May of 2017 and is now approved less than three years later, representing the most rapid timeline in the development of an oncology medicine with multiple indications. We applaud the FDA for their leadership and collaboration, recognizing the importance of bringing a new therapy to patients with advanced or metastatic RET-driven lung and thyroid cancers.”

Retevmo should only be used in advanced or metastatic patients whose tumors have a RET fusion in NSCLC or thyroid cancer or a RET mutation in MTC. This can be determined through biomarker testing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), either with tumor tissue biopsy or liquid biopsy, can be an appropriate biomarker test to determine actionable genomic alterations, including RET. If NGS is not available, RET can be detected using other biomarker testing methods. An FDA-approved test for the detection of RET fusions and RET mutations is not currently available. In LIBRETTO-001, identification of a RET gene alteration was prospectively determined in plasma or tumor tissue by local laboratories using NGS, PCR, or FISH. Immunohistochemistry was not used in the clinical trial.

“Increasingly, through the use of comprehensive biomarker testing, patients with metastatic cancer have an opportunity to receive a treatment tailored to the specific genomic nature of their tumor,” said Andrea Ferris, president and chief executive officer at LUNGevity. “Retevmo represents an important new advance in this growing field, as the first therapy approved specifically for patients with RET-driven tumors. We urge patients to ask their doctors about broad biomarker tests that include RET alterations.”

Retevmo was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of RET fusion-positive NSCLC and for the treatment of RET fusion-positive and RET-mutant thyroid cancers including poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, undifferentiated or anaplastic thyroid cancer, MTC and locally advanced or metastatic follicular or papillary thyroid cancer. The two confirmatory Phase 3 trials (LIBRETTO-431 and LIBRETTO-531) are currently enrolling patients.

Retevmo is expected to be available from specialty pharmacies within one week.

About Retevmo™ (selpercatinib)

Retevmo (selpercatinib, formerly known as LOXO-292) (pronounced reh-TEHV-moh) is a selective and potent RET kinase inhibitor. Retevmo may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells, which can result in side effects. Retevmo is an oral prescription medicine, 120 mg or 160 mg dependent on weight (-/+ 50 kg), taken twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.3

About RET-Driven Cancers
Genomic alterations in the RET kinase, which include fusions and activating point mutations, lead to overactive RET signaling and uncontrolled cell growth. RET fusions have been identified in approximately 2 percent of NSCLC; and 10-20 percent of papillary, Hurthle cell, anaplastic, and poorly differentiated thyroid cancers. Activating RET point mutations account for approximately 60 percent of sporadic MTC and approximately 90 percent of germline MTC. RET fusion-positive cancers and RET-mutant MTC are primarily dependent on this single activated kinase for their proliferation and survival. This dependency, often referred to as “oncogene addiction,” renders such tumors highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors targeting RET. RET-driver alterations are predominantly mutually exclusive from other oncogenic drivers.

About LIBRETTO-001
The LIBRETTO-001 Phase 1/2 trial was the largest clinical trial of patients with RET-driven cancers treated with a RET inhibitor. The trial included a dose escalation phase (Phase 1) and a dose expansion phase (Phase 2). The Phase 2 portion of the trial had major efficacy outcomes of ORR and DoR, and prespecified secondary endpoints of CNS ORR and CNS DoR, as determined by an independent review committee according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Results from the NSCLC population were last presented at the 2019 IASLC World Congress on Lung Cancer (WCLC), while results from the thyroid populations were last presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 Congress. 

Important Safety Information for Retevmo™ (selpercatinib)

Hepatotoxicity: Serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with Retevmo. Increased AST occurred in 51% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 events in 8% and increased ALT occurred in 45% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 events in 9%. The median time to first onset for increased AST was 4.1 weeks (range: 5 days to 2 years) and increased ALT was 4.1 weeks (range: 6 days to 1.5 years). Monitor ALT and AST prior to initiating Retevmo, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue Retevmo based on the severity.

Hypertension occurred in 35% of patients, including Grade 3 hypertension in 17% and Grade 4 in one (0.1%) patient. Overall, 4.6% had their dose interrupted and 1.3% had their dose reduced for hypertension. Treatment-emergent hypertension was most commonly managed with anti-hypertension medications. Do not initiate Retevmo in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating Retevmo. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, at least monthly thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue Retevmo based on the severity.

Retevmo can cause concentration-dependent QT interval prolongation. An increase in QTcF interval to >500 ms was measured in 6% of patients and an increase in the QTcF interval of at least 60 ms over baseline was measured in 15% of patients. Retevmo has not been studied in patients with clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or recent myocardial infarction. Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, and severe or uncontrolled heart failure. Assess QT interval, electrolytes and TSH at baseline and periodically during treatment, adjusting frequency based upon risk factors including diarrhea. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Retevmo and during treatment. Monitor the QT interval more frequently when Retevmo is concomitantly administered with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors or drugs known to prolong QTc interval. Withhold and dose reduce or permanently discontinue Retevmo based on the severity.

Serious, including fatal, hemorrhagic events can occur with Retevmo. Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhagic events occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Retevmo including 3 (0.4%) patients with fatal hemorrhagic events, including one case each of cerebral hemorrhage, tracheostomy site hemorrhage, and hemoptysis. Permanently discontinue Retevmo in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage.

Hypersensitivity occurred in 4.3% of patients receiving Retevmo, including Grade 3 hypersensitivity in 1.6%. The median time to onset was 1.7 weeks (range 6 days to 1.5 years). Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity included fever, rash and arthralgias or myalgias with concurrent decreased platelets or transaminitis. If hypersensitivity occurs, withhold Retevmo and begin corticosteroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Upon resolution of the event, resume Retevmo at a reduced dose and increase the dose of Retevmo by 1 dose level each week as tolerated until reaching the dose taken prior to onset of hypersensitivity. Continue steroids until patient reaches target dose and then taper. Permanently discontinue Retevmo for recurrent hypersensitivity.

Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, Retevmo has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold Retevmo for at least 7 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of Retevmo after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.

Based on data from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, Retevmo can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of selpercatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis at maternal exposures that were approximately equal to those observed at the recommended human dose of 160 mg twice daily resulted in embryolethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Retevmo and for at least 1 week after the final dose. There are no data on the presence of selpercatinib or its metabolites in human milk or on their effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Retevmo and for 1 week after the final dose.

Severe adverse reactions (Grade 3-4) occurring in ≥15% of patients who received Retevmo in LIBRETTO-001, were hypertension (18%), prolonged QT interval (4%), diarrhea (3.4%), dyspnea (2.3%), fatigue (2%), abdominal pain (1.9%), hemorrhage (1.9%), headache (1.4%), rash (0.7%), constipation (0.6%), nausea (0.6%), vomiting (0.3%), and edema (0.3%).

Common adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in ≥15% of patients who received Retevmo in LIBRETTO-001, were dry mouth (39%), diarrhea (37%), hypertension (35%), fatigue (35%), edema (33%), rash (27%), constipation (25%), nausea (23%), abdominal pain (23%), headache (23%), cough (18%), prolonged QT interval (17%), dyspnea (16%), vomiting (15%), and hemorrhage (15%).

Laboratory abnormalities (all grades; Grade 3-4) ≥20% worsening from baseline in patients who received Retevmo in LIBRETTO-001, were AST increased (51%; 8%), ALT increased (45%; 9%), increased glucose (44%; 2.2%), decreased leukocytes (43%; 1.6%), decreased albumin (42%; 0.7%), decreased calcium (41%; 3.8%), increased creatinine (37%; 1.0%), increased alkaline phosphatase (36%; 2.3%), decreased platelets (33%; 2.7%), increased total cholesterol (31%; 0.1%), decreased sodium (27%; 7%), decreased magnesium (24%; 0.6%), increased potassium (24%; 1.2%), increased bilirubin (23%; 2.0%), and decreased glucose (22%; 0.7%).

Concomitant use of acid-reducing agents decrease selpercatinib plasma concentrations which may reduce Retevmo anti-tumor activity. Avoid concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists, and locally-acting antacids with Retevmo. If coadministration cannot be avoided, take Retevmo with food (with a PPI) or modify its administration time (with a H2 receptor antagonist or a locally-acting antacid).

Concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors increase selpercatinib plasma concentrations which may increase the risk of Retevmo adverse reactions including QTc interval prolongation. Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors with Retevmo. If concomitant use of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the Retevmo dosage as recommended and monitor the QT interval with ECGs more frequently.

Concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers decrease selpercatinib plasma concentrations which may reduce Retevmo anti-tumor activity. Avoid coadministration of Retevmo with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers.

Concomitant use of Retevmo with CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates increase their plasma concentrations which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Avoid coadministration of Retevmo with CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to increased adverse reactions. If coadministration cannot be avoided, follow recommendations for CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates provided in their approved product labeling.

The safety and effectiveness of Retevmo have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of Retevmo have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy and for advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate). Use of Retevmo for these indications is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.

No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥30 mL/Min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). A recommended dosage has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.

Reduce the dose when administering Retevmo to patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than 3 to 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST). No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor for Retevmo-related adverse reactions in patients with hepatic impairment.

IKEMA trial results released early based on recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee
Addition of Sarclisa significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death compared to carfilzomib and dexamethasone alone
Results will be submitted to an upcoming medical meeting and form the basis for regulatory submissions later this year
PARIS – May 12, 2020 – The Phase 3 IKEMA clinical trial evaluating Sarclisa® (isatuximab) added to carfilzomib and dexamethasone met the primary endpoint at its first planned interim analysis, demonstrating significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared to standard of care carfilzomib and dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. There were no new safety signals identified in this study.

“When Sarclisa was added to standard-of-care treatment carfilzomib and dexamethasone in this phase 3 trial, results clearly demonstrated a significant reduction in risk of disease progression or death,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “This is the second positive phase 3 trial for Sarclisa, further supporting the potential our medicine has to improve outcomes for patients struggling with relapsed multiple myeloma.”

Results will be submitted to an upcoming medical meeting and are anticipated to form the basis of regulatory submissions planned for later this year.

About the Trial

The randomized, multi-center, open label Phase 3 IKEMA clinical trial enrolled 302 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma across 69 centers spanning 16 countries. All study participants received one to three prior anti-myeloma therapies. During the trial, Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks, then every other week for 28-day cycles in combination with carfilzomib twice weekly at the 20/56mg/m2 dose and dexamethasone at the standard dose for the duration of treatment. The primary endpoint of IKEMA is progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, the rate of very good partial response or greater, minimal residual disease, complete response rate, overall survival and safety.

The use of Sarclisa in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in relapsed multiple myeloma is investigational and has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About Sarclisa

Sarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma cells. It is designed to work through many mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells, making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa.

Sarclisa is approved in the U.S. in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. In the U.S., the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Sarclisa has also received positive CHMP opinion in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. A final decision on the Marketing Authorisation Application for Sarclisa in the E.U. is expected in the coming months. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of the U.S., Switzerland, Canada and Australia.

Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments for people with multiple myeloma. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other blood cancer types (hematologic malignancies) and solid tumors.

For more information on Sarclisa clinical trials please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.

About Multiple Myeloma

Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy, with more than 138,000 new diagnoses of multiple myeloma worldwide yearly. Despite available treatments, multiple myeloma remains an incurable malignancy, and is associated with significant patient burden. Since multiple myeloma does not have a cure, most patients will relapse. Relapsed multiple myeloma is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory multiple myeloma refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.

About CapsidMap™ for Designing AAV Gene Therapies

By designing capsids that confer improved functional properties to Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors, Dyno’s proprietary CapsidMap™ platform overcomes the limitations of today’s gene therapies on the market and in development. Today’s treatments are primarily confined to a small number of naturally occurring AAV vectors that are limited by delivery, immunity, packaging size, and manufacturing challenges. CapsidMap uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology for the design of novel capsids, the cell-targeting protein shell of viral vectors. The CapsidMap platform applies leading-edge DNA library synthesis and next generation DNA sequencing to measure in vivo gene delivery properties in high throughput. At the core of CapsidMap are advanced search algorithms leveraging machine learning and Dyno’s massive quantities of experimental data, that together build a comprehensive map of sequence space and thereby accelerate the discovery and optimization of synthetic AAV capsids.

Dyno’s technology platform builds on certain intellectual property developed in the lab of George Church, Ph.D., who is Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School (HMS), a Core Faculty member at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, and a co-founder of Dyno. Several of the technical breakthroughs that enabled Dyno’s approach to optimize synthetic AAV capsid engineering were described in a November 2019 publication in the journal Science, based on work conducted by Dyno founders and members of the Church Lab at HMS and the Wyss Institute. Dyno has an exclusive option to enter into a license agreement with Harvard University for this technology.

May 12, 2020 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for the Company’s mRNA vaccine candidate (mRNA-1273) against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

Moderna receives FDA fast track designation for mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) against novel coronavirus

Tweet this

“Fast Track designation underscores the urgent need for a vaccine against the novel coronavirus,” said Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Moderna. “As we await the full set of clinical data from the NIAID-led Phase 1 study, we are actively preparing for our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies to continue learning about the potential of mRNA-1273 to protect against SARS-CoV-2.”

Fast Track is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapies and vaccines for serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Programs with Fast Track designation may benefit from early and frequent communication with the FDA, in addition to a rolling submission of the marketing application. The Company previously received Fast Track designation for its investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893) and its methylmalonic acidemia (MMA; mRNA-3704) and propionic acidemia (PA; mRNA-3927) programs.

On May 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed its review of the Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for mRNA-1273 allowing it to proceed to a Phase 2 study, which is expected to begin shortly. Moderna is finalizing the protocol for a Phase 3 study, expected to begin in early summer of 2020. Funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), supported the planning for these studies and will also support the late-stage clinical development programs, as well as the scale-up of mRNA-1273 manufacturing both at the Company’s facilities and that of its strategic collaborator, Lonza Ltd.

About the Phase 2 Study

Moderna has received initial feedback from the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 2 study, which will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. The Company intends to enroll 600 healthy participants across two cohorts of adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300). Each participant will be assigned to receive placebo, a 50 μg or a 250 μg dose at both vaccinations. Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by CEPI, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing. A summary of the company’s work to date on SARS-CoV-2 can be found here.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,400 participants have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has nine development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)
RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)
Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)
Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for seven prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV and Zika). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

For Holders of Contingent Value Rights (CVR), Ticker BMY-RT

U.S. FDA approval of ide-cel by March 31, 2021 is one of the required remaining milestones of the Contingent Value Rights issued upon the close of the Celgene acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2019. The other is U.S. FDA approval of liso-cel by December 31, 2020. The company is committed to working with FDA to progress both applications and achieve the remaining regulatory milestones required by the CVR.

About Ide-cel

Ide-cel is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy. The ide-cel CAR is comprised of a murine extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) specific for recognizing BCMA, attached to a human CD8 α hinge and transmembrane domain fused to the T cell cytoplasmic signaling domains of CD137 4-1BB and CD3-ζ chain, in tandem. Ide-cel recognizes and binds to BCMA on the surface of multiple myeloma cells leading to CAR T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells.

In addition to the pivotal KarMMa trial evaluating ide-cel in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio’s broad clinical development program for ide-cel includes clinical studies (KarMMa-2, KarMMa-3, KarMMa-4) in earlier lines of treatment for patients with multiple myeloma, including newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. For more information visit clinicaltrials.gov.

Ide-cel was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA and PRIority Medicines (PRIME) designation, as well as Accelerated Assessment status, by the European Medicines Agency for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

Ide-cel is being developed as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio.

*Sutimlimab targets C1-activated hemolysis in cold agglutinin disease (CAD)

PARIS – May 14, 2020 – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review of Sanofi’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for sutimlimab for the treatment of hemolysis in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Sutimlimab, an investigational monoclonal antibody, targets the underlying cause of hemolysis in CAD by selectively inhibiting complement C1s.

If approved, sutimlimab would be the first and only approved treatment for these patients. The target action date for the FDA decision is November 13, 2020.

CAD is a chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia that causes the body’s immune system to mistakenly attack healthy red blood cells and cause their rupture (hemolysis). CAD patients may experience chronic anemia, profound fatigue, acute hemolytic crisis, and other potential complications, including an increased risk of thromboembolic events and early death.1,2,3 An estimated 5,000 people in the U.S. live with CAD.

“People living with cold agglutinin disease currently have no approved treatment option and experience chronic anemia and profound fatigue, which have a persistent and serious impact on their lives,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “Results from our 26-week pivotal Phase 3 study clearly demonstrated that sutimlimab had a clinically meaningful effect on complement-mediated hemolysis, which is the cause of anemia and fatigue. If approved, sutimlimab will be the first and only FDA-approved treatment to uniquely address C1-activated hemolysis and help alleviate the chronic disease burden for people with CAD.”

The BLA submission is based on results from part A (n=24) of the open label, single arm pivotal Phase 3 CARDINAL study in patients with primary CAD. The data were presented in the Late-Breaking Abstracts Session at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology and demonstrated sutimlimab met its primary composite efficacy endpoint defined as the proportion of patients who demonstrated an increase from baseline in Hgb level ≥2 g/dL or normalization of Hgb level ≥12 g/dL at the treatment assessment time point (mean value from weeks 23, 25, and 26) and no blood transfusion from week 5 through week 26. The trial showed sutimlimab also met its secondary endpoints by indicating improvements in disease process, including improvements in hemoglobin, normalization of bilirubin, and improvements in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Score.

Targeting C1s in the classical complement pathway
Sutimlimab is designed to selectively target and inhibit C1s in the classical complement pathway, which is part of the innate immune system. By blocking C1s, it is thought that sutimlimab halts C1-activated hemolysis in CAD. The inhibition of the classical pathway at C1s aims to retain immune surveillance functional activities of the alternative or lectin complement pathways.

Sanofi is evaluating sutimlimab in the on-going Phase 3 CADENZA trial for CAD patients who have not recently had a blood transfusion and separately, investigating sutimlimab for patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Sutimlimab has been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designation by the FDA. Sutimlimab is currently under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About Optune

Optune is a noninvasive, antimitotic cancer treatment for GBM. Optune delivers Tumor Treating Fields to the region of the tumor.

Tumor Treating Fields is a cancer therapy that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division. Tumor Treating Fields does not stimulate or heat tissue and targets dividing cancer cells of a specific size. Tumor Treating Fields causes minimal damage to healthy cells. Mild to moderate skin irritation is the most common side effect reported. Tumor Treating Fields is approved in certain countries for the treatment of adults with GBM and in the U.S. for MPM, two of the most difficult cancer types to treat. The therapy shows promise in multiple solid tumor types – including some of the most aggressive forms of cancer.

Approved Indications (U.S.)

Optune is intended as a treatment for adult patients (22 years of age or older) with histologically-confirmed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Optune with temozolomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed, supratentorial glioblastoma following maximal debulking surgery, and completion of radiation therapy together with concomitant standard of care chemotherapy.

For the treatment of recurrent GBM, Optune is indicated following histologically- or radiologically-confirmed recurrence in the supratentorial region of the brain after receiving chemotherapy. The device is intended to be used as a monotherapy, and is intended as an alternative to standard medical therapy for GBM after surgical and radiation options have been exhausted.

Important Safety Information

Contraindications

Do not use Optune in patients with GBM with an implanted medical device, a skull defect (such as, missing bone with no replacement), or bullet fragments. Use of Optune together with skull defects or bullet fragments has not been tested and may possibly lead to tissue damage or render Optune ineffective.

Use of Optune for GBM together with implanted electronic devices has not been tested and may lead to malfunctioning of the implanted device.

Do not use Optune for GBM in patients known to be sensitive to conductive hydrogels. Skin contact with the gel used with Optune may commonly cause increased redness and itching, and may rarely lead to severe allergic reactions such as shock and respiratory failure.

Warnings and Precautions

Optune can only be prescribed by a healthcare provider that has completed the required certification training provided by Novocure®.

The most common (≥10%) adverse events involving Optune in combination with chemotherapy in patients with GBM were thrombocytopenia, nausea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, convulsions, and depression.

The most common (≥10%) adverse events related to Optune treatment alone in patients with GBM were medical device site reaction and headache. Other less common adverse reactions were malaise, muscle twitching, and falls related to carrying the device.

If the patient has an underlying serious skin condition on the treated area, evaluate whether this may prevent or temporarily interfere with Optune treatment.

Do not prescribe Optune for patients that are pregnant, you think might be pregnant or are trying to get pregnant, as the safety and effectiveness of Optune in these populations have not been established.

 Tiragolumab is a mAb targeting TIGIT, acts by blocking its interaction with PVR, or CD155 that can suppress the body’s immune response","Phase II CITYSCAPE trial shows promising results adding tiragolumab to Tecentriq in people with PD-L1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
Full results will be presented in an oral abstract session at the ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program organised by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)

Basel, 14 May 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced positive results from the Phase II CITYSCAPE trial, the first randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tiragolumab plus Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) compared with Tecentriq alone as an initial (first-line) treatment for people with PD-L1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tiragolumab is a novel cancer immunotherapy designed to bind to TIGIT, an immune checkpoint protein expressed on immune cells. Both TIGIT and PD-L1 play an important role in immune suppression, and blocking both pathways could enhance anti-tumour activity. The full results will be presented in an oral abstract session (Abstract #9503) at the ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program organised by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which will be held 29-31 May 2020.

“We are pleased to share these first randomised anti-TIGIT results, showing that tiragolumab, our novel cancer immunotherapy, has encouraging efficacy and safety in combination with Tecentriq,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “TIGIT, an immune checkpoint protein expressed on immune cells, was identified by our own scientists. By blocking both TIGIT and PD-L1 pathways simultaneously, we hope to deepen patient responses to immunotherapy and widen the circle of people who may benefit.”

At the primary analysis, tiragolumab plus Tecentriq met both co-primary endpoints in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, showing an improvement in the objective response rate (ORR) (31.3% vs 16.2%) and a 43% reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival; PFS) (median PFS= 5.4 vs 3.6 months; hazard ratio (HR)=0.57, 95% CI: 0.37–0.90) compared with Tecentriq alone.

An exploratory analysis in people with high levels of PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%) showed a clinically meaningful improvement in ORR (55.2% vs 17.2%) and a 67% reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death (median PFS=not reached vs 3.9 months; HR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.15–0.72) with the combination compared with Tecentriq alone.1

The data suggest that the combination of tiragolumab plus Tecentriq was well-tolerated, showing similar rates of all Grade 3 or more all-cause adverse events (AEs) when combining the two immunotherapies compared with Tecentriq alone (41.8% vs 44.1%).

At a six-month follow-up, the improvement in the ORR and PFS in the tiragolumab plus Tecentriq arm persisted in both the ITT and the PD-L1-high populations, and no new safety signals were observed.
As part of Roche’s commitment to explore new immunotherapy options and combinations, the company recently initiated two Phase III clinical trials evaluating tiragolumab plus Tecentriq for people with certain types of lung cancer (SKYSCRAPER-01 and SKYSCRAPER-02). Tiragolumab is also being evaluated in other solid tumours as well as in hematological cancers. Additional Phase 1a/b results in solid tumours will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.

About CITYSCAPE study 1
CITYSCAPE is a global Phase II, randomised and blinded study evaluating tiragolumab plus Tecentriq compared with Tecentriq alone in 135 patients with first-line PD-L1-positive, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either tiragolumab plus Tecentriq or placebo plus Tecentriq, until progressive disease or loss of clinical benefit. Co-primary endpoints are ORR and PFS. Secondary endpoints include safety and overall survival.

About tiragolumab and TIGIT 5
Tiragolumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with TIGIT, a protein receptor on immune cells 2 3. By binding to TIGIT, tiragolumab blocks its interaction with a protein called poliovirus receptor (PVR, or CD155) that can suppress the body’s immune response 4. Blockade of TIGIT and PD-L1 may synergistically enable the re-activation of T-cells and enhance NK cell anti-tumour activity 2 6 7.

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.

Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

(“Innovent”) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high-quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune, metabolic and other major diseases, today jointly announced with Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) that the Phase 2 TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) ORIENT-2 study in China met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS).

The randomized study, which evaluated TYVYT monotherapy compared to chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan) as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS. The safety profile of TYVYT is consistent with previously reported TYVYT study results, and no new safety signals were identified. The detailed results will be reported in an ASCO 2020 poster discussion session (No. 4511).

Innovent and Lilly plan to discuss these results with the Drug Evaluation Center (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China.

The principal investigator of the ORIENT-2 study, Professor Jianming Xu from the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, stated: “The incidence of ESCC in Asian countries is much higher than that in Western countries. The current standard of treatment is still based on traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Traditional chemotherapy drugs have shown a very limited effect on the second-line treatment of patients with advanced ESCC. Over the past 10 years, immunotherapy has made tremendous progress in multiple tumor types, but the drug development advancements in treating ESCC has been slower and there remains a huge unmet medical need. The ORIENT-2 study confirmed that TYVYT can prolong overall survival in the second-line treatment of people with ESCC. We have seen that sintilimab is more efficacious than chemotherapy and we are hopeful that TYVYT has the potential to be a new treatment option for these patients.”

Dr. Hui Zhou, Vice President and Head of Oncology Strategy and Medical Sciences of Innovent, stated: “TYVYT was approved by the NMPA in 2018 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after second-line or later systemic chemotherapy. We currently have more than 20 clinical studies ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of TYVYT in other types of tumors. The results of the ORIENT-2 study demonstrate the potential of TYVYT to treat patients with advanced ESCC in the second-line setting. We are also conducting a Phase 3 trial to evaluate TYVYT combined with chemotherapy (paclitaxel and cisplatin) as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic ESCC. We hope these clinical trials can provide more effective treatment options for clinicians and benefit more ESCC patients.”

“From Hodgkin’s lymphoma, lung cancer to esophageal cancer, we are glad to see that TYVYT’s clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in multiple tumor types,” said Dr. Li Wang, Senior Vice President of Lilly China and Head of Lilly China Drug Development and Medical Affairs Center. “We are thankful to the patients and their families, investigators and clinical trial sites participating in the ORIENT-2 study, and to our colleagues from Innovent. We would not have seen these encouraging results without their efforts. We look forward to working to bring TYVT as a new treatment option to people with ESCC in China.”

About the ORIENT-2 Study

ORIENT-2 is a randomized, open-label, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TYVYT with paclitaxel or irinotecan in patients with advanced or metastatic ESCC who failed first-line treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03116152). The primary endpoint was OS.

A total of 190 subjects were enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive TYVYT or the investigator’s choice of paclitaxel or irinotecan, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or other reasons stated in the protocol, whichever occurs first.

About advanced ESCC

The incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer in China rank third and fourth, respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 90 percent of all esophageal cancer cases. A considerable proportion of patients with early-stage ESCC will develop recurrence or metastatic disease following resection surgery. Currently, the standard treatment for ESCC is limited to traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. There are few treatment options and no targeted therapies for ESCC, resulting in a large unmet clinical need.

About TYVYT® (Sintilimab Injection)

TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), an innovative drug developed with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Lilly in China, has been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after second-line or later systemic chemotherapy, and included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies. TYVYT is the only PD-1 inhibitor that has been included in the new Catalogue of the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), in November 2019. In April 2020, the NMPA accepted the supplemental new drug application for TYVYT in combination with ALIMTA® (pemetrexed) and platinum as first-line therapy in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In May 2020, TYVYT combined with Gemzar® (gemcitabine for injection) and platinum chemotherapy met the predefined primary endpoint in the Phase 3 ORIENT-12 study as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC.

TYVYT is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1/ PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells. Innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies with TYVYT to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications, including more than 10 registration or pivotal clinical trials.

These new programs targeting the tumor microenvironment are the latest in a series of strategic acquisitions and collaborations that strengthen Boehringer Ingelheim’s position in cancer immunology, with leading assets and robust capabilities in cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, T-cell engagers and myeloid cell modulators 
Acquisition of Versant-built company based in Toronto’s MaRS Discovery District
Ingelheim, Germany and Toronto, Canada – 14 May 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the acquisition of Northern Biologics Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Northern LP. By acquiring this entity, which focuses on therapeutic antibodies targeting the tumor microenvironment, Boehringer Ingelheim is now positioned at the forefront of the stromal biology space – an emerging area in cancer immunology. The seller will retain the Northern Biologics name and will continue to drive certain preclinical efforts on one of the programs, while Boehringer Ingelheim will be responsible for clinical, regulatory and commercial development of the acquired programs.

The total transaction includes an upfront payment, milestones and other consideration payments.

The first program, now in late preclinical development, is an antibody inhibitor of Periostin, a secreted matricellular protein overexpressed in the immunosuppressive stroma microenvironment of many solid tumor types. Targeting these stromal cells can help turn previously ‘cold’ tumors – non-reactive, immunologically inactive tumors – to ‘hot’ tumors – those that are susceptible or accessible to host immune system attack. The antibody program targeting Periostin has emerged as a promising therapy to overcome stromal mechanisms of immune exclusion and suppression.

The second program targets a key regulator of myeloid cells that is important for enhancing anti-tumor T-cell function. Targeting myeloid cells is a focus area of research and clinical development for Boehringer Ingelheim and the acquired program offers combination opportunities across Boehringer Ingelheim’s portfolio.

“This acquisition provides Boehringer Ingelheim with two complementary assets to our existing cancer immunology portfolio and supports our strategy to target ‘cold’ tumors with synergistic combination approaches,” said Jonathon Sedgwick, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Global Head, Cancer Immunology & Immune Modulation Research, Boehringer Ingelheim. “Driving innovation in tumor stroma and myeloid cell biology is yet another example of how we are ‘Taking Cancer On’ by exploring first-in-class approaches to provide the best treatment options for cancer patients.”

“We are gratified by this transaction with Boehringer Ingelheim, which simultaneously accelerates these promising assets into the clinic,” said Philip Vickers, Ph.D., President and CEO of Northern Biologics. “I am proud of the Northern R&D team, which discovered and advanced these compounds in the emerging field of tumor stroma and myeloid cell biology.”

Founding investor Versant Ventures established Northern Biologics in Toronto’s MaRS Discovery District in collaboration with the University of Toronto and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in 2014. The programs acquired by Boehringer Ingelheim were discovered and translated into clinical candidates by Northern’s Toronto-based research team. Northern Biologics retains rights to its lead asset, MSC-1, an anti-LIF 1 antibody that recently successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials.

The Northern Biologics-Boehringer Ingelheim acquisition represents the second recent transaction for a Versant-built company operating out of the MaRS discovery district in Toronto. It follows the August 2019 acquisition of BlueRock Therapeutics, which also drew on technology locally developed by Canadian scientists.

This acquisition positions Boehringer Ingelheim as a leader in the field of stromal targeting biology and, along with a series of strategic acquisitions and collaborations over the past two years, further strengthens the company’s broad and diverse oncology pipeline. By combining its world-class, in-house research and development with that of highly innovative biotechnology companies, Boehringer Ingelheim is developing innovative cancer immunology therapies and accelerating the delivery of the next generation of cancer treatments.

BOTHELL, Wash.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval to TUKYSA™ (tucatinib) tablets in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for adult patients with advanced unresectable (cannot be surgically removed) or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases (disease that has spread to the brain), who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. The FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review for TUKYSA and reviewed this application for approval under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program. The TUKYSA New Drug Application (NDA) is also part of Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international health authorities. TUKYSA is an oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of HER2, a protein that contributes to cancer cell growth.1,2

“With highly significant and clinically important results for overall and progression-free survival, the addition of TUKYSA to trastuzumab and capecitabine has the potential to become a standard of care for people with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after having received one or more previous anti-HER2 therapies in the metastatic setting,” said Eric P. Winer, MD, Chief of the Division of Breast Oncology, Susan F. Smith Center for Women’s Cancers at Dana-Farber. “Cancer spreads to the brain in up to half of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer; and this approval is based on a unique clinical trial that included patients with active brain metastases, either untreated or progressing. TUKYSA is well tolerated by patients and is a valuable addition to the agents we have for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.”

“We’re pleased to have collaborated with the FDA on our second expedited real-time oncology review, enabling us to rapidly bring this new targeted medicine to patients,” said Clay Siegall, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Seattle Genetics. “TUKYSA has shown impressive results in people with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, including in patients with active brain metastases, and offers patients an effective medicine following previous treatment with other anti-HER2 agents in the metastatic setting.”

TUKYSA, in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine, was evaluated in the trial HER2CLIMB, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 612 patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had previously received, either separately or in combination, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Forty-eight percent of patients in the study had a presence or history of brain metastases. The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the first 480 randomized patients.1 Additional efficacy outcome measures were evaluated in all randomized patients and included overall survival (OS), PFS in patients with a history or presence of brain metastases, and confirmed objective response rate (ORR).

Patients who received TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine had a 46 percent reduction in the risk of cancer progression or death (PFS) compared to patients who received trastuzumab and capecitabine alone (hazard ratio (HR)=0.54 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.42, 0.71]; p<0.00001). The addition of TUKYSA reduced the risk of death (OS) by 34 percent compared to trastuzumab and capecitabine alone (HR=0.66 [95% CI: 0.50, 0.87]; p=0.0048). Nearly twice the number of patients who received TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine had a confirmed objective response compared to those who received trastuzumab and capecitabine alone (40.6 percent (95% CI: 35.3, 46.0) vs. 22.8 percent (95% CI: 16.7, 29.8); p=0.00008). For patients with brain metastases, the addition of TUKYSA reduced the risk of cancer progression or death (PFS) by 52 percent compared to trastuzumab and capecitabine alone (HR=0.48 [95% CI: 0.34, 0.69]; p<0.00001).

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26 percent of patients who received TUKYSA. Serious adverse reactions occurring in 2 percent or more of patients who received TUKYSA were diarrhea (4%), vomiting (2.5%), nausea, abdominal pain, and seizure (2% each). The most common adverse reactions occurring in 20 percent or more of patients who received TUKYSA were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia, and rash. Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 6 percent of patients who received TUKYSA; adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of TUKYSA (in 1 percent or more of patients) were hepatotoxicity (1.5%) and diarrhea (1%).

The data were published in The New England Journal of Medicinein December 2019.

About TUKYSA (tucatinib)

TUKYSA is an oral medicine that is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the HER2 protein. In vitro (in lab studies), TUKYSA inhibited phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3, resulting in inhibition of downstream MAPK and AKT signaling and cell growth (proliferation), and showed anti-tumor activity in HER2-expressing tumor cells. In vivo (in living organisms), TUKYSA inhibited the growth of HER2-expressing tumors. The combination of TUKYSA and the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab showed increased anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo compared to either medicine alone.1

SeaGen Secure offers access and reimbursement support to help patients access TUKYSA. For more information, go to SeaGenSecure.com.

About HER2-Positive Breast Cancer

Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer have tumors with high levels of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which promotes the growth of cancer cells. An estimated 279,100 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2020.3 Between 15 and 20 percent of breast cancer cases are HER2-positive.3 Historically, HER2-positive breast cancer tends to be more aggressive and more likely to recur than HER2-negative breast cancer.4,5,6 Up to 50 percent of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients develop brain metastases over time.7,8,9

Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions

Diarrhea – TUKYSA can cause severe diarrhea including dehydration, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and death. In HER2CLIMB, 81% of patients who received TUKYSA experienced diarrhea, including 12% with Grade 3 diarrhea and 0.5% with Grade 4 diarrhea. Both patients who developed Grade 4 diarrhea subsequently died, with diarrhea as a contributor to death. The median time to onset of the first episode of diarrhea was 12 days and the median time to resolution was 8 days. Diarrhea led to dose reductions of TUKYSA in 6% of patients and discontinuation of TUKYSA in 1% of patients. Prophylactic use of antidiarrheal treatment was not required on HER2CLIMB.If diarrhea occurs, administer antidiarrheal treatment as clinically indicated. Perform diagnostic tests as clinically indicated to exclude other causes of diarrhea. Based on the severity of the diarrhea, interrupt dose, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue TUKYSA.
Hepatotoxicity – TUKYSA can cause severe hepatotoxicity. In HER2CLIMB, 8% of patients who received TUKYSA had an ALT increase >5 × ULN, 5% had an AST increase >5 × ULN, and 1.5% had a bilirubin increase >3 × ULN (Grade ≥3). Hepatotoxicity led to dose reduction of TUKYSA in 8% of patients and discontinuation of TUKYSA in 1.5% of patients.Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to starting TUKYSA, every 3 weeks during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of hepatoxicity, interrupt dose, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue TUKYSA.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity – TUKYSA can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential, and male patients with female partners of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during TUKYSA treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose.
Adverse Reactions

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients who received TUKYSA. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients who received TUKYSA were diarrhea (4%), vomiting (2.5%), nausea (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and seizure (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received TUKYSA including sudden death, sepsis, dehydration, and cardiogenic shock.

Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients who received TUKYSA; those occurring in ≥1% of patients were hepatotoxicity (1.5%) and diarrhea (1%). Adverse reactions led to dose reduction in 21% of patients who received TUKYSA; those occurring in ≥2% of patients were hepatotoxicity (8%) and diarrhea (6%).

The most common adverse reactions in patients who received TUKYSA (≥20%) were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia, and rash.

Lab Abnormalities

In HER2CLIMB, Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities reported in ≥5% of patients who received TUKYSA were: decreased phosphate, increased ALT, decreased potassium, and increased AST. The mean increase in serum creatinine was 32% within the first 21 days of treatment with TUKYSA. The serum creatinine increases persisted throughout treatment and were reversible upon treatment completion. Consider alternative markers of renal function if persistent elevations in serum creatinine are observed.

Drug Interactions

Strong CYP3A or Moderate CYP2C8 Inducers: Concomitant use may decrease TUKYSA activity. Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA.
Strong or Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Concomitant use of TUKYSA with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor may increase the risk of TUKYSA toxicity; avoid concomitant use. Increase monitoring for TUKYSA toxicity with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors.
CYP3A Substrates: Concomitant use may increase the toxicity associated with a CYP3A substrate. Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. If concomitant use is unavoidable, decrease the CYP3A substrate dosage.
P-gp Substrates: Concomitant use may increase the toxicity associated with a P-gp substrate. Consider reducing the dosage of P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicity.
Use in Specific Populations

Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed while taking TUKYSA and for at least 1 week after the last dose.
Renal Impairment: Use of TUKYSA in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), because capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.
Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the dose of TUKYSA for patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment.
For more information, please see the full Prescribing Information for TUKYSA here.

 The study resulted in ORR 33.3%, mDOR 7.7 mos. Additionally, the P-III ASCENT study (N=500) is halted by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for compelling evidence of efficacy across multiple endpoints with expected results in mid-2020
 TRODELVY (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) is a novel ADC targeting the Trop-2 antigen approved by the US FDA for relapsed or refractory metastatic TNBC and is currently being evaluated as a treatment for eight hard-to-treat solid cancers","Morris Plains, N.J., Immunomedics, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMU) (“Immunomedics” or the “Company”), a leading biopharmaceutical company in the area of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Trodelvy™ (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. Trodelvy is the first ADC approved by the FDA specifically for relapsed or refractory metastatic TNBC and is also the first FDA-approved anti-Trop-2 ADC.1

Trodelvy, which was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review, was approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program based on the objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) observed in a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in the confirmatory Phase 3 ASCENT study, which was recently halted by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for compelling evidence of efficacy across multiple endpoints.

“The approval of Trodelvy, the first ADC approved specifically for metastatic TNBC, an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis and few effective therapies, will give clinicians a novel tool for treating patients with this disease,” stated Aditya Bardia, MD, MPH, Director of Precision Medicine at the Center for Breast Cancer, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Bardia was the lead investigator of the Phase 2 study. “In our trial, Trodelvy demonstrated clinically meaningful responses in patients with difficult-to-treat metastatic TNBC and moves the needle towards better outcomes for patients with metastatic breast cancer.”

In the single-arm Phase 2 study, Trodelvy demonstrated an ORR of 33.3 percent (95 percent CI: 24.6, 43.1) and a median DoR of 7.7 months (95 percent CI: 4.9, 10.8), as determined by local assessment, in 108 adult TNBC patients who had previously received a median of three prior systemic therapies in the metastatic setting (range: 2-10).1

“We are proud to bring Trodelvy to patients with metastatic TNBC who are in dire need of new options. Trodelvy has the potential to become a standard of care in in the management of TNBC, and we anxiously await the results of ongoing studies in other types of metastatic breast cancer,” said Dr. Loretta M. Itri, Chief Medical Officer of Immunomedics. “This approval highlights the potential of our unique ADC platform and strengthens the premise that the Trop-2 antigen found in many solid cancers is an important target for drug delivery. We are committed to broadening the potential use of Trodelvy in other Trop-2-expressing cancers, especially those with unmet need.”

Trodelvy carries a black box warning for severe neutropenia and severe diarrhea. The most common adverse reactions occurring in 25 or more percent of patients included nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, vomiting, alopecia, constipation, decreased appetite, rash and abdominal pain. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in more than 5 percent of patients were neutropenia, white blood cell count decreased, anemia, hypophosphatemia, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Two percent of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. There were no deaths related to treatment and no severe cases of neuropathy or interstitial lung disease.1

“Trodelvy’s approval is a major milestone in our transformation from a research-based organization to a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company, underscoring our commitment to bring innovative therapies to patients with hard-to-treat cancers,” said Dr. Behzad Aghazadeh, Executive Chairman of Immunomedics. “We are grateful to all of the patients, their families, physicians, and nurses who participated in our clinical trials and played a significant role in making this moment possible.”

The Company recently announced that the Phase 3 confirmatory ASCENT study of Trodelvy in metastatic TNBC, with over 500 patients enrolled, will be stopped early due to compelling efficacy across multiple endpoints, based on the unanimous recommendation of the DSMC. The Company remains on track to achieve topline results from the ASCENT study by mid-2020.

About TRODELVY

Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) is the lead product and the most advanced program in Immunomedics’ unique antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) platform. Trodelvy is an ADC that is directed against Trop-2, a cell-surface protein expressed in many solid cancers, making it an attractive target for Trodelvy to potentially address multiple types of cancer.2 Trodelvy binds to Trop-2 and delivers the anti-cancer drug, SN-38, to kill cancer cells. Trodelvy is currently being evaluated as a treatment for eight hard-to-treat solid cancers.

About triple-negative breast cancer

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer, accounting for up to 20 percent of all breast cancers.3 TNBC is diagnosed more frequently in younger and premenopausal women and is highly prevalent in African American and Hispanic women.4 TNBC cells do not have estrogen or progesterone hormone receptors, or very much of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 – hence the term triple negative. This means that medicines that target these receptors are not typically effective in TNBC. There is currently no approved standard of care for people with previously-treated mTNBC.3


About Immunomedics

Immunomedics is a pioneering leader in next-generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology, committed to help transform the lives of people with hard-to-treat cancers. Our proprietary ADC platform centers on using a novel linker that does not require an enzyme to release the payload to deliver an active drug inside the tumor cell and the tumor microenvironment, thereby producing a bystander effect. TRODELVY, our lead ADC, is the first ADC FDA approved for the treatment of people with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and is also the first FDA-approved anti-Trop-2 ADC.

First-in-Class Approval Validates UroGen’s Innovative Technology and Future Opportunity Across its Specialty Cancers and Urologic Diseases Portfolio
Company to Host Conference Call on Thursday, April 16 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time
PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 15, 2020– UroGen Pharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: URGN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted expedited approval for Jelmyto™(mitomycin) for pyelocalyceal solution, a first-in-class treatment indicated for adults with low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer (LG UTUC). This landmark approval is based on positive results from the Phase 3 OLYMPUS trial that showed Jelmyto provides an effective, kidney-sparing option for patients with this rare and difficult-to-treat cancer.

Jelmyto consists of mitomycin, an established chemotherapy, and sterile hydrogel, using UroGen’s proprietary sustained release RTGel™ technology. It has been designed to enable longer exposure of urinary tract tissue to mitomycin, thereby enabling the treatment of tumors by non-surgical means.

“UroGen was founded on the vision to improve lives by challenging the current standard of care. Jelmyto, which leverages our innovative technology and expertise in specialty cancers and urologic diseases, is just the beginning as we build a company focused on bringing novel solutions to patients,” said Liz Barrett, President and Chief Executive Officer, UroGen. “We thank the patients and researchers involved in our OLYMPUS trial for helping us advance a transformative treatment in a disease space that has been historically ignored. We are tremendously proud to have pioneered this first-in-class therapy that improves patient care in a difficult-to-treat cancer.”

LG UTUC is a rare cancer that develops in the lining of the upper urinary tract, ureters and kidneys. In the U.S., there are approximately 6,000 – 7,000 new or recurrent LG UTUC patients annually. It is a challenging condition to treat due to the complex anatomy of the urinary tract system. The current standard of care includes multiple surgeries and most patients require a radical nephroureterectomy, which includes the removal of the renal pelvis, kidney, ureter and bladder cuff.1 Treatment is further complicated by the fact that LG UTUC is most commonly diagnosed in patients over 70 years of age, who may already have compromised kidney functionality and may suffer further complications as a result of major surgery.

“Jelmyto offers a new, non-surgical treatment approach for patients who otherwise may require treatment by radical nephroureterectomy, which is associated with declining kidney function and other complications,” said Dr. Seth Lerner, M.D., FACS, Professor of Urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX and Principal Investigator of the OLYMPUS trial. “This novel, minimally invasive, kidney-sparing treatment has the potential to transform the way low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer is treated and help patients avoid long-term complications associated with surgery and the loss of their kidney.”

The FDA approval is based on results from the Phase 3 OLYMPUS trial showing Jelmyto achieved clinically significant disease eradication in adults with LG UTUC.Findings include:

Complete response (CR) (primary endpoint) of 58% in the intent-to-treat population and in the sub-population of patients who were deemed not capable of surgical removal at diagnosis.
At the 12-month time point for assessment of durability, 19 patients remained in CR, seven had experienced recurrence of disease and nine patients continued to be followed for the 12-month duration of response.
Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated 12-month durability at 84%2 (based on interim data).
The most commonly reported adverse events (≥ 20%) were ureteric obstruction, flank pain, urinary tract infection, hematuria, renal dysfunction, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, dysuria, and vomiting. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and manageable using well established treatments. No treatment-related deaths occurred.
“There has been little progress for decades in the treatment of low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer, and this new option is paradigm-shifting for patients who often face recurrence and major surgery to remove their kidney,” said Andrea Maddox-Smith, Chief Executive Officer, Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network. “We applaud the FDA approval and the impact it will have for this community of elderly patients, many of whom struggle with comorbidities and have been hoping for a surgery-free treatment option.”

UroGen is committed to helping patients access Jelmyto. UroGen Support may help identify appropriate financial assistance programs for patients with commercial, Medicare or Medicaid coverage, as well as those with no insurance coverage. These programs are for eligible patients who have been prescribed Jelmyto and who need help managing the cost of treatment. The appropriate program will depend on the patient’s coverage. Visit http://www.Jelmyto.com or contact UroGen Support at 855-JELMYTO for additional information.

The FDA evaluated Jelmyto under Priority Review, which is reserved for medicines that may represent significant improvements in safety or efficacy in treating serious conditions. Jelmyto was also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, which was created to expedite the development and review of drugs developed for serious or life-threatening conditions with high unmet need.

About the Phase 3 OLYMPUS Trial

OLYMPUS (Optimized DeLivery of Mitomycin for Primary UTUC Study) is an open-label, single-arm Phase 3 clinical trial of Jelmyto™ (mitomycin) for pyelocalyceal solution to evaluate the safety, tolerability and tumor ablative effect of Jelmyto in patients with low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC). The trial enrolled 74 patients at clinical sites across the U.S. and Israel. Study participants were treated with six weekly instillations of Jelmyto administered via a standard catheter. Four to six weeks following the last instillation, patients underwent a Primary Disease Evaluation (PDE) to determine complete response (CR), the primary endpoint of the study. PDE involved a ureteroscopy and wash cytology, a standard microscopic test of cells obtained from the urine to detect cancer. Patients who achieved a CR at the PDE timepoint were then followed for up to 12 months to determine the durability of response with Jelmyto.

About Jelmyto™ (mitomycin) for pyelocalyceal solution

Jelmyto™ (mitomycin) for pyelocalyceal solution is a drug formulation of mitomycin for the treatment of low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer (LG UTUC). Utilizing the RTGel™ technology platform, UroGen’s proprietary sustained release, hydrogel-based formulation, Jelmyto is designed to enable longer exposure of urinary tract tissue to mitomycin, thereby enabling the treatment of tumors by non-surgical means. Jelmyto is delivered to patients using standard ureteral catheters. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Breakthrough Therapy Designations to Jelmyto for the treatment of LG UTUC. Jelmyto is the first drug approved for the treatment of LG UTUC.

About Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (UTUC)

Urothelial cancer is the ninth most common cancer globally and the eighth most lethal neoplasm in men in the U.S. Between five percent and 10 percent of primary urothelial cancers originate in the ureter or renal pelvis and are collectively referred to as upper tract urothelial cancers (UTUC). In the U.S., there are approximately 6,000 – 7,000 new or recurrent low-grade UTUC patients annually. Most cases are diagnosed in patients over 70 years old, and these older patients often face comorbidities. There are limited treatment options for UTUC, with the most common being endoscopic surgery or nephroureterectomy (removal of the entire kidney and ureter). These treatments can lead to a high rate of recurrence and relapse.

33106,"Incyte's Pemazyre (pemigatinib) Receives the US FDA's Approval as the Novel Treatment for Adults with Previously Treated, Unresectable LA or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma","FDA Approves Incyte’s Pemazyre™ (pemigatinib) as First Targeted Treatment for Adults with Previously Treated, Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma","The approval is based on P-II FIGHT-202 (NCT02924376) study which involves assessing of Pemazyre (13.5 mg, qd) in adults with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with documented FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement
 The study has three cohorts: Cohort A (FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements), Cohort B (other FGF/FGFR genetic alterations) or Cohort C (no FGF/FGFR genetic alterations and resulted in OR 36%, mDOR 9.1 mos.
 Pemazyre is an oral inhibitor of FGFR isoforms 1, 2 and 3 and has also received the US FDA’s BT Designation and ODD to treat patients with previously treated advanced/metastatic or unresectable FGFR2 translocated cholangiocarcinoma and for cholangiocarcinoma respectively","WILMINGTON, Del.- Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pemazyre™ (pemigatinib), a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. Pemazyre is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for this indication, which was approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

“Our research into FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements in cholangiocarcinoma and the development of Pemazyre as the first targeted treatment option demonstrates our commitment to translating scientific discovery into solutions that can positively impact patients’ lives,” said Hervé Hoppenot, Chief Executive Officer, Incyte. “We’re proud to bring Pemazyre to patients and will make this new treatment available immediately.”

The FDA approval was based on data from the FIGHT-202 study, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study that evaluated Pemazyre as a treatment for adults with cholangiocarcinoma. In patients harboring FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements (Cohort A), Pemazyre monotherapy resulted in an overall response rate of 36% (primary endpoint), and median DOR of 9.1 months (secondary endpoint). Warnings and precautions for Pemazyre include eye problems such as dry or inflamed eyes, inflamed cornea, increased tears and a disorder of the retina; high levels of phosphate in the blood; and, for women who are pregnant, a risk of harm to the unborn baby or loss of pregnancy.

The FDA granted Pemazyre Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of patients with previously treated advanced/metastatic or unresectable FGFR2 translocated cholangiocarcinoma. Additionally, the FDA granted Pemazyre Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, and the New Drug Application (NDA) for Pemazyre was reviewed under the FDA’s Priority Review program.

“Although cholangiocarcinoma is considered a rare disease, it has been on the rise over the past three decades,”1,2 said Ghassan Abou-Alfa, M.D., Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “It is encouraging to have a new targeted treatment option for patients who historically have had limited options after first-line chemotherapy or surgery, in which relapse rates remain high.”

Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer that forms in the bile duct. It is classified based on its anatomical origin: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) occurs in the bile duct inside the liver and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma occurs in the bile duct outside the liver. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma are often diagnosed at a late or advanced stage when the prognosis is poor.3,4 The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma varies regionally and ranges between 0.3-3.4 per 100,000 in North America and Europe.3 FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements occur almost exclusively in iCCA, where they are observed in 10-16% of patients.5-7 FGFRs play an important role in tumor cell proliferation and survival, migration and angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). Activating fusions, rearrangements, translocations and gene amplifications in FGFRs are closely correlated with the development of various cancers.

“Today’s approval of Pemazyre provides an exciting new treatment option for patients and will bring hope to those who typically face a difficult diagnosis journey and poor prognosis,” said Stacie Lindsey, President, Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation.

Incyte is committed to supporting patients and removing barriers to access medicines. Eligible patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Pemazyre have access to IncyteCARES (Connecting to Access, Reimbursement, Education and Support), a comprehensive program offering patient support, including financial assistance and ongoing education and resources to eligible patients.

About FIGHT-202

The FIGHT-202 Phase 2 multi-center, open-label, single-arm study (NCT02924376) evaluated the safety and efficacy of Pemazyre – a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor – in adult (age ≥18 years) patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with documented FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement.

Patients were enrolled into one of three cohorts – Cohort A (FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements), Cohort B (other FGF/FGFR genetic alterations) or Cohort C (no FGF/FGFR genetic alterations). All patients received 13.5 mg Pemazyre orally once daily (QD) on a 21-day cycle (two weeks on/one week off) until radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The primary endpoint of FIGHT-202 was overall response rate (ORR) in Cohort A, assessed by independent review per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints include ORR in Cohorts B, A plus B, and C; and duration of response (DOR).

Roche’s new digital tool could help simplify the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with respiratory compromise in the current COVID-19 pandemic1
Roche v-TAC is available in markets accepting the CE mark2

Basel, 15 May 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the CE mark availability of Roche v-TAC, a new digital diagnostic solution that allows clinicians to obtain results for arterial blood gas values from patients with respiratory or metabolic abnormalities via a simpler, less invasive venous puncture through the use of a digital algorithm.

Blood gas analysis is typically used in hospital point of care (POC) settings, where quick and accurate results are needed. This includes emergency rooms, intensive care units and operating rooms. The analysis provides clinicians with information about a patient’s pulmonary function and acid‐base status, both of which are essential to make a diagnosis, provide treatment and monitor progress.

A traditional blood gas test requires the collection of an arterial blood sample, which can be a painful experience for the patient since most arteries lie deeper in the tissue than veins and have a thicker wall to be punctured. This procedure is usually carried out by medical doctors or specially-trained staff. Through the Roche v-TAC digital solution, staff without specific training to draw arterial blood samples are now able to withdraw a venous blood sample instead and digitally convert these values into arterial blood gas values, which can help free up specialist healthcare staff to other tasks. Roche’s v-TAC is fully integrated for use with Roche’s cobas b 123 POC and cobas b 221 systems using the Roche cobas infinity POC solution.

“In an emergency situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Roche v-TAC could also help healthcare professionals to assess disease severity faster in patients and closely monitor potential deterioration in patients with respiratory compromise,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Digital tools based on clinical algorithms like Roche v-TAC can help improve and simplify delivery of care in emergency situations faster and where it is most needed.”

Roche acquired the v-TAC technology at the end of March with the acquisition of Obi Medical Aps, a privately-held company based in Hadsund, Denmark that focuses on developing disruptive blood gas testing technology.

About Blood Gas testing
Blood gas and electrolyte testing is used in a number of critical care situations, during surgery and in a number of other clinical areas, including neonatal and dialysis units. For example, it can help determine whether a patient is receiving sufficient respiratory support, or suffering from heavy trauma or acute heart and lung diseases.

Blood gas and electrolyte systems provide fast, accurate, quantitative measurements of whole blood for pH, pCO2, pO2, Sodium , Potassium , Chloride , Calcium, Glucose, Lactate, Haematocrit, Total bilirubin and CO-Oximetry (tHb, O2Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb).

About cobas b 123 POC and b 221 systems
The cobas b 123 POC system is a mobile, cartridge-based, blood gas analyser designed for POC testing to measure blood gases, electrolytes, metabolites and oxygen saturation and neonatal bilirubin. With various configurations and a throughput of up to 30 samples per hour, the cobas b 123 POC system can easily be customized to the clinical needs of the ICU, ER, NICU, OR, dialysis units or the laboratory.

The cobas b 221 system is a fully automated blood gas analyser for the quantitative measurement of blood gases, electrolytes, metabolites and oxygen saturation and neonatal bilirubin. The system is designed to be used in POC settings such as emergency departments, intensive care units and laboratories.

Connectivity to the hospital network for both cobas b 123 and cobas b 221 is enabled wirelessly or via a network port using the cobas infinity POC software which is available worldwide. For more information, visit diagnostics.roche.com

About OBI Medical Aps
In March 2020, Roche acquired OBI Medical Aps, a privately held company based in Denmark that focuses on developing disruptive blood gas testing technology. OBI Medical Aps was founded in 2002 by a group of leading scientists, researchers and clinicians from Aalborg University Hospital and from the Centre for Model-based Medical Decision Support at Aalborg University.

About Roche’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with varying developments from country to country and we are partnering with healthcare providers, laboratories, authorities and organisations to help make sure that patients receive the tests, treatment and care they need.

Reliable, high-quality testing is essential to help healthcare systems overcome this pandemic. On 13 March we received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a high-volume molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, which is also available in countries accepting the CE Mark. On 3 May, Roche announced that its COVID-19 antibody test, aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies in the blood, also received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation and is available in markets accepting the CE mark. Our existing diagnostics portfolio for critical care has also been playing a significant role in supporting patient management during the COVID-19 crisis, with our blood gas and sepsis products being used to monitor patients in the acute setting. Roche is working closely with governments and health authorities around the world, and has significantly increased production to help ensure availability of tests globally.

While there are currently no approved medicines for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, we are actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio and are researching options for the future. On 19 March, we announced the initiation of COVACTA – a global Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra©/RoActemra© (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. Roche has also initiated an internal early research programme focused on the development of medicines for COVID-19 and is evaluating a large number of potential collaborations.

In these exceptional times, Roche stands together with governments, healthcare providers and all those working to overcome the pandemic.

“TAK-733 is a great example of the power of our approach to decode challenging and important areas of biology. By applying machine learning to images of cells, we capture cellular changes accompanying hundreds of unique biological perturbations, and even loss of just a single gene,” said Chris Gibson, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO, Recursion. “Using our platform, we uncovered targeted areas of oncology where TAK-733 could be effective. And because our dataset is fully relatable, we then cross-referenced TAK-733 against hundreds of disease models we’ve developed already or will develop in the coming years.”

TAK-733 was identified as a potential treatment for a hereditary tumor syndrome using Recursion’s approach to creating cellular models of diseases where genes are inactive. Using its automated drug discovery platform, Recursion discovered the potential of TAK-733 by testing more than 200 potential molecules from Takeda’s library against the most effective potential treatment for cancers carrying particular mutations.

“We’re making immense progress in oncology by understanding the genetic drivers of different tumor types and developing targeted therapeutics,” said Ron Alfa, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational Discovery. “Almost all available drugs today target a particular type of mutation that result in activated proteins — oncogenes. However, most tumors also harbor mutations that eliminate or deactivate proteins, tumor suppressors, and only a few of these pathways have been understood well enough to develop therapeutics. Recursion’s platform opens the door to discovering targeted therapeutics that are effective when these tumor suppressors are inactive.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Recursion obtains exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize TAK-733. For more information on Recursion, please visit www.recursionpharma.com.

Among 875 patients who participated in the Phase 3 study of SB3, a total of 367 patients (SB3, n=186; TRZ, n=181) were enrolled in a five-year follow-up study. The aim of this follow-up study was to observe the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), asymptomatic significant left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease, incidence of other cardiac events, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). The median follow-up duration from initiation of the Phase 3 study was 53 months.
During the follow-up period, incidence of asymptomatic significant LVEF decrease was comparable between SB3 and reference trastuzumab (SB3, n=1; TRZ, n=2), with all patients recovering with LVEF who reported 50% or above. No symptomatic CHF, cardiac death, or other significant cardiac condition occurred in either group during the follow-up period.
Four-year EFS rates were 83.4% for SB3 and 80.7% for reference trastuzumab (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47-1.27), while four-year OS rates were 94.4% for SB3 and 89.6% for reference trastuzumab (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.24-1.16).
Within the group of patients who received reference trastuzumab, the patients exposed to at least one vial from the reference trastuzumab lots with expiry dates from August 2018 to December 2019 during neoadjuvant period showing lower (drifted) levels of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) were classified as the “drifted TRZ group,” and the remaining patients who were not exposed to any vials from the reference trastuzumab lots with lower levels of ADCC were classified as the “non-drifted TRZ group.” In an ad-hoc analysis, there was no difference observed in EFS (HR 1.60, 95% CI, 0.58-4.40, p=0.362) and OS (HR 0.97 95% CI, 0.11-8.50, p=0.975) between SB3 and non-drifted TRZ group. There was a difference observed in EFS (HR 5.50 95% CI, 1.81-16.65, p=0.003) and OS (HR 15.35 95% CI, 1.78-132.69, p=0.013) between drifted TRZ and non-drifted TRZ group.

May 14, 2020 02:56 AM Eastern Daylight Time
BEERSE, Belgium–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced updated results from the Phase 1b/2 CARTITUDE-1 study (NCT03548207) evaluating the efficacy and safety of JNJ-4528, an investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.1 Longer-term follow-up results from the Phase 1b portion of the study (n=29); to be shared in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Virtual Scientific Program (Abstract #8505), show that all patients responded to treatment and the responses were deep and durable, with 86 percent of patients achieving stringent complete response at a median follow-up of 11.5 months and 86 percent of patients being alive and progression free at nine months.1

“We continue to advance the investigation of this novel CAR-T treatment with the goal of bringing a differentiated immunotherapy to patients with multiple myeloma, many of whom have exhausted all potential prior treatment options.”

The 100 percent overall response rate (ORR) included 97 percent of patients achieving a very good partial response or better and three percent achieving a partial response.1 Responses were observed among heavily pretreated patients (n=29) at a median administered dose 0.72×10 6 CAR+ viable T cells/kg. 1 Patients evaluated had received a median of five (range, 3-18) prior treatment regimens; 86 percent were triple-refractory and 28 percent were penta-refractory.1 The median time to first response was one month (range, 1-3) and 81 percent of evaluable patients (n=16) achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative disease status at 10-5 or 10-6 at the time of first suspected complete response.1

“The longer-term results for JNJ-4528, as demonstrated through the latest findings from the CARTITUDE-1 study, show the continued treatment effect for heavily pretreated patients who faced a dismal prognosis,” said Jesus G Berdeja, M.D., Director of Myeloma Research, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, and principal study investigator. “We’re encouraged by not only the relatively high rate of stringent complete responses, but also the progression-free survival seen in these patients.”

“Janssen has a rich heritage in bringing transformational therapies to people living with blood cancers,” adds Dr Patrick Laroche, M.D., Haematology Therapy Area Lead, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Janssen-Cilag. “I am excited to see these latest results support early promising data previously presented and hope that one day JNJ-4528 can offer a viable treatment option for multiple myeloma patients.”

The most common adverse events (AEs) observed in CARTITUDE-1 were neutropenia (100 percent) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS, 93 percent).1 In patients who experienced Grade 3 and above AEs, the most common were neutropenia (100 percent), thrombocytopenia (69 percent) and leukopenia (66 percent). The median time of onset of CRS was seven days (range, 2-12) post-infusion, with a majority of patients experiencing Grade 1-2 CRS and two patients (7 percent) experiencing Grade 3 or greater CRS.1Neurotoxicity consistent with immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was observed in three patients (10 percent), including one patient (3 percent) with Grade 3 or greater toxicity.1 Three deaths were reported during the Phase 1b study: one due to CRS, one due to acute myeloid leukaemia (not treatment-related) and one due to progressive disease.1

“These recently updated data from the CARTITUDE-1 study suggest a durable response and tolerable safety profile for JNJ-4528,” said Sen Zhuang, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Oncology Clinical Development, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We continue to advance the investigation of this novel CAR-T treatment with the goal of bringing a differentiated immunotherapy to patients with multiple myeloma, many of whom have exhausted all potential prior treatment options.”

About CARTITUDE-1

CARTITUDE-1 (NCT03548207) is an ongoing Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicentre study evaluating the safety and efficacy of JNJ-4528 in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, 97 percent of whom were refractory to the last line of treatment; 86 percent of whom were triple-class refractory meaning their cancer did not, or no longer responds to an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an anti-CD38 antibody.1,2

The primary objective of the Phase 1b portion of the study was to characterise the safety and confirm the dose of JNJ-4528, informed by the first-in-human study with LCAR-B38M* CAR-T cells (LEGEND-2).2 Based on the safety profile observed in this portion of the study, outpatient dosing will be evaluated in additional CARTITUDE studies.1 The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the efficacy of JNJ-4528 with overall response as the primary endpoint.2

About JNJ-4528 (LCAR-B38M*)

JNJ-4528 (LCAR-B38M) is an investigational chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The design comprises a structurally differentiated CAR-T with two BCMA-targeting single domain antibodies.1 CAR-T cells are an innovative approach to eradicating cancer cells by harnessing the power of a patient’s own immune system.3 BCMA is a protein that is highly expressed on myeloma cells.4

In December 2017, Janssen entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Legend Biotech to develop and commercialise JNJ-4528 (LCAR-B38M).5 In May 2018, Janssen initiated the Phase 1b/2 CARTITUDE-1 trial (NCT03548207) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNJ-4528 in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, informed by the LEGEND-2 study results.2

In April 2019, JNJ-4528 was granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).6 PRIME offers enhanced interaction and early dialogue to optimise drug development plans and speed up evaluation of cutting-edge, scientific advances that target a high unmet medical need.7 In February 2020, the European Commission granted orphan designation for JNJ-4528.8

About Multiple Myeloma

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterised by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.9 In Europe, more than 48,200 people were diagnosed with MM in 2018, and more than 30,800 patients died.10 Around 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients do not reach five-year survival,11,12 and almost 29 percent of patients with multiple myeloma will die within one year of diagnosis.13

Although treatment may result in remission, unfortunately, patients will most likely relapse as there is currently no cure.14 Refractory MM is when a patient’s disease progresses within 60 days of their last therapy.15 Relapsed cancer is when the disease has returned after a period of initial, partial or complete remission.15 While some patients with MM have no symptoms at all, others are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.16 Patients who relapse after treatment with standard therapies, including protease inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, have poor prognoses and require new therapies for continued disease control.17

*LCAR-B38M identifies the investigational product in China, sponsored by Janssen’s development partner, Legend Biotech.

May 18, 2020 02:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
TOKYO & BASKING RIDGE, N.J. & MUNICH–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.

“We look forward to working closely with the FDA on the potential for ENHERTU to become the first HER2 directed therapy approved for #NSCLC” – Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, SVP, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo

Tweet this

NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, and prognosis is particularly poor for patients with metastatic disease as only about six to 10 percent will be alive five years after diagnosis.1,2 Approximately two to four percent of patients with NSCLC have a HER2 mutation.3,4

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) BTD is designed to accelerate the development and regulatory review of potential new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and address a significant unmet medical need. The new medicine needs to have shown encouraging preliminary clinical results that demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.

“We are encouraged by the promising evidence of activity seen with ENHERTU in patients with advanced lung cancer and a HER2 mutation,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “We look forward to working closely with the FDA on the potential for ENHERTU to become the first HER2 directed therapy approved for non-small cell lung cancer.”

“Today’s news is very welcome as we continue to evaluate the potential of ENHERTU to help patients with this devastating type of lung cancer,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “Targeted treatments and immunotherapies are demonstrating tremendous advancements, but there remains an unmet medical need for patients with HER2 mutations who are not benefiting from such therapies or for those whose cancer continues to progress.”

The FDA granted BTD based on data from ongoing phase 2 DESTINY-Lung01 trial currently assessing ENHERTU, a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), in patients with HER2 mutant metastatic NSCLC and data from the phase 1 trial published in Cancer Discovery. An interim analysis from DESTINY-Lung01 will be presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program.

The overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in the ongoing DESTINY-Lung01 trial is consistent with that seen in the phase 1 trial. The most common adverse events to date (n=42) are gastrointestinal and hematological including nausea, alopecia, anemia, decreased appetite and decreased neutrophil count. There have been five cases of drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis in patients with HER2 mutant NSCLC, all of which were grade 2. There have been no ILD-related deaths.

This is the third BTD granted for ENHERTU in the U.S., and the fourth expedited regulatory designation received globally. Last week, ENHERTU received BTD in patients with HER2 positive unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab.

ENHERTU recently received accelerated approval in the U.S. and approval in Japan under the conditional early approval system for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.

About HER2

HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. In some tumors, HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.5

Other HER2 gene alterations (called HER2 mutations) have been identified in NSCLC, specifically adenocarcinomas, as distinct molecular targets.4,6 Approximately two to four percent of patients with NSCLC have HER2 mutations, which have been independently associated with cancer cell growth and poor prognosis.3,4

About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.7 In the U.S., it is estimated that 228,820 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 and more than 135,000 people will die from the disease.8

NSCLC accounts for approximately 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.9 For patients with metastatic disease, prognosis is particularly poor, as only six to 10 percent will be alive five years after diagnosis.1 The introduction of targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitors in recent years has improved the treatment landscape for patients with advanced NSCLC; however, new approaches are needed for those who are not eligible for available treatments, or whose cancer continues to progress.10 Currently, no medicine is specifically approved for patients with HER2 mutant NSCLC.

About DESTINY-Lung01

DESTINY-Lung01 is a global, phase 2, open-label, multicenter, two-cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in 170 patients with HER2 mutant (n=90) or HER2 overexpressing (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+, n=80) unresectable and metastatic non-squamous NSCLC whose cancer has progressed after one or more systemic therapies including chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy or immunotherapy. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Key secondary endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate, progression free survival, and overall survival.

About ENHERTU

ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.) is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.

ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.

ENHERTU has been approved for use only in the U.S. and Japan. ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of the U.S. and Japan for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the subject proposed use.

A comprehensive development program for ENHERTU is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.

About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca

In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.

U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU®

ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.
Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.
Contraindications

None.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).

Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).

Neutropenia

Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.

Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.

Left Ventricular Dysfunction

Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.

Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.

Adverse Reactions

The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.

ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.

The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

Use in Specific Populations

Pregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.
Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.
Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.
Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%).
Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

33229,AstraZeneca's Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) Receives NMPA's Approval for Patients with COPD,"First approval in China of a fixed-dose, long-acting dual bronchodilator in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler device","The NMPA’s approval is based on P-III PINNACLE 4 study assessing Bevespi Aerosphere (bid via a pMDI) vs its monotherapy components (glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate) and PBO in patients with moderate to very severe COPD
 The P-III PINNACLE 4 study demonstrated improvement in lung function as measured by trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), published in the International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
 The approval follows the approval of AstraZeneca’s triple-combination therapy, Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) for the maintenance treatment of COPD in China. Bevespi Aerosphere (FD) is a dual bronchodilator, administered in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler utilizing Aerosphere delivery technology","AstraZeneca’s Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) has been approved in China as a maintenance treatment to relieve symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.

The approval by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) was based on positive results from the Phase III PINNACLE 4 trial1 in which Bevespi Aerosphere demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in lung function as measured by trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), compared to its monotherapy components and placebo, all administered twice daily via pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. The trial formed part of the broader PINNACLE clinical trials programme showing efficacy and safety and involving more than 5,000 patients across Asia, Europe and the US.2,3,4

This was the first approval by the NMPA for a maintenance, fixed-dose, long-acting dual bronchodilator combination therapy in a pMDI, which uses the innovative Aerosphere delivery technology.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects almost 100 million people in China and presents a significant patient and public health burden. The use of maintenance combination therapies in China is increasing year-on-year and the approval of Bevespi Aerosphere offers an important new treatment and choice of inhaler for patients, particularly those with limited lung function and advanced age who may benefit from using a pressurised metered-dose inhaler.”

Bevespi Aerosphere is already approved in the US, EU, Japan and other countries for the long-term maintenance treatment of moderate to very severe COPD.

The approval of Bevespi Aerosphere follows the recent approval of AstraZeneca’s triple-combination therapy, Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate), for the maintenance treatment of COPD in China.5

COPD

COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.6 It affects an estimated 384 million people worldwide and approximately 100 million people in China.7,8COPD is the third leading cause of death globally.6 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.6

PINNACLE

PINNACLE 1, 2 and 4 were randomised, double-blinded, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trials conducted over 24 weeks, which compared the efficacy and safety of Bevespi Aerosphere administered twice daily via a pMDI to its monotherapy components (glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate) and to placebo.1,2,3 In PINNACLE 1, open-label tiotropium was included as an active control.2 PINNACLE 3 was a multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, chronic-dosing, active-controlled, 28-week safety extension trial of PINNACLE 1 and 2, which evaluated the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of Bevespi Aerosphere administered twice daily via a pMDI compared to its monotherapy components.4 All the trials were conducted in patients with moderate to very severe COPD.1,2,3,4

Results from the PINNACLE 4 trial were published in the International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.1

Bevespi Aerosphere

Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) is a fixed-dose dual bronchodilator in a pMDI, combining glycopyrronium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA). PMDIs are an important choice for COPD patients where limited lung function, advanced age and reduced dexterity or cognition are significant considerations for patients to achieve therapeutic benefits from their medicines.9,10 Bevespi Aerosphere is the only LABA/LAMA with Aerosphere delivery technology. Results from an imaging trial have shown that Bevespi Aerosphere effectively delivers medicine to both the large and small airways.11

The conditional MAA is expected to be issued in coming days
 Earlier, the EMA has recommended the compassionate use of remdesivir, which allows a drug to be administered to patients even before it has been fully authorized
 Additionally, Guido Rasi stated that other possible treatments that may be available fast are mAbs, that can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2","BRUSSELS (Reuters) – The head of the European Union’s medicines agency Guido Rasi said on Monday an initial authorisation for U.S. pharmaceutical company Gilead’s remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment could be granted in coming days.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has already recommended the compassionate use of remdesivir, which allows a drug to be administered to patients even before it has been fully authorised.

“It might be that a conditional market authorisation can be issued in the coming days,” Rasi told a hearing in the EU Parliament in Brussels.

Apart from remdesivir, Rasi said other possible treatments against COVID-19 that may be available fast are those based on monoclonal antibodies, which can “neutralize” the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the illness COVID-19",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Gilead-3.jpg,COVID-19|Regulatory,Gilead | EMA,Remdesivir,COVID-19|Regulatory|Coming Days|Grant|Initial Authorization,publish,18/5/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/remdesivir-close-to-eus-initial-authorisation-as-covid-19-treatment/,https://pharmashots.com/33239/ema-to-grant-initial-authorization-to-gileads-remdesivir-covid-19-in-coming-days/

mRNA-1273 provided full protection against viral replication in the lungs in a mouse challenge model

Anticipated dose for Phase 3 study between 25 µg and 100 µg; expected to start in July

Conference call to be held on Monday, May 18 at 8:30 a.m. ET

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–May 18, 2020– Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced positive interim clinical data of mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate against novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), from the Phase 1 study led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Immunogenicity data are currently available for the 25 µg and 100 µg dose level (ages 18-55) after two doses (day 43) and at the 250 µg level (ages 18-55) after one dose (day 29). Dose dependent increases in immunogenicity were seen across the three dose levels, and between prime and boost within the 25 µg and 100 µg dose levels. All participants ages 18-55 (n=15 per cohort) across all three dose levels seroconverted by day 15 after a single dose. At day 43, two weeks following the second dose, at the 25 µg dose level (n=15), levels of binding antibodies were at the levels seen in convalescent sera (blood samples from people who have recovered from COVID-19) tested in the same assay. At day 43, at the 100 µg dose level (n=10), levels of binding antibodies significantly exceeded the levels seen in convalescent sera. Samples are not yet available for remaining participants.

At this time, neutralizing antibody data are available only for the first four participants in each of the 25 µg and 100 µg dose level cohorts. Consistent with the binding antibody data, mRNA-1273 vaccination elicited neutralizing antibodies in all eight of these participants, as measured by plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assays against live SARS-CoV-2. The levels of neutralizing antibodies at day 43 were at or above levels generally seen in convalescent sera.

mRNA-1273 was generally safe and well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with that seen in prior Moderna infectious disease vaccine clinical studies. The sole incidence of a grade 3 adverse event in the 25 µg and 100 µg dose cohorts was a single participant at 100 µg who experienced grade 3 erythema (redness) around the injection site. To date, the most notable adverse events were seen at the 250 µg dose level, comprising three participants with grade 3 systemic symptoms, only following the second dose. All adverse events have been transient and self-resolving. No grade 4 adverse events or serious adverse events have been reported.

Preclinical results from a viral challenge study in mice conducted in collaboration with NIAID and its academic partners are also available. In this study, vaccination with mRNA-1273 prevented viral replication in the lungs of animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing titers in Phase 1 clinical trial participants at the 25 µg and 100 µg dose levels were consistent with neutralizing titers that were protective in the mouse challenge model.

Based on the interim Phase 1 data, the Moderna-led Phase 2 study will be amended to study two dose levels, 50 µg and 100 µg, with the aim of selecting a dose for pivotal studies. The NIAID-led Phase 1 study is being amended to include a 50 µg dose level cohort across each of the three age groups. Modernaanticipates the dose for the Phase 3 study to be between 25 µg and 100 µg and expects Phase 3 trial initiation in July, subject to finalization of the clinical trial protocol.

“These interim Phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection starting with a dose as low as 25 µg,” said Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Moderna. “When combined with the success in preventing viral replication in the lungs of a pre-clinical challenge model at a dose that elicited similar levels of neutralizing antibodies, these data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials.”

“With today’s positive interim Phase 1 data and the positive data in the mouse challenge model, the Moderna team continues to focus on moving as fast as safely possible to start our pivotal Phase 3 study in July and, if successful, file a BLA,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer at Moderna. “We are investing to scale up manufacturing so we can maximize the number of doses we can produce to help protect as many people as we can from SARS-CoV-2.”

Funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), supported the planning for the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of mRNA-1273 and will also support the execution of these studies, as well as the scale-up of mRNA-1273 manufacturing both at the Company’s facilities and that of its strategic collaborator, Lonza Ltd.

About mRNA-1273

mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was selected by Moderna in collaboration with investigators from Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing; it was shipped to NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection. The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing.

On May 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed its review of the Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for mRNA-1273 allowing it to proceed to a Phase 2 study, which is expected to begin shortly. On May 12, the FDA granted mRNA-1273 Fast Track designation. Moderna is finalizing the protocol for a Phase 3 study, expected to begin in July 2020. A summary of the company’s work to date on SARS-CoV-2 can be found here.

About Moderna’s Prophylactic Vaccines Modality

Moderna scientists designed the company’s prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent infectious diseases. More than 1,400 participants have been enrolled in Moderna’s infectious disease vaccine clinical studies under health authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Clinical data demonstrate that Moderna’s proprietary vaccine technology has been generally well-tolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens. Based on clinical experience across Phase 1 studies, the company designated prophylactic vaccines a core modality and is working to accelerate the development of its vaccine pipeline.

The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine, rapid discovery to respond to emerging pandemic threats and manufacturing agility derived from the platform nature of mRNA vaccine design and production. Moderna has built a fully integrated manufacturing plant which enables the promise of the technology platform.

Moderna currently has nine development candidates in its prophylactic vaccines modality, including:

Vaccines against respiratory infections

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults (mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1172 or V172 with Merck)
RSV vaccine for young children (mRNA-1345)
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) vaccine (mRNA-1653)
Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (mRNA-1273)
Influenza H7N9 (mRNA-1851)
Vaccines against infections transmitted from mother to baby

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (mRNA-1647)
Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893 with BARDA)
Vaccines against highly prevalent viral infections

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine (mRNA-1189)
To date, Moderna has demonstrated positive Phase 1 data readouts for seven prophylactic vaccines (H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3, CMV and Zika). Moderna’s CMV vaccine is currently in a Phase 2 dose-confirmation study. Moderna’s investigational Zika vaccine (mRNA-1893), currently in a Phase 1 study, was granted FDA Fast Track designation in August 2019.

“We are pleased to offer people with certain types of lung cancer a new chemotherapy-free option that can help prolong their lives and be administered on a flexible dosing schedule, including an option for once-a-month Tecentriq infusions,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “Today marks the fifth approval of Tecentriq in lung cancer, as we remain committed to providing an effective and tailored treatment option for every person diagnosed with this disease.”

This approval is based on an interim analysis from the Phase III IMpower110 study, which showed Tecentriq monotherapy improved overall survival (OS) by 7.1 months compared with chemotherapy (median OS=20.2 versus 13.1 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.59, 95% CI: 0.40–0.89; p=0.0106) in people with high PD-L1 expression (TC3/IC3-wild-type [WT]). Safety for Tecentriq appeared to be consistent with its known safety profile, and no new safety signals were identified. Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 12.9% of people receiving Tecentriq compared with 44.1% of people receiving chemotherapy.

Tecentriq is the first and only single-agent cancer immunotherapy with three dosing options, allowing administration every two, three or four weeks. The supplemental Biologics License Application for the Tecentriq monotherapy was granted Priority Review, a designation given to medicines the FDA has determined to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease.

In the U.S., Tecentriq has received four approvals across NSCLC, including as a single agent or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies. It is also approved in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (chemotherapy) for the first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

Genentech has an extensive development program for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.

About the IMpower110 study

IMpower110 is a Phase III, randomized, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq monotherapy compared with cisplatin or carboplatin and pemetrexed or gemcitabine (chemotherapy) in PD-L1-selected, chemotherapy-naïve participants with stage IV non-squamous or squamous NSCLC. The study enrolled 572 people, of whom 554 were in the intention-to-treat WT population, which excluded people with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and were randomized 1:1 to receive:

Tecentriq monotherapy, until disease progression (or loss of clinical benefit, as assessed by the investigator), unacceptable toxicity or death; or
Cisplatin or carboplatin (per investigator discretion) combined with either pemetrexed (non-squamous) or gemcitabine (squamous), followed by maintenance therapy with pemetrexed alone (non-squamous) or best supportive care (squamous) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death.
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS by PD-L1 subgroup (TC3/IC3-WT; TC2/3/IC2/3-WT; and TC1,2,3/IC1,2,3-WT), as determined by the SP142 assay test. Key secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).

About lung cancer

According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that more than 228,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2020, and NSCLC accounts for 80-85% of all lung cancers. It is estimated that approximately 85% of lung cancer diagnoses in the United States are made when the disease is in the advanced stages.

About Tecentriq® (atezolizumab)

Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1. Tecentriq is designed to bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the re-activation of T cells. Tecentriq may also affect normal cells.

Tecentriq U.S. Indications

Tecentriq is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with:

A type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

About Huntington’s Disease

A rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington’s Disease has an overall prevalence rate in Asia of 0.40/100,000, with an average age at onset of 40 years.1 Chorea – involuntary, random and sudden, twisting and/or writhing movements – is one of the most striking physical manifestations of this disease and occurs in approximately 90% of patients.

About Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder characterized by repetitive and uncontrollable movements of the tongue, lips, face, trunk and extremities. The often-debilitating disorder affects about 500,000 people in the United States and is usually a result of treatment with widely used medications for psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder or the gastrointestinal agent, metoclopramide. The prevalence of TD in China is 33.7%2 in individuals with Schizophrenia receiving long-term treatment with antipsychotics and can be caused by certain medications used to treat mental health conditions, which means that up to one third of treated Schizophrenia patients may have TD. The disease not only affects the treatment adherence of patients, but also affects their quality of life and their social functioning. This is the first approved treatment TD in China.

About AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine)

AUSTEDO® is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults and for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease.

“We are excited to share this news on the development of our first treatment for ophthalmic diseases,” said Seongwon Han, Medical Team Leader at Samsung Bioepis. He continued, “These 24-week interim results suggest that SB11 will be a valuable treatment option for nAMD, potentially helping millions of patients worldwide.”

The study achieved its primary endpoints which were the change from baseline in best corrected visual activity (BCVA) at Week 8 and central subfield thickness (CST) at Week 4. The least squares (LS) mean change in BCVA was 6.2 letters for SB11, compared with 7.0 letters for reference ranibizumab. The LS mean change in CST was −108.4 μm for SB11 vs −100.1 μm for reference ranibizumab. The confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the two treatments in BCVA and CST was within the predefined equivalence margins.

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 66.0% for SB11 and 66.9% for reference ranibizumab. The overall incidence of anti-drug antibodies was low (3.0% for SB11 vs 3.1% for reference ranibizumab). Pharmacokinetic (PK) serum concentrations also appeared comparable.

This data was to be presented at Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting 2020 which has been cancelled due to COVID-19.

Samsung Bioepis announced in November 2019 that it has entered into a new commercialization agreement with Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) for two ophthalmology biosimilar candidates, SB11 (ranibizumab) and SB15 (aflibercept), in the United States (US), Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia.

SB11 Phase 3 Study

The SB11 Phase 3 study was a randomized, double-masked, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of SB11 compared to reference ranibizumab in patients with nAMD. 705 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive SB11 or reference ranibizumab in monthly injections (0.5 mg). The primary endpoints were BCVA and CST. Equivalence was declared if the two-sided 90% CI of the difference of the LS mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 8 between two treatments was within the pre-defined margin of ± 3 letters and if the two-sided 95% CI of the difference of the LS mean change from baseline in CST at Week 4 between two treatments was within the pre-defined margin of ± 36 μm. Secondary endpoints were safety, PK, and immunogenicity.

About nAMD

nAMD is a form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD); a disease that impacts the central area of the retina in the eye (the macula). AMD is a leading cause of blindness in people aged 60 and over,ii however many people do not immediately recognize the symptoms, mistaking it for a normal sign of ageing. This leads to the more severe condition, nAMD, where new and abnormal blood vessels grow uncontrollably under the macula, causing swelling, bleeding and fibrosis.

Innovent and MD Anderson will co-fund the development activities for sintilimab, which may include multiple clinical research studies to be conducted by MD Anderson
 The collaboration provides Innovent an opportunity to pursue the US FDA’s approval of sintilimab for multiple rare cancer indications in addition to larger cancer indications that Innovent is independently pursuing for approval as well","SUZHOU, China, and HOUSTON, May 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Innovent Biologics, Inc. (“Innovent”) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high-quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune, metabolic and other major diseases, and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center today announced a strategic collaboration agreement to co-develop TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), Innovent’s anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in rare cancers in the U. S..

The joint development will focus on advancing sintilimab as an effective immune checkpoint inhibitor for patients with rare cancer types. This research will be enabled by MD Anderson’s experience in conducting clinical trials for even the rarest cancers not often seen by other centers. These studies will provide opportunities for Innovent to pursue approval of sintilimab by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for multiple rare cancer indications in addition to larger cancer indications for sintilimab that Innovent is independently pursuing for approval as well.

“TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) was approved in 2018 by the National Medical Products Association (NMPA) in China for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after second-line or later systemic chemotherapy, where it is currently being evaluated in additional clinical trials for solid tumors” said Dr. Michael Yu, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Innovent. “We believe TYVYT® has great potential in various tumor types, both as a single agent and in combination with other inhibiting agents, and currently we are conducting more than 20 related clinical trials including over 10 registration clinical trials. Through this new co-development collaboration, we will work to advance TYVYT® into rare tumors, where we hope it will continue to demonstrate its efficacy across multiple tumor types.”

“We look forward to working with Innovent and utilizing our unique expertise in treating rare cancers to advance sintilimab toward potential FDA approval,” said Ferran Prat, Ph.D., J.D., senior vice president for Research Administration and Industry Relations at MD Anderson. “The introduction of sintilimab to the U.S. would broaden the treatment options available to patients with rare cancer types, many of whom do not currently have an effective standard of care available.”

Under the agreement, Innovent and MD Anderson will co-fund the development activities for sintilimab, which may include multiple clinical research studies to be conducted by MD Anderson. MD Anderson plans to develop an approach, upon commercialization in rare diseases, to allow royalty payments it receives on sales of the product in the U.S. to be used to fund care for uninsured patients.

About TYVYT® (Sintilimab Injection)

TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), an innovative drug developed with global quality standards jointly developed by Innovent and Lilly in China, has been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after second-line or later systemic chemotherapy, and included in the 2019 Guidelines of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology for Lymphoid Malignancies. TYVYT is the only PD-1 inhibitor that has been included in the new Catalogue of the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), in November 2019. In April 2020, the NMPA accepted the supplemental new drug application for TYVYT in combination with ALIMTA® (pemetrexed) and platinum as first-line therapy in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In May 2020, TYVYT combined with Gemzar®(gemcitabine for injection) and platinum chemotherapy met the predefined primary endpoint in the Phase 3 ORIENT-12 study as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC, TYVYT monotherapy met the primary endpoint in the ORIENT-2 study as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well.

33351,AveXis Receives EC's Conditional Approval and Activates â€œDay Oneâ€ Access Program for Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) to Treat Spinal Muscular Atrophy,"AveXis receives EC approval and activates “Day One” access program for Zolgensma, the only gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)","The EC’s approval is based on P-III STR1VE-US and P-I START studies assessing the efficacy & safety of a one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in symptomatic SMA Type 1 patients aged <6 mos. at dosing, with one/ two copies of the SMN2 backup gene, or two copies of the SMN2 backup gene, respectively
 Zolgensma has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in pre/ symptomatic SMA, including prolonged event-free survival and achievement of motor milestones unseen in natural history of the disease and to date, sustained for 5 yrs. post-dosing. Additional supportive data include the results from ongoing P-III SPR1NT study
 AveXis is in talks with EU governments and reimbursement agencies to agree on terms of innovative “Day One” access program, enabling its access in all EU countries. Immediate access to Zolgensma, aligned to the label, is available in France through the ATU framework and expected shortly in Germany","Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is conditionally approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1; or SMA patients with up to three copies of the SMN2 gene
Zolgensma has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SMA, including prolonged event-free survival and achievement of motor milestones unseen in natural history of the disease and to date, sustained for 5 years post-dosing 
Immediate access to Zolgensma, aligned to the label, is available in France through the ATU framework and expected shortly in Germany
AveXis in discussions with EU governments and reimbursement agencies to agree on terms of innovative “Day One” access program to enable rapid access in all EU countries given urgent need to treat SMA
Basel, May 19, 2020 – AveXis, a Novartis company, today announced the European Commission (EC) granted conditional approval for Zolgensma®(onasemnogene abeparvovec) for the treatment of patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1; or for patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to three copies of the SMN2 gene. The approval covers babies and young children with SMA up to 21 kg according to the approved dosing guidance.

In Europe each year, approximately 550–600 infants are born with SMA, a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.1,2,3Zolgensma is a one-time gene therapy designed to address the genetic root cause of the disease by replacing the function of the missing or nonworking SMN1 gene. Administered during a single, intravenous (IV) infusion, Zolgensma delivers a new working copy of the SMN1 gene into a patient’s cells, halting disease progression. According to Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research (PNCR) natural history study of SMA, almost all patients under the age of five years of age will be under 21kg with some patients at 6, 7 or 8 weighing below 21 kg.4 AveXis is planning a product presentation that allows for treatment of patients weighing up to 21 kg and is working with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to finalize supply timelines.

“The EC approval of Zolgensma is a significant milestone for the SMA community, and further underscores the substantial clinical value of the only gene therapy for SMA, bringing new hope to those impacted by this rare, but devastating disease.” said Dave Lennon, president of AveXis. “Even under the current pandemic conditions, the urgent need to treat SMA has resulted in access pathways in France and Germany for Zolgensma, a potentially life-saving medicine delivered in a single dose. Additionally, we have met with more than 100 stakeholder organizations across Europe to discuss our “Day One” access program to enable rapid access with customizable options designed to work within local pricing and reimbursement frameworks.”

SMA is a significant burden to the healthcare system in Europe with cumulative estimated healthcare costs per child ranging between €2.5 to €4 million within the first 10 years alone.5 Zolgensma is a transformative and highly innovative one-time gene therapy for a devastating and progressive genetic disease and is consistently priced worldwide under a value-based framework, however final pricing and reimbursement decisions are determined at the local level. Designed to work within existing, local pricing and reimbursement frameworks, the “Day One” access program offers ministries of health and reimbursement bodies a variety of flexible options that can be implemented immediately to support swift access and broad reimbursement.

The “Day One” access program ensures the cost of patients treated before national pricing and reimbursement agreements are in place align with the value-based prices negotiated following clinical and economic assessments. The program maintains the integrity of the local pricing and reimbursement frameworks with a variety of customizable options including:

Retroactive rebates ensuring early access costs are aligned with negotiated prices following local clinical and economic assessment processes
Deferred payments and installment options allowing reimbursement bodies to manage budget impact during the early access phase
Outcomes-based rebates negotiated following clinical and economic assessments can be applied to patients treated during the early access period
Robust training for treating institutions on administration and follow-up care
Access to RESTORE, a global registry of patients who have been diagnosed with SMA that draws upon existing country registries
Immediate access to Zolgensma, aligned to the label, is available in France through the ATU framework and expected shortly in Germany.

“Today’s approval brings tangible progress in harnessing the transformational power of gene therapy,” said Dr. Eugenio Mercuri, Professor, Pediatric Neurology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. “The approval of Zolgensma represents an important new way for physicians to treat patients with SMA. The results we have seen for Zolgensma to date from the STR1VE clinical trial show an impressive survival rate at the conclusion of the study, with the majority of patients achieving functional milestones, like sitting without support, that wouldn’t have been reached in untreated infants.”

“SMA Europe receives with deep excitement the news on the approval by the European Commission, of a gene therapy for treating a part of our community,” said Mencía de Lemus, President of SMA Europe. “Many hopes have been put into this much awaited therapy. It will be now be up to all stakeholders involved to ensure that treating doctors, together with parents, can take the best therapeutic option based on the benefit that each of them can provide to each individual. Gathering more data on how Zolgensma impacts in the lives of patients will be extremely important to better understand the potential of this new therapy on improving lives of those living with SMA.”

The EC approval is based on the completed Phase 3 STR1VE-US and Phase 1 START trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of a one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in symptomatic SMA Type 1 patients <6 months of age at dosing, who had one or two copies of the SMN2 backup gene, or two copies of the SMN2 backup gene, respectively. STR1VE-EU, a comparable Phase 3 study is ongoing. Zolgensma demonstrated prolonged event-free survival; rapid motor function improvement, often within one month of dosing; and, sustained milestone achievement, including the ability to sit without support, crawl and walk independently – milestones never achieved in untreated Type 1 patients.6

Additional supportive data included interim results from the ongoing SPR1NT trial, a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm study of a single, one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in pre-symptomatic patients (<6 weeks at age of dosing) genetically defined by bi-allelic deletion of SMN1 with 2 or 3 copies of SMN2. These data demonstrate rapid, age appropriate major milestone gain, reinforcing the critical importance of early intervention in SMA patients.5

The most commonly observed side effects after treatment were elevated liver enzymes and vomiting. Acute serious liver injury and elevated aminotransferases can occur. Patients with pre-existing liver impairment may be at higher risk. Prior to infusion, physicians should assess liver function of all patients by clinical examination and laboratory testing. And, they should administer systemic corticosteroid to all patients before and after treatment, and then continue to monitor liver function for at least 3 months after infusion.6 There is limited experience in patients 2 years of age and older or with body weight above 13.5 kg. The safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in these patients have not been established.

AveXis has an exclusive, worldwide license with Nationwide Children’s Hospital to both the intravenous and intrathecal delivery of AAV9 gene therapy for the treatment of all types of SMA; has an exclusive, worldwide license from REGENXBIO for any recombinant AAV vector in its intellectual property portfolio for the in vivo gene therapy treatment of SMA in humans; an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Généthon for in vivo delivery of AAV9 vector into the central nervous system for the treatment of SMA; and a non-exclusive, worldwide license agreement with AskBio for the use of its self-complementary DNA technology for the treatment of SMA.

About Spinal Muscular Atrophy
SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death.2,3 If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases.7,8 SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, resulting in the progressive and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.2 It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.9 This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities.10 More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.11

About Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec)
Zolgensma® is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma represents the first approved therapeutic in the company’s proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy.1 More than 500 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program. AveXis is pursuing registration in close to three dozen countries with regulatory decisions anticipated in Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Argentina, South Korea and Brazil in late 2020 or early 2021.1

In May 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zolgensma for the treatment of pediatric patients less than two years of age with SMA with bi-allelic mutations in the SMN1 gene.12 In the U.S. nearly all on-label patients have been approved by their payer for access to Zolgensma. On March 19, 2020, Zolgensma was approved by Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of SMA in patients under the age of two, including those who are pre-symptomatic at diagnosis.13 Today’s EC approval applies to all 27 European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and the United Kingdom.

33376,Roche Launches Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Blood Test in the US,Roche highly accurate antibody test for COVID-19 goes live at more than 20 initial lab sites in the US,"Roche reported that its Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab test is live at 20+ commercial and hospital lab sites throughout the US and a plan to increase to 200+ commercial and hospital lab sites in the next several wks. with the ability to perform millions of tests/ week
 Earlier, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab test has received the US FDA’s EUA. The company has 3,000+ analyzers that perform Ab test installed across the US
 The Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 test is based on an in-solution double-antigen sandwich format that can detect Abs against COVID-19 and has 99.8% specificity and demonstrated no cross-reactivity to the common cold, HIV and other coronaviruses. The launch will allow LabCorp and other commercial labs to perform 2M+ tests/ week by June","INDIANAPOLIS, May 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Roche (SIX: RO, ROG;OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced its Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test is live at more than 20 commercial and hospital lab sites throughout the United States, with plans in the next several weeks to increase to more than 200 commercial and hospital lab sites with the ability to perform millions of tests per week. The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA earlier this month.

“Roche is proud to make this highly accurate serology test available in the U.S. to determine if a person has developed antibodies to COVID-19,” said Matt Sause, President and CEO of Roche Diagnostics North America. “Reliable, high-quality antibody testing is essential to help us overcome this pandemic and will play an important role in getting people back to work. We are proud to partner with LabCorp in making this test available in the U.S.”

The Roche antibody test is uniquely designed to identify mature (high affinity) antibodies developed late in the immune response, significantly reducing the chance of a false positive result. It provides 99.8 percent specificity, which is greater than previously available antibody tests. This specificity is crucial to determine reliably if a person has been exposed to the virus and has developed antibodies. Tests with lower specificity and sensitivity can lead to a high number of misidentified cases in a population. A false positive result may put a patient at risk by indicating they have antibodies when they do not.

“Our long-standing relationship and collaboration with Roche enables us to introduce many innovative, high-quality tests for clinicians and patients, which is more important now than ever before,” said Dr. Brian Caveney, chief medical officer and president of LabCorp Diagnostics. “Roche’s new antibody test allows LabCorp to provide more options and increase COVID-19 testing capacity as we support the country’s response to the health crisis.”

Roche has more than 3,000 analyzers that perform the antibody test installed across the United States. Roche is distributing millions of tests per week to U.S. labs that can implement quickly, enable the broadest geographic reach and provide testing to areas hardest hit by COVID-19.

Roche is working to meet demand by scaling global production rapidly in an effort to expand broader access as quickly as possible.

Healthcare providers can order the test for patients through their normal clinical laboratory process.

About the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test
The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test, which is based on an in-solution double-antigen sandwich format, can detect antibodies to the new coronavirus causing COVID-19, which could signal whether a person has already been infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. Based on the measurement of a total of 5272 samples, the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has 99.8% specificity and shows no cross-reactivity to the common cold, HIV and other coronaviruses. This means it can lower the chance of false positives due to the detection of similar antibodies that may be present in an individual. Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 detected antibodies with 100% sensitivity in samples taken 14 days after a PCR-confirmed infection. As of 24 April 2020, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans.

More information for healthcare providers, patients and the general public is available at diagnostics.roche.com. Technical information about the test is available at Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test.

About Emergency Use Authorization Status
The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test has not been FDA cleared or approved. It has been authorized by FDA under an EUA for use by authorized laboratories. This test has been authorized only for detecting the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens. It is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

33391,Eiger BioPharmaceuticals Reports the US FDA's Acceptance of NDA for Zokinvy (lonafarnib) to Treat Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies,Eiger BioPharmaceuticals Announces FDA Acceptance of NDA for Filing with Priority Review of Zokinvy (lonafarnib) for Treatment of Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies,"The US FDA has accepted the NDA for accelerated review of Zokinvy (lonafarnib) and has granted PR designation with the anticipated PDUFA date as Nov 20, 2020. The US FDA is not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application
 The NDA includes the data from the study published in JAMA 2018 that demonstrated an 88% reduction in the risk of mortality in patients with Progeria treated with Zokinvy as monothx. After 2.2yrs follow up, Zokinvy reported lower mortality rate as compared with no treatment (3.7% vs 33.3%)
 Zokinvy is an orally active inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, an enzyme involved in modification of proteins via prenylation and has received FDA & EMA’s ODD and FDA’s BTD & RPD designation","PALO ALTO, Calif., May 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:EIGR), focused on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for accelerated review of Zokinvy™ (lonafarnib) for treatment of Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies. The FDA granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of November 20, 2020. The FDA is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application. Zokinvy for treatment of Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation.

“The acceptance of our first NDA is a significant milestone for Eiger, and an important step toward bringing a treatment to children and young adults with Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies,” said David Cory, President and CEO of Eiger. “We would like to thank The Progeria Research Foundation (PRF) for their commitment, persistence and dedication. Most importantly, we are grateful to all the children with Progeria and their families who have made this possible by participating in the lonafarnib clinical trials. We are preparing for the commercial launch of Zokinvy in the U.S and Europe.”

The Zokinvy NDA includes data from a study published by Gordon et al in Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) 2018 which demonstrated a survival benefit with an 88% reduction in the risk of mortality in patients with Progeria treated with lonafarnib monotherapy. The most commonly reported adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Many patients with Progeria have received continuous lonafarnib therapy for greater than 10 years. There is currently no approved therapy for Progeria or Progeroid Laminopathies.

“This milestone is the culmination of twelve years of clinical trials, treating children from over 30 countries and six continents with Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies,” stated Leslie Gordon, MD, PhD, PRF Medical Director. “We are fortunate to have Eiger as a partner for the preparation and filing of the NDA and providing continuous Zokinvy (lonafarnib) drug supply to children and young adults with Progeria. We are grateful to all the children with Progeria and their families. Their courage inspires all of us, every day.”

About Progeria 
Progeria, also known as Hutchinson‐Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), is an ultra-rare and fatal genetic condition of accelerated aging in children. Progeria is caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene, which encodes the lamin A protein, yielding the farnesylated aberrant protein, progerin. Lamin A protein is part of the structural scaffolding that holds the nucleus together. Without lonafarnib therapy, children with Progeria die of the same heart disease that affects millions of normally aging adults (arteriosclerosis), but at an average age of 14.5 years. Disease manifestations include severe failure to thrive, scleroderma‐like skin, global lipodystrophy, alopecia, joint contractures, skeletal dysplasia, global accelerated atherosclerosis with cardiovascular decline, and debilitating strokes. It is estimated that 400 children worldwide have Progeria.

About Progeroid Laminopathies 
Progeroid Laminopathies are genetic conditions of accelerated aging caused by a constellation of mutations in the lamin A and/or Zmpste24 genes yielding farnesylated proteins that are distinct from progerin. While non‐progerin producing, these genetic mutations result in disease manifestations with phenotypes that have overlap with, but are distinct from, Progeria. Collectively, worldwide prevalence of Progeroid Laminopathies is similar to Progeria.

About Zokinvy (lonafarnib) 
Zokinvy is a well‐characterized, late‐stage, orally active inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, an enzyme involved in modification of proteins through a process called prenylation. Progerin is a farnesylated, aberrant protein that researchers believe cannot be cleaved, resulting in tight association with the nuclear envelope, which leads to changes in nuclear envelope morphology and subsequent cellular damage.

Zokinvy blocks the farnesylation of progerin and has been dosed in over 90 children with Progeria at Boston Children’s Hospital in Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 studies. In patients with HGPS, Zokinvy monotherapy was associated with a lower mortality rate after 2.2 years of follow-up compared with no treatment (3.7% vs 33.3%, respectively) with a hazard ratio of 0.12 or a reduction in risk of mortality of 88% (Gordon et al, JAMA 2018).

Zokinvy has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for Progeria by the FDA and EMA and Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation by the FDA. Zokinvy (lonafarnib) is not approved for any indication, and is licensed by Eiger from Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.

FDA has conditionally accepted the proposed brand name Zokinvy™ for lonafarnib for treatment of Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies. Final approval of the Zokinvy brand name is conditional on FDA approval of the product candidate, lonafarnib.

About The Progeria Research Foundation 
The Progeria Research Foundation (PRF) was established in 1999 by the family of Sam Berns, a child with Progeria. Within four years of its founding, the PRF Genetics Consortium, in collaboration with Francis Collins, MD, PhD, discovered the Progeria gene. PRF has funded and co-coordinated all lonafarnib-associated clinical trials for Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies, conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital, and supports scientists who conduct Progeria research worldwide. PRF is the only non-profit organization solely dedicated to finding treatments and the cure for Progeria and its age-related conditions, including heart disease. PRF’s International Patient Registry includes over 300 children with Progeria in more than 65 countries. For more information, please visit www.progeriaresearch.org.

About Eiger
Eiger is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of first-in-class, well-characterized drugs for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases for patients with high unmet medical needs, for which no approved therapies exist.

The NDA and MAA submissions for Zokinvy for the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS or Progeria) and Progeroid Laminopathies have been accepted for filing. Eiger has also established a global Managed Access Program, expected to span greater than 40 countries, to ensure all children and young adults with Progeria and Progeroid Laminopathies have access to treatment.

Management to Host Conference Call at 8:00 a.m. ET Today
LEXINGTON, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–May 20, 2020– Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALDX) (Aldeyra), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel therapies with the potential to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases, today announced the planned advancement of the investigational new HSP90 inhibitor ADX-1612 to clinical testing for COVID-19, and provided an update on ADX-629, a novel investigational RASP inhibitor in development for COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases.

ADX-1612, which has been clinically tested in more than 1,600 subjects for the potential treatment of cancer, is an inhibitor of chaperone protein HSP90, a target widely implicated in viral disease.1 Aldeyra announced that ADX-1612 has demonstrated nanomolar potency similar to or greater than that of remdesivir in an in vitro model. Complementary to the nucleic acid inhibition mechanism of action of remdesivir and related antiviral compounds, ADX-1612 potentially leads to the inhibition of proteins associated with viral replication and infection, and thereby may enhance the activity of other antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Importantly, via comprehensive expression profiling of human cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2, HSP90 was recently identified as a key pharmaceutical target for viral inhibition.2 Pending FDA feedback, an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission for ADX-1612 is expected in the third quarter of 2020.

Aldeyra also announced that ADX-629, a novel orally administered investigational RASP inhibitor, has been granted a BARDA CoronaWatch meeting. ADX-629 has completed pre-IND discussions with the Pulmonary Division of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, and Aldeyra expects to submit an IND application in June 2020. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by cytokine release syndrome, which may lead to respiratory compromise, often including the requirement for mechanical ventilation. In a preclinical model of cytokine storm, ADX-629 has demonstrated broad-based reductions across a variety of TH1, TH2, and TH17 inflammatory cytokines, while upregulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.

“The nanomolar potency of ADX-1612 against SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro model announced today is consistent with a broad array of mechanistic target validation, in vitro viral inhibition, and preliminary clinical data that support investigation of ADX-1612 for the treatment of COVID-19,” stated Todd C. Brady, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aldeyra. “In addition, we are pleased to announce that ADX-629, a novel investigational immune-modulating drug, continues to progress toward clinical testing in COVID-19-associated respiratory compromise as part of a systematic approach to identify activity across a variety of different inflammatory diseases.”

Aldeyra announced that, in addition to the planned COVID-19 clinical trial, the current Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial of ADX-1612 in ovarian cancer (the Phase 2 EUDARIO Trial) is expected to complete enrollment in June 2020. Aldeyra previously announced that Phase 2a clinical trials of ADX-629 in psoriasis and atopic asthma are expected to initiate in the second half of 2020.

Roxadustat is a first-in-class, hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), approved and launched to treat anemia associated with CKD in Japan in DD patients and in China in both DD and NDD patients","TOKYO and SAN FRANCISCO, May 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and FibroGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: FGEN, CEO: Enrique Conterno, “FibroGen”) today announced the marketing authorization application (MAA) for roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for regulatory review.

The MAA is supported by positive results from a pivotal Phase 3 program, which involved more than 9,000 patients worldwide.1-7 The MAA dossier includes the DOLOMITES study, the results of which will be disclosed later this year.8,9 Results from these studies support roxadustat as efficacious in increasing and maintaining target hemoglobin levels with reduced use of intravenous iron in adult patients with CKD anemia, both those who are dialysis dependent (DD) and those non-dialysis dependent (NDD). These data also support a favorable risk:benefit profile with cardiovascular (CV) and general safety of roxadustat reflective of the underlying conditions of the CKD population.1–6

“This acceptance marks a significant milestone for roxadustat, which we believe has the potential to offer an important new oral therapeutic option in the EU for the management of anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease,” said Bernhardt G. Zeiher, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Astellas. “Chronic kidney disease impacts one in eight people in Europe, of whom one in five are affected by anemia that is often untreated or not treated to target. We look forward to the review and assessment by EMA in the hope of bringing this innovative treatment to patients across the EU.”

“There is significant unmet medical need for patients with anemia of CKD, a serious and often life-threatening disease,” said K. Peony Yu, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, FibroGen. “This submission and FibroGen’s recent submission of a New Drug Application in the U.S. are supported by positive results from the largest global phase 3 program in patients with CKD anemia. We look forward to working with Astellas during the EMA’s review of the MAA, and to the potential of roxadustat as a new therapeutic option for treating anemia in CKD patients on dialysis and not on dialysis across Europe.”

EMA’s acceptance of the roxadustat MAA for treatment of anemia in adult patients with CKD on dialysis and not on dialysis triggers a milestone payment of $130 million by Astellas to FibroGen.

About CKD and Anemia
CKD is a progressive loss of kidney function caused by damage to the kidneys resulting from conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or immune-regulated inflammatory conditions.10 Worldwide 1 in 10 people are living with CKD.11 In Europe 1 in 8 people are living with CKD,11 of whom 1 in 5 are affected by anemia, this rises to 1 in 2 in people with the most severe CKD (CKD stage 5).12 CKD is predicted to become the fifth most common cause of premature death globally by 2040.13 It is a critical worldwide healthcare issue that represents a large and growing unmet medical need.

Anemia is a common complication of CKD,14 resulting from the failing kidneys’ diminished ability to produce erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in dialysis and non-dialysis populations, increasing in both prevalence and severity as kidney disease worsens.15 Anemia associated with CKD increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, worsens renal outcomes and can negatively impact patients’ quality of life.16–18

About Roxadustat
Roxadustat is a first-in-class orally administered inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl­ hydroxylase (PH), which increases hemoglobin levels with a mechanism of action that is different from that of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. As a HIF-PH inhibitor, roxadustat activates a response that occurs naturally when the body responds to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. This response involves the regulation of multiple, complementary processes to promote erythropoiesis and to increase the blood’s oxygen-carrying capacity.

Roxadustat is approved and launched for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD in Japan in DD patients and in China in both DD and NDD patients. A supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) has been submitted to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for NDD patients and a New Drug Application (NDA) has been submitted in the US in both DD and NDD patients.

Astellas and FibroGen are collaborating on the development and commercialization of roxadustat for the potential treatment of anemia in territories including Japan, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East and South Africa. FibroGen and AstraZeneca are collaborating on the development and commercialization of roxadustat for the potential treatment of anemia in the US, China and other markets in the Americas and in Australia/New Zealand as well as Southeast Asia.

33425,Apple and Google Launch COVID-19 Exposure Notification System to Support Health Agencies,Exposure Notification API launches to support public health agencies,"Apple and Google have released their smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they have been exposed to the COVID-19. Last month, the companies collaborated to leverage their technology to trace the spread of coronavirus
 The software leverages Bluetooth technology to detect when someone with the app has in contact with another app user who tests positive for the COVID-19. The exposure notifications technology is available to public health agencies on both iOS and Android
 The companies stated that they are not trying to replace contact tracing, but their “exposure notification” system can augment the process and slow the spread of COVID-19. Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments stated that privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data","Note: The following is a joint statement from Apple and Google.

One of the most effective techniques that public health officials have used during outbreaks is called contact tracing. Through this approach, public health officials contact, test, treat and advise people who may have been exposed to an affected person. One new element of contact tracing is Exposure Notifications: using privacy-preserving digital technology to tell someone they may have been exposed to the virus. Exposure Notification has the specific goal of rapid notification, which is especially important to slowing the spread of the disease with a virus that can be spread asymptomatically.

To help, Apple and Google cooperated to build Exposure Notifications technology that will enable apps created by public health agencies to work more accurately, reliably and effectively across both Android phones and iPhones. Over the last several weeks, our two companies have worked together, reaching out to public health officials, scientists, privacy groups and government leaders all over the world to get their input and guidance.

Starting today, our Exposure Notifications technology is available to public health agencies on both iOS and Android. What we’ve built is not an app—rather public health agencies will incorporate the API into their own apps that people install. Our technology is designed to make these apps work better. Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to Exposure Notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app. User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.

Today, this technology is in the hands of public health agencies across the world who will take the lead and we will continue to support their efforts.

First agreements to supply at least 400 million doses; Company has total capacity sourced for one billion doses through 2020 and into 2021; continues to increase capacity further
More than $1bn US BARDA investment to support development and production of the vaccine 
AstraZeneca is advancing its ongoing response to address the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19, collaborating with a number of countries and multilateral organisations to make the University of Oxford’s vaccine widely accessible around the world in an equitable manner.

The Company has concluded the first agreements for at least 400 million doses and has secured total manufacturing capacity for one billion doses so far and will begin first deliveries in September 2020. AstraZeneca aims to conclude further agreements supported by several parallel supply chains, which will expand capacity further over the next months to ensure the delivery of a globally accessible vaccine.

AstraZeneca today received support of more than $1bn from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine, starting in the fall. The development programme includes a Phase III clinical trial with 30,000 participants and a paediatric trial.

In addition, the Company is engaging with international organisations such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organisation (WHO), for the fair allocation and distribution of the vaccine around the world. AstraZeneca is also in discussions with governments around the world to increase access. Furthermore, AstraZeneca is in discussions with the Serum Institute of India and other potential partners to increase production and distribution.

AstraZeneca recently joined forces with the UK Government to support Oxford University’s vaccine and has progressed rapidly in its efforts to expand access around the world. The Company will supply the UK starting in September and is thankful for the Government’s commitment and overall work on vaccines.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “This pandemic is a global tragedy and it is a challenge for all of humanity. We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world. We are so proud to be collaborating with Oxford University to turn their ground-breaking work into a medicine that can be produced on a global scale. We would like to thank the US and UK governments for their substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine. We will do everything in our power to make this vaccine quickly and widely available.”

AstraZeneca has now finalised its licence agreement with Oxford University for the recombinant adenovirus vaccine. The licensing of the vaccine, formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and now known as AZD1222, follows the recent global development and distribution agreement with the University’s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group. AstraZeneca has also agreed to support the establishment of a joint research centre at Oxford University for pandemic preparedness research.

A Phase I/II clinical trial of AZD1222 began last month to assess safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in over 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years across several trial centres in southern England. Data from the trial is expected shortly which, if positive, would lead to late-stage trials in a number of countries. AstraZeneca recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical program with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk.

The Company’s comprehensive pandemic response also includes rapid mobilisation of AstraZeneca’s global research efforts to discover novel coronavirus-neutralising antibodies to prevent and treat progression of the COVID-19 disease, with the aim of reaching clinical trials in the next three to five months. Additionally, the Company has quickly moved into testing of new and existing medicines to treat the infection, including CALAVI and ACCORD trials underway for Calquence (acalabrutinib) and DARE-19 trial for Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in COVID-19 patients.

Financial considerations

Today’s announcement is not anticipated to have any significant impact on the Company’s financial guidance for 2020; expenses to progress the vaccine are anticipated to be offset by funding by governments.

AZD1222

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, now known as AZD1222, was developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group. It uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold (adenovirus) virus that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.

The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to generate a strong immune response from a single dose and it is not replicating, so cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as a temperature, influenza-like symptoms, headache or a sore arm.

— Rates of Adverse Events Were Low and Comparable Across Treatment Groups —

FOSTER CITY, Calif. & MECHELEN, Belgium–(BUSINESS WIRE)–May 20, 2020– Gilead Sciences, Inc.(Nasdaq: GILD) and Galapagos NV (Euronext & Nasdaq: GLPG) today announced positive topline results from SELECTION, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b/3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the investigational, oral, once-daily, selective JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in 1,348 biologic-naïve or biologic-experienced adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Filgotinib 200 mg achieved all primary endpoints in the study, inducing clinical remission at Week 10 and maintaining clinical remission at Week 58 in a significantly higher proportion of patients compared with placebo. Filgotinib 100 mg did not achieve statistically significant clinical remission at Week 10.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200520005818/en/

In this trial, clinical remission was defined as an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and ≥ 1 point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1. Among the biologic-naïve cohort (Cohort A induction trial; n=659), 52 percent of patients had a baseline Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) of nine or higher. In the biologically-experienced cohort (Cohort B induction trial; n=689), 74 percent of patients had a baseline MCS of nine or higher, and 51 percent were previously treated with two different classes of biologics (TNFα antagonists and an integrin receptor antagonist).

Among biologic-naïve patients, a statistically significant higher proportion of patients achieved clinical remission at Week 10 when treated with filgotinib 200 mg (26.1 percent, p=0.0157) compared with placebo (15.3 percent). Among biologic-experienced patients, a statistically significant higher proportion of patients achieved clinical remission at Week 10 when treated with filgotinib 200 mg (11.5 percent, p=0.0103) compared with placebo (4.2 percent).

Patients who achieved clinical response or remission after 10 weeks of treatment with filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg were subsequently re-randomized to their induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58 (maintenance trial, n=558). Both doses of filgotinib achieved the primary endpoint in this maintenance trial. At Week 58, 37.2 percent of biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission, compared with 11.2 percent treated with placebo (p˂0.0001).

Of patients receiving filgotinib 100 mg, 23.8 percent achieved clinical remission at Week 58, compared with 13.5 percent treated with placebo (p=0.0420).

In the induction trial of biologic-naïve patients, the incidence of serious adverse events was similar across treatment groups (200 mg: 1.2 percent; 100 mg: 4.7 percent; placebo: 2.9 percent). In the induction trial of biologic-experienced patients, the incidence of serious adverse events was also similar across treatment groups (200 mg: 7.3 percent; 100 mg: 5.3 percent; placebo: 6.3 percent). There were no deaths in either induction cohort.

In the maintenance trial, 4.5 percent of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg experienced a serious adverse event, compared with none for their corresponding placebo; 4.5 percent of patients treated with filgotinib 100 mg experienced a serious adverse event, compared with 7.7 percent for their corresponding placebo.

Rates of serious infections, herpes zoster, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal perforation were low and comparable across treatment groups in both the induction and maintenance phases of the study. Two deaths were observed in the filgotinib 200 mg treatment group in the maintenance trial. One patient with pre-existing asthma died due to asthma exacerbation, and the second patient with pre-existing atherosclerosis died due to left ventricular heart failure per autopsy report. Neither death was assessed as related to study drug by the investigator.

“We are encouraged by the early response as an induction therapy and the durable efficacy as a maintenance therapy observed in the SELECTION trial,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “Patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis can struggle to effectively manage their disease. These topline data suggest that filgotinib could play a role in helping more patients achieve a meaningful and sustained improvement in treatment response with an oral therapy.”

“We are pleased to see that SELECTION results indicate that filgotinib can help ulcerative colitis patients, including those refractory to treatment, achieve and sustain remission for more than one year,” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer, Galapagos. “We believe that the results point to an efficacy and safety profile consistent with prior studies with filgotinib, and offer a meaningful contribution to the patient data with filgotinib from other inflammatory conditions. We look forward to presenting more detailed results to the scientific community.”

UC is a chronic, idiopathic inflammatory disease affecting the colon and often involves periods of remission interspersed with periods of active disease. Common symptoms of UC are bloody diarrhea and rectal urgency. UC is often diagnosed in people of working age who can face debilitating flares in their symptoms and progression of disease overtime. An estimated 40 percent of patients experience a relapse annuallyi and do not achieve sustained remission.

Detailed results from the SELECTION trial will be submitted for presentation at a future scientific conference.

Filgotinib is an investigational agent and is not approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority for any use. Regulatory submissions of filgotinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are currently under review by the FDA, European Medicines Agency, and Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The efficacy and safety of filgotinib have not been established. For information about the clinical trials with filgotinib: www.clinicaltrials.gov.

About the SELECTION Phase 2b/3 Trial

The SELECTION Phase 2b/3 trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the selective JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The SELECTION trial comprises 2 Induction Trials and a Maintenance Trial. The Cohort A Induction Trial enrolled biologic-naive patients, and the Cohort B Induction Trial enrolled biologic-experienced patients.

Across both induction studies, patients with moderately to severely active UC were randomized to receive filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. Moderately to severely active UC was defined as a centrally read endoscopy score ≥ 2, a rectal bleeding score ≥ 1, a stool frequency score ≥ 1 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of ≥ 2 based on the MCS. Patients with clinical remission or response at Week 10 of induction were subsequently re-randomized to the induction dose of filgotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and treated through Week 58.

The primary objectives of SELECTION are to evaluate the efficacy of filgotinib compared with placebo in establishing EBS clinical remission as determined by the Mayo Clinic endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and ≥ 1 point decrease in stool frequency from baseline to achieve a subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 10 and Week 58. Eligible patients who completed treatment in the SELECTION trial through Week 58 were enrolled in the ongoing SELECTION long-term extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety of filgotinib in patients with moderately to severely active UC.
