<p>The FDA’s approval was based on P-III ENLIVEN study results assessing Turalio vs PBO in 120 patients in the ratio (1:1) with symptomatic TGCT associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement with the surgery. The P-III ENLIVEN study results: @25wks. tumor response rate by RECIST v 1.1 (38% vs 0%); ORR by TVS (56% vs 0%). Turalio is approved with a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity due to the risk of liver injury. Turalio is the first oral therapy targeting CSF1R thus inhibiting the driver of abnormal cells in the synovium responsible for causing TGCT and has received FDA’s PR, BT, OD designation, currently under EMA’s review for TGCT.</p>

19775,PharmaShots' Key Highlights of Third Quarter 2019,,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third quarter of 2019 has ended with major acquisitions in the pharma and biotech industry along with multiple approvals. Starting with the latest acquisition where Biocon Biologics acquires Pfizer’s Research Facility for expansion of its R&amp;D footprints with the acceleration of the development of its biosimilars from lab to pilot scale. Previously, Amgen acquired Celgene’s Otezla (apremilast) for $13.4B to dispel the apprehensions lifted by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission due to a contending treatment being developed. Additionally, Bayer signed a license agreement with Informed Data Systems utilizing One Drop’s Digital Therapeutics platform for a better understanding of healthcare outcomes for patients with chronic conditions. The quarter also rolled major approvals for biosimilars i.e Samsung Bioepis' Hadlima (biosimilar, adalimumab) received FDA’s approval for autoimmune diseases as well as Teva Canada’s Herzuma (biosimilar, trastuzumab) received Health Canada’s for multiple cancer indications. Our team at PharmaShots has summarized and complied with the insights of Q3’19. </p>
