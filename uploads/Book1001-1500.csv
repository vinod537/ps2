<p class=""preamble"">A study by researchers at Karolinska Institutet shows that a treatment adjustment algorithm based on lung function and symptoms in a mobile phone can be an efficient tool in managing uncontrolled asthma. For fuss-free measuring of lung function, the phone connects to a wireless spirometer and the app can register respiratory symptoms and provide visual feedback on treatment. The study is published in the highly respected European Respiratory Journal.</p>

<div class=""paragraph--text-image__text"">
Asthma is a widespread disease that affects around 10 per cent of Sweden’s population. Approximately half the affected people have so-called uncontrolled asthma and frequently experience breathing difficulties or asthma attacks. Inadequate management and/or incorrect use of medicines are common causes of this.
“Previous research has shown that asthma sufferers’ health and quality of life improves with patient education that focuses on self-care, self-testing and clear management plans. Additionally, health and medical care costs fall if patient involvement and knowledge can be leveraged,” states Björn Nordlund, paediatric nurse and research group leader at the Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.
<h2>Automated, self-care system</h2>
Consequently, along with his colleagues, Björn Nordlund developed a digital, automated, self-care system for asthma. Called AsthmaTuner, it enables the measuring of lung function via a wireless spirometer connected to a mobile telephone app. Symptoms are evaluated using questions linked to an individual treatment plan. The system was approved for use in medical care in 2018. It is now marketed by MediTuner AB, a company partly owned by Björn Nordlund.
“The system analyses lung function and symptoms in accordance with asthma-care guidelines,” he explains. “It then gives feedback in the form of automated, doctor-prescribed, treatment recommendation. Users also receive a picture of the inhaler that is to be used and instructions on whether the medication is to be maintained, increased or decreased.”

<div class=""paragraph--text-image__text"">
The now published study was carried out in primary care and at the Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Its purpose was to evaluate the digital tool’s impact on symptoms and whether users more readily remembered to take their medicines.
The study comprised 77 uncontrolled asthma sufferers aged 6 upwards. Around half of these were children and adolescents. Study participants were randomly chosen to use AsthmaTuner for at least eight weeks as a support for self-management; and, also for at least eight weeks, receive traditional asthma care with a printed, individual, treatment plan.
<h2>Asthma symptoms improved</h2>
“In parts, the results were hard to interpret. However, we could see that asthma symptoms improved more with the digital tool than they did with traditional care. Adult patients who used the tool at least once a week also more often remembered to take their medicines. Thus, we conclude that this tool can contribute to alleviating uncontrolled asthma sufferers’ symptoms,” says Björn Nordlund.
As asthma requires long-term, regular management, the researchers regarded the shortness of the study as a weakness. Hence the plans to continue the work.
“We do not know if the effects last longer than eight weeks. Thus, we are starting a larger study this autumn. It will run for a longer period and be conducted in Norrtälje’s Tiohundra medical care district and paediatric medical care in Stockholm (the Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital).”
AsthmaTuner was developed in collaboration with Region Stockholm and KI Innovations AB. Clinical testing was administered by Karolinska Trial Alliance. The present study was financed by funding from Uppsala Bio, Region Stockholm’s innovation fund, Capio’s research fund, Vinnova (Sweden’s innovation agency) and MediTuner AB. Henrik Ljungberg was the study’s first author. He, like Björn Nordlund, is a co-founder of MediTuner AB, which owns AsthmaTuner.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the European Commission has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with Inlyta (axitinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This approval includes patients in all IMDC risk groups. It is based on findings from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 trial, which demonstrated that KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib reduced the risk of death by 47% compared with sunitinib (HR=0.53 [95% CI, 0.38, 0.74]; p=0.00005) in patients with advanced RCC. The KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination also demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared with sunitinib.
“Advanced renal cell carcinoma is one of the most lethal types of cancer, with the majority of patients dying within five years of their initial diagnosis,” said Prof. Thomas Powles, lead investigator for KEYNOTE-426 and director of Barts Cancer Centre. “It’s encouraging that we can now offer patients in Europe the KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination as a first-line treatment option.”
The approval allows marketing of the KEYTRUDA combination in all 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway.
“The European approval of the KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination for the treatment of advanced RCC marks an important milestone in our efforts for patients with this aggressive disease,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “Offering an additional treatment option in the first-line setting is particularly important in patients with advanced RCC and underscores our commitment to develop KEYTRUDA in areas of unmet need.”
<b>Data Supporting the European Approval</b>
The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-426, a Phase 3, randomized, multi-center, open-label, active-controlled trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib in patients with advanced RCC with clear cell component, regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status and International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk categories. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Randomization was stratified by risk categories (favorable versus intermediate versus poor) and geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”). The dual primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1); secondary endpoints included ORR and duration of response (DOR), as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. The study enrolled 861 patients who were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks in combination with axitinib 5 mg orally, twice daily. Patients who tolerated axitinib 5 mg twice daily for two consecutive treatment cycles (i.e. 6 weeks) with no &gt; Grade 2 treatment-related adverse events to axitinib and with blood pressure well controlled to = 150/90 mm Hg were permitted dose escalation of axitinib to 7 mg twice daily. Dose escalation of axitinib to 10 mg twice daily was permitted using the same criteria. Axitinib could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity.</li>
 	<li>Sunitinib 50 mg orally, once daily for four weeks and then off treatment for two weeks.</li>
</ul>
Treatment with KEYTRUDA and axitinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as verified by BICR or confirmed by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or for KEYTRUDA, a maximum of 24 months.
In KEYNOTE-426, KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS, reducing the risk of death by 47% compared with sunitinib (HR=0.53 [95% CI, 0.38, 0.74]; p=0.00005). There were 59 events (14%) observed in patients receiving KEYTRUDA with axitinib (n=432) versus 97 events (23%) in patients receiving sunitinib (n=429). Median OS was not reached with either treatment regimen. The KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination also demonstrated improved PFS, with a reduction in the risk of progression or death of 31% compared with sunitinib (HR=0.69 [95% CI, 0.57, 0.84]; p=0.00012). There were 183 events (42%) observed in patients receiving KEYTRUDA with axitinib versus 213 events (50%) in patients receiving sunitinib. Median PFS was 15.1 months (95% CI, 12.6, 17.7) in patients who received the KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination versus 11.0 months (95% CI, 8.7, 12.5) for those who received sunitinib. In the study, the ORR was 59% for patients who received the KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination (95% CI, 54, 64) and 36% for those who received sunitinib (95% CI, 31, 40) (p&lt;0.0001), with a complete response rate of 6% and 2% and a partial response rate of 53% and 34%, for patients who received the KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination versus sunitinib, respectively. The median DOR was not reached (range, 1.4+ to 18.2+ months) with the KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination and was 15.2 months (range 1.1+ to 15.4+ months) with sunitinib.
In KEYNOTE-426, the safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib was investigated in patients with previously untreated, advanced RCC. When KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib is given, higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone have been reported in patients with advanced RCC. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) have been reported. Among patients with advanced RCC, the most frequent adverse reactions were diarrhea (54%), hypertension (45%), fatigue (38%), hypothyroidism (35%), decreased appetite (30%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (28%), nausea (28%), ALT increased (27%), AST increased (26%), dysphonia (25%), cough (21%) and constipation (21%). Incidences of Grades 3-5 adverse reactions were 76% for the KEYTRUDA with axitinib combination and 71% for sunitinib.
<b>About Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in Europe</b>
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about 9 out of 10 kidney cancers are renal cell carcinomas. RCC is about twice as common in men as in women. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, obesity, workplace exposure to certain substances and high blood pressure. There were approximately 403,000 cases of kidney cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2018 and about 175,000 deaths from the disease. In Europe, it is estimated that 136,500 new cases of kidney cancer were diagnosed in 2018 and approximately 54,700 people died from the disease.
<b>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection</b>
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>
<b>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grade 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination with Axitinib)</b>
<i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</i>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination with Axitinib</i>
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%), receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.
<b>Adverse Reactions</b>
In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (=20%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).
In KEYNOTE-054, KEYTRUDA was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 509 patients; the most common (=1%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse reaction (=20%) with KEYTRUDA was diarrhea (28%).
In KEYNOTE-189, when KEYTRUDA was administered with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 20% of 405 patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3%) and acute kidney injury (2%). The most common adverse reactions (=20%) with KEYTRUDA were nausea (56%), fatigue (56%), constipation (35%), diarrhea (31%), decreased appetite (28%), rash (25%), vomiting (24%), cough (21%), dyspnea (21%), and pyrexia (20%).

Leiden, The Netherlands, September 3, 2019 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical
Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the Company’s
investigational prophylactic vaccine for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-
mediated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged 60 years or older. Older adults are
among the populations at highest risk of developing RSV, a highly-contagious, potentially
life-threatening respiratory infection that affects more than 64 million people each year
worldwide.
1
The FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation was based on clinical data with Janssen’s
prophylactic RSV senior vaccine that may demonstrate substantial improvement compared
to available standard of care on a clinically significant endpoint(s).
2
“With no preventive vaccines or effective antiviral treatments currently available, RSV
remains a significant cause of illness in at-risk populations, particularly older adults,” said
Johan Van Hoof, M.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Vaccines, and Managing Director,
Janssen Vaccines &amp; Prevention B.V., Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. “This Breakthrough
Therapy Designation represents clear recognition of the transformative potential of this
investigational RSV preventive solution. We look forward to working closely with the FDA
throughout the course of the prophylactic RSV senior vaccine development program.”
As a result of being granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Janssen’s prophylactic
RSV senior vaccine candidate is now eligible for all associated FDA features.2 The
investigational prophylactic vaccine is currently in a Phase 2b proof of concept study to
investigate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine against RSV in adults aged 65 years and
older.
About Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly prevalent, very contagious respiratory
infection and a leading cause of bronchitis and pneumonia, affecting more than 64
million people each year worldwide.
1 Because the symptoms of RSV can be difficult to
distinguish from influenza or other respiratory infections, many who are infected with
RSV may not be properly diagnosed. Young children, older adults, and those with
underlying health conditions are most at risk. Each year, RSV leads to more than 3
million hospitalizations and nearly 60,000 deaths in children under 5, nearly half of
which occur in infants under 6 months old.3 Among older adults, RSV causes 177,000
hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths annually in the U.S. alone.4 With no preventive
vaccine or effective antiviral treatment available, RSV is a substantial health and
economic burden globally. Estimated hospitalization costs attributed to RSV in people
aged 65 years or older exceed $1 billion in the U.S. annually.5
Janssen’s prophylactic
RSV senior vaccine is part of a portfolio of vaccines that Janssen is developing for
society’s highest areas of unmet need.
About Janssen’s Investigational Prophylactic Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
Senior Vaccine
At Janssen, we are pursuing multiple avenues including preventive and therapeutic
options to combat the serious harm caused by RSV infections. Our investigational
prophylactic respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) senior vaccine is being investigated for the
prevention of RSV-mediated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged 60 years or
older. The prophylactic RSV senior vaccine candidate leverages unique features of
Janssen’s adenovector platform (AdVac®). The investigational vaccine contains the gene
encoding for the fusion protein of the RSV virus as an antigen.

<div class=""xn-content"">
ROCKVILLE, Md. and ALPHARETTA, Ga., Sept. 4, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- REGENXBIO Inc. (Nasdaq: RGNX), a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy based on its proprietary NAV<sup>®</sup> Technology Platform, and Clearside Biomedical, Inc.(Nasdaq: CLSD), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and delivering treatments that restore and preserve vision for people with serious back of the eye diseases, today announced an option and license agreement for exclusive worldwide rights to Clearside's proprietary, in-office SCS Microinjector™ for the delivery of RGX-314 to the suprachoroidal space to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other conditions for which anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment is currently the standard of care. REGENXBIO plans to evaluate RGX-314 using Clearside's SCS Microinjector for in-office, non-surgical delivery into the suprachoroidal space, while continuing to advance its RGX-314 subretinal delivery program currently in development for wet AMD and DR.
Delivery of NAV AAV8-based gene therapy through the suprachoroidal space can potentially provide a targeted, in-office, non-surgical approach to obtaining widespread transgene expression in the retina without exposing the vitreous and the anterior segment of the eye to the injected drug. Clearside's patented SCS Microinjector is specifically designed to allow for consistent injection into the suprachoroidal space and has been tested in over 1,000 injections in clinical trials to date.
""We are pleased to partner with Clearside in evaluating the use of the SCS Microinjector to deliver RGX-314 to the suprachoroidal space in the eye. We believe this approach can potentially allow for the treatment of an expanded population of patients with wet AMD and DR by providing access to gene therapy treatment in all settings of patient care,"" said Kenneth T. Mills, President and Chief Executive Officer of REGENXBIO. ""Delivery into the suprachoroidal space, which in clinical trials has demonstrated minimal associated procedural risks, may allow physicians to treat patients with diseases like DR earlier in the disease course with RGX-314. We will continue to advance the RGX-314 subretinal delivery clinical program, with a Phase IIb clinical trial in wet AMD and a Phase II clinical trial in DR expected to begin by the end of 2019, and we look forward to moving both delivery approaches through development as part of our deep commitment to patients.""
""REGENXBIO is the ideal partner for us given its leadership, expertise and pioneering work in the development and manufacturing of AAV vectors for the delivery of anti-VEGF therapeutic antibodies in the ophthalmology space,"" said George Lasezkay, Pharm.D., J.D., Chief Executive Officer of Clearside. ""We are excited by the recent positive interim data reported by REGENXBIO from the current RGX-314 Phase I/IIa trial in wet AMD. This is an exciting time for us to collaborate with REGENXBIO to evaluate the potential application of our proprietary in-office SCS Microinjector for AAV gene therapy.""
A recent research collaboration with Johns Hopkins School of Medicine published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation<sup>1</sup> highlights the potential of RGX-314 gene therapy delivered into the suprachoroidal space. In these preclinical studies, delivery of RGX-314 into the suprachoroidal space resulted in similar expression of anti-VEGF Fab and suppression of VEGF-induced vascular leakage as subretinal delivery.
""Intravitreal delivery of AAV gene therapy can be limited by ocular inflammation, immune responses in the vitreous and restrictive physical transduction barriers due to the inner limiting membrane on the retina. These hurdles can potentially be overcome with alternative in-office delivery approaches such as delivery to the suprachoroidal space,"" said Olivier Danos, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of REGENXBIO. ""Preclinical suprachoroidal delivery studies conducted with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine demonstrated encouraging initial results in multiple animal species, and we look forward to further evaluation of this route of administration for RGX-314.""
""Following on the positive long-term clinical results from RGX-314 delivered subretinally, it is exciting to see that preliminary preclinical studies with suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 achieved widespread transgene expression in the retina, similar to what was observed in RGX-314 preclinical studies using subretinal delivery. Suprachoroidal delivery of gene therapy has the opportunity for broad transduction of the retina and has the potential to be the preferred choice for in-office treatment of wet AMD, DR and other chronic retinal diseases,"" said Robert Avery, M.D., study investigator from California Retina Consultantsin Santa Barbara, CA. ""I am thrilled to see REGENXBIO evaluating an in-office procedure in addition to the on-going RGX-314 subretinal delivery program, which has the potential to provide multiple treatment options to patients with significant unmet needs.""
Under the terms of the agreement, Clearside has granted REGENXBIO an option to receive an exclusive, worldwide commercial license, with rights to sublicense, to Clearside's SCS Microinjector for the delivery of AAV gene therapies for the treatment of wet AMD, DR, and other conditions for which chronic anti-VEGF treatment is currently the standard of care. In return for these rights, Clearside will receive a fee upon REGENXBIO's exercise of its option, as well as up to $34 million in total development milestones across multiple indications, up to $102 million in sales milestones and mid-single digit royalties on net sales of products using the SCS Microinjector. REGENXBIO will be responsible for all development and commercialization activities for gene therapy product candidates. Clearside will be responsible for supplying the SCS Microinjector and supporting REGENXBIO's preclinical studies, clinical studies and commercial use.
<b>About RGX-314</b>
RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD, DR and other additional chronic retinal conditions treated with anti-VEGF. RGX-314 consists of the NAV AAV8 vector encoding an antibody fragment which inhibits VEGF, modifying the pathway for formation of new leaky blood vessels which lead to retinal fluid accumulation and vision loss. In REGENXBIO's on-going clinical trial in subjects with wet AMD, dose-dependent increases in protein expression levels across five cohorts have been seen, and 50% of Cohort 3 subjects continued to be free of anti-VEGF injections at 18 months following a single subretinal administration of RGX-314.

Samsung Bioepis has begun recruiting patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in India for a phase 3 clinical study of its proposed eculizumab biosimilar, SB12, referencing Soliris.
The double-blind, multicenter, crossover <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04058158#contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">study</a> will compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of SB12 with the reference eculizumab in approximately 50 patients with PNH, a rare, life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by destruction of red blood cells, presence of blood clots, and impaired bone marrow function.
Patients will be randomized to receive 600 mg of either the biosimilar or the reference eculizumab through intravenous administration every week for 4 weeks. Then, they will receive 900 mg of eculizumab for the fifth week, and 900 mg every 2 weeks until week 52. At week 26, patients initially randomized to the biosimilar will be switched to the reference, and those who initiated treatment with the reference will be switched to the biosimilar.
The primary outcome measures are hemolysis as measured by lactate dehydrogenase at week 26 in a parallel comparison and at week 52 by a crossover comparison. The study’s estimated completion date is July 2021.
In addition to PNH, the reference eculizumab is also approved by the FDA to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (a rare disease that causes abnormal blood clots to form in the small blood vessels in the kidneys), generalized myasthenia gravis (a rare, autoimmune, neuromuscular junction disorder), and, <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/news/fda-approves-alexions-eculizumab-for-neuromyelitis-optica-spectrum-disorder-"">most recently</a>, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD, a rare disorder of the central nervous system).
The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has also <a href=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/summaries-opinion/soliris"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">adopted</a>a positive opinion of eculizumab in for the treatment of NMOSD, and the European Commission will make a final determination on authorizing the drug for this fourth indication.
At least one other biosimilar developer is targeting the high-cost Soliris: Amgen’s proposed biosimilar, ABP 959, was recently shown in a phase 1 study to have similar PK and pharmacodynamics to the reference drug in patients 219 healthy volunteers. The proposed biosimilar also demonstrated similar safety and immunogenicity to Soliris.

<strong>ATLANTA - </strong>Today, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), in partnership with the Spondylitis Association of America (SAA) and the Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN), released the <a href=""https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Axial-Spondyloarthritis"">2019 Update of the Recommendations for the Treatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Nonradiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)</a>. The guideline includes 86 recommendations that provide updated and new guidance for the management of patients with AS and nr-axSpA in the areas of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment options; AS-related comorbidities; and disease activity assessment, imaging, and screening.
“SAA is proud to be a co-sponsor of these updated guidelines. SAA is committed to expanding treatment options and ensuring that both spondyloarthritis patients and the medical practitioners that are entrusted with their care have the best resources to aid in their decision-making,” said Cassie Shafer, chief executive officer of the SAA.
<a href=""https://www.spondylitis.org/Spondylitis-Plus/axial-spondyloarthritis-classification"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Axial SpA</a>, which is comprised of AS and nr-axSpA, is the main form of chronic inflammatory arthritis affecting the axial skeleton. This condition is characterized by
back and hip pain, peripheral joint pain, and fatigue, all of which can vary in severity. According to the SAA, as much as 1 percent of the adult United States population may have axial SpA. This means that as many as 2.7 million adults may be affected by the disease.
The ACR’s previous guideline, published in 2015, provided recommendations for pharmacological treatments, management of selected comorbidities, disease monitoring, and preventive care. The 2019 update builds on these recommendations by adding information on new medications, managing biologic and biosimilars usage in patients, and best practices for utilizing imaging (MRI and radiographs).
“Based on the literature, we felt it was important to address topics such as sequencing biologics for patients with active AS despite NSAID usage, whether to taper or discontinue biologics in the setting of remission, and clearer guidelines on when to obtain images – particularly in instances when results would likely lead to a change in treatment,” said Michael Ward, MD, MPH, researcher at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and principal investigator of the guideline. “We hope this new information will help get patients on an effective treatment faster and ultimately improve patients’ health status and quality of life.”
To update the guideline, a team of experts conducted a systematic literature review for 20 clinical questions on pharmacological treatment addressed in the 2015 guidelines along with 26 new questions on pharmacological treatment, treat-to-target strategy, and the use of imaging. The results of this review were then discussed by a separate voting panel and crafted into recommendations that were labeled conditional or strong based on the evidence available. A few of the recommendations from the <a href=""https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Axial-Spondyloarthritis"">guideline</a> include:
<ul>
 	<li>A strong recommendation to treat adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs with a TNFi (no preferred choice) over no treatment with a TNFi.</li>
 	<li>A conditional recommendation to treat with a TNFi over treatment with secukinumab, ixekizumab or tofacitinib, and a conditional recommendation to treat with seukinumab or ixekizumab over tofacitinib.</li>
 	<li>A strong recommendation to continue treatment with the originator biologic over mandated switching to its biosimilar for adults with stable AS.</li>
 	<li>A conditional recommendation against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval as a standard approach for adults with active or stable nr-axSpA on any treatment.</li>
</ul>
“These guidelines update those from four years ago by consolidating the expert thought around the use of the newest therapeutic agents and modifying a number of recommendations from the 2015 guideline to reflect recent evidence. They provide patients and the medical community with clear recommendations for spondyloarthritis management using a rigorous approach, and SPARTAN is proud to endorse them,” said Dr. Liron Caplan, chair of SPARTAN.
ACR guidelines are currently developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation <a href=""http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">(GRADE) methodology</a>, which creates rigorous standards for judging the quality of the literature available and assigns strengths to the recommendations. Due to limited data in some areas, the quality of evidence was most often low, very low or occasionally moderate. This led to nearly all recommendations being conditional, with only a few strong recommendations in cases in which there was sufficient evidence.

<strong>NEW YORK, Sep 4, 2019 -</strong> Schrödinger today announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca to deploy Schrödinger’s advanced computing platform to help accelerate drug discovery efforts. Schrödinger’s computational platform combines physics-based modeling and machine learning to enable chemists to predict the potency of a molecule binding to a target protein. This increases the likelihood that, when synthesized, compounds will have the correct properties required for further development and reduces the number of compounds that need to be synthesized.
Schrödinger’s platform will be used by AstraZeneca’s medicinal and computational chemists to help improve the design of compounds to identify potential new therapeutic candidates.
To ensure a comprehensive knowledge transfer, Schrödinger’s team will work closely and share best practices with AstraZeneca to help integrate the platform into their drug discovery workflow. Garry Pairaudeau, Global Chemistry Lead, R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, commented: “Our strategic goal is to transform drug design using innovative digital technologies. In this collaboration with Schrödinger, we look forward to realizing the potential of predictive physics-based modeling and machine learning to help us deliver higher quality compounds more effectively.” “We are excited to launch this collaboration. AstraZeneca is a leader in embracing the potential of technology to reshape drug discovery, and we look forward to supporting them to deliver their vision for the future of drug design,” said Schrödinger CEO Ramy Farid, Ph.D.

— Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation invests $55 million in an infectious disease collaboration that could reach up to $100 million in total funding —
<strong>Mainz, Germany, September 4, 2019 –</strong> BioNTech SE, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on patient-specific immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases, announced today that it has signed an agreement with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (the Gates Foundation) to develop HIV and tuberculosis programs, further expanding the Company’s infectious disease portfolio. This partnership includes an initial equity investment of $55 million, which is expected to close within the next week. The funds will be used to develop preclinical vaccine and immunotherapy candidates to prevent HIV and tuberculosis infection as well as to lead to durable antiretroviral therapy-free remission of HIV disease. Total funding under the collaboration could reach $100 million through potential future grant funding from the Gates Foundation that would be used to underwrite the evaluation of these candidates in the clinic and support the initiation of new infectious disease projects.
“We are thrilled about the partnership with the Gates Foundation and the outstanding network of infectious disease specialists that it has built,” <strong>said Prof. Ugur Sahin, CEO of BioNTech</strong>. “Targeting severe infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV infection is in line with our mission to leverage our immunotherapy capabilities not only for cancer but also beyond, in disease areas of high medical need.”
“Despite remarkable advances in global health since 1990, current approaches to preventing and treating tuberculosis – the world’s leading cause of death from infectious disease – and HIV infection remain inadequate,” <strong>said Lynda Stuart, Deputy Director, Vaccines and Human Immunobiology, Discovery and Translational Sciences at the Gates Foundation</strong>. “BioNTech’s innovative mRNA-based approach and in-depth understanding of the immune system offer exciting pathways to develop effective new immune-based therapies that could dramatically reduce the global incidence of HIV and tuberculosis. We believe this partnership will add to our portfolio of innovative tools and could make a significant impact.”
Under the terms of the agreement, the collaboration will fund the identification of potential HIV and tuberculosis vaccine and immunotherapy candidates and their pre-clinical development. It will further enable BioNTech to build out its infectious disease infrastructure, including platform development and may allow the Company to initiate three new additional programs within its infectious disease portfolio. All programs will utilize BioNTech’s proprietary platforms and the Company will retain rights for commercialization of the vaccine and immunotherapy candidates in the developed world while providing affordable access to the candidates in developing countries.
<strong>About BioNTech</strong>
BioNTech was founded in 2008 on the understanding that every cancer patient’s tumor is unique and therefore each patient’s treatment should be individualized. Its cutting-edge pipeline includes individualized mRNA-based product candidates, innovative chimeric antigen receptor T cells, novel checkpoint immunomodulators, targeted cancer antibodies and small molecules. BioNTech’s product development approach has been validated by seven collaborations with, in chronological order, Eli Lilly and Company, Genmab, Sanofi, Bayer Animal Health, Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, Genevant and Pfizer, and its scientific approach through over 150 peer-reviewed scientific publications. BioNTech’s shareholders include the Struengmann Family Office as its majority shareholder, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Invus, Janus Henderson Investors, MIG Fonds, Redmile Group, Salvia, Mirae Asset Financial Group, Platinum Asset Management, Jebsen Capital, Steam Athena Capital, BVCF Management and several European family offices.

BEERSE, Belgium--The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved the expanded use of ustekinumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic or have medical contraindications to such therapies.<sup>1</sup> Ustekinumab is the first available biologic treatment to selectively target the IL-12/IL-23 pathway, an important therapeutic target in UC.<sup>2</sup>
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“The devastating impact of ulcerative colitis on the lives of people with this condition is often underestimated. Typically, ulcerative colitis first presents in young adults at a time when they are still in education or starting their careers – often limiting their ability to achieve their personal goals”</p>
<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190904005566/en/European-Commission-Approves-Expanded-Janssen%E2%80%99s-STELARA%C2%AE-ustekinumab#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
“<i>The devastating impact of ulcerative colitis on the lives of people with this condition is often underestimated</i>. <i>Typically, ulcerative colitis first presents in young adults at a time when they are still in education or starting their careers – often limiting their ability to achieve their personal goals,” </i>said Professor Silvio Danese*, Head of the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Centre at Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy. “<i>Whilst there is no cure yet for ulcerative colitis, treatments which can help prevent the flare up of symptoms and allow people to get on with their lives are hugely important. For this reason, the approval of ustekinumab in ulcerative colitis is welcome news and will provide a valuable therapeutic option for both patients and their doctors</i>.”
Affecting 2.6 million people in Europe, UC is a serious, chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the large intestine.<sup>3</sup>Symptoms vary but may include abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhoea and fatigue, which can be painful, embarrassing and debilitating, placing a significant burden on people with the condition.<sup>4,5</sup> For up to two thirds of people with UC, current treatments are not completely successful or complications may arise.<sup>6,7,8,9</sup>
“<i>Today marks a significant milestone in the treatment of ulcerative colitis</i>,” said Jan Wehkamp, MD, Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. “<i>Many hundreds of thousands of people in Europe struggle with one of the two types of inflammatory bowel disease – Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis – and are in urgent need of effective treatment options. Ustekinumab has been available to people with Crohn’s disease since it was approved in 2016, and thanks to the patients who enrolled in the UNIFI clinical trial programme and their willingness to participate, we are delighted it will now be available to people with ulcerative colitis, offering them a chance of durable remission and relief from the often painful and debilitating symptoms</i>.”
The EC approval is based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 UNIFI trial programme – a programme that was split into an initial Induction study (UNIFI-I) of at least eight weeks, followed by a Maintenance study (UNIFI-M) of 44 weeks – both of which demonstrated ustekinumab’s efficacy as a treatment option for patients with moderately to severely active UC who demonstrated an inadequate response to or were unable to tolerate conventional (i.e. corticosteroids or immunomodulators) or biologic (i.e. one or more tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha antagonists and/or vedolizumab) therapies.<sup>10,11</sup>
Ustekinumab has demonstrated a consistent safety profile in UC where trials show the treatment is well tolerated. In the primary randomised population of the Induction and Maintenance studies, a similar proportion of patients in the ustekinumab and placebo groups experienced adverse events (AE), serious AEs, infections and serious infections through to week 44. During the Induction phase, one death from an oesophageal varices haemorrhage was reported, and no malignancies, opportunistic infections or tuberculosis were reported. During the Maintenance phase, no deaths and two malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) were reported (90 mg ustekinumab q8w: colon cancer [n=1]; 90 mg ustekinumab q12w: papillary renal cell carcinoma [n=1]). There was one patient-reported NMSC in the 90 mg ustekinumab q12w group (2 squamous cell carcinoma events).<sup>10,11</sup>
Marketing authorisation follows a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), issued on 25 July 2019.<sup>12</sup> Janssen announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval of STELARA<sup>®</sup> (ustekinumab) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in December 2018. The review is ongoing.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About the UNIFI Programme</span></b>
UNIFI is a Phase 3 programme, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab induction and maintenance dosing for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC in adults who demonstrated an inadequate response to, or were unable to tolerate, conventional (i.e. corticosteroids, immunomodulators) or biologic (i.e. one or more TNF-alpha antagonists and/or vedolizumab) therapies. Both the Induction and Maintenance studies were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre studies. The Induction study was of at least 8 weeks duration for participants, who were each administered a single IV ustekinumab infusion.<sup>10,11</sup>
Participants achieving clinical response in the Induction study were eligible to enter into the Maintenance study. The Maintenance study was 44 weeks in duration, representing a total treatment duration of 1 year. The primary endpoint of the Induction study was clinical remission at week 8, and the primary endpoint for the Maintenance study was clinical remission at week 44. After completion of the Maintenance study, eligible participants are continuing in a long-term extension study for an additional three years.<sup>10,11</sup>
In the Induction study, for the recommended dose of ustekinumab, 62 percent of patients were found to have achieved clinical response<sup>a</sup>compared with 31 percent of patients receiving placebo (p&lt;0.001) at week 8.<sup>11</sup> As early as week 2 of the study, a higher proportion of patients who received a single IV infusion dose of ustekinumab had no bleeding or achieved normal stool frequency as compared with those randomised to placebo.<sup>1,11</sup> Full results of the Induction study were previously shared during a plenary session at the American College of Gastroenterology Annual Scientific Meeting and in a <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20181009005698%2Fen%2FNew-Phase-3-Data-Show-Single-Dose&amp;esheet=52084573&amp;newsitemid=20190904005566&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=press+release&amp;index=1&amp;md5=ec1b69f571f1b7ae9daf41ea0e9d6709"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">press release</a> on 9 October, 2018.<sup>13</sup>
All patients who were randomised into the 44-week Maintenance study were induction responders to IV ustekinumab. Among patients subsequently randomised to receive subcutaneous ustekinumab (q8w or q12w), a significantly greater percentage achieved clinical remission vs initial responders randomised to placebo. The sustained effect of ustekinumab was also observed in those in the ustekinumab q8w and q12w groups compared to placebo (57.4 percent and 48.3 percent respectively, vs 35.4 percent, p&lt;0.001 and p=0.010, respectively), as measured by durable partial Mayo remission<sup>b</sup> (partial Mayo remission at =80 percent of all visits and at the last visit).<sup>14 </sup>Full results of the Maintenance study were previously presented during a plenary session at 14th Congress of the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation and shared in a <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20190311005469%2Fen%2FNew-Phase-3-STELARA%25C2%25AE-ustekinumab-Data-Show&amp;esheet=52084573&amp;newsitemid=20190904005566&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=press+release&amp;index=2&amp;md5=09ee378e61ba0dc44ee31e5c57cac2b3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">press release</a> on 11 March, 2019.<sup>15</sup>
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About ulcerative colitis (UC)</span></b>
UC affects up to 2.6 million people in Europe.<sup>3 </sup>It is a chronic disease of the large intestine, also known as the colon, in which the lining becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores, or ulcers, that produce pus and mucous. UC is the result of an abnormal response by the body's immune system. Symptoms vary, but may include loose and more urgent bowel movements, persistent diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, loss of appetite, weight loss and fatigue.<sup>5</sup>
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About STELARA<sup>®</sup> (ustekinumab)</span></b><sup>16</sup>
In the European Union, ustekinumab<b> </b>is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including ciclosporin, methotrexate (MTX) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A, and is also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adolescent patients aged 12 years and older who are inadequately controlled by or are intolerant to other systemic therapies or phototherapies. In addition, ustekinumab<b> </b>is approved alone or in combination with MTX for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to previous non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. In November 2016, the EC approved ustekinumab<b> </b>for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a TNF-alpha antagonist or have medical contraindications to such therapies.

<div class=""node__content"">
<p align=""left"">EXTON, Pa., Sept. 04, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IDRA) announced today that they have entered into an immuno-oncology clinical research collaboration with AbbVie, a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company.  The purpose of the collaboration is to conduct a clinical study evaluating whether combinations of an OX40 agonist (ABBV-368), a TLR-9 agonist (tilsotolimod), chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel) and/or an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antagonist (ABBV-181) stimulate the immune system resulting in anti-tumor responses.</p>
This Phase 1b, multi-center, open-label study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of combinations of ABBV-368 plus tilsotolimod in subjects with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
The study will test three separate treatment arms:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>ABBV-368 plus tilsotolimod;</li>
 	<li>ABBV-368 plus tilsotolimod and nab-paclitaxel; and</li>
 	<li>ABBV-368 plus tilsotolimod, nab-paclitaxel and ABBV-181.</li>
</ul>
Under the terms of the agreement, Idera will provide clinical trial supply of tilsotolimod to AbbVie and AbbVie will be responsible for conduct of the study.
“We are excited to be entering into this additional clinical collaboration, which continues to advance our strategy of exploring the possibilities to further improve patient outcomes harnessing the immune system against difficult to treat cancers, which historically have not generated significant objective response rates through checkpoint inhibition alone,” stated Elizabeth A. Tarka, M.D., F.A.C.C., Idera’s Chief Medical Officer.  “We look forward to working together with AbbVieto advance our understanding of the combination effect of ABBV-368 and tilsotolimod for these patients.”

<span class=""xn-location"">BOSTON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 5, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- IFM Therapeutics (IFM), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that modulate novel targets in the innate immune system, today announced that IFM Due, an IFM subsidiary company, has reached a collaboration and exclusive option agreement with Novartis to develop a suite of immunotherapies that inhibit the cGAS/STING pathway to treat a range of serious inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis will make fixed payments sufficient to fully finance IFM Due's research and development costs for the cGAS/STING program in exchange for the option to acquire the IFM Due subsidiary. Upon option exercise, IFM Due's shareholders will be entitled to consideration in aggregate value of up to $840 million, including an upfront payment upon option closing and other contingent consideration.
""IFM was founded to address novel targets of the innate immune system that are believed to underlie numerous serious conditions, said Gary D Glick, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of IFM. ""In the four years since, we have developed an array of distinct small molecules for inflammatory disorders and cancer that are now in clinical development, demonstrating our team's ability to progress novel, high value programs rapidly. Today's announcement represents a significant milestone in the continued advancement of our pipeline.""
Discovered only a decade ago, the cGAS/STING (cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase, Stimulator of Interferon Genes) pathway functions within the innate immune system to sense cytosolic DNA, which is a signal of cellular danger, and then triggers a STING-dependent inflammatory response. Mutations that activate this pathway can cause a variety of serious autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans that are characterized by excessive interferon/cytokine signaling, including rare diseases such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) and a subset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Aberrant cGAS/STING activation, such as in the setting of mitochondrial dysfunction, also underlies more common diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Parkinson's disease.
""In the broad set of diseases where excessive production of interferon and other pro-inflammatory cytokines via the cGAS/STING pathway is an underlying driver, precisely targeting this pathway is the most attractive therapeutic approach,"" said H. <span class=""xn-person"">Martin Seidel</span>, Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Research and Development at IFM. ""We are excited to once again collaborate with Novartis, an industry leader who shares our belief in the powerful therapeutic potential of blocking the cGAS/STING pathway, and whose commitment to reaching patients aligns with ours.""
""Today's collaboration between IFM's wholly owned subsidiary, IFM Due, and Novartis highlights the unique benefits of IFM's corporate strategy and structure. By housing each of IFM's distinct programs in a dedicated subsidiary, we can surgically tailor our financing strategy in a manner that preserves IFM's corporate flexibility, allowing us to pursue strategic partnerships that maximize shareholder value and accelerate the development of our pipeline,"" said Lina Gugucheva, Vice President of Business Development, Operations and Strategy at IFM. ""Today's agreement with Novartis once again highlights the advantages of this model. We are pleased that since IFM's inception in 2015, through three separate transactions, each of IFM's programs and each launched IFM company has attracted an ideal partner with highly relevant expertise, helping to ensure these programs reach patients as quickly as possible.""
IFM Due has two preclinical programs in development. The first is aimed at developing orally available, small-molecule antagonists of STING that can block its ability to stimulate excessive production of interferons and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Clinical trials of the first STING antagonist are expected to begin in 2021. The second program is aiming to develop small-molecule inhibitors of cGAS, which will block the pathway at a more upstream node.
<b>About IFM Due</b>
IFM Due (pronounced <i>du-way</i>), a subsidiary of IFM Therapeutics, is a biopharmaceutical company developing a suite of small-molecule antagonists and inhibitors targeting aberrant inflammatory responses of the innate immune system triggered by the cGAS/STING pathway, which is believed to underlie a variety of serious diseases. The Company is developing small-molecule, orally available drug candidates to address a breadth of potential therapeutic indications, including rare, autoimmune, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://www.takeda.com/investors/"">TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</a>) (“Takeda”) today announced that the company is issuing a US recall for all doses of NATPARA<sup>®</sup> (parathyroid hormone) for Injection (25 mcg, 50 mcg, 75 mcg, and 100 mcg). This recall is being conducted after discussions with the FDA and is effective immediately due to a potential issue related to rubber particulates originating from the rubber septum of the NATPARA cartridge. During the 14-day NATPARA treatment period, the septum is punctured by a needle each day to obtain the daily dosage of NATPARA solution. When the septum is repeatedly punctured, it is possible that small rubber fragments may detach into the cartridge.
<p class=""paragraph"">With patient safety as the company’s main priority, Takeda is communicating directly with healthcare professionals, patients, and specialty pharmacies in the US regarding the actions required as a result of the recall. Consistent with the product labeling, Takeda is alerting NATPARA patients and prescribers that discontinuing NATPARA abruptly can cause a sharp decrease in blood calcium levels (severe hypocalcemia) which can result in serious health consequences. It is critically important that patients contact their prescribing healthcare provider to discuss their individual treatment plan and ensure close supervision, including frequent monitoring of blood calcium levels and close titration of active vitamin D and calcium supplements upon stopping NATPARA to avoid low blood calcium (hypocalcemia).</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">The safety profile of NATPARA remains consistent with the product label.  Takeda is working closely with regulatory agencies in relevant markets outside of the US where NATPAR/A is available.  NATPAR/A continues to be available in these markets.</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">NATPARA, a recombinant human protein with the full length 84–amino–acid sequence of endogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH), is currently approved in the US as the only adjunctive treatment for adult patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who cannot be adequately controlled with standard therapy alone (calcium and vitamin D).</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">Takeda is committed to supply integrity, and we are working closely with the FDA to resolve the issue and resume supply as soon as possible. The financial impact of the recall is currently being assessed in conjunction with the remediation plan. Takeda will share the financial impact once determined.</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">Healthcare providers with medical-related questions or other questions about the NATPARA recall should contact Takeda Medical Information at +1-800-828-2088 and select Option 2.  Patients in the US with questions about the NATPARA recall should contact OnePath at +1-866-888-0660.

<h4><b>About NATPARA<sup>®</sup> (parathyroid hormone) for Injection in the US</b></h4>
NATPARA (parathyroid hormone) for Injection is a parathyroid hormone indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism.
<h4><b>Limitations of Use:</b></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma, NATPARA is recommended only for patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D alone.</li>
 	<li>NATPARA was not studied in patients with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations.</li>
 	<li>NATPARA was not studied in patients with acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class=""paragraph""><b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b></h4>
<b>WARNING: POTENTIAL RISK OF OSTEOSARCOMA</b>
<b>In male and female rats, parathyroid hormone caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) that was dependent on dose and treatment duration. A risk to humans could not be excluded.</b>
<b>Because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma, prescribe NATPARA only to patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium and active forms of vitamin D and for whom the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risk.</b>
<b>Avoid use of NATPARA in patients who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma (including those with Paget’s disease of bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, pediatric and young adult patients with open epiphyses, patients with hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma or patients with a history of prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton).</b>
<b>NATPARA is available only through a restricted program called the NATPARA REMS Program.</b>
<p class=""paragraph""><b>For more information about the NATPARA REMS program, call 1-855-NATPARA or go to </b><a href=""http://www.natpararems.com/"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""http://www.natpararems.com/"" data-action=""External""><b>www.NATPARAREMS.com</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<h4><b>Contraindications:</b></h4>
<p class=""paragraph"">NATPARA is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of NATPARA. Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria) have occurred with NATPARA.</p>
<h4 class=""paragraph""><b>Warnings and Precautions:</b></h4>
<p class=""paragraph""><b><i>Hypercalcemia</i></b><i>: </i>Severe hypercalcemia has been reported with NATPARA. The risk is highest when starting or increasing the dose of NATPARA but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Treat hypercalcemia per standard practice and consider holding and/or lowering the dose of NATPARA if severe hypercalcemia occurs.</p>
<p class=""paragraph""><b><i>Hypocalcemia:</i></b>Severe hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking NATPARA, including cases that resulted in seizures. The risk is highest with interruption or discontinuation of NATPARA treatment but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia, and replace calcium and vitamin D if indicated in patients interrupting or discontinuing NATPARA to prevent severe hypocalcemia.</p>
<p class=""paragraph""><b><i>Digoxin Toxicity:</i></b>Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digoxin, monitor serum calcium more frequently and increase monitoring when initiating or adjusting NATPARA dose.</p>
<p class=""paragraph""><b><i>Hypersensitivity:</i></b> There have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients taking NATPARA. Reactions included anaphylaxis, dyspnea, angioedema, urticaria, and rash. If signs or symptoms of a serious hypersensitivity reaction occur, discontinue treatment with NATPARA, treat hypersensitivity reaction according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Monitor for hypocalcemia if NATPARA is discontinued.</p>
<h4><b>Adverse Reactions:</b></h4>
<p class=""paragraph"">The most common adverse reactions associated with NATPARA and occurring in greater than 10% of individuals were: paresthesia, hypocalcemia, headache, hypercalcemia, nausea, hypoaesthesia, diarrhea, vomiting, arthralgia, hypercalciuria and pain in extremity.</p>
<h4><b>Drug Interactions:</b></h4>
<p class=""paragraph""><i>Alendronate:</i> Co-administration of alendronate and NATPARA leads to reduction in the calcium sparing effect, which can interfere with the normalization of serum calcium. Concomitant use of NATPARA with alendronate is not recommended.</p>
<h4><b>Use in Specific Populations:</b></h4>
<p class=""paragraph"">There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">The safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established</p>

<span class=""xn-location"">LONDON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 5, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Theragnostics, which is developing molecular radiotherapy for imaging and treating a broad range of cancers, announces a licence agreement with AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/theragnostics-signs-agreement-with-astrazeneca-300911832.html#financial-modal"">AZN</a>) for intellectual property (IP) that enables Theragnostics' freedom to operate globally in the diagnostic field of certain selected radionuclide-labelled PARPi (<b>P</b>oly (<b>A</b>DP-<b>R</b>ibose) <b>P</b>olymerase inhibitors) with an option to an exclusive licence for freedom to operate globally in the therapeutic field of certain selected radionuclide-labelled PARPi.
PARP inhibitors are a novel class of oncology drugs that block an enzyme, Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase, that cancer cells use in response to DNA damage, both endogenous and as caused by treatments such as chemotherapy.
Theragnostics' technology platform enables the development of molecular radiotherapy based on a PARPi for imaging and treating cancer. Theragnostics modifies a PARPi drug molecule with a radioactive atom to create a radionuclide PARPi (rPARPi). This can either be used to image PARP in a cancer patient for diagnostic use or the radioactive isotope can be used to deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation into tumour cells, which offers the potential to molecularly target the radiation in order to hit and kill tumour cells whilst avoiding damage to healthy cells and associated side effects.
The potential market for PARP inhibitors is large. There are at least four approved conventional pharmaceutical PARPi on the market with new and expanded indications being approved in several markets in recent months, opening up a multibillion-dollar opportunity. Analysts estimate that peak sales for the PARPi class could reach <span class=""xn-money"">$4.8 billion</span> by 2023 (source, Evaluate Pharma), a figure which only includes indications in ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. Analyst PARPi peak sales forecasts could rise as newer indications and label expansions are included within estimates. PARPi is a therapeutic class that could be applicable in up to 40% of tumours with varying DNA Damage Response associated mutations or dependencies and may have additional efficacy in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
<b><span class=""xn-person"">Gareth Smith</span>, Chief Operating Officer of Theragnostics, said:</b>
<i>""We believe that a radionuclide PARPi therapy will work independently of DNA mutations associated with heightened PARPi activity, such as BRCA1/BRCA2 and will avoid development of treatment resistance. Therefore, the number of patients benefiting from PARPi therapy could significantly expand.""</i>
<b><span class=""xn-person"">Greg Mullen</span>, Chief Executive Officer of Theragnostics, said:</b>
<i>""Theragnostics' strategy is to develop novel diagnostic imaging agents and targeted radionuclide therapies to improve treatment of a range of cancers. This agreement with AstraZeneca strengthens our IP estate and enables us to accelerate the development of our rPARPi therapy and diagnostic portfolio which has the potential to offer new and expanded treatment options to patients in a number of cancers.""</i>
The agreement follows Theragnostics' global licensing agreement for rPARPi with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), <span class=""xn-location"">USA</span>, a world leading facility in oncology research and cancer treatment in <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2019</span>. Together these agreements give Theragnostics flexibility and expanded capabilities to design and develop a broad range of both diagnostic and therapeutic molecular radiotherapies.
<b>About Theragnostics</b>
Theragnostics is a private clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing precision oncology products for diagnostic medical imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy. The Company has completed a number of proof-of-concept phase I and II clinical trials for several radionuclide diagnostics and targeted therapies.
For more information, please visit <a href=""http://www.theragnostics.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">www.theragnostics.com</a>.
<b>About rPARPi</b>
rPARPi was invented and developed within the lab of <span class=""xn-person"">Thomas Reiner</span>, PhD, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, <span class=""xn-location"">New York</span>, where the positron emission tomography (PET) agent [18F]PARPi is currently recruiting patients in a Phase I clinical trial in head and neck cancers. The core structure of the developed rPARPi agents allow for their application as theragnostic agents – they can be labelled with diagnostic isotopes as well as with isotopes to enable cancer therapy.
<b>About PARP</b>
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes are involved in normal cellular processes including DNA damage response. PARP activity and expression are up-regulated in tumour cells and through the inhibition of PARP it is possible to render cancer cells unable to respond effectively to DNA damage, such as DNA single-strand break. Currently approved PARP inhibitors also actively trap PARP onto DNA resulting in the generation of DNA double-strand breaks that can result in cancer cell death. PARP inhibitors are a rapidly emerging drug class showing promise as anti-cancer agents in a range of tumour types.

“ResistancePlus MG FleXible represents both an evolution of our technology and of Resistance Guided Therapy for Mgen”, said Colin Denver SpeeDx CEO. “There is considerable interest by clinicians and laboratories alike, as it will now be even easier to adhere to international and local management guidelines and provide clinically relevant and timely information to manage the growing problem of macrolide resistance in Mgen infections.”
Mgen can cause symptoms such as urethritis, cervicitis, endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease, and has been linked to reproductive health complications including pre-term birth and infertility.<sup>1,2</sup> Macrolide antibiotics, specifically azithromycin, are the first-line treatment for the rapidly growing problem of Mgen, but resistance to these antibiotics has increased up to 50% in several countries.<sup>4-6</sup> There are limited alternative treatment options, many of which are expensive, difficult to access, or associated with undesirable side-effects.<sup>4,5</sup> Current Mgen guidelines focus on extending the utility of azithromycin by testing for macrolide resistance-associated mutations and stratifying patient treatment accordingly.<sup>1-3</sup>
“SpeeDx offers unique technology for simultaneous detection of pathogens and drug resistance directly from clinical specimens. Together, we have leveraged the open architecture of our new FleXible cartridge to enable detection of this emerging drug-resistant pathogen on the GeneXpert System,” said David H. Persing, M.D., Ph.D., Cepheid's Chief Medical and Technology Officer. “The ResistancePlus MG Flexible cartridge offers best-in-class performance in an easy to use, on-demand format to address a significant medical need in symptomatic individuals, and adds to the growing portfolio of STI testing options available on our platform.”
Timely detection of antibiotic resistant infections enables Resistance Guided Therapy, resulting in better treatment of the disease for patients, reduced potential for spreading infection among vulnerable populations, and supporting antibiotic stewardship to combat rising antibiotic resistance.
<b><i>Resistance</i></b><i>Plus®</i> MG FleXible will be exclusively distributed by Cepheid.

PRINCETON, N.J.--(<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com&amp;esheet=52088187&amp;newsitemid=20190905005186&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bristol-Myers+Squibb+Company&amp;index=1&amp;md5=7375265a7a65fe9dd9425f8e12a7c2f0"">Bristol-Myers Squibb Company</a> (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the Phase 3 CheckMate -548 trial evaluating the addition of <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) to the current standard of care (temozolomide and radiation therapy) versus the standard of care alone did not meet one of its primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS), in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) that is O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-methylated. The data monitoring committee recommended that the trial continue as planned to allow the other primary endpoint, overall survival (OS), to mature. The company remains blinded to all study data.
“Though CheckMate -548 did not show statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival, we are continuing to evaluate the benefit the addition of <i>Opdivo </i>to the standard of care treatment regimen may bring to patients suffering from GBM, an extremely aggressive and difficult disease to treat. We look forward to seeing the overall survival data when they are available,” said Fouad Namouni, M.D., head, Oncology Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “We are grateful to the patients, caregivers and investigators participating in this trial who make this research possible.”
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About CheckMate -548</span></b>
CheckMate -548 (NCT02667587) is a Phase 3 randomized, multi-center study evaluating <i>Opdivo </i>in addition to the current standard of care (temozolomide and radiation therapy), versus the standard of care alone, in patients with newly diagnosed GBM that is MGMT-methylated. The primary endpoints of the trial are PFS per blinded independent central review (BICR) and OS. The secondary endpoints are investigator assessed PFS, and OS rate up to two years.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About GBM</span></b>
GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. The global incidence of GBM is less than 10 per 100,000 people. Standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed GBM can include surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy, but treatment options are limited. The last investigational medicine to improve survival for patients with newly diagnosed GBM was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005. The five year survival rate of patients with GBM is less than five percent.
MGMT methylation status is among the most commonly used biomarkers in GBM for treatment guidance. Studies suggest MGMT methylation status may be predictive of the likelihood of patients with GBM to respond to therapy.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">Bristol-Myers Squibb: Advancing Oncology Research</span></b>
At Bristol-Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The focus of our research is to increase quality, long-term survival for patients and make cure a possibility. Through a unique multidisciplinary approach powered by translational science, we harness our deep scientific experience in oncology and Immuno-Oncology (I-O) research to identify novel treatments tailored to individual patient needs. Our researchers are developing a diverse, purposefully built pipeline designed to target different immune system pathways and address the complex and specific interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment and the immune system. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines, like I-O, a reality for patients.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo</i></span></b>
<i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994) of patients. Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. Encephalitis occurred in one patient receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg (0.2%) after 1.7 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one RCC patient receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg (0.2%) after approximately 4 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patient (0.8%) receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg after 15 days of exposure.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in &lt;1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
<b>Infusion Reactions</b>
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in &lt;1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
<b>Lactation</b>
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.
<b>Serious Adverse Reactions</b>
In Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse drug reactions reported in 2% to &lt;5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase.

 	<li><strong>The approval of the new Tecentriq-based combination expands treatment options for people across Europe affected by non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Decision based on data showing that the Tecentriq plus chemotherapy combination demonstrated a significant overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) benefit</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has approved and granted marketing authorisation for Tecentriq<sup>®</sup> (atezolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and Abraxane<sup>®</sup> [albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel]), for the initial (first-line) treatment of adults with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC.
“Today’s approval marks another advance for people living with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, providing a new treatment option for those affected in Europe,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “This Tecentriq-based combination expands treatment options and offers flexibility to physicians when making treatment choices combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy – which is important, given the complexity of lung cancer.”
This approval is based on results from the Phase III IMpower130 study, which demonstrated that the Tecentriq combination therapy helped people live significantly longer, compared with chemotherapy alone (median overall survival [OS]=18.6 versus 13.9 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.79; 95% CI: 0.64–0.98; p=0.033) in the intention-to-treat wild-type (ITT-WT) population.<sup>1</sup> The Tecentriq-based combination also significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival [PFS]) compared with chemotherapy alone (median PFS=7.0 versus 5.5 months; HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.54–0.77; p&lt;0.0001) in the ITT-WT population.<sup>1</sup> The safety profile of the Tecentriq combination therapy was consistent with that observed in previous studies.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally, and each year 1.76 million people die as a result of the disease, which translates into more than 4,800 deaths worldwide every day.<sup>2</sup> NSCLC is the most prevalent type of lung cancer, accounting for around 85% of all cases.<sup>3</sup>
Currently, Roche has nine Phase III lung cancer studies underway evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other medicines across different types of lung cancer. Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.
<h3>About the IMpower130 study</h3>
IMpower130 is a Phase III, multicentre, open-label, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel versus chemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel) alone for chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. The study enrolled 723 people who were randomised (2:1) to receive:
<ul>
 	<li>Tecentriq plus carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (Arm A), or</li>
 	<li>Carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (Arm B, control arm)</li>
</ul>
During the treatment-induction phase, people in Arm A received Tecentriq and carboplatin on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 4 or 6 cycles or until loss of clinical benefit, whichever occurred first. People received Tecentriq during the maintenance treatment phase until loss of clinical benefit was observed.
During the treatment-induction phase, people in Arm B received carboplatin on day 1 and nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 4 or 6 cycles or until disease progression, whichever occurred first. People received best supportive care during the maintenance treatment phase. Switch maintenance to pemetrexed was also permitted. People who were consented prior to a protocol revision were given the option to crossover to receive Tecentriq as monotherapy until disease progression.
The co-primary endpoints were:
<ul>
 	<li>PFS, as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in the ITT-WT population</li>
 	<li>OS in the ITT-WT population</li>
</ul>
A summary of the ITT-WT data from the IMpower130 study that support this approval is included below:<sup>1</sup>
<ul>
 	<li>Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy helped people live significantly longer, compared with chemotherapy alone (median OS=18.6 versus 13.9 months; HR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.64–0.98; p=0.033).</li>
 	<li>Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 36% compared with chemotherapy alone (median PFS=7.0 versus 5.5 months; HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.54–0.77; p&lt;0.0001).</li>
 	<li>Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy shrank tumours (objective response rate [ORR]) in 49.2% of people (95% CI: 44.49–53.96) compared with 31.9% of people (95% CI: 25.84–38.36) on chemotherapy alone.</li>
 	<li>The median duration of response (DoR) for people receiving Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy was 8.4 months (95%, CI: 6.9–11.8) compared with 6.1 months (95% CI: 5.5–7.9) for people on chemotherapy alone.</li>
 	<li>Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 73.2% of people receiving Tecentriq plus chemotherapy compared with 60.3% of people receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common Grade 3–4 AEs in people receiving Tecentriq plus chemotherapy were an abnormal low count of a certain type of white blood cell (neutropenia, 32.1%), a decrease in red blood cells (anaemia, 29.2%), and a decreased neutrophil count (12.1%).</li>
</ul>
<h3>About NSCLC</h3>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally.<sup>2</sup> Each year 1.76 million people die as a result of the disease; this translates into more than 4,800 deaths worldwide every day.<sup>2</sup> Lung cancer can be broadly divided into two major types: NSCLC and small cell lung cancer. NSCLC is the most prevalent type, accounting for around 85% of all cases.<sup>3</sup> NSCLC comprises non-squamous and squamous-cell lung cancer, the squamous form of which is characterised by flat cells covering the airway surface when viewed under a microscope.<sup>3</sup>
<h3>About Tecentriq (atezolizumab)</h3>
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy (CIT) that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.
Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, and in PD-L1-positive triple-negative breast cancer.

<p align=""center""><em>Acquisition of Razor’s treatment stratification test will broaden OncoCyte's capabilities to include the management of early-stage lung cancer </em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>In a published study of individuals identified as high risk by the Razor test and treated with chemotherapy, the five-year disease-free survival rate was 92%, compared to 49% in untreated high-risk patients</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>Recent positive coverage decision by the </em><em>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) accelerates path to commercialization and secures reimbursement for ~70% of eligible patients</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">ALAMEDA, Calif., Sept. 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OncoCyte Corporation (NYSE American: OCX), a developer of novel tests for the early diagnosis and management of lung cancer, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Razor Genomics.  An initial closing at which OncoCyte will acquire shares of Razor preferred stock representing 25% of the outstanding equity of Razor, is expected to close by the end of September, subject to customary and other closing conditions. OncoCyte will have the option to acquire the balance of the outstanding shares of Razor common stock from Razor’s shareholders (the “Purchase Option”).</p>
<p align=""justify"">Razor’s CLIA-certified treatment stratification test (the “Razor test”) has been rigorously validated to identify early-stage lung cancer patients who are at high-risk versus low-risk of death within five years following surgical resection. The Razor test enables the identification of lung cancer patients at high risk for recurrence and allows them to be treated at a time when their cancer can still be responsive to adjuvant chemotherapy. Importantly, the recent decision by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Molecular Diagnostic Services Program (“CMS”) to recommend coverage for the Razor test is a significant inflection point for OncoCyte and accelerates the path to becoming a commercial stage company.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Notwithstanding recent advancements in treatment, lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death. Approximately 30% of patients with surgically removed early stage lung cancer recur and over half of those that recur die within five years of surgery,” said Ron Andrews, Chief Executive Officer of OncoCyte. “The addition of the Razor treatment stratification test for patients diagnosed with early stage lung cancer is a perfect downstream complement to our proprietary DetermaVu™ liquid biopsy test that we are developing to help manage CT-identified lung nodules and thereby facilitate the early diagnosis of lung cancer. The Razor test enables us to address an adjacent critical decision point that physicians and patients face during the lung cancer treatment journey that today remains unmet. There are many such decision points along this care continuum, and this transaction is a significant step forward for OncoCyte as we work to build a comprehensive diagnostic content company serving the needs of lung cancer patients across disease stages, from early diagnosis all the way through recurrence monitoring and beyond.”</p>
<p align=""justify"">“Importantly, the Razor test is extensively validated and has been published in prestigious medical journals such as <em>Lancet</em> and the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>. CMS’s recent proposed positive coverage decision to provide reimbursement reflects the clinical utility of the test and, we believe, will drive broad test adoption. There remain many significant unmet needs in the detection and treatment of lung cancer, and we are poised to occupy a leading position in providing molecular tests that can improve outcomes for lung cancer patients,” Mr. Andrews concluded.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In a published clinical utility study, the five-year disease-free survival rate was 92% for individuals identified as high risk by the Razor test and treated with chemotherapy, compared to 49% in untreated high-risk patients. Similarly, individuals identified as low risk by the Razor test had a 5-year disease free survival of 94% without the use of chemotherapy. In this study, the test demonstrated higher accuracy at discriminating between high and low risk patients than current National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN) guideline criteria for risk assessment.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In another published survey of physicians who ordered the test, approximately one in three physicians changed their treatment decision based on the results of the Razor test.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The current staging system for lung cancer is not adequate and misses high risk patients who could benefit from chemotherapy,” noted Dr. David M. Jablons, Professor and Chief of General Thoracic Surgery at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. “The Razor treatment stratification test has been shown to improve the identification of high-risk patients over conventional staging, and when given chemo, these high-risk patients had a profound improvement in survival. In fact, a new staging approach that incorporates the Razor test has now been published in <em>Journal of Thoracic Oncology</em>.”</p>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) is the first and only cancer immunotherapy approved by the European Medicines Agency for the initial treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>The combination significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for the first time in over 20 years</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has approved and granted marketing authorisation for Tecentriq<sup>®</sup> (atezolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) for the initial (first-line) treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).
“This approval makes Tecentriq the first cancer immunotherapy available in Europe for the initial treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, marking an important step forward for patients,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “The combination of Tecentriq and chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival compared to the current standard-of-care – an advance that, until now, has been difficult to achieve due to the refractory nature of this disease.”
This approval is based on results from the Phase III IMpower133 study, which showed that Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy helped people live significantly longer compared with chemotherapy alone (median overall survival [OS]=12.3 versus 10.3 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.70, 95% CI: 0.54–0.91; p=0.0069) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The Tecentriq-based combination also significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival [PFS]) compared with chemotherapy alone (PFS=5.2 versus 4.3 months; HR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.96; p=0.017).<sup>1</sup> Safety for the Tecentriq and chemotherapy combination appeared consistent with the known safety profile of Tecentriq.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide<sup>2</sup> and SCLC accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases, with the majority of patients (70%) diagnosed in the “extensive stage”, often meaning a poor prognosis.<sup>3</sup> SCLC is distinguished from other lung cancer subtypes due to its aggressive nature, rapid growth, and early development of metastatic disease.<sup>3</sup>
Currently, Roche has nine Phase III lung cancer studies underway evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other medicines across different types of lung cancer. Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.
<h3>About the IMpower133 study</h3>
IMpower133 is a Phase III, multicentre, double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) versus chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) alone in chemotherapy-naïve adults with ES-SCLC. The study enrolled 403 people who were randomised equally (1:1) to receive:
<ul>
 	<li>Tecentriq in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Arm A), or</li>
 	<li>Placebo in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Arm B, control arm)</li>
</ul>
During the treatment-induction phase, people received treatment on 21-day cycles for four cycles, followed by maintenance with Tecentriq or placebo until progressive disease (PD), as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment could be continued until persistent radiographic PD or symptomatic deterioration was observed.
The co-primary endpoints were PFS, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, and OS in the ITT population.
A summary of the ITT data from the IMpower133 study that support this approval is included below:<sup>1</sup>
<ul>
 	<li>Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy helped people live significantly longer, compared with chemotherapy alone (OS=12.3 versus 10.3 months; HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.54-0.91, p=0.0069) in the ITT population.</li>
 	<li>The Tecentriq-based combination also significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death compared with chemotherapy alone (PFS=5.2 versus 4.3 months; HR=0.77; 95% CI: 0.62–0.96, p=0.017).</li>
 	<li>Safety for the Tecentriq and chemotherapy combination appeared consistent with the known safety profile of Tecentriq.</li>
 	<li>Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 56.6% of people receiving Tecentriq plus chemotherapy, compared with 56.1% of people receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common adverse reactions (=20%) in people receiving Tecentriq plus chemotherapy were low white blood cell count (neutropenia; 23%), anaemia (14%), decreased neutrophil count (14%) and thrombocytopenia (10%).</li>
</ul>
<h3>About SCLC</h3>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally.<sup>2</sup> Each year 1.76 million people die as a result of the disease; this translates into more than 4,800 deaths worldwide every day.<sup>2</sup> Lung cancer can be broadly divided into two major types: NSCLC and SCLC, with SCLC accounting for approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases.<sup>3</sup>
<h3>About Tecentriq (atezolizumab)</h3>
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy (CIT) that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.
Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, and in PD-L1-positive triple-negative breast cancer.

<div class=""wd_subtitle wd_language_left"">Strategic agreement utilizes FDA-approved next-generation sequencing Oncomine Dx Target Test to identify RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer patients who may be suitable for LOXO-292, Lilly's RET inhibitor</div>
<span class=""xn-location"">CARLSBAD, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 9, 2019</span> /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Thermo Fisher Scientific today announced an agreement with Eli Lilly and Company for development of a companion diagnostic that will use the U.S Food and Drug Administration-approved, next-generation sequencing-based Oncomine Dx Target Test to identify certain non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid cancer patients who may be treated with Lilly's investigational therapy, LOXO-292. Specifically, the test would be used with patients whose tumors harbor a rearranged during transfection (RET) alteration. <i>RET</i> variants are found in about two percent of NSCLC, about 60 percent of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and up to approximately 20 percent of other thyroid cancers.
LOXO-292 is a highly selective and potent oral RET inhibitor being studied by Lilly in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced cancers that harbor activating alterations of the RET kinase. Changes in the RET kinase, including fusions and mutations, can cause uncontrolled cell growth leading to tumor development. Cancers driven by such alterations are mostly dependent on this singularly activated pathway, making them highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors.
""One of the biggest barriers to realizing the full power of precision medicine in oncology is having access to high-quality testing, such as next-generation sequencing-based tests, that identify a broad range of clinically actionable alterations, can be performed locally and allow treating institutions to participate in this important step in the evolving treatment paradigm,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Anne White</span>, president of Lilly Oncology. ""With this agreement, we believe that more patients will gain access to high-quality tumor profiling, identifying those with <i>RET </i>alterations potentially suitable for LOXO-292 therapy, in addition to other alterations suitable for treatment with other therapies.""
<span class=""xn-person"">Mark Stevenson</span>, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific said: ""We are pleased to enter into this agreement with Lilly and leverage our Oncomine platform as a means to quickly identify cancer patients who may benefit from this breakthrough therapy, even in cases of limited sample availability. We are committed to working with our global pharmaceutical partners to help bring forth next-generation sequencing-based companion diagnostics and best-in-class therapies that can have a profound impact on treating cancer patients.""
Under the terms of the agreement, <span class=""xn-person"">Thermo Fisher</span> will retain the rights to commercialize the test in all markets, including <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>. Once validation is complete, <span class=""xn-person"">Thermo Fisher</span> will submit a supplemental premarket approval (sPMA) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to broaden the clinical claims of its Oncomine Dx Target Test.
The NGS test, which received FDA approval in 2017, simultaneously screens tumor samples for multiple gene variants associated with NSCLC, a subset of which are utilized to identify patients who may be eligible for several approved targeted therapies. It is covered in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and a majority of the largest commercial U.S. health plans. Oncomine Dx Target Test is also approved for reimbursement by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW).

AstraZeneca today presented detailed results from the Phase III CASPIAN trial, showing <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) significantly improved overall survival (OS) in patients with previously-untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
<i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with four cycles of standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapy (etoposide with either cisplatin or carboplatin) demonstrated a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in OS vs. SoC consisting of up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI).
The risk of death was reduced by 27% (equal to a hazard ratio of 0.73), with median OS of 13.0 months for <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy vs. 10.3 months for SoC. Results showed a prolonged OS benefit with an estimated 33.9% of patients alive at 18 months following treatment with <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy vs. 24.7% of patients following SoC.
Across all efficacy endpoints, benefits were observed in patients treated with <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy vs. SoC. Results showed a significantly higher progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 months (17.5% vs. 4.7%), a 10.3% increase in confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (67.9% vs. 57.6%), and improved duration of response (DOR) at 12 months (22.7% vs. 6.3%).
The results were presented at the Presidential Symposium of the IASLC 2019 World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer in Barcelona, Spain.
Jose´ Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D said: “We are encouraged to see more than a third of small cell lung cancer patients treated with <i>Imfinzi</i> plus chemotherapy alive at the 18-month landmark, which is remarkable given the aggressive nature of the disease. It is also noteworthy that these results may enable physicians to choose <i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy backbones. We look forward to working with regulatory authorities to bring <i>Imfinzi</i> to patients with small cell lung cancer around the world as soon as possible.”
Luis Paz-Ares, MD, Ph.D., Chair, Medical Oncology Department, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, Madrid, Spain and principal investigator in the Phase III CASPIAN trial said: “Patients have had limited treatment options for small cell lung cancer, a devastating disease where the five-year survival rate has been as low as 6%. The significant survival benefit demonstrated with <i>Imfinzi</i> combined with only four cycles of a choice of chemotherapy compared to a robust control arm, provides evidence and hope of a new treatment option for these patients.”
SCLC is an aggressive, fast-growing cancer that recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.<sup>1</sup>

The safety and tolerability of <i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with SoC etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy was consistent with previous trials. Results showed that 61.5% of patients experienced a Grade 3 or 4 AE with <i>Imfinzi </i>plus SoC (all causes) vs. 62.4% with SoC, and patients discontinuing treatment due to AEs were similar between arms (9.4% vs. 9.4%).
<i>Imfinzi</i> is also being tested following concurrent chemoradiation therapy in limited-stage SCLC in the Phase III ADRIATIC trial.
<i>Imfinzi</i> is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer after chemoradiotherapy in 49 countries, including the US, Japan and across the EU, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial.
<b>About CASPIAN</b>
The CASPIAN trial is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage SCLC. The trial compared <i>Imfinzi</i> in combination with etoposide and either cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy, or <i>Imfinzi</i>, tremelimumab and chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with up to four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional PCI. The trial will continue to the final analysis of OS for the combination of <i>Imfinzi</i>, tremelimumab and chemotherapy.
The trial is being conducted in more than 200 centres across 22 countries, including in the US, Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint is OS.
<b>About small cell lung cancer</b>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.<sup>2</sup> Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and SCLC, with about 15% classified as SCLC.<sup>3</sup> About three quarters of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.<sup> </sup>Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.<sup>4</sup>
<b>About <i>Imfinzi</i></b>
<i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.
<i>Imfinzi</i> is also approved for previously-treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in 10 countries, including the US.
As part of a broad development programme, <i>Imfinzi</i> is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, biliary tract cancer and other solid tumours.
<b>About AstraZeneca in lung cancer</b>
AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. We aim to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with our approved medicines <i>Iressa</i> (gefitinib) and <i>Tagrisso</i> (osimertinib), and ongoing Phase III trials ADAURA, LAURA, FLAURA and FLAURA2 as well as the Phase II combination trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD.<sup>5-7</sup>
Our extensive late-stage Immuno-Oncology programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents approximately three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.<sup>8</sup> <i>Imfinzi</i> (durvalumab), an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON, PEARL, and CASPIAN) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials AEGEAN, PACIFIC-2, ADRIATIC, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-4, and PACIFIC-5) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy.
<b>About AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)</b>
IO is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. Our IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. We believe that IO-based therapies offer the potential for life-changing cancer treatments for the clear majority of patients.
We are pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes <i>Imfinzi</i> (anti-PDL1) as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4) in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine our IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across our Oncology pipeline, and from our research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.
<b>About AstraZeneca in oncology</b>
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly-growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With at least six new medicines to be launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 5, 2019</span> /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced the launch of the company's TRILUMINATE Pivotal trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the company's TriClip transcatheter tricuspid valve repair system for the treatment of severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). This is the first pivotal Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) trial in the U.S. to evaluate a catheter-based, non-surgical treatment for patients with severe TR – a condition in which the valve doesn't close properly, allowing blood to flow backward into the heart, which forces the heart to work harder. In severe cases, this condition can potentially lead to heart failure if left untreated.<sup>i.ii.iii</sup>
In the U.S. alone, approximately one in 30 people over the age of 65 have moderate to severe TR<sup>iv</sup>. Despite the prevalence of tricuspid valve disease, the tricuspid valve is often referred to as the ""forgotten heart valve"" as treatment options are limited. There are currently no approved non-surgical, minimally invasive treatments for people with severe TR.
The first enrollments in the TRILUMINATE IDE study occurred at Abbott Northwestern hospital in <span class=""xn-location"">Minneapolis, Minn.</span>, led by <span class=""xn-person"">Paul Sorajja</span>, M.D., and his cardiac team. Dr. Sorajja also serves as the trial co-primary investigator.
""Patients with symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation are often at an increased risk for conventional surgery. As a result, many are not referred for intervention,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David Adams</span>, M.D., Chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Cardiac Surgeon-in-Chief of the Mount Sinai Health System and co-primary investigator in the trial. ""The opportunity to assess how we can better treat these patients with a minimally invasive approach is critical and  we're excited about the potential for this therapy in improving the quality of life for these patients.""
The TRILUMINATE Pivotal study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled global study of approximately 700 patients expected to enroll in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, and <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>. Patients will be randomized to receive either the TriClip device or medical therapy and followed for a total of five years. The study will also have a single arm for the treatment of subjects with more complex tricuspid valve disease.
Alongside the TRILUMINATE study, Abbott's TriClip device was accepted for national reimbursement consideration through a process known as ""Parallel Review"" by the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The Parallel Review program is a collaborative effort that is intended to reduce the time between FDA approval and Medicare coverage decisions through CMS's National Coverage Determination (NCD) process.<sup>[1]</sup>
The launch of the TRILUMINATE Pivotal IDE study follows a smaller, single-arm TRILUMINATE trial that was conducted in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> and the U.S. to evaluate the safety and performance of the TriClip repair system. Results from <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2570474-1&amp;h=1249825877&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fabbott.mediaroom.com%2F2019-05-21-TRILUMINATE-Study-Shows-Treatment-with-Abbotts-First-of-its-Kind-Minimally-Invasive-Device-Reduces-Tricuspid-Heart-Valve-Leaks&amp;a=that+study"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">that study</a>, presented during a late-breaking session at EuroPCR 2019, found that after 30 days, 86.6 percent of patients who received the TriClip device saw a reduction in TR severity of at least one grade. In addition to a strong safety profile for the procedures in patients considered to be at high risk for surgery, a significant proportion of patients also saw an improvement in their heart failure symptoms as assessed using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score.
""While we've made substantial progress on a number of fronts for challenging structural heart conditions, tricuspid regurgitation impacts far too many patients worldwide, and physicians are limited by a lack of meaningful therapy alternatives to surgery,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Neil Moat</span>, M.D., chief medical officer of Abbott's structural heart business. ""Early results with our TriClip repair system have been encouraging and we're excited to continue driving innovation that we believe will benefit more patients in the future.""
Abbott's transcatheter tricuspid valve repair system is an investigational device only. The TriClip valve repair system is built on the foundation of Abbott's MitraClip system, which has been commercially available in the U.S. since 2013 and in Europe since 2008. With more than 15 years of clinical experience and over 80,000 patients treated worldwide, the MitraClip system is the first and only transcatheter mitral valve therapy with proven safety and survival, and durable clinical outcomes.

<b>- Filing includes data from two Phase 3 trials which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Abicipar quarterly dosing regimen</b><b>- Approvals in the United States and Europe are anticipated in 2020</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
DUBLIN, Sept. 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company with a heritage of more than 70 years in eye care, and Molecular Partners (SIX: MOLN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of drugs known as DARPin® platform, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a Biologics License Application (BLA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Abicipar pegol, a novel, investigational DARPin® therapy, in patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The FDA is expected to take action on the BLA mid-2020. A decision from the European Commission is expected in the second half of 2020.
<div id=""DivAssetPlaceHolder1"" class=""PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference"">
<img title=""Allergan plc logo"" src=""https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/222796/allergan_plc_logo.jpg"" alt=""Allergan plc logo"" />
</div>
The BLA and MAA filings are based on data from two Phase 3 trials, CEDAR and SEQUOIA, which supported the non-inferior efficacy of the Abicipar quarterly dosing regimen to maintain vision gains with more than 50 percent fewer injections versus ranibizumab (13 vs. 6) dosed monthly in the first year.
""Acceptance of our marketing applications brings us one step closer to offering physicians and patients a new treatment option that has the potential to reduce patient visits and injections while achieving and maintaining vision gains with quarterly dosing,"" said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer, Allergan. ""Today's announcement reinforces Allergan's continued commitment to eye care innovation and means patients are one step closer to receiving what we believe to be a transformative treatment that will help address unmet needs for nAMD patients.""
The identical, global Phase 3 head-to-head pivotal trials, CEDAR and SEQUOIA, assessed the efficacy and safety of Abicipar compared with ranibizumab in treatment-naïve patients with nAMD. The primary endpoint measured the proportion of treated patients with stable vision at week 52 and, in both studies, Abicipar demonstrated similar efficacy after 6 or 8 injections, compared to 13 ranibizumab injections in the first year of this study. The overall adverse events were similar among the three treatment arms (Abicipar dosed every 8 weeks, Abicipar dosed every 12 weeks, or ranibizumab dosed monthly).
""The FDA filing acceptance marks an important milestone for the DARPin® technology as Abicipar becomes our first DARPin® candidate to receive filing acceptance by the FDA,"" commented Michael T. Stumpp, COO of Molecular Partners. ""We're excited for the potential Abicipar holds to become a true quarterly dosed anti-VEGF treatment in patients with nAMD to provide vision gains and improved quality of life.""
DARPin® molecules are derived from naturally occurring binding proteins that consist of repeat sequences with capping structures at each end of the protein. DARPin® molecules have three key properties that have made them an important investigational class of binding protein for researchers: high binding affinity, low molecular weight and customizable applications. These three properties make DARPin® molecules candidates for a broad range of therapeutic applications and are currently being investigated in therapeutic categories such as ophthalmology, oncology and immuno-oncology. Allergan and Molecular Partners are committed to advancing patient care through the development of molecules such as Abicipar.

AG10 is a small molecule designed to treat the root cause of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) – destabilized and misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein – by binding and stabilizing TTR in the blood. Eidos is currently evaluating AG10 in a Phase 3 study in the U.S. and Europe for ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) – a progressive, fatal disease caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR amyloid in the heart – and plans to begin a Phase 3 study in ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) – a progressive, fatal disease caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR amyloid in the peripheral nervous system.
“There is a significant need for new treatments for TTR amyloidosis. We believe AG10 holds promise in its ability to stabilize TTR and halt disease progression,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research &amp; Development at Alexion. “We are excited by the potential to grow our amyloidosis portfolio by partnering with Eidos to expand the development of AG10 to Japan. Alexion has more than 10 years of experience operating there, and we look forward to applying our expertise to bring AG10 to Japanese patients.”
“The Phase 2 study in ATTR-CM suggested that AG10 has the potential to become an important treatment option for the underserved ATTR-CM population. The trial showed that AG10 was generally well-tolerated and resulted in near-complete stabilization of TTR, which is known to be correlated with disease severity in ATTR-CM. In the study, AG10 also normalized serum TTR levels, a prognostic indicator of survival in ATTR patients,” said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Medical Officer of Eidos. “We have now begun our Phase 3 program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AG10 in larger studies. This agreement provides the potential opportunity to help even more patients globally by leveraging Alexion’s significant development and commercial experience to expand the AG10 program into Japan.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will acquire an exclusive license for the clinical development and commercialization of AG10 in Japan. Eidos will receive an upfront payment of $25 million and an equity investment of $25 million at a premium to the market price upon deal execution, with the potential for additional Japanese-based milestone- and royalty-dependent payments.
<b>About AG10</b>
AG10 is an investigational, orally-administered small molecule designed to potently stabilize tetrameric transthyretin, or TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to TTR amyloidosis, or ATTR. In a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic ATTR-CM, AG10 was generally well tolerated, demonstrated greater than 90 percent average TTR stabilization at Day 28, and increased serum TTR concentrations, a prognostic indicator of survival in a retrospective study of ATTR-CM patients, in a dose-dependent manner.
AG10 was designed to mimic a naturally-occurring variant of the TTR gene (T119M) that is considered a rescue mutation because co-inheritance has been shown to prevent or ameliorate ATTR in individuals also inheriting a pathogenic, or disease-causing, mutation in the TTR gene. To our knowledge, AG10 is the only TTR stabilizer in development that has been observed to mimic the stabilizing structure of this rescue mutation.
The Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM study of AG10 in patients with ATTR-CM is underway in the United States and Europe. Part A of the study will assess the change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 12 months. Part B of the study will evaluate reduction in all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations will be evaluated at 30 months. In addition, Eidos plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of AG10 in ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) in the second half of 2019.
<b>About Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTR)</b>
There is significant medical need in transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) given the large patient population and an inadequate current standard of care. ATTR is caused by the destabilization of TTR due to inherited mutations or aging and is commonly divided into three distinct categories: wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt-CM), mutant ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTRm-CM), and ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN). The worldwide prevalence of each disease is approximately 400,000 patients, 40,000 patients and 10,000 patients, respectively.
All three forms of ATTR are progressive and fatal. For patients with untreated ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM, symptoms usually manifest later in life (age 50+), with median survival of three to five years from diagnosis. ATTR-PN either presents in a patient's early 30s or later (age 50+), and results in a median life expectancy of five to ten years from diagnosis for untreated patients. Progression of all forms of ATTR causes significant morbidity, impacts productivity and quality of life, and creates a significant economic burden due to the costs associated with progressively greater patient needs for supportive care.

PRINCETON, N.J.--(<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com%2F&amp;esheet=52090280&amp;newsitemid=20190910005328&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bristol-Myers+Squibb+Company&amp;index=1&amp;md5=76295397594c7dff5a0c0a4bd94be16a"">Bristol-Myers Squibb Company</a> (NYSE: BMY) today announced long-term pooled efficacy and safety results from the Phase 3 CheckMate -017 and CheckMate -057 studies in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). At five years, patients treated with<i> Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) continued to experience long-term overall survival (OS) benefit versus docetaxel. OS rates at five years were 13.4% for <i>Opdivo</i> and 2.6% for docetaxel. The OS benefit for <i>Opdivo</i>-treated patients was observed across all subgroups.
The safety profile for patients treated with <i>Opdivo</i> was consistent with previously reported findings in second-line NSCLC and no new safety signals were seen with extended follow-up. Of patients still on study, only 2 of 70 experienced a new treatment-related select AE between years three and four and there were no new treatment-related select AE’s reported between years four and five among the 55 patients still on study.
Among patients with an objective response to <i>Opdivo</i>, 32.2% continued to see a response at five years. 0% of patients with an objective response to docetaxel continued to see a response at five years. The median duration of response was 19.9 months for <i>Opdivo</i>-treated patients and 5.6 months for patients treated with docetaxel.
Scott Gettinger, M.D., professor, Medical Oncology at Yale Cancer Center, commented, “The five-year CheckMate -017 and 057 data underscores the durable efficacy for <i>Opdivo</i> in this patient population compared to traditional chemotherapy.”
Sabine Maier, M.D., development lead, Thoracic Cancers, Bristol-Myers Squibb, said, “Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in second-line non-small cell lung cancer in 2015, <i>Opdivo </i>has become an important treatment option for this population of patients, who historically faced five-year survival rates of less than 5% when treated with standard chemotherapy. The long-term survival outcomes from these two studies in a large patient population add to the body of evidence supporting the durability of <i>Opdivo</i>-based regimens, which has now been demonstrated across multiple tumor types and lines of therapy.”
This pooled analysis, which represent the longest follow-up of previously treated NSCLC patients treated with Immuno-Oncology therapy in phase 3 randomized trials, will be shared in an oral presentation today from 12-12:10 PM CEST (OA14.04) at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 20<sup>th</sup> World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in Barcelona, Spain.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About the Analysis</span></b>
The pooled analysis of the two randomized Phase 3 CheckMate -017 and CheckMate -057 studies were conducted to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) in a large population of patients (n=854) with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) across both squamous and non-squamous histologies. This pooled five-year analysis represents the longest follow-up reported from randomized Phase 3 trials of an Immuno-Oncology therapy in this setting and provides insight into the impact of <i>Opdivo</i>response on long-term overall survival (OS) outcomes. Patients in both studies experienced disease progression during or after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and were randomized 1:1 to receive <i>Opdivo</i> 3 mg/kg once every two weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once every three weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the primary analysis, patients in the docetaxel arm no longer receiving benefit could cross over to receive <i>Opdivo</i>. OS was the primary endpoint for both studies.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About Lung Cancer</span></b>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common types of lung cancer and accounts for up to 85% of diagnoses. Survival rates vary depending on the stage and type of the cancer when diagnosed. For patients diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, the five-year survival rate is approximately 5%.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">Bristol-Myers Squibb: Advancing Oncology Research</span></b>
At Bristol-Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The focus of our research is to increase quality, long-term survival for patients and make cure a possibility. Through a unique multidisciplinary approach powered by translational science, we harness our deep scientific experience in oncology and Immuno-Oncology (I-O) research to identify novel treatments tailored to individual patient needs. Our researchers are developing a diverse, purposefully built pipeline designed to target different immune system pathways and address the complex and specific interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment and the immune system. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines, like I-O, a reality for patients.
<b><span class=""bwuline"">About <i>Opdivo</i></span></b>
<i>Opdivo</i> is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, <i>Opdivo</i> has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
<i>Opdivo</i>’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the <i>Opdivo</i> clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The <i>Opdivo</i> trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from <i>Opdivo</i> across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, <i>Opdivo</i> was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. <i>Opdivo</i> is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s <i>Opdivo</i> and <i>Yervoy </i>combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 60 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in &lt;1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
<b>Infusion Reactions</b>
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in &lt;1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</b>
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
<b>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</b>
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone</b>
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
<b>Lactation</b>
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.
<b>Serious Adverse Reactions</b>
In Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse drug reactions reported in 2% to &lt;5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase. In Checkmate 066, serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=206). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in =2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (3.9%) and diarrhea (3.4%). In Checkmate 067, serious adverse reactions (74% and 44%), adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation (47% and 18%) or to dosing delays (58% and 36%), and Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (72% and 51%) all occurred more frequently in the OPDIVO plus YERVOY arm (n=313) relative to the OPDIVO arm (n=313). The most frequent (=10%) serious adverse reactions in the OPDIVO plus YERVOY arm and the OPDIVO arm, respectively, were diarrhea (13% and 2.2%), colitis (10% and 1.9%), and pyrexia (10% and 1.0%). In Checkmate 017 and 057, serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=418).

The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were pneumonia, dyspnea, pneumonitis, pleural effusions, and dehydration. In Checkmate 025, serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=406). The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in =2% of patients were acute kidney injury, pleural effusion, pneumonia, diarrhea, and hypercalcemia. In Checkmate 214, serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients receiving OPDIVO plus YERVOY and in 43% of patients receiving sunitinib. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in =2% of patients were diarrhea, pyrexia, pneumonia, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea, adrenal insufficiency, and colitis; in patients treated with sunitinib, they were pneumonia, pleural effusion, and dyspnea. In Checkmate 205 and 039, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 7% and dose delays due to adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients (n=266).

<strong>DEERFIELD, Ill. - September 10, 2019</strong>
Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), a leading global medical products company, today entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cheetah Medical, a leading provider of non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring technologies. The agreement demonstrates Baxter's ongoing commitment to improving clinical outcomes with an established patient monitoring technology to better inform and guide clinicians' treatment decisions. Cheetah Medical is a natural adjacency for Baxter, given Baxter's longstanding leadership in infusion systems and intravenous (IV) solutions, breadth of knowledge in fluid management, and strong presence in critical care and IV therapy. The transaction consists of an upfront cash consideration of $190 million, with potential for an additional $40 million based on clinical and commercial milestones.
The addition of Cheetah Medical will accelerate Baxter's presence in the specialized patient monitoring space with key technology used to guide fluid management—a critical aspect of patient care—as too little or too much fluid can increase mortality and risk of complications. Cheetah Medical's technology is helping to shift care away from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to fluid administration to one that is data-driven and tailored to individual patient needs. Through this integrated approach to medication delivery and patient monitoring, clinicians will be better able to manage patients with sepsis, acute kidney injury (AKI) and other critical conditions, as well as patients undergoing surgery. Cheetah Medical's technology will also serve as a foundational component of a novel platform of specialized patient monitoring technologies currently under development. This platform will join other Baxter devices and products—IV infusion pumps, IV fluids and medications—as part of an integrated system designed to aid and inform therapeutic decisions.
""The robust capabilities and innovative monitoring technologies we will gain with the acquisition of Cheetah Medical will be additional strategic growth drivers as we work to eliminate preventable harm and enable personalized therapy for hospitalized patients around the world,” said David Ferguson, general manager, Medication Delivery, Baxter. ""We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring these products to more patients and clinicians and look forward to building upon Cheetah Medical's expertise and technology to enhance our leadership in medication delivery and critical care.""
Cheetah Medical, headquartered in Boston and Tel Aviv, Israel, was founded in 2000. Today, its technology is available in approximately 30 countries around the world, including the United States. Cheetah Medical will provide Baxter with the company's non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems, including the latest <strong>Starling</strong><strong>™ SV</strong>system. These monitoring technologies provide dynamic measurements of fluid responsiveness, enabling clinicians to make more confident and informed treatment decisions regarding the proper amount of fluid required to maintain organ and tissue perfusion.
""Cheetah Medical brings a talented team with globally recognized experience in monitoring and fluid management,"" added Ferguson. ""We welcome the new employees who will help us grow our leadership in this space and join us in our mission to save and sustain lives.""
""We strongly believe in the power of our technology to help clinicians make more confident and informed treatment decisions in ways that can help improve patient outcomes and enhance healthcare efficiencies,"" said Chris Hutchison, president and chief executive officer, Cheetah Medical. ""Becoming part of Baxter will enable us to continue to invest in clinical and commercial initiatives on a global basis, which will help ensure that the right therapy gets to the right patients at the right time.""
The proposed acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. The company expects the acquisition to be immaterial to earnings in 2019 and 2020.
<strong>About Cheetah Medical</strong>
Cheetah Medical is the pioneer and leading global provider of 100 percent non-invasive fluid management monitoring technologies, designed for use in critical care, operating room and emergency department settings. The CHEETAH Starling™ SV is fast becoming the gold standard in fluid management, as it provides immediate, dynamic assessments of fluid responsiveness, enabling clinicians to make more confident and informed treatment for their patients. Moreover, recent research from the University of Kansas Medical Center has shown effective fluid management can reduce hospital ICU stays by an average of 2.89 days, reduce risk of mechanical ventilation and initiation of acute dialysis, saving over $14,000 in medical costs <em>per</em>patient. The company's fluid management systems currently make an impact in more than 400 hospitals throughout the U.S. and in 30 countries worldwide.

<em>Conference Call and Webcast Today at 5:00 pm EDT / 4:00 pm CDT</em>
<strong>The Woodlands, Texas, September 10, 2019</strong> - Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX), today announced the termination of its alliance with Sanofi for the development and commercialization of Zynquista<strong>™</strong> (sotagliflozin) and the settlement of its related disputes with Sanofi, each effective September 9, 2019. In connection with the termination, Lexicon will regain all rights to Zynquista and assume full responsibility for the worldwide development and commercialization of Zynquista in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Under the terms of the settlement, Sanofi will pay Lexicon $260 million, of which $208 million is payable upfront and the remainder is payable within twelve months, and coordinate with Lexicon in the transition of responsibility for ongoing clinical studies and other activities.
“Our four-year alliance with Sanofi has been a productive one, with Zynquista receiving marketing approval in Europe in type 1 diabetes and advancing into late-stage studies in type 2 diabetes,” said Lonnel Coats, president and chief executive officer of Lexicon. “Regaining worldwide rights allows us to advance our efforts to realize the full value of the Zynquista program as we prepare for regulatory filings in the U.S. and in Europe in type 2 diabetes, with data coming over the next few months from the remainder of the core Phase 3 studies and over the longer term from two outcomes studies with potential for demonstrating cardiovascular and renal benefits. We believe that this potential, along with a European approval in type 1 diabetes, offer an attractive opportunity for potential collaborators as we work to maximize the global potential for Zynquista and to achieve greater operational flexibility.”
<strong>Conference Call and Webcast Information</strong>
Lexicon management will hold a live conference call and webcast today at 5:00 pm EDT / 4:00 pm CDT to discuss today’s announcement. The dial-in number for the conference call is 888-645-5785 (U.S./Canada) or 970-300-1531 (international). The conference ID for all callers is 7376526. The live webcast and replay may be accessed by visiting Lexicon’s website at www.lexpharma.com/investors. An archived version of the webcast will be available on the website for 14 days.
<h4>About Zynquista (sotagliflozin)</h4>
Discovered using Lexicon’s unique approach to gene science, Zynquista is an oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney. Zynquista is approved in the European Union (EU) for use as an adjunct to insulin therapy to improve blood sugar (glycemic) control in adults with type 1 diabetes with a body mass index = 27 kg/m2, who could not achieve adequate glycemic control despite optimal insulin therapy. Outside of such approval, Zynquista is investigational and has not been approved by any other regulatory authority for type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 10, 2019-- Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: XERS), a specialty pharmaceutical company leveraging its novel technology platforms to develop and commercialize ready-to-use injectable and infusible drug formulations, announced today that it has received regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for GVOKE™ (glucagon) injection, its ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above.
GVOKE is the first glucagon product approved that can be administered via a prefilled syringe (GVOKE PFS) or auto-injector (GVOKE HypoPen™), vastly reducing the steps to prepare and administer glucagon in the event of severe hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels. These innovative formats are designed to provide the reliability of a ready-to-use liquid glucagon while making it easier for patients or caregivers to administer quickly and simply. GVOKE will be available in two doses: a 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose for pediatric patients and a 1 mg/0.2 mL dose for adolescent and adult patients. GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma, insulinoma, and patients with a known hypersensitivity to glucagon or to any of the excipients in GVOKE.
“Everyone managing diabetes is at risk for developing severely low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, and we know this can quickly progress from a mild event to an emergency situation. The availability of GVOKE - the first ready-to-use liquid glucagon option - brings confidence to patients, parents and caregivers that these challenging events can be easily and rapidly resolved,” said Davida Kruger, MSN, APN-BC, BC-ADM<b></b>Certified Nurse Practitioner, Henry Ford Health System, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disorders, Detroit, Michigan.
The FDA’s approval is based on positive <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fxerispharma.gcs-web.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fxeris-pharmaceuticals-announces-positive-phase-3-clinical-trial&amp;esheet=52090961&amp;newsitemid=20190910005829&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=results&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8defc24d06e5f6817f4d9b818ef824c1"">results</a> from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy, safety, and utility of GVOKE in treating severe hypoglycemia when compared with conventional glucagon emergency kits among adults and children with type 1 diabetes (NCT02656069, NCT03091673, NCT03439072). The studies demonstrated 100% treatment success in children and 99% treatment success in adults. Usability <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fxerispharma.gcs-web.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Florem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipiscing-elit-1&amp;esheet=52090961&amp;newsitemid=20190910005829&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=research&amp;index=2&amp;md5=c47563f87f0f49302c9f9a8d815d6c8c"">research</a> evaluating the GVOKE PFS and GVOKE HypoPen demonstrated nearly 100% success rates in administering a full dose of glucagon using the simple 2-step administration process. The most common adverse reactions in adults were nausea, vomiting, injection site edema, and headache. In pediatric and adolescent patients, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, hypoglycemia, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, hyperglycemia, injection site reactions and discomfort, and urticaria. Approximately 80% of side effects seen were mild.
""Until now, many people may have been hesitant to use conventional glucagon kits because the complex preparation felt confusing and perhaps overwhelming. With GVOKE as a new glucagon option, we gain an easy to use and effective solution to a dangerous and stressful event,"" said Jeff Hitchcock, founder and president of Children with Diabetes.
""The approval of GVOKE is an important step forward for people with diabetes. Severe hypoglycemia is a terrifying and dangerous diabetes complication. This new option will make treatment easier and faster in the event of an emergency,” said Aaron J. Kowalski, Ph.D., President and CEO of JDRF.
“While we celebrate this approval as Xeris’ first commercial product, more importantly, this milestone is a positive step forward for the diabetes community as the first premixed, prefilled, and premeasured liquid glucagon to effectively treat severe hypoglycemia in both adults and children with diabetes,” said Paul R. Edick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Xeris Pharmaceuticals. “We are actively preparing to introduce GVOKE in two different administration options to accommodate the community’s preferences starting with our pre-filled syringe in 4-6 weeks and the auto-injector in 2020.”

<b>Indication</b>
GVOKE™ is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above.
<b>Important Safety Information</b>
<b>Contraindications</b>
GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma, insulinoma, and known hypersensitivity to glucagon or to any of the excipients in GVOKE. Allergic reactions have been reported with glucagon and include anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties and hypotension.
<b>Warnings and Precautions</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because glucagon may stimulate the release of catecholamines from the tumor. If the patient develops a dramatic increase in blood pressure and a previously undiagnosed pheochromocytoma is suspected, 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate, administered intravenously, has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure.</li>
 	<li>In patients with insulinoma, administration of glucagon may produce an initial increase in blood glucose; however, GVOKE administration may directly or indirectly (through an initial rise in blood glucose) stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycemia. GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with insulinoma. If a patient develops symptoms of hypoglycemia after a dose of GVOKE, give glucose orally or intravenously.</li>
 	<li>Allergic reactions have been reported with glucagon. These include generalized rash, and in some cases, anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties and hypotension. GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction.</li>
</ul>
GVOKE is effective in treating hypoglycemia only if sufficient hepatic glycogen is present. Patients in states of starvation, with adrenal insufficiency or chronic hypoglycemia, may not have adequate levels of hepatic glycogen for GVOKE administration to be effective. Patients with these conditions should be treated with glucose.
<b>Adverse Reactions</b>
Most common (=10%) adverse reactions associated with GVOKE are nausea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia.
<b>Drug Interactions</b>
Patients taking beta-blockers may have a transient increase in pulse and blood pressure when given GVOKE. In patients taking indomethacin, GVOKE may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or may even produce hypoglycemia. GVOKE may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
Please see full Prescribing Information for GVOKE PFS and GVOKE HypoPen on <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xerispharma.com&amp;esheet=52090961&amp;newsitemid=20190910005829&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.xerispharma.com&amp;index=4&amp;md5=2737db0046b9196fa24e053eb67de7b1"">www.xerispharma.com</a>. Manufactured for Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. by Pyramid Laboratories Inc., Costa Mesa, CA 92626.
<b>About Severe Hypoglycemia</b>
Hypoglycemic events of any severity are a daily concern for people with diabetes. Mild or moderate hypoglycemia can occur multiple times a month. Severe hypoglycemia is characterized by severe cognitive impairment, requiring external assistance for recovery, and can be extremely frightening for patients and caregivers. Severe hypoglycemia can result in cardiovascular disease, seizure, coma, and, if left untreated, death. These severe hypoglycemic events can occur multiple times a year. Such events require emergency assistance from another person or caregiver such as a family member, friend, or co-worker.
<b>About Glucagon</b>
Glucagon is a metabolic hormone secreted by the pancreas that raises blood glucose levels by causing the liver to rapidly convert glycogen (the stored form of glucose) into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. Glucagon and insulin are two critical hormones in a glycemic control system that keep blood glucose at the right level in healthy individuals. In people with diabetes who are dependent on insulin, this control system is disrupted, and insulin must be injected to avoid high levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia). The opposite effect, or low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), is also prevalent in this population due to dysregulated glucagon secretion. Severe hypoglycemia is a serious condition and can lead to seizures, coma, potential brain injury and, if untreated, death.
Glucagon is the standard of care for treating severe hypoglycemia. According to the American Diabetes Association, glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose &lt;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L). Leveraging XeriSol™, one of Xeris’ two proprietary formulation technology platforms, Xeris has the potential to provide the first ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for use by people with diabetes and other conditions to prevent or manage various forms of hypoglycemia and improve glucose control.
<b>About Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</b>
Xeris is a specialty pharmaceutical company leveraging its novel technology platforms to develop and commercialize ready-to-use, room-temperature stable injectable and infusible drug formulations. The Company’s proprietary XeriSol™ and XeriJect™ formulation technologies are being evaluated for the subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) delivery of highly-concentrated, non-aqueous, ready-to-use formulations of peptides, small molecules, proteins, and antibodies using commercially available syringes, auto-injectors, multi-dose pens, and infusion pumps. XeriSol™ and XeriJect™ have the potential to offer distinct advantages over existing formulations of marketed and development-stage products, including eliminating the need for reconstitution, enabling long-term, room-temperature stability, significantly reducing injection volume, and eliminating the requirement for intravenous (IV) infusion. These attributes may lead to products that are easier to use by patients, caregivers, and health practitioners and reduce costs for payers and the healthcare system.

&nbsp;
<strong> Samsung Bioepis’ BRENZYS™ (etanercept) becomes available in Brazil through Brazil’s public health system, Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS)
</strong>•<strong> Established seven years ago, Samsung Bioepis’ products are now available across five continents: North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America.</strong>
<strong>INCHEON, KOREA – September 10, 2019</strong> – Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. today announced its expansion into the Brazilian biopharmaceutical market. The first product available in the country is BRENZYS™ (etanercept), a biosimilar referencing ENBREL®.<sup>i</sup>  BRENZYS™ was approved by Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA), the country’s health regulatory agency, in December 2017 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.
Samsung Bioepis is continuing its business expansion in multiple markets across the world, including mainland China, where the company entered into partnerships with 3SBio and C-Bridge Capital to develop and commercialize multiple biosimilar candidates from Samsung Bioepis.
BRENZYS™ is being supplied to Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS), the country’s public health system, through a Productive Development Partnership (PDP) between Samsung Bioepis and local partners, Bionovis and Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz.
Under the PDP, Samsung Bioepis will supply biosimilar products or product intermediaries to the local partners for sale to SUS for a period of 10 years. During this period, Samsung Bioepis will provide technology transfer to the local partners, so that manufacturing responsibilities can be gradually transferred to enable local manufacturing in Brazil. The PDP scheme was introduced by the Brazilian government in 2008, in order to expand access to medicines and support the country’s pharmaceutical industry through technology transfer from established companies in return for guaranteed purchases from SUS.
In Brazil, over 75% of patients nationwide rely on SUS for health care coverage.<sup>ii</sup>  While biologics represent approximately 4% of all medicinal products acquired by SUS, they account for approximately 51% of government spending on medicinal products.<sup>iii</sup>
“We are excited to provide our high-quality biosimilars to patients across Brazil, and look forward to working with our local partners to enhance patient access to high-quality healthcare. Equally important, by sharing our scientific knowledge with our local partners, we hope to do our part in contributing to the long-term development of the Brazilian biopharmaceutical industry,” said Sang-Jin Pak, Senior Vice President and Head of Commercial Division, Samsung Bioepis. “At Samsung Bioepis, we will continue to demonstrate our enduring commitment to biosimilars by further strengthening our pipeline and widening their availability for patients and health care systems across the world.”
Samsung Bioepis’ products are now available across five continents: North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. The company currently has four biosimilars approved and marketed across Europe, which include the anti-TNF trio of BENEPALI™ (etanercept), FLIXABI™ (infliximab), and IMRALDI™ (adalimumab), as well as an oncologic biosimilar, ONTRUZANT® (trastuzumab). Over 170,000 patients are currently under treatment with Samsung Bioepis’ biosimilars in Europe. In the United States, the company has one biosimilar – RENFLEXIS® (infliximab-abda) – approved and marketed. ONTRUZANT® (trastuzumab-dttb) received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2019, while ETICOVO™ (etanercept-ykro) and HADLIMA™ (adalimumab-bwwd) received FDA approval in April and July 2019, respectively.

DARMSTADT, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 11, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/-- Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, a leading science and technology company, which operates its biopharmaceutical business as EMD Serono in the US and <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the investigational targeted therapy tepotinib* in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring <i>MET</i> exon 14 skipping alterations who progressed following platinum-based cancer therapy.
""Tepotinib was associated with robust objective responses with durability that has not previously been seen in patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping alterations, selected by either tissue or liquid biopsy approaches,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Luciano Rossetti</span>, Global Head of Research &amp; Development for the Biopharma business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>. ""This breakthrough therapy designation further underscores the potential of tepotinib, and we aim to advance this program and deliver this medicine as quickly as possible to NSCLC patients who may benefit.""
Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide, with 2 million cases diagnosed annually.<sup>1</sup> Alterations of the MET signaling pathway are found in various cancer types, including 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis.<sup>2-4</sup>
Discovered in-house at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, tepotinib is an investigational oral MET kinase inhibitor that is designed to be highly potent and selective<sup>5</sup> and to inhibit the oncogenic signaling caused by <i>MET</i> (gene) alterations, including both <i>MET</i> exon 14 skipping alterations and <i>MET</i> amplifications, or MET protein overexpression.
In <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2018</span>, tepotinib's potential was recognized by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), which granted SAKIGAKE 'fast-track' designation for tepotinib in advanced NSCLC harboring <i>MET</i> exon 14 skipping alterations. SAKIGAKE designation promotes research and development in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, aiming at early practical application for innovative pharmaceutical products, medical devices and regenerative medicines.
Tepotinib is also being investigated in the INSIGHT 2 study (NCT03940703) in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated, <i>MET</i> amplified, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC having acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKI.
The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on data from the ongoing VISION study (NCT02864992), showing preliminary clinical evidence that tepotinib may offer an improvement over available therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring <i>MET</i> exon 14 skipping alterations detected by liquid biopsy (LBx) or tissue biopsy (TBx) across different lines of treatment.
Results from an interim analysis of the ongoing VISION study in 73 efficacy-evaluable patients with NSCLC with <i>MET</i> exon 14 skipping alterations identified by LBx or TBx testing demonstrate overall objective response rate (ORR) of 50.0% for LBx-identified patients as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC), and 55.3% as assessed by investigators. The ORR for TBx-identified patients was 45.1% and 54.9%, respectively. The overall median duration of response (DOR) was 12.4 months and 17.1 months among LBx-identified patients, as assessed by IRC and investigators, respectively, while among TBx-identified patients, 15.7 and 14.3 months were observed, respectively.
Most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were Grade 1 and 2. No Grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were observed. Any grade TRAEs reported by =10% of 87 patients evaluable for safety were peripheral edema (48.3%), nausea (23.0%) diarrhea (20.7%) and increased blood creatinine (12.6%). Other relevant TRAEs of any grade include increased lipase (4.6%), fatigue (3.4%) and vomiting (3.4%). TRAEs led to permanent discontinuation in four patients (two patients due to peripheral edema, one due to interstitial lung disease, one due to diarrhea and nausea).
Results from this study were presented in an oral presentation at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.<sup>6</sup> The use of both LBx and TBx to identify patients for the VISION study is intended to support improved patient selection and is consistent with the company's focus on patient-centric drug development.
<sup>*</sup><i>Tepotinib is the recommended International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for the MET kinase inhibitor (MSC2156119J). Tepotinib is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use anywhere in the world.</i>
<b>About Breakthrough Therapy Designation</b>
Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs which are intended to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). The FDA's granting of the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for advanced NSCLC does not alter the standard regulatory requirement to establish the safety and effectiveness of a drug through adequate and well-controlled studies to support approval.
<b>About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</b>
With 2 million cases diagnosed annually, lung cancer (including trachea, bronchus and lung) is the most common type of cancer worldwide, and the leading cause of cancer-related death, with 1.7 million mortality cases worldwide.<sup>1</sup>Alterations of the MET signaling pathway, including <i>MET</i> exon 14 skipping alterations and <i>MET</i> amplifications, occur in 3-5% of NSCLC cases.<sup>2-4</sup>
<b>About Tepotinib</b>
Tepotinib, discovered in-house at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, is an investigational oral MET inhibitor that is designed to inhibit the oncogenic MET receptor signaling caused by <i>MET </i>(gene) alterations, including both <i>MET</i> exon 14 skipping alterations and <i>MET </i>amplifications, or MET protein overexpression. It has been designed to have a highly selective mechanism of action, with the potential to improve outcomes in aggressive tumors that have a poor prognosis and harbor these specific alterations.
Tepotinib is currently being investigated in NSCLC and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span> is actively assessing the potential of investigating tepotinib in combination with novel therapies and in other tumor indications.

<div class=""pagebody-copy"">Apple’s support of the medical research community began with the introduction of ResearchKit and CareKit, which expanded the pace and scale at which healthcare could be studied and provided. Apple used ResearchKit to create the Apple Heart Study, which was the largest study of its kind and illustrated the impact virtual, large-scale studies can have on medical research by examining atrial fibrillation to provide validation for the irregular rhythm notification feature on Apple Watch.</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">“Women make up half of the world’s population, yet even today there has been limited investment in studying their unique health needs,” said Michelle A. Williams, a reproductive epidemiologist and dean of the faculty at the Harvard T.H. Chan School. “This study, unprecedented in scope, will greatly advance our understanding of the biological and social determinants of women’s health, and lead to better health outcomes.”</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">“This is an exciting opportunity for NIEHS researchers to contribute to the study design and use the resulting data to answer novel questions, not only important to women of reproductive age, but to women of all ages,” said Dale Sandler, Ph.D., chief of the NIEHS Epidemiology Branch.</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">“We are excited to be working with all the study participants and with Apple to identify the features of complex human physiology that lead to different outcomes in wellness or chronic disease, and to use this information to empower individuals to maximize their own health,” said Calum MacRae, the vice chair of Scientific Innovation for the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and associate professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">“At the American Heart Association, we are a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives, and we are committed to educating and empowering people to be proactive in all areas of their heart health and general well-being,” said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. “We believe that emerging technology solutions that seek to provide deeper health insights offer great potential in getting us there. We are collaborating with Apple and Brigham and Women’s Hospital on the Apple Heart and Movement Study to explore the correlation between a broad range of physical activities and a person’s overall heart health to ultimately understand risks and interventions to improve health.”</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">“We are excited about this unique opportunity to partner with Apple to determine how everyday activities affect our hearing,” said DuBois Bowman, dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “The information gleaned from this partnership will be critical for us to address the public health impact of various noise exposures on hearing loss in the United States.”</div>
<div class=""pagebody-copy"">“The World Health Organization is pleased to note the announcement of the Apple Hearing Study which will contribute toward our Make Listening Safe initiative by improving our understanding of users’ listening behaviors,” said Dr. Shelly Chadha, technical officer of Prevention of Deafness and Hearing Loss at the World Health Organization. “With over a billion young people who could be at risk of hearing loss due to unsafe listening, WHO is addressing this challenge through raising awareness and setting new standards for safe listening. The knowledge gained through this study will contribute to future public health action in this field.”</div>

SAN DIEGO--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Avalon Ventures today announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for the acquisition of Sitari Pharmaceuticals by GSK. Sitari has been developing a novel treatment for celiac disease and was the first company formed under the GSK-Avalon venture collaboration in 2013. Sitari was incubated at COI Pharmaceuticals, the Community of Innovation established by Avalon Ventures.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“Our collaboration with GSK has been overwhelmingly positive as we were able to rapidly launch a series of new companies based on promising scientific research, and we successfully advanced five programs into preclinical studies for a variety of unmet medical needs”</p>
<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190910006154/en/Avalon-Ventures-COI-Pharmaceuticals-Announce-Acquisition-Sitari#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
“Our collaboration with GSK has been overwhelmingly positive as we were able to rapidly launch a series of new companies based on promising scientific research, and we successfully advanced five programs into preclinical studies for a variety of unmet medical needs,” said Jay Lichter, Ph.D., CEO of Sitari, president and CEO of COI, and managing director of Avalon Ventures. “Sitari’s preclinical program has the potential to become a medicine to help millions of patients with celiac disease, and we are excited that GSK, a leader in developing innovative medicines, will be advancing the program.”
Genetic predisposition plays a key role in celiac disease, which is an autoimmune digestive disorder caused by intolerance to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, that damages the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food. The enzymatic activity of transglutaminase 2<i> </i>(TG2) is responsible for triggering the inflammatory cascade in response to gluten exposure in patients with celiac disease. Sitari’s TG2 inhibitors have the potential to suppress the autoimmune response that results in intestinal inflammation and cell pathogenesis in celiac patients.
“Over the last six years, GSK and Avalon have pioneered a unique biotech funding model designed to identify novel targets from top-tier academic labs and translate cutting-edge discoveries into promising clinical candidates,” said John Lepore, SVP, Research, GSK. “Bringing the Sitari TG2 program into GSK is strongly aligned with our research focus on genetically-associated targets and immune-driven disease. The current standard of care for celiac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, but a significant number of patients still experience gastrointestinal symptoms and disease progression. TG2 inhibition could represent a new hope for celiac disease patients.”

<b>About biosimilars</b><sup>4</sup>
A biosimilar biologic drug, or a biosimilar, is a drug demonstrated to be highly similar to a biologic drug that was already authorized for sale (known as the reference biologic drug). Biosimilars are approved based on a thorough comparison to a reference biologic drug. A biosimilar may enter the market after the expiry of the reference biologic drug's patents and data protection.
<b>About HERZUMA® (trastuzumab)</b>
HERZUMA® is a monoclonal antibody (mAB) biosimilar to HERCEPTIN® that selectively binds with high affinity to extra cellular domain (ECD) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 protein overexpression is observed in breast cancer and gastric cancer. HERZUMA® is the second HERCEPTIN® biosimilar approved by Health Canada for the treatment of adult patients with Early Breast Cancer (EBC), Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) and Metastatic Gastric Cancer (MGC).
HERZUMA® was first approved by the <span class=""xn-location"">South Korea's</span> Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2014</span>. Since <span class=""xn-chron"">October 2016</span>, TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. entered into an exclusive partnership with Celltrion Inc. to commercialize HERZUMA® in the U.S. and Canada. The European Commission granted marketing authorization for HERZUMA® in <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2018</span> and the drug was approved in all 28 EU member states, <span class=""xn-location"">Norway</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Liechtenstein</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Iceland</span> (non-members of the EU).

<b>About Early and Metastatic Breast Cancer<sup>5,6</sup></b>
Breast Cancer is a cancer that starts in the cells of the breast. Those cells sometimes change and no longer grow or behave normally, which may lead to non-cancerous (benign) breast conditions such as atypical hyperplasia and cysts. It can also lead to a cancerous (malignant) tumour that can grow into and destroy nearby tissue.
Most often, breast cancer starts in cells that line the ducts, the tubes that carry milk from the glands to the nipple, and is called ductal carcinoma. When the cancer starts in the cells of the lobules, which are the groups of glands that make milk, it is called lobular carcinoma. Breast cancer has different stages that describe or classify a cancer based on how much cancer there is in the body and where it is when first diagnosed.
<b>Early Breast Cancer (EBC)</b><b><sup> </sup></b>is the stage when the tumour is smaller than 5 cm and the cancer has not spread to more than 3 lymph nodes. This stage includes stages 1A, <span class=""xn-money"">1B</span> and 2A.
<b>Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) </b>is the stage when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bone, liver, lungs or brain. It is also called stage 4 breast cancer.
<b>About Metastatic Gastric Cancer<sup>7,8</sup></b>
Gastric cancer is a malignant tumour that starts in cells of the stomach. The tumour may cause precancerous conditions in the stomach if not treated, such as gastric adenoma, or adenomatous polyps, and gastric epithelial dysplasia. In some cases, changes to stomach cells can cause cancer. Most often, cancer starts in gland cells in the inner layer of the stomach wall, which is called the gastric mucosa. This type of cancer is called adenocarcinoma of the stomach. It makes up about 95% of all stomach cancers.
Metastatic Gastric Cancer is when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as to the lungs, bone, peritoneum or omentum. This is also called phase 4 stomach or gastric cancer.

</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) presented today full pivotal phase III study results for satralizumab as a monotherapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a rare, debilitating central nervous system disease. Results from the SAkuraStar study, presented at the 35th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), show that satralizumab monotherapy achieved a 55% reduction in the risk of relapses compared to placebo in the overall population, representative of NMOSD patients (HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.89; p=0.0184). In the large (~67%) subgroup of patients seropositive for AQP4-IgG antibodies, the effect was higher with a 74% reduction in risk of relapses (HR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.11-0.63; p=0.0014). People who are AQP4-IgG seropositive tend to experience a more severe disease course.
“The positive phase III results for satralizumab, first as an add-on therapy and now as a monotherapy are exciting to see, and importantly, it achieved efficacy in a broad range of NMOSD patients, reflective of what we see in our everyday practice. Satralizumab targets the IL-6 receptor, potentially offering a novel treatment approach,” said Professor Jeffrey Bennett, University of Colorado Neurology &amp; Ophthalmology. “Approved treatment options demonstrating favourable safety and efficacy in controlled clinical trials are urgently needed. Even one relapse may lead to blindness and debilitating motor dysfunction for people with NMOSD.”
In the overall satralizumab-treated population, 76.1% were relapse-free at 48 weeks, and 72.1% relapse-free at 96 weeks, compared to 61.9% and 51.2% with placebo, respectively. Data from the AQP4-IgG seropositive subgroup showed that 82.9% were relapse-free at 48 weeks and 76.5% relapse-free at 96 weeks when treated with satralizumab, compared to 55.4% and 41.1% with placebo, respectively.
NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies (AQP4-IgG) that target and damage a specific cell type, called astrocytes, resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain. Through the use of a diagnostic biomarker test, most NMOSD patients are identified as AQP4-IgG seropositive; however, as many as one-third of patients with NMOSD are AQP4-IgG seronegative. The condition is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis.
Satralizumab inhibits IL-6 signalling, which is believed to play a key role in the inflammation that occurs in people with NMOSD, leading to damage and disability. People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses that directly cause cumulative, permanent neurological damage.
“While first described 125 years ago, the underlying biology of NMOSD has only recently been understood. The positive results from the pivotal SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky studies support the hypothesis that IL-6 plays a key role in this devastating disease that can take away people’s independence,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are encouraged by these results and look forward to working with regulators over the coming months to bring satralizumab to people living with NMOSD as soon as possible.”
These SAkuraStar data add to the previously reported results for satralizumab in combination with baseline therapy for people with NMOSD. Initial phase III data for SAkuraSky were presented at the 34th ECTRIMS congress in 2018. The data showed a 62% reduction in the risk of relapses in a representative population of both AQP4-IgG seropositive and AQP4-IgG seronegative patients in the overall study population (HR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16-0.88; p=0.0184) when used in combination with baseline therapy compared to placebo, and a 79% reduction in the risk of relapses in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients (HR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06-0.75; p=0.0086).
Overall, the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was similar between the satralizumab monotherapy and placebo treatment groups in the SAkuraStar study; and between the satralizumab added to baseline therapy and placebo added to baseline therapy treatment groups in the SAkuraSky study. A lower rate of infections (including serious infections) was observed in patients treated with satralizumab compared with the placebo group. In both studies, most adverse events were mild to moderate, and the most common adverse events in the satralizumab group were urinary tract infections and upper respiratory tract infections in the SAkuraStar study and upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis (common cold) and headache in the SAkuraSky study. Safety analyses continue in the open-label extensions of SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky.
The data available across two controlled, randomised phase III clinical trials suggest that satralizumab could be an efficacious option for patients across a broad NMOSD patient population, whether given as a monotherapy or in combination with baseline therapy. Satralizumab is administered every four weeks by subcutaneous injection, which may be a convenient option for patients and carers.
The SAkuraStar study recruited 95 NMOSD patients from the age of 20-70 and SAkuraSky recruited 83 patients, including adolescents, aged 13-73. These studies represent one of the largest clinical trial programmes undertaken for this rare disease.
<h3>About SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky in NMOSD</h3>
SAkuraStar is a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of satralizumab monotherapy administered to patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint is the time to first protocol-defined relapse (PDR), adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Secondary endpoints included the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for pain and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue score.
Ninety-five patients aged from 20-70 years were randomised to either of the following two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio: satralizumab (120 mg) or placebo. Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at Week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment period ended when the total number of PDRs had reached 44 or at 1.5 years after the enrollment of the last patient, whichever occurred first. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with satralizumab in an open-label extension period. Patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive or seronegative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by the diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD were enrolled.
SAkuraSky is a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of satralizumab added to baseline immunosuppressant therapy in patients with NMOSD. The primary endpoint was the time to first relapse as adjudicated by an independent review committee in the double-blind period. Main secondary endpoints included change in VAS score for pain and change in FACIT Fatigue score.
Eighty-three male and female patients aged from 13 to 73 years were randomised to either of the following two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: satralizumab (120 mg) or placebo added to baseline therapy (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and/or corticosteroids). Both treatments were administered subcutaneously at Week 0, 2, and 4. The subsequent treatment was continued at 4-week intervals. The double-blind treatment ended when patients experienced a PDR; the study ended when the total number of PDRs reached 26. After experiencing a PDR or upon completion of the study, patients in both groups were offered treatment with satralizumab in an open-label extension period. Patients with AQP4-IgG seropositive or seronegative neuromyelitis optica (NMO, as defined by diagnostic criteria in 2006) and those with AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD were enrolled.
<h3>About neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)</h3>
NMOSD is a rare, lifelong and debilitating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that primarily damages the optic nerve(s) and spinal cord, causing blindness, muscle weakness and paralysis. People with NMOSD experience unpredictable, severe relapses directly causing cumulative, permanent, neurological damage and disability. In some cases, relapse can result in death. NMOSD affects over 10,000 people in Europe, 15,000 people in the US and up to hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. The disease is most common among non-Caucasian women in their 30s and 40s.
NMOSD is commonly associated with pathogenic antibodies (AQP4-IgG) that target and damage a specific cell type, called astrocytes resulting in inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve(s), spinal cord and brain. AQP4-IgG antibodies are detectable in the blood serum of around two-thirds of NMOSD patients.
Although most cases of NMOSD can be confirmed through a diagnostic test, people living with the condition are still frequently misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This is due to overlapping features of the two disorders, including a higher prevalence in women, similar symptoms and the fact that both are relapse-based conditions.
<h3>About satralizumab</h3>
Satralizumab is an investigational humanised monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 receptor. The cytokine IL-6 is thought to be a key driver in NMOSD, triggering the inflammation cascade and leading to damage and disability. Positive phase III results for satralizumab, as both monotherapy and in combination with baseline therapy, suggest that IL-6 inhibition may be an effective therapeutic approach for NMOSD. The phase III clinical development programme for satralizumab includes two studies: SAkuraStar and SAkuraSky.

<span class=""xn-location"">STOCKHOLM</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 11, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced the results from the Phase 3 OPTIMUM study for ponesimod, an investigational selective S1P1 receptor modulator, showing superior efficacy on the primary endpoint and most secondary endpoints compared to Aubagio<sup>®</sup><sup> </sup>(teriflunomide)* 14 mg in adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).
In the head-to-head, two-year Phase 3 comparative study, statistically significant reduction of annualized relapse rate (ARR), the study's primary endpoint, was observed with ponesimod when compared to teriflunomide by 30.5% up to week 108 (ARR = 0.202 for ponesimod 20 mg vs. 0.290 for teriflunomide 14 mg, p=0.0003).
The data were presented by Professor <span class=""xn-person"">Ludwig Kappos</span>**, Chair of the Department of Neurology at University Hospital of <span class=""xn-location"">Basel, Switzerland</span>, on behalf of the study's investigators, as part of an oral presentation at the 35th Congress of The European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in <span class=""xn-location"">Stockholm, Sweden</span>.
""This is the first large controlled head-to-head study comparing two oral compounds for the treatment of relapsing MS. Notably, we saw superiority of the investigational agent ponesimod when compared to teriflunomide across the primary and most secondary endpoints. These data, in conjunction with the observed safety profile, underline the potential of ponesimod as a new treatment option for MS,"" said Professor Kappos.
Several pre-specified secondary endpoints were also examined as part of the OPTIMUM trial, including fatigue. Based on results from the Fatigue Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire - Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (FSIQ-RMS) at week 108, statistically significant effects on fatigue symptoms were observed with ponesimod compared to teriflunomide (mean difference: -3.57, p=0.0019). FSIQ-RMS is a new MS-specific, 20-item patient-reported outcome measure that comprises symptoms and impacts with an increase from baseline indicating worsening in fatigue symptoms.
""Despite an ever-growing treatment landscape, unmet needs remain in helping patients with MS,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Luc Truyen</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Development and External Affairs, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""We are thrilled to be here at ECTRIMS to present these pivotal findings as they mark the first head-to-head trial of two oral therapies for relapsing MS and demonstrate positive results for ponesimod compared to a leading disease-modifying therapy.""
Additional secondary endpoints of note include cumulative number of combined unique active lesions (CUALs) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), time to first 12-week confirmed disability accumulation (CDA) and time to first 24-week CDA from baseline. A 56% reduction (p&lt;0.0001) in the number of CUALs was observed with ponesimod compared to teriflunomide. The 12-week CDA was observed in 10.1% and 12.4% of patients in the ponesimod and teriflunomide arms, respectively; however, the result was not statistically significant.
The safety profile observed for ponesimod in the OPTIMUM study was consistent with previous studies of ponesimod and the known safety profile for other S1P receptor modulators. The most commonly observed adverse events included nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infections and an increase in alanine amino transferase.
Ponesimod is an investigational agent. Data from the OPTIMUM study will serve as the basis for regulatory submissions to the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of ponesimod as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS.
<b><u>About Ponesimod<br class=""dnr"" /></u></b>Ponesimod is an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator that functionally inhibits S1P activity and reduces the number of circulating lymphocytes. It is thought that in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), ponesimod prevents immune cells from crossing the blood-brain barrier and damaging myelin. Myelin is a protective sheath that insulates nerve cells and is damaged in patients with multiple sclerosis.<sup>1</sup>
<b><u>Study Design<br class=""dnr"" /></u></b>OPTIMUM was a head-to-head, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 superiority study to compare efficacy, safety and tolerability of ponesimod 20 mg versus teriflunomide in adults with relapsing MS. The study enrolled 1,133 participants with the treatment duration of 108 weeks across 162 study site locations worldwide, including <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Mexico</span>.
<b>Primary Endpoint</b><b><u><br class=""dnr"" /></u></b>The primary endpoint was measured by ARR from baseline to end of study. ARR is defined as the number of confirmed relapses per subject-year. The study met its primary objective.
<b>Secondary Endpoints<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Secondary endpoints included fatigue, cumulative number of CUALs, time to first 12-week CDA and time to first 24-week CDA. Fatigue symptoms were measured as change from baseline to week 108 using the FSIQ-RMS, which was developed to evaluate fatigue-related symptoms and the impacts of those symptoms on the lives of people with relapsing MS. CUALs, defined as new gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions plus new or enlarging T2 lesions (without double-counting of lesions) measured by MRI, were assessed from baseline to week 108. The 12- and 24-week CDAs were defined as increases in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score relative to baseline confirmed after 12 or 24 weeks. The EDSS score quantifies MS-related disability and monitors changes in the level of disability over time and is based on a standardized examination by a neurologist. EDSS ranges from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest) with 0.5-unit increments.
<b><u>About Multiple Sclerosis <br class=""dnr"" /></u></b>MS is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system affecting 2.3 million people worldwide<sup>2</sup> with females more impacted than males.<sup>3</sup> The disease is characterized by demyelination<sup>2</sup> and axonal loss leading to neurological impairment and severe disability.<sup>4</sup> The main subtype of MS is relapsing forms of MS, which manifests in 85% of MS patients and includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS.<sup>5</sup>
Relapses are defined as new, worsening or recurrent neurological symptoms that last for more than 24 hours with the absence of fever or infections. Relapses may be fully resolved over days or weeks or lead to persistent residual deficits and accumulation of disability<sup>.6</sup>

<p class=""bwalignc""><em>Eligible patients in Scotland will immediately have access to ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and SYMKEVI (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor</em></p>
LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 12, 2019-- Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: VRTX) today announced that eligible cystic fibrosis patients living in Scotland will now have access to ORKAMBI<em><sup>®</sup></em> (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and SYMKEVI<em><sup>®</sup></em> (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor following the signing of an access agreement.
“We would like to thank the Scottish authorities for their partnership and the collaborative and flexible way that we have worked together to find this access solution,” said Ludovic Fenaux, Senior Vice President, Vertex International. “It means that approximately 400 eligible cystic fibrosis patients in Scotland now have access to ORKAMBI or SYMKEVI.”
As part of the 5-year agreement Vertex has also committed to collecting real world data on these medicines that will support any future submissions to the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC).
Vertex cystic fibrosis medicines are reimbursed in 17 countries around the world including Austria, Australia, Denmark, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the U.S.
<strong>About CF in Scotland</strong>
Approximately 900 people in Scotland live with CF. In the UK, the median age of death is 32 years. NHS Scotland estimates that one in 24 Scots have a CFTR mutation which, if carried by both parents, would lead to a child being born with CF.
<strong>About ORKAMBI<sup>®</sup> (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and the <em>F508del</em> mutation </strong>
In people with two copies of the <em>F508del </em>mutation, the CFTR protein is not processed and trafficked normally within the cell, resulting in little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface. Patients with two copies of the <em>F508del</em> mutation are easily identified by a simple genetic test.
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor is a combination of lumacaftor, which is designed to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the F508del-CFTR protein, and ivacaftor, which is designed to enhance the function of the CFTR protein once it reaches the cell surface.

<strong>About SYMKEVI<sup>®</sup> (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor </strong>
Some mutations result in CFTR protein that is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and that generally does not reach the cell surface. Tezacaftor is designed to address the trafficking and processing defect of the CFTR protein to enable it to reach the cell surface and ivacaftor is designed to enhance the function of the CFTR protein once it reaches the cell surface.

<em><strong>Acquisition Gives Aytu Timely Entry into Growing Consumer Healthcare Market with a Portfolio of Over 30 Products that Generated $24M of Revenue During Past Four Quarters</strong></em>
<em><strong>Combination Will Create Specialty Rx and Consumer Pharma</strong></em><em><strong> Company with Revenue of $31M</strong></em>
<em><strong>New Products, Robust Cross-Selling, and Operational Efficiencies </strong></em><em><strong>Designed to Accelerate Time to Profitability</strong></em>
<b>ENGLEWOOD, CO and SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / September 12, 2019 /</b> Aytu BioScience, Inc. (NASDAQ:AYTU), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on commercializing novel products that address significant patient needs and Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INNV), a specialty pharmaceutical company commercializing, licensing and developing safe and effective consumer health products, today announced that the companies have signed a definitive merger agreement whereby Aytu will retire all outstanding common stock of Innovus for an aggregate of up to $8 million in shares of Aytu common stock, less certain deductions, at the time of closing. This initial consideration to Innovus common shareholders is estimated to consist of approximately 4.2 million shares of Aytu stock. Additional consideration for up to $16 million in milestone payments in the form of contingent value rights (CVRs) may be paid to Innovus shareholders in cash or stock over the next five years if certain revenue and profitability milestones are achieved.
Innovus generated more than $24 million in revenue in the four quarters ending June 30, 2019.
Through this combined entity, Aytu will expand into the $40 billion consumer healthcare market with a portfolio of over thirty consumer products competing in large therapeutic categories including diabetes, men’s health, sexual wellness and respiratory health. This expanded product line broadens Aytu’s portfolio beyond prescription therapeutics to enable wider revenue distribution, reduced seasonality associated with Aytu’s seasonal antitussive product line, and higher revenue from an expanded base of proprietary products.
Combined, Aytu and Innovus generated more than $31 million in revenue over the preceding four reported quarters ending June 30, 2019. This business combination provides increased revenue scale and enables operational synergies that can be leveraged to accelerate the combined company’s growth and path to profitability.
Josh Disbrow, Chief Executive Officer of Aytu BioScience, commented, “Through this business combination we have taken a very timely step into a large, rapidly growing segment of the healthcare market. Over the past two years, significant investment has been made in the areas of consumer wellness, telemedicine, and online health, so it’s the right time for Aytu to enter this high-growth market. Further, consumers are increasingly taking control over their healthcare decisions and, particularly for common conditions, over 90% of the time patients are self-treating with over-the-counter options in advance of receiving care from a prescriber. By adding a consumer unit to Aytu’s already growing prescription business, we increase our exposure to the broader patient market while continuing to grow our portfolio of novel prescription products.”
Mr. Disbrow continued, “This will make Aytu a fully-integrated specialty pharmaceutical company addressing patient needs in both prescription and non-prescription categories. Innovus President &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Bassam Damaj, Ph.D. and his team have developed a robust product line and have more than doubled revenue since 2017, so I’m thrilled about the prospect of our combined growth plan as the Innovus business becomes the newly created Aytu Consumer Health business unit.”
Initially, the company expects to operate the commercial aspects of the Innovus consumer business separately from Aytu’s prescription business, while rationalizing general and administrative expenses through the removal of Innovus’ public company costs and redundant administrative and operational processes, along with the reduction in overhead, administrative and facilities costs.
The prescription product portfolio will continue to be primarily commercialized through the existing Aytu sales force, while the consumer health products will continue to be primarily commercialized via Innovus’ proprietary Beyond Human<sup>®</sup> marketing platform. However, both lines of business are expected to benefit from opportunistic cross-selling such that some consumer products may be marketed in the physician office setting by Aytu’s sales force, while the marketing of the prescription products may be bolstered through various online and direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives. It is expected that the two segments will leverage administrative and operational efficiencies following the integration of the two companies.
Dr. Bassam Damaj, Ph.D., President &amp; Chief Executive Officer of Innovus Pharmaceuticals, stated, “This is an exciting inflection point for Innovus and our shareholders as we combine with Aytu to strengthen our market position and provide a growth platform for the company and our products. We are looking forward to helping build Aytu into a world-class healthcare company, and I’m personally excited about continuing on as the President of the Aytu Consumer Health business unit. With the combined strength of our companies, we believe we can more rapidly grow our novel OTC medicines and supplements while developing additional consumer healthcare products as we grow, thus adding value to the newly-expanded Aytu BioScience.”
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Aytu will issue to Innovus shareholders a combination of stock and contingent value rights (CVRs), subject to the achievement of certain milestones, for up to $24 million. The number of shares to be issued will be determined based on a formula that adjusts the initial $8 million purchase price for various deductions, such as amounts owed from Innovus to Aytu under a promissory note (currently $1 million principal amount), payments to be made to warrant holders (above a threshold), changes in Innovus liabilities and working capital, and other adjustments. The CVRs provide additional value of up to $16 million if revenue and profitability milestones over the next five years are met.
The board of directors of both companies have approved the terms of the merger transaction which is subject to the approval of both companies’ shareholders. At the time of signing, Aytu had collected voting agreements supporting the merger transaction that represent approximately 35% of current shares outstanding. Innovus has thus far collected voting agreements supporting the transaction that represent (at the time of signing) approximately 17% of shares outstanding.
Aytu expects to retire Innovus warrants where warrant holders have cash-out rights that would be triggered by the merger. The cost of doing so is estimated to be $1.1 million, paid in a combination of cash and stock. More information about the planned merger, along with the Definitive Merger Agreement, will be available in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The transaction, which is expected to close as early as Aytu’s second fiscal quarter of 2020 (quarter ending 12/31/19) and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

 	<li><strong>New fixed-dose combination is administered under the skin in just minutes, significantly reducing the time spent receiving treatment</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Data will be submitted to health authorities around the world, including the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency</strong></li>

</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the phase III FeDeriCa study met its primary endpoint. The study showed a new investigational fixed-dose combination (FDC) of Perjeta<sup>®</sup> (pertuzumab) and Herceptin<sup>®</sup>(trastuzumab), administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in combination with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, demonstrated non-inferior levels of Perjeta in the blood (pharmacokinetics) compared to standard IV infusion of Perjeta plus Herceptin and chemotherapy in people with HER2-positive early breast cancer (eBC). The safety profile of the FDC of Perjeta and Herceptin was consistent with that of Perjeta and Herceptin administered intravenously.<sup>1,2</sup>
“With this single injection under the skin, people with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving Perjeta and Herceptin can have a faster treatment option,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Our medicines have helped millions of people living with HER2-positive breast cancer and this latest development is particularly exciting as, for the first time, we have combined two therapeutic antibodies as a single subcutaneous formulation.”
SC administration of the FDC takes approximately 8 minutes for the initial loading dose, and approximately 5 minutes for each subsequent maintenance dose. This is compared to approximately 150 minutes for infusion of a loading dose of Perjeta and Herceptin using the standard IV formulations, and between 60-150 minutes for subsequent maintenance infusions for the combination.<sup>1,2,3</sup>
Full data from the FeDeriCa study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting and to health authorities around the world.
<h3>About the FeDeriCa study</h3>
FeDeriCa is an international, multi-centre, two-arm, randomised, open-label, phase III study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of SC injection of the FDC of Perjeta and Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy, compared with standard IV infusions of Perjeta and Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy in people with HER2-positive eBC who are being treated in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery) settings.<sup>4</sup> The primary endpoint of the study is minimum levels of Perjeta in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough). Secondary endpoints include safety; minimum levels of Herceptin in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough); and total pCR, meaning there is no tumour tissue detectable at the time of surgery.<sup>4</sup>
<h3>About the FDC of Perjeta and Herceptin</h3>
The FDC of Perjeta and Herceptin is a new SC formulation that combines Perjeta and Herceptin with Halozyme Therapeutics’ Enhanze<sup>®</sup> drug delivery technology.
Trastuzumab in the FDC is the same monoclonal antibody as in IV Herceptin and pertuzumab is the same monoclonal antibody as in IV Perjeta. The mechanisms of action of Perjeta and Herceptin are believed to complement each other as both bind to the HER2 receptor, but to different places.<sup>5</sup> The combination of Perjeta and Herceptin is thought to provide a more comprehensive, dual blockade of the HER signaling pathways.<sup>5</sup>
The standard IV formulation of Perjeta in combination with IV Herceptin and chemotherapy (the Perjeta-based regimen) is approved in over 100 countries for the treatment of both early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In the neoadjuvant eBC setting, the Perjeta-based regimen has been shown to almost double the rate of pCR compared to Herceptin and chemotherapy.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, the combination has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence of invasive disease or death in the adjuvant eBC setting.<sup>7</sup> In the metastatic setting, the combination has shown an unprecedented survival benefit in previously untreated (first-line) patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.<sup>8</sup>
Halozyme’s Enhanze drug delivery technology may enable and optimise SC drug delivery for appropriate co-administered therapeutics. The technology is based on a proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), an enzyme that temporarily degrades hyaluronan – a glycosaminoglycan or chain of natural sugars in the body, to aid in the dispersion and absorption of other injected therapeutic drugs.<sup>9</sup>
<h3>About Roche’s medicines for HER2-positive breast cancer</h3>
Roche has been leading research into the HER2 pathway for over 30 years and is committed to improving the health, quality of life and survival of people with both early and metastatic HER2-positive disease. HER2-positive breast cancer is a particularly aggressive form of the disease that affects approximately 15-20% of patients.<sup>10</sup>Roche has developed three innovative medicines that have helped transform the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: Herceptin (trastuzumab), Perjeta (pertuzumab) and Kadcyla<sup>®</sup> (trastuzumab emtansine). Eligibility for treatment with Roche’s HER2-targeted medicines is determined via a diagnostic test which identifies people who will likely benefit from these medicines at the onset of their disease.

<strong>Issued: London UK</strong>
GlaxoSmithKline (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Nucala (mepolizumab) for use in children as young as six years old who are living with severe eosinophilic asthma. Nucala is the only targeted biologic to be approved for the condition in the six to 11-year age group in the US.
<strong>Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&amp;D, GSK, said:</strong> “Children with severe eosinophilic asthma currently have limited treatment choices available to them. We believe this important new indication for Nucala is a significant development for these children and their families”.
Tonya Winders, CEO and President, Allergy and Asthma Network, noted: “As a mother of children who suffer from asthma, I know first-hand the huge impact it has on a family, from the constant worry about your child being hospitalised, to practical issues like arranging time off work to care for them. Having Nucala approved as the first biologic for treating severe eosinophilic asthma in this young age group represents a significant step forward for the asthma community.”
The FDA approval is supported by an open-label study, conducted in children aged six to 11 years and suffering from severe eosinophilic asthma, that investigated Nucala’s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and long-term safety. Evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents also supported approval in this age group. The 52-week long-term phase of the study showed that the safety profile in paediatric patients aged six to 11 years was similar to the known safety profile in patients aged 12 years and older.
Dr Daniel Jackson, MD, Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin, added: “Severe eosinophilic asthma in children is a complicated condition that can be extremely challenging to treat. Nucala has made a difference for many adults and adolescents living with severe asthma. This approval is an important development, giving physicians like me a much-needed option to consider for our paediatric patients”.
Nucala (100mg dose subcutaneous injection) was first approved in 2015 as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma aged 12 years and older. This approval (40mg dose subcutaneous injection) extends the current indication in the US for Nucala to patients aged six to 11 years.
Nucala has been approved for use as an add-on treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in patients aged six years and older in the EU since August 2018.
<h2><strong>About Nucala (mepolizumab)</strong></h2>
First approved in 2015 for severe eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab is the first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets IL-5. It is believed to work by preventing IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils. Inhibiting IL-5 binding in this way reduces blood eosinophils without completely depleting them.
Mepolizumab has been developed for the treatment of diseases that are driven by inflammation caused by eosinophils. It has been studied in over 3,000 patients in 21 clinical trials across a number of eosinophilic indications and is the only biologic with 4.8 years of safety and efficacy data in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). Mepolizumab has been approved (under the brand name Nucala) in the US, Europe and in over 20 other markets, as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. It is also the only anti-IL5 biologic therapy approved for paediatric use from ages six to 17 in Europe in severe eosinophilic asthma. In the US, Japan and Canada and a number of other markets, it is approved as add-on maintenance treatment for patients with EGPA. Mepolizumab is currently being investigated for severe hypereosinophilic syndrome, nasal polyposis and COPD.
In the US, Nucala (100mg subcutaneous injection of mepolizumab) is currently licensed as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma aged 12 years and older. This now extends to patients aged six to 11 years (40mg dose subcutaneous injection). Nucala (300mg as three separate 100mg subcutaneous injections of mepolizumab) is licensed for the treatment of adult patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Nucala is not approved for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Full US Prescribing Information is available at <a href=""https://www.gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribing_Information/Nucala/pdf/NUCALA-PI-PIL-IFU-COMBINED.PDF"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">US Prescribing Information Nucala</a>.
<h2><strong>About severe asthma and eosinophilic inflammation  </strong></h2>
Severe asthma is defined as asthma which requires treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming ‘uncontrolled’ or which remains ‘uncontrolled’ despite this therapy. Severe asthma patients are also often categorised by long-term use of oral corticosteroids (OCS). In a sub-set of severe asthma patients, the over-production of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) is known to cause inflammation in the lungs. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. Studies suggest that approximately 60% of patients with severe asthma have eosinophilic airway inflammation.
<h2><strong>GSK’s commitment to respiratory disease</strong></h2>
For 50 years, GSK has led the way in developing medicines that advance the management of asthma and COPD. From introducing the world’s first selective short-acting beta agonist in 1969, to launching six treatments in five years to create today’s industry-leading respiratory portfolio, we continue to innovate so we can reach the right patients, with the right treatment. Working together with the healthcare community, we apply world-class science to discover and understand the molecules that become the medicines of tomorrow. We won’t stand still until the simple act of breathing is made easier for everyone.
<h2><strong>Serving paediatric patients</strong></h2>
We are committed to bringing our specialty biologic medicines to paediatric patients who have limited treatment options. We are currently progressing regulatory reviews of treatments for children with severe eosinophilic asthma and lupus, reinforcing our commitment to serving an unmet need with these medicines that are proven to be effective in adults.
<h2><strong>Important safety information for Nucala (mepolizumab)</strong></h2>
The following is a summary of the safety information for Nucala. Please consult the full Prescribing Information, including Patient Information, at <a href=""http://www.nucala.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.Nucala.com</a> for all the safety information for Nucala.
Nucala should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to mepolizumab or excipients in the formulation.
Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, rash) have occurred after administration of Nucala. Discontinue Nucala in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.
Do not use to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
Herpes zoster infections have occurred in patients receiving Nucala. Consider vaccination if medically appropriate.
Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with Nucala. Decrease corticosteroids gradually, if appropriate.
Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before therapy with Nucala. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with Nucala and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue Nucala until parasitic infection resolves.
<h2><strong>Adverse reactions</strong></h2>
Most common adverse reactions (incidence =5%) in severe asthma clinical trials included headache, injection site reaction, back pain, and fatigue. Injection site reactions (eg, pain, erythema, swelling, itching, burning sensation) occurred in 8% of subjects treated with 100mg of Nucala versus 3% treated with placebo.
In a clinical trial in patients with EGPA receiving 300 mg of Nucala, no additional adverse reactions were identified to those reported in severe asthma clinical trials. Injection site reactions (eg, pain, erythema, swelling) occurred in 15% of subjects treated with 300 mg of Nucala versus 13% treated with placebo.

<p class=""bwalignc""><i>Top-line analysis showed a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for CC-486</i></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><i>Celgene plans regulatory submissions beginning in 1H 2020</i></p>
SUMMIT, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) today announced top-line results from the international phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, QUAZAR AML-001. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of investigational therapy CC-486 as maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who achieved first complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) with induction chemotherapy (with or without consolidation). The study demonstrated that maintenance treatment with CC-486 resulted in a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival compared to placebo. The key secondary endpoint of relapse-free survival (RFS) also showed a statistically significant improvement.
CC-486 was well-tolerated and there were no unexpected safety events in QUAZAR AML-001. This phase 3 study enrolled 472 patients, randomized 1:1 to receive either oral CC-486 300mg or placebo once daily for 14 days of a 28-day cycle plus best supportive care until disease relapse.
“AML remains a deadly blood cancer where most patients are not curable and less than 30% of patients survive five years<sup>1</sup>,” said Jay Backstrom, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer for Celgene. “The CC-486 QUAZAR AML-001 study is the first phase 3 trial to demonstrate that the addition of maintenance therapy has the potential to extend overall survival in a broad population of patients with newly diagnosed AML who have achieved remission with induction chemotherapy.”
Data from QUAZAR AML-001 will be submitted to a future medical meeting. Celgene also plans regulatory submissions for CC-486 beginning in the first half of 2020.
CC-486 is an investigational compound and not approved for any use in any geography.
<b>About QUAZAR AML-001</b>
Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of CC-486 as AML maintenance therapy in patients who achieved first CR or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) with induction chemotherapy (with or without consolidation) The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Key secondary endpoints included relapse-free survival (RFS), safety and tolerability, healthcare resource utilization and patient-reported outcomes per the FACIT-Fatigue Scale and EQ-5D questionnaire. The study enrolled 472 patients, randomized 1:1 to receive either oral CC-486 300mg or placebo once daily for 14 days of a 28-day cycle plus best supportive care until disease progression.
<b>About CC-486</b>
CC-486 is a cytidine nucleoside analogue and incorporates into DNA and RNA. The main mechanism of action is thought to cause DNA hypomethylation and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The antineoplastic effect of CC-486 is hypothesized to cause death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanism.
<b>About AML</b>
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal blast cells that are supposed to grow into different types of blood cells. It may present in multiple subtypes based on the maturity of the cancer cells at diagnosis.<sup>2</sup> There will be an estimated 21,450 new cases of AML in the United States this year, accounting for 1.2% of all cancer cases, with an estimated 10,920 deaths resulting from the disease. There are an estimated 61,048 people living with AML in the United States.<sup>3</sup>

 	<li><em>Helps radiologists prioritize critical cases with a suspected pneumothorax – a type of collapsed lung – by immediately flagging critical cases to radiologists for triage, which could drastically cut the average review time from up to eight hours</em></li>
 	<li><em>Offers first-of-its-kind automated AI quality check features that detect acquisition errors, flagging images for technologist review and allowing them to make corrections before they go to radiologists for review</em></li>

<b><strong>WAUKESHA, Wis., September 12, 2019 </strong></b>– GE Healthcare today announced the Food and Drug Administration’s 510(k) clearance of Critical Care Suite, an industry-first collection of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms embedded on a mobile X-ray device. Built in collaboration with UC San Francisco (UCSF), using GE Healthcare’s Edison platform, the AI algorithms help to reduce the turn-around time it can take for radiologists to review a suspected pneumothorax, a type of collapsed lung.
<ul>
 	<li>“X-ray – the world’s oldest form of medical imaging – just got a whole lot smarter, and soon, the rest of our offerings will too,” says Kieran Murphy, President &amp; CEO, GE Healthcare. “GE Healthcare is leading the way in the creation of AI applications for diagnostic imaging and taking what was once a promise and turning it into a reality. By integrating AI into every aspect of care, we will ultimately improve patient outcomes, reduce waste and inefficiencies, and eliminate costly errors. Critical Care Suite is just the beginning.”“Clinicians are always looking for clinically proven methods to increase outcomes and improve the patient experience,” says Dr. Rachael Callcut, Associate Professor of Surgery at UCSF, a surgeon at UCSF Health and Director of Data Science for the Center for Digital Health Innovation, who partnered in the development of Critical Care Suite.  “When a patient X-ray is taken, the minutes and hours it takes to process and interpret the image can impact the outcome in either direction. AI gives us an opportunity to speed up diagnosis, and change the way we care for patients, which could ultimately save lives and improve outcomes.”“Currently, 62 percent of exams are marked ‘STAT’ or for urgent reading1, but they aren’t all critical. This creates a delay in turnaround for truly critical patients, which can be a serious issue,” adds Jie Xue, President &amp; CEO, X-ray, GE Healthcare. “Not only does Critical Care Suite flag images with a suspected pneumothorax with impressive accuracy<a href=""https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-healthcare-receives-fda-clearance-first-artificial-intelligence-algorithms#_ftn2"">[2]</a> and enable radiologists to prioritize those cases immediately, but it also makes AI accessible. Our embedded AI algorithms offer hospitals an opportunity to try AI without making investments into additional IT infrastructure, security assessments or cybersecurity precautions for routing images offsite.”Additional partners in the development of Critical Care Suite include St. Luke’s University Health Network, Humber River Hospital, and CARING - Mahajan Imaging – India.<b><strong>About GE Healthcare:</strong></b></li>

 	<li>GE Healthcare’s Edison offering comprises applications and smart devices built using the Edison platform. The platform uses an extensive catalog of healthcare-specific developer services to enable both GE developers and select strategic partners to design, develop, manage, secure and distribute advanced applications, services and AI algorithms quickly. Edison integrates and assimilates data from multiple sources, applying analytics and AI to not only transform data, but provide actionable insights that can be deployed on medical devices, via the cloud or at the edge of the device.</li>
 	<li>Additionally, embedding Critical Care Suite on-device offers several benefits to radiologists and technologists. For critical findings, GE Healthcare’s algorithms are a fast and reliable way to ensure AI results are generated within seconds of image acquisition, without any dependency on connectivity or transfer speeds to produce the AI results. These results are then sent to the radiologist at the same time that the device sends the original diagnostic image, ensuring no additional processing delay. Also, automatically running quality checks on-device integrates them into the technologist’s standard workflow and enables technologist actions – such as rejections or reprocessing – to occur at the patient’s bedside and before the images are sent to PACS.</li>
 	<li>A prioritized “STAT” X-ray can sit waiting for up to eight hours for a radiologist’s review1. However, when a patient is scanned on a device with Critical Care Suite, the system automatically analyzes the images by simultaneously searching for a pneumothorax. If a pneumothorax is suspected, an alert – along with the original chest X-ray – is sent directly to the radiologist for review via picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). The technologist also receives a subsequent on-device notification<a href=""https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-healthcare-receives-fda-clearance-first-artificial-intelligence-algorithms#_ftn1"">[1]</a> to give awareness of the prioritized cases. Quality-focused AI algorithms simultaneously analyze and flag protocol and field of view errors as well as auto rotate the images on-device. Critical Care Suite and the quality algorithms were developed using GE Healthcare’s Edison platform – which helps deploy AI algorithms quickly and securely – and deployed on the company’s Optima XR240amx system.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-healthcare-receives-fda-clearance-first-artificial-intelligence-algorithms#_ftnref1"">[1]</a> The technologist on-device notification is generated after a delay, post exam closure, and it does not provide any diagnostic information, nor is it intended to inform any clinical decision, prioritization, or action.</li>

<span class=""xn-location"">WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 13, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: <span class=""xn-location"">Tokyo</span>, CEO: <span class=""xn-person"">Haruo Naito</span>, ""Eisai"") and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eisai-and-biogen-to-discontinue-phase-iii-clinical-studies-of-bace-inhibitor-elenbecestat-in-early-alzheimers-disease-300917734.html#financial-modal"">BIIB</a>, Corporate headquarters: <span class=""xn-location"">Cambridge, Massachusetts</span>, CEO: <span class=""xn-person"">Michel Vounatsos</span>, ""Biogen"") today announced the decision to discontinue the Phase III clinical studies (MISSION AD1,
AD2) on the investigational oral BACE (beta amyloid cleaving enzyme) inhibitor elenbecestat (development code: E2609) in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The decision is based on the results of a safety review conducted by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which recommended to discontinue these trials due to unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. Detailed data of these studies will be presented at future medical meetings.
Investigators are being informed of the decision and they will be contacting their study participants to discontinue the investigational treatment.
Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Lynn Kramer</span>, Chief Clinical Officer, Neurology Business Group, Eisai Co., Ltd., said: ""We would like to thank the patients and the families, as well as medical professionals, that participated in the MISSION AD studies. Without their contributions we would not be able to advance Alzheimer's disease research. We are very disappointed with the news, and intend to learn from these data and continue engaging with patients and investigators, to pursue the discovery of new medicines for Alzheimer's disease.""
The Phase III clinical trial program for elenbecestat (MISSION AD) consisted of two global Phase III clinical studies with identical protocols, MISSION AD1 (Study 301) and MISSION AD2 (Study 302). Both studies were multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group Phase III clinical studies designed to assess the efficacy and safety of elenbecestat for treatment in a total of about 2,100 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD (collectively known as early AD) with confirmed amyloid pathology in the brain. Patients were randomized to receive either 50 mg of elenbecestat or placebo daily during the treatment period of 24 months, and the primary endpoint was the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).
As part of this decision, the long-term extension of the Phase II clinical trial of elenbecestat (Study 202) will also be discontinued. This determination does not impact the program of the anti-amyloid beta (Aß) protofibril monoclonal antibody BAN2401, and the Phase III Clarity AD trial of BAN2401 will continue.

<p align=""justify"">VALBY, Denmark and BOTHELL, Wash., Sept. 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- H. Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) and Alder BioPharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ALDR) (Alder) today announced a definitive agreement for Lundbeck to acquire Alder. Under the terms of the agreement, Lundbeck will commence a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Alder, whereby Alder stockholders will be offered an upfront payment for USD 18.00 per share in cash, along with one non-tradeable Contingent Value Right (CVR) that entitles them to an additional USD 2.00 per share upon approval of eptinezumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), representing a total potential consideration of USD 20.00 per share. The transaction is valued at up to USD 1.95 billion (approximately DKK 13 billion) net of cash, on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Alder is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming migraine treatment through the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic antibodies. Through this acquisition, Lundbeck will continue to expand the range of brain diseases for which the company brings its leading and best-in-class therapies to patients. In addition, by acquiring Alder, Lundbeck will further enhance its capabilities to deliver future biological innovations in brain diseases.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Alder is developing eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. Eptinezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is administered as a quarterly 30-minute IV infusion. Eptinezumab was designed for immediate and complete bioavailability with high specificity and strong binding for suppression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide believed to play a key role in mediating and initiating migraines. If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it will be the first IV CGRP therapy for migraine prevention. Alder is also developing ALD1910, a mAb designed to inhibit pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) for migraine prevention. Eptinezumab, together with ALD1910, will help establish Lundbeck as an emerging leader in migraine and other pain syndromes.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Alder submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for eptinezumab in February 2019 and the FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of 21 February 2020. Lundbeck expects to submit eptinezumab for approval to regulatory authorities in the European Union during 2020, followed by submissions for approval in other regions around the world including China and Japan.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Strategic benefits</strong>
The proposed transaction is anticipated to significantly strengthen Lundbeck’s business as early as 2020, accelerating the build of Lundbeck’s late-stage pipeline and providing access to new capabilities in the monoclonal antibody field. The addition of eptinezumab will expand Lundbeck’s leading global brain disease franchise. Lundbeck intends to leverage its proven expertise in neuroscience, and its highly effective organization across 56 countries, to maximize the opportunity to serve patients suffering from brain diseases, including migraine.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The acquisition of Alder will support Lundbeck’s aim to deliver long-term sustainable growth and is consistent with capital allocation priorities. The transaction is expected to accelerate and diversify Lundbeck’s revenue growth with the expected U.S. launch of eptinezumab for preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine in 2020 and the expected expansion of indications for the product. Lundbeck will gain an early-stage antibody, ALD1910, against a separate target for migraine and other pain syndromes with the potential to leverage the expertise in migraine across a broader product offering. Lundbeck will also gain access to a team with strong monoclonal antibody expertise, accelerating Lundbeck’s capabilities in this arena. The transaction is expected to be core EPS accretive in 2023 assuming FDA approval in the first quarter of 2020 followed by regulatory approvals in other regions including Europe.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Dr. Deborah Dunsire, President and CEO of Lundbeck,</strong> commented, “<em>Alder is an excellent strategic fit for Lundbeck’s focused expertise in brain diseases and organizational capabilities. This transaction flows from our strategic intent to Expand and Invest to Grow. Migraine prevention is an attractive indication for us that leverages our specialized commercial expertise in delivering medicines for brain diseases. We expect the global launch of eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine, as well as the further potential development of the product in additional indications, to accelerate Lundbeck’s growth in the coming years.”   </em></p>
<p align=""justify"">”<em>As a global leader in neuroscience research with products registered in more than 100 countries and a strong network of neurology specialists, Lundbeck is the ideal partner </em><em>to advance Alder’s mission of changing the treatment paradigm for migraine prevention. We believe this positions eptinezumab for a successful launch both in and outside of the United States</em>,” <strong>said Bob Azelby, Alder’s president and chief executive officer.</strong> “<em>Importantly, today's news provides Alder shareholders with significant and immediate cash value, as well as the ability to benefit further once eptinezumab is approved by the EMA. Looking ahead, we expect Lundbeck will leverage Alder’s expertise in antibody development to explore additional indications for eptinezumab and continue the development of ALD1910</em>.”</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Terms, closing conditions and financing</strong>
Under the terms of the agreement, Lundbeck will commence a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Alder, whereby Alder stockholders will be offered an upfront payment for USD 18.00 per share in cash, along with one non-tradeable Contingent Value Right (CVR) of USD 2.00 per share. The upfront cash consideration represents a 79% premium to Alder’s shareholders based on the closing price on 13 September 2019 and an approximately 3% discount based on the 52-week high share price.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The non-tradeable CVR will be paid upon the approval by the European Commission of a ""Marketing Authorization Application"" in the European Union, through the centralized procedure. The terms of the CVR payment reflect the parties' agreement over the sharing of potential economic upside benefits from such approval. There can be no assurance such approval will occur or that any contingent payment will be made.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Lundbeck will acquire any shares of Alder not tendered into the tender offer through a merger for the same per share consideration as will be payable in the tender offer. The merger will be effected as soon as practicable after the closing of the tender offer.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Board of Alder has unanimously approved the transaction and Alder will file a recommendation to shareholders recommending they tender their shares to Lundbeck. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of more than 50% of all shares of Alder outstanding at the expiration of the offer and receipt of required regulatory clearances, which includes a Hart-Scott-Rodino review in the U.S. The terms and conditions of the tender offer will be described in the tender offer documents, which will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Lundbeck expects to fund the acquisition through existing cash resources and bank financing.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>Advisors</strong>
For Lundbeck, MTS Health Partners and PJT Partners are acting as the exclusive financial advisors and Baker McKenzie is acting as legal advisor in this transaction. For Alder, Centerview Partners is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP and Cooley LLP are acting as legal advisors.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Financial guidance
If closed, the acquisition of Alder will impact Lundbeck's financial guidance for 2019. While the transaction is not expected to have impact on revenue in 2019, it is expected to be dilutive to both EBIT and cash flow for the year.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In Alder’s interim report for the second quarter of 2019, the net loss for the first six months was USD 176.3 million. The company maintained its full year guidance for 2019 of net cash used in operating activities and purchases of property and equipment to be in the range of USD 285 to USD 315 million. The majority of the spend is focused on ensuring that Alder is prepared for the potential launch of eptinezumab in the first quarter of 2020, including advancing eptinezumab’s supply chain, building commercial inventory, continuing to build out Alder’s commercial footprint and other pre-launch market readiness activities.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The expected impact from the transaction on Lundbeck's profitability in 2019 will depend on the timing of the closing of the transaction. However, on a pro forma basis assuming the transaction is closed on 1 November 2019, Lundbeck expects to incur transaction costs of approximately 200 million related to the acquisition of Alder and integration and retention costs of DKK 400-500 million. Furthermore, Lundbeck will recognize two months (on pro-forma basis) of Alder’s operating costs, which is estimated at DKK 325-400 million. Lundbeck’s guidance for core EBIT will only be impacted by the recognition of Alder’s operating costs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">As described above, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be closed before, on or after 1 November 2019, or on any specific timeline or by and specific date, or at all.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Lundbeck confirmed the transaction is not expected to result in any change to its current dividend policy and continues to expect a pay-out ratio of 30-60% for 2019.</p>

<p align=""justify"">About the eptinezumab PROMISE clinical trial program</p>
<p align=""justify""><em><u>PROMISE-1</u></em> (PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous eptinezumab Safety and Efficacy-1) was a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for prevention of episodic migraine. In the study, patients (n=888) were randomized to receive up to four IV doses of eptinezumab (30 mg, 100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo, administered by infusion every 12 weeks. To be eligible for the trial, patients must have experienced at most 14 headache days per month, of which at least four met the criteria for migraine.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In June 2017, Alder announced that eptinezumab met the primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints in PROMISE-1.</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over the 12-week treatment period
º  Statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days from a baseline average of 8.6 days to 4.3 monthly migraine days for 300 mg (p=0.0001) and 3.9 days for 100 mg (p=0.0179) compared to a 3.2 days for placebo</li>
 	<li>Key secondary endpoints achieved by both doses of eptinezumab were responders rates of 75% or greater at weeks 1 – 4.
º  Day 1 clinical benefit: =50% reduction in the proportion of patients treated with eptinezumab 100 mg or 300 mg experiencing a migraine on Day 1  post-dose, compared to a 25% reduction in patients that received placebo
º  Significant 75% responses: ~1/3 of patients treated with eptinezumab 100 mg or 300 mg achieved a =75% reduction in migraine days by Month 1
º  On average of 1 in 5 patients had 100% response: no migraines in any given month</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">PROMISE 2 (PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2) was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for chronic migraine prevention. In the study, patients (n=1,072) were randomized to receive eptinezumab (100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo, administered by infusion once every 12 weeks. To be eligible for the trial, patients must have experienced at least 15 headache days per month, of which at least eight met the criteria for migraine. Patients who participated in the trial had an average of 16.1 migraine days per month at baseline.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Alder announced that eptinezumab met the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints in PROMISE-2:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over the 12-week, double-blind treatment period:
º  Statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days from baseline: 8.2 monthly migraine days for 300 mg (p=0.0001) and 7.7 days for 100 mg (p=0.0001) compared to an average 3.2 days for placebo</li>
 	<li>Key secondary and other endpoints met, including reduction in the percentage of patients experiencing migraine on the day following administration and reduction of migraine prevalence days 1-28, reduction of at least 50%, 75%, and 100% from baseline in mean monthly migraine days assessed through 12 weeks, change from baseline in mean monthly acute migraine-specific medication days, and reductions from baseline in patient-reported impact scores on the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). º  Day One prevention: &gt;50% reduction in migraine beginning Day One post-infusion in patients treated with eptinezumab 100 mg or 300 mg compared to 27% for placebo, p&lt;0.000
º  Over Months 1 through 3 after a single IV administration, 58% and 61% of patients achieved 50% or greater reduction in migraine days from  baseline compared to 39% for placebo, p&lt;0.0001
º  Over months 1 through 3 after a single IV administration, 27% and 33% of patients achieved a 75% or greater reduction in migraine days from baseline, compared to 15% for placebo, p&lt;0.0001
º  100% reduction in migraine days was achieved by 11% and 15% of patients with chronic migraine who were treated with eptinezumab 100 mg or 300 mg, respectively, each month, on average, for Months 1, 2, and 3, compared with 5% of patients who received placebo (post hoc, unadjusted)
º  All other pre-specified key secondary endpoints were met with statistical significance</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">Safety and tolerability were evaluated in the PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2 trials. In pooled data assessment across the two trials, nasopharyngitis (swelling of the nasal passages and the back of the throat) was the only AE occurring at an incidence of 2.0% or greater than placebo, but only at the 300mg dose (8% vs. 6% for placebo). Other AEs included upper respiratory infection, nausea and urinary tract infection, arthralgia (joint pain), dizziness, anxiety and fatigue, which all occurred at a similar incidence to placebo (less than 2% difference vs. placebo) in the pooled data set.</p>
<p align=""justify"">About eptinezumab (ALD403)</p>
<p align=""justify"">Eptinezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb) discovered and developed by Alder BioPharmaceuticals for migraine prevention. Eptinezumab was designed for 100% bioavailability delivered via quarterly 30-minute IV infusion with high specificity and strong binding for rapid, robust, and sustained suppression of CGRP.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Alder plans to initiate a phase III clinical trial evaluating eptinezumab as a treatment for acute migraine in the second half of 2019. The trial will seek to leverage eptinezumab’s immediate and complete bioavailability, with the objective of securing an indication for the acute treatment of migraine.</p>
<p align=""justify"">About ALD1910</p>
<p align=""justify"">Alder is developing ALD1910, a preclinical monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to inhibit pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) for migraine prevention. PACAP has emerged as an important signaling molecule in the pathophysiology of migraine and represents an attractive novel target for treating migraine. ALD1910 may hold potential as a migraine prevention treatment for those who have an inadequate response to other therapies and could provide another mechanism-specific therapeutic option for migraine patients and their physicians.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Good Manufacturing Practice and Investigational New Drug-enabling (IND) studies are underway.</p>
<p align=""justify"">About Migraine
Migraine is estimated to be the 2<sup>nd</sup> leading cause of Years Lived with Disability among all diseases causing disability<sup>i</sup>. More than 134 million are estimated to experience migraine annually. It is a disabling neurological disease characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate to severe headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivities to light and sound. The occurrence of migraine can be unpredictable with a profound impact on activities of daily living. Migraine is much more than a bad headache. According to the “Chronic Migraine in America” Survey<sup>ii</sup>:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>93% - migraine affects their ability to work</li>
 	<li>89% - migraine affects their ability to maintain relationships w/ partner</li>
 	<li>86% - migraine affects their ability to maintain relationships w/ children</li>
 	<li>64% - constantly worried about disappointing people</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">This disease can last decades, often during what should be the most productive years of patients’ lives<sup>iii</sup>. Migraine can remit or progress to chronic migraine over time and persist as chronic migraine for years or decades, but it commonly oscillates between periods of frequent episodic and chronic migraine<sup>iv</sup>. Many of the standard of care preventive treatments for episodic and chronic migraine fail to meet the needs of most patients and most patients discontinue use within 6 months to 1 year due to lack of efficacy and/or side effects<sup>v</sup>, <sup>vi</sup>. There is a significant need for new, effective, and well-tolerated treatment options.</p>
<p align=""justify"">About Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Alder BioPharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming migraine treatment through the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic antibodies. Alder’s lead product candidate, eptinezumab, is an investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb) delivered by infusion that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) for the prevention of migraine. If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it will be the first quarterly, anti-CGRP infusion therapy for migraine prevention. Alder is also developing ALD1910, a preclinical mAb that inhibits pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) for migraine prevention.

 	<li>Collaboration aims to provide a connected device experience for millions of people living with diabetes using insulin</li>
 	<li>Two world leaders in diabetes work together to drive meaningful

</ul>
<p align=""justify"">
<strong>PARIS and ABBOTT PARK, ILL. – September 16, 2019</strong> – Sanofi and Abbott are partnering to integrate glucose sensing and insulin delivery technologies that would help to further simplify how people with diabetes manage their condition. The two companies will take an innovative approach to connected care by developing tools that combine the revolutionary FreeStyle Libre technology with insulin dosing information for future smart pens, insulin titration apps and cloud software.
<em>
“For close to a century, Sanofi has been supporting those living with diabetes through our robust portfolio of medicines. This strategic relationship with Abbott is representative of the next evolution of our commitment for better diabetes care by incorporating digital tools into the daily life of people living with diabetes,” </em>said Gustavo Pesquin, Senior Vice President Global Diabetes and Cardiovascular Franchise at Sanofi.<em> “By partnering with Abbott, we are a step closer to realizing our connected ecosystem, which would help improve control and the quality of life decision cycle for patients through individualized glycemic management of diabetes.”</em>
The non-exclusive collaboration will initially enable data sharing, at the consent of the user, between Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre mobile app and cloud software and Sanofi’s connected insulin pens, apps and cloud software that are currently in development. This data sharing will enable both people with diabetes and their doctors to make better informed treatment decisions around medication, nutrition and lifestyle.
<em>
""As the global leader in continuous glucose monitoring, we see a significant opportunity to impact the health of millions of people living with diabetes by developing new tools and connectivity with Sanofi, a leader in the insulin space,"" </em>said Jared Watkin, Senior Vice President, Diabetes Care, Abbott.<em> ""Diabetes can be overwhelming as it is an information-rich condition with various streams of data from multiple devices. Building a digital ecosystem around FreeStyle Libre simplifies the user experience by consolidating how people get their data – both through offering Abbott’s digital health tools and by working with other diabetes and technology leaders.""</em></p>

<p align=""start"">DUBLIN and BAGSVÆRD, Denmark, Sept. 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a title="""" href=""http://www.medtronic.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>Medtronic plc</u></a> (NYSE:<a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=MDT&amp;exchange=4"">MDT</a>), and Novo Nordisk A/S today announced a collaboration that will develop solutions to integrate insulin dosing data from future Novo Nordisk smart insulin pens into Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices from Medtronic, such as the Guardian™ Connect system.</p>
<p align=""start"">People with diabetes spend an average of one hour a day on self-care, amounting to a full two years devoted exclusively to their disease over their lifetime.<sup>1,2</sup>This new, non-exclusive collaboration reflects both companies'commitment to making diabetes management easier by integrating key health technologies.</p>
<p align=""start"">""Millions of people living with diabetes work to control their sugar levels and track their insulin injections every day. To help ease the hassle of diabetes management, we are excited to be partnering with Medtronic, the largest medical device company in the world,” said Camilla Sylvest, executive vice president, Commercial Strategy &amp; Corporate Affairs, Novo Nordisk. “We now collaborate with all major CGM device producers, which means we can bring the benefits of smart insulin pens to even more people.”</p>
<p align=""start"">""We see incredible power in combining a variety of data points to drive insights that help people living with diabetes make more informed decisions around managing their glucose levels,"" said Alejandro Galindo, president of the Advanced Insulin Management division within the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. ""Our new agreement with Novo Nordisk, the world’s largest producer of insulin, will streamline the sharing of two of the most important pieces of information – glucose measurements and insulin dosed. With this, Medtronic can further enhance our market-leading analytics and insights to help ease the burden of diabetes.""</p>
<p align=""start"">By integrating glucose monitoring and insulin dosing data, people with diabetes and their healthcare professionals and caregivers (with permission from the person with diabetes) will be able to automatically track these two important items in a single place, giving people living with diabetes one less thing to think about in the daily management of their condition. Further, being able to view both glucose and insulin data together can facilitate more productive conversations between people and their doctors, enabling more informed decisions on how to better manage glucose levels and increase Time in Range (TIR) - the percentage of time people with diabetes spend in the optimal glycaemic range of 70-180 mg/dL.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p align=""start"">Novo Nordisk expects to launch its durable smart insulin pens, NovoPen® 6 and NovoPen Echo® Plus, as well as its disposable, pre-filled injection solution starting in 2020. Once available, smart insulin pens will be compatible with both Android and iOS devices. The Guardian Connect system will be updated as well to integrate data from these Novo Nordisk smart pens.</p>
<p align=""start""><strong><u>Time in Range</u></strong>
Time in Range refers to the percentage of time people with diabetes spend in the optimal glycaemic range of 70-180 mg/dL. The goal with diabetes management is to increase time spent in this target range and to minimise high and low sugar levels. Poor glycaemic control can lead to both immediate and long-term complications such as damage to blood vessels - increasing the risk of coronary artery disease and stroke. Damage to blood vessels can also lead to loss of vision, kidney disease, and nerve damage.</p>
<p align=""start""><strong><u>About the Guardian Connect system</u></strong>
As the only CGM system with predictive alerts up to 60 minutes in advance, the Guardian Connect system is a smart CGM system that helps people with diabetes stay ahead of high and low glucose events by empowering people using multiple daily injections (MDI) to more proactively manage their diabetes with meaningful, personalised insights. Healthcare providers may access this CGM data with their patient’s permission to run robust reports that help them inform therapy decisions and improves engagement with patients.</p>

AstraZeneca today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for the development of <i>Farxiga</i> (dapagliflozin) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, or the worsening of heart failure, in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
The FDA’s Fast Track programme is designed to accelerate the development and review of new medicines for the treatment of serious conditions where there is an unmet treatment need.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “Heart failure affects approximately 64 million people worldwide, and about half will die within five years of diagnosis. This Fast Track designation for <i>Farxiga</i> brings us closer to fulfilling our ambition to help prevent, treat and cure heart failure, and we look forward to working with the FDA to explore <i>Farxiga</i> as a potential new treatment option for heart failure patients.”
The Fast Track designation is based on two Phase III trials, DAPA-HF and DELIVER, which investigated the role of <i>Farxiga</i>in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), respectively.
<i>Farxiga</i> is currently approved as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapy to improve glycaemic control in adults with type-2 diabetes (T2D). In <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2019/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-for-farxiga-in-chronic-kidney-disease-27082019.html"">August 2019</a> the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the development of <i>Farxiga</i> to delay the progression of renal failure and prevent CV and renal death in patients with chronic kidney disease.
&nbsp;
<b>About heart failure</b>
Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening disease in which the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body.<sup>1</sup> It affects approximately 64 million people worldwide (at least half of which have a reduced ejection fraction) and is a chronic and degenerative disease where half of patients will die within five years of diagnosis.<sup>2,3,4</sup> HF remains as ‘malignant’ as some of the most common cancers in both men (prostate and bladder cancers) and women (breast cancers).<sup>5</sup> It is the leading cause of hospitalisation for those over the age of 65 and represents a significant clinical and economic burden.<sup>6</sup>
<b>About <i>Farxiga</i></b>
<i>Farxiga</i> is a first-in-class, oral once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor indicated as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood-pressure reduction, as an adjunct to diet and exercise in adults with T2D. <i>Farxiga</i> has a robust programme of clinical trials that includes more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in more than 35,000 patients, as well as more than 2.5 million patient-years’ experience.
<b>About the DapaCare Clinical Programme</b>
AstraZeneca is taking a holistic, patient-centric approach to disease management by addressing the underlying morbidity, mortality and organ damage associated with CV, metabolic and renal diseases. Due to the interconnectivity of these diseases, AstraZeneca has developed the DapaCare clinical programme to explore the CV and renal profile of <i>Farxiga</i> in people with and without T2D. The clinical programme will enrol nearly 30,000 patients in randomised clinical trials and is supported by a multinational real-world evidence study. DapaCare will generate data across a spectrum of people with established CV disease, CV risk factors and varying stages of renal disease, both with and without T2D, providing healthcare providers with evidence needed to improve patient outcomes.
<i>Farxiga </i>is also being developed for patients with HF in the DELIVER (HFpEF) and DETERMINE (HFrEF and HFpEF) trials, in addition to chronic kidney disease in the DAPA-CKD trial. DapaCare underscores our commitment to following the science by pursuing a holistic patient approach to address the multiple risk factors associated with CV, renal and metabolic diseases.
<b>About AstraZeneca in heart failure</b>
AstraZeneca is committed to advancing science and clinical outcomes with <i>Farxiga</i> in the treatment of people with HF. The company’s extensive clinical programme includes several global Phase III trials (DAPA-HF, DELIVER and DETERMINE) focusing on distinct and clinically important areas of HF research in order to provide comprehensive clinical evidence around the disease and address areas of high unmet need in HF. AstraZeneca is also investing its efforts in compelling new science through early-stage research of several potential medicines to address HF.
<b>About AstraZeneca in CVRM</b>
Cardiovascular, Renal &amp; Metabolism (CVRM) together forms one of AstraZeneca’s three therapy areas and is a key growth driver for the Company. By following the science to understand more clearly the underlying links between the heart, kidneys and pancreas, AstraZeneca is investing in a portfolio of medicines to protect organs and improve outcomes by slowing disease progression, reducing risks and tackling co-morbidities. The Company’s ambition is to modify or halt the natural course of CVRM diseases and potentially regenerate organs and restore function, by continuing to deliver transformative science that improves treatment practices and cardiovascular health for millions of patients worldwide.
<b>About AstraZeneca</b>
AstraZeneca is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas – Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism (CVRM), and Respiratory. AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide.

Volasertib is an inhibitor of Polo-like-kinase 1 (PLK1), an enzyme known to be involved in cancer progression in a number of diseases. The compound was being developed by Boehringer for the treatment of a specific form of leukemia but clinical development activities were halted after a large Phase III study with adult patients failed to meet its primary endpoints. Meanwhile, independent academic groups had generated strong data in support of further developing the drug for rhabdomyosarcoma and a few other pediatric cancer indications. By signing this licensing agreement, Oncoheroes and Boehringer Ingelheim make it possible to continue the clinical development of volasertib to the benefit of younger cancer patients.

<span class=""xn-location"">HORSHAM, Pa.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 16, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking first-in-class approval of TREMFYA<sup>®</sup> (guselkumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Developed by Janssen, TREMFYA is a human monoclonal antibody against the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23. TREMFYA is the first approved selective IL-23 inhibitor. It was approved in the U.S. in <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2017</span> for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and has also been approved in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, the European Union, <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> and several other countries worldwide.
The TREMFYA sBLA is based on results from the Phase 3 DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 studies, which met their primary endpoints of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20 percent improvement (ACR20) response after 24 weeks of treatment. The safety profile observed for TREMFYA in the DISCOVER studies was generally consistent with previous studies as well as the current TREMFYA prescribing information. The DISCOVER program comprises the first-ever Phase 3 studies evaluating a human monoclonal antibody against the p19 subunit of IL-23 for active PsA, and the results have been submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.
""We're excited about the DISCOVER data and the potential of TREMFYA as a treatment option given the unmet needs of patients living with psoriatic arthritis, a chronic lifelong disease,"" said Newman Yeilding, M.D., Head of Immunology Development, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""DISCOVER-1 and 2 are the ninth and tenth Phase 3 studies Janssen has completed in PsA, across our portfolio of medicines.""
In addition to the primary endpoint of ACR20 response at week 24, multiple secondary endpoints were assessed, including ACR50/70, resolution of soft tissue inflammation (enthesitis and dactylitis), disease activity (DAS-28 CRP), improvement in physical function (HAQ-DI), skin clearance (IGA), improvement in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and quality of life (SF-36 PCS and MCS). DISCOVER-2 also assessed effect on structural damage using the van der Heide-Sharp score (vdH-S) as a key secondary endpoint.
""With this submission to the FDA, we hope to offer the first IL-23 p19 inhibitor to clinicians and their patients for active psoriatic arthritis,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Andrew Greenspan</span>, M.D., Vice President, Immunology Medical Affairs, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.  ""Psoriatic arthritis is a complex disease involving both the skin and the joints with a heterogeneous range of clinical manifestations, and it requires treatment options with different mechanisms of action.""
Both DISCOVER trials were randomized, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA administered by subcutaneous injection in patients with active PsA compared to placebo. DISCOVER-1 evaluated 381 participants, including those previously treated with anti-TNF therapy, and continued through 52 weeks. DISCOVER-2 included 739 biologic-naïve participants and is planned to continue through 100 weeks.
Janssen also expects to submit a marketing application to the European Medicines Agency seeking approval of TREMFYA as a treatment for PsA before the end of the year.
<b><u>About Psoriatic Arthritis<br class=""dnr"" /></u></b>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by joint inflammation, enthesitis, dactylitis and the skin manifestations of psoriasis.<sup>1</sup> It is estimated that at least one million Americans are living with PsA, and up to 30 percent of patients living with psoriasis can develop PsA.<sup>2</sup> The disease causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints; it commonly appears between the ages of 30 and 50, but can develop at any time.<sup>2</sup> Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset of the disease.<sup>2</sup>
<b><u>About TREMFYA<sup>® </sup></u></b><b><u>(</u></b><b><u>guselkumab</u></b><b><u>)<br class=""dnr"" /></u></b>Developed by Janssen, TREMFYA<sup>®</sup> is a human monoclonal antibody against the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23, and is approved in the U.S., <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>, the European Union, <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet [UV] light). IL-23 is an important driver of the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The TREMFYA development program includes: two Phase 3 programs evaluating TREMFYA in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis, a Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span>/3 program in Crohn's disease, a Phase <span class=""xn-money"">2b</span>/3 program in Ulcerative Colitis, and two Phase 2 programs – one exploring biologic combination therapy in Ulcerative Colitis and the other for the treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa.
The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Next-Generation Professional CGM Combines Valuable Data with Optimal User Experience
DUBLIN, Sept. 17, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, services and solutions, today announced the Envision™ Pro Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system — a fully disposable, zero calibration professional CGM system — has obtained CE (Conformité Européenne) Mark approval. Medtronic will begin commercial release in Europe and the Middle East this fall, subject to local regulatory requirements1. This new technology will empower healthcare professionals and their patients with either type 1 and type 2 diabetes to see accurate glucose levels and trends over time to develop more optimal diabetes therapy plans.

“Medtronic has a 20-year history in professional CGM as the first company to have an approved physician-use CGM system,” said Sheri Dodd, vice president and general manager for the Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business at Medtronic. “The launch of the Envision Pro CGM system represents multiple important innovations as the first disposable and zero calibration CGM from Medtronic.”

The glucose data collected by the Envision recorder generates up to five diagnostic reports that are reviewed by healthcare professionals with their patients. The main report, Pattern Snapshot, uses advanced pattern recognition algorithms to help advance the conversation between the healthcare provider and patient by identifying daily patterns of high and low sugar levels and their association with food, medication, exercise and sleep. With these insights, providers can facilitate therapy adjustments and provide lifestyle change recommendations to their patients in order to minimize excursions and the associated risk of complications. The Envision Pro CGM system provides accurate data that is blinded to the patient to obtain an unbiased view of their real-world glucose levels. It also has comprehensive event tracking features and easy-to-read reports, making it easier for physicians to have needed therapy discussions with their patients.

The Envision Pro system was designed with ease of use as a top priority. For instance, patients no longer need to calibrate the CGM through fingersticks. Also, there is no need to return the sensor or recorder to their physician, as both pieces are now fully disposable. The recorder communicates wirelessly with the patient’s smartphone allowing automatic data uploading so that the healthcare provider obtains the data seamlessly and can run reports remotely without additional in-office visits.

“Fingersticks and A1C only show part of how a person’s sugar levels are fluctuating throughout the day,” said Professor Dr. Christophe De Block, M.D., Ph.D., head of the Department of Endocrinolgy-Diabetology-Metabolism at Antwerp University Hospital. “The Envision Pro CGM system will allow me and my patients to see the percent of time that they are in the optimal target glucose range, and when they are high or low, so that we can better uncover how food, exercise and medication affect their sugar levels. This provides me the opportunity to have more informed discussions and to customize the diabetes management plans for my patients, and augments the personal engagement of patients thereby motivating them to adhere to therapeutic advice.”

About Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) measures glucose levels every 5 minutes using a tiny sensor inserted beneath the skin, typically in the abdomen or upper arm. There are two forms of CGM – real-time CGM and professional blinded CGM. Real-time CGM is a patient-focused tool that allows a patient with diabetes to understand how insulin and their lifestyle affect glucose levels throughout the day. It is meant to be worn for months and years. Professional blinded CGM records glucose levels just as frequently but is designed for the healthcare professional to get an unbiased snapshot of glucose trends over a week, since the glucose levels are masked and the patient can not react to real-time values during the evaluation period. It is generally used just a few times a year. The reports can empower healthcare providers with additional insights to help them develop personalized treatment plans for their patients in less time, for better diabetes management.

About the Diabetes Group at Medtronic (www.medtronicdiabetes.com)
Medtronic is working together with the global community to change the way people manage diabetes. The company aims to transform diabetes care by expanding access, integrating care and improving outcomes, so people living with diabetes can enjoy greater freedom and better health.

<p class=""bwalignc""><i>– Acceleron to discontinue development of ACE-083 in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy –</i></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><i>– Topline results from the Phase 2 trial of ACE-083 in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease expected in Q1 2020 -</i></p>
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 16, 2019-- Acceleron Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:XLRN), a leading biopharmaceutical company in the discovery and development of TGF-beta superfamily therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases, today announced that treatment with ACE-083 in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) did not achieve functional secondary endpoints in the Phase 2 trial.
Although ACE-083 demonstrated a robust, statistically significant increase in mean total muscle volume, the primary endpoint of the trial, the increase failed to translate to statistically significant improvements in functional tests. As a result, Acceleron will not conduct further clinical trials of ACE-083 in FSHD.
“We are certainly disappointed with these results. As we have stated consistently, for ACE-083 to become an important new therapy for patients with FSHD, it would have to deliver a meaningful functional benefit on top of an ability to grow muscle,” said Habib Dable, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. “Unfortunately, in this case, the data show no evidence of such a benefit and, therefore, do not support further development of ACE-083 for FSHD. We’re grateful to the patients, families, caregivers, and investigators who participated in this research.”
Dable added: “We now look toward the first quarter of next year, when we expect topline results from the placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of ACE-083 in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease—a neuromuscular disorder of different pathophysiology.”
In this Phase 2 trial in patients with FSHD, ACE-083 was generally well tolerated. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) and injection-site related. Acceleron expects to present results at a future medical meeting.
ACE-083 is an investigational therapy that is not approved for any use in any country.
<b>FSHD Phase 2 Trial Design</b>
The two-part Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to evaluate ACE-083 in FSHD patients with muscle weakness in the biceps brachii (BB) and the tibialis anterior (TA), a muscle in the lower leg involved in foot dorsiflexion (raising the foot at the ankle). Part 1 was an open-label, dose-escalation study, with ACE-083 administered by injection into the BB or TA muscle to evaluate safety and increases in muscle volume over a 3-month treatment period. Part 2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using the optimal dose level selected in Part 1. A total of 56 patients were randomized in Part 2 to receive either placebo or ACE-083 and were evaluated for changes in muscle volume, fat fraction, strength, function, quality of life, and safety over a 6-month primary treatment period, followed by a 6-month open-label treatment period.

<span class=""xn-location"">MAHWAH, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 16, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (Glenmark), a research-led, integrated global pharmaceutical company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to its bispecific antibody candidate GBR 1342 for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received prior therapies. Derived from the company's proprietary BEAT® (<b><u>B</u></b>ispecific <b><u>E</u></b>ngagement by <b><u>A</u></b>ntibodies based on the <b><u>T</u></b> cell receptor) technology, GBR 1342 is being investigated for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The candidate is one of five clinical-stage assets in the pipeline of Glenmark's new innovation company.
GBR 1342 is designed to bind to both CD3 on T cells and CD38, an antigen known to be implicated in hematological malignancies, on target cells. This activates T cells and redirects them toward CD38+ tumor cells found in multiple myeloma. Once directed at the right target, the T cells help destroy the tumor cells.
A first-in-human, open-label, Phase 1 trial of GBR 1342 in multiple myeloma, is ongoing to assess the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of GBR 1342, and will also evaluate biomarkers, immunogenicity, and additional measures of disease activity.
<p id=""indentid"" class=""prnml40""><i>""Patients who are struggling with diseases like multiple myeloma are seeking new treatment options and innovative approaches. We believe the focus of our new company is essential to these patients and to the healthcare system,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Alessandro Riva</span>, MD, CEO of the new company. ""As one of our first important pipeline milestones, we are excited that the FDA has recognized the potential for GBR 1342 to offer a significant advancement for patients with multiple myeloma.""</i></p>
Multiple myeloma is a rare blood disorder in which plasma cells in the bone marrow become malignant and replicate unchecked.<sup>1</sup> The malignant plasma cells can displace normal blood cells in the body, leading to anemia and uncontrolled bleeding.<sup>1</sup> It can also cause issues with bone density and strength, as well as lead to an increased risk of infection by lowering the body's immune response.<sup>1</sup>
More than 32,000 new cases of multiple myeloma are expected to be diagnosed in 2019 in the U.S.<sup>2</sup> During that same time, about 13,000 people are expected to die from the disease.<sup>2</sup>
The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan drug designation to novel drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. The designation allows manufacturers to qualify for various incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical trials and — upon regulatory approval — 7 years of market exclusivity.

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) and granted priority review for Merck’s investigational Ebola vaccine (V920), under review for the prevention of disease caused by the Ebola Zaire virus. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action date, is set for March 14, 2020<i>. </i>In July 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to V920.
“Merck has worked with government partners and the global health community to accelerate development of our investigational V920 Ebola vaccine. FDA’s priority review designation underscores our long-standing partnership with the U.S. government toward its development and licensure,” said Dr. Paula Annunziato, vice president, Merck Research Laboratories. “A top priority for us remains achieving registration of V920 and regulatory approval of our German manufacturing site, so that licensed supply can be produced over time to support global public health preparedness and health security objectives. We look forward to continuing to work with the FDA throughout the review process.”
In parallel to its regulatory efforts, Merck has remained steadfast in its commitment to scale-up the number of investigational V920 Ebola vaccine doses being produced to help international public health officials and government authorities meet ongoing, unpredictable, and evolving outbreak response needs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries. Since May 2018, Merck has donated and shipped more than 245,000 1.0mL investigational V920 Ebola vaccine doses to the World Health Organization (WHO) in response to requests by the WHO. Beyond doses already delivered, more than 190,000 additional 1.0mL investigational doses are currently available and ready to ship to the outbreak region at WHO's request.
In addition, in June 2019, Merck started executing an updated replenishment strategy to increase investigational V920 Ebola vaccine supply, based on ongoing consultations with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, WHO and Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance). The strategy targets production of an additional estimated 650,000 1.0mL investigational doses, to be released and made available in a phased manner over the next 6-to-18 months. In total, past, current and upcoming production will amount to more than 900,000 1.0mL investigational doses of V920. Stockpiles are inherently dynamic, and therefore all estimates included here are as of the time of this statement and subject to change.
New investigational supply will be based on a combination of leveraging material from ongoing production activities at the planned commercial manufacturing site in Germany and new production at a clinical manufacturing site in the U.S. While the company continues to explore opportunities to accelerate production, our timing estimates are based on the need to meet manufacturing and quality-control requirements.
“We continue to be proud and humbled to provide our investigational V920 Ebola vaccine as an additional tool in support of the comprehensive public health response efforts against the current Ebola outbreak. Merck appreciates and continues to work closely with our collaborators and is inspired by the relentless determination of everyone involved, especially frontline responders, working to contain this unique and dangerous outbreak,” Dr. Annunziato added.
<b>Status of International Regulatory Filings for Merck’s Investigational V920 Ebola Zaire Vaccine</b>
In March 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for V920 for review. In parallel, and in close collaboration with FDA and EMA, submissions have also been made to the WHO to achieve prequalification status and to health authority representatives of the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF).
<b>About Merck’s Investigational V920 Ebola Zaire Vaccine</b>
V920, Merck’s investigational Ebola Zaire vaccine, was initially engineered by scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory and subsequently licensed to a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics Corporation. In late 2014, when the Ebola outbreak in western Africa was at its peak, Merck licensed V920 from NewLink Genetics. Since that time, the company has worked closely with a number of external collaborators to enable a broad clinical development program with partial funding from the U.S. government, including the Department of Health and Human Service’s Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) and the Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Program (DTRA) and Joint Vaccination Acquisition Program (JVAP), among others. Merck’s V920 investigational supply replenishment activities are supported by partial Federal funding from BARDA under Contract No. HHSO100201700012C. Merck is responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and regulatory efforts in support of V920. The company has committed to working closely with other stakeholders to accelerate the continued development, production and, if licensed, distribution of the vaccine.

<p class=""selectionShareable""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland, and Moscow, Russia, September 17, 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.selexis.com/"">Selexis SA</a> and <a href=""http://www.generium.ru/en/"">Generium JSC</a> today announced that a sixth Selexis SURE<em>technology</em> Platform™-generated biological product has been approved for marketing. The latest approved product, dornase alfa inhalation solution, is used together with antibiotics, bronchodilators, and steroids to control symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Generium is the first company in the world to develop and market a biosimilar of dornase alfa.</p>
<p class=""selectionShareable"">According to the National Institutes of Health, cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by the buildup of thick, sticky mucus that can damage many of the body’s organs. The disorder’s most common signs and symptoms include progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive system problems. The features of the disorder and their severity varies among affected individuals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""selectionShareable"">“This biologic’s market approval in Russia represents another major milestone for Selexis and we are pleased to recognize the work of Generium in delivering the fifth and sixth approvals using our SURE<em>technology</em> Platform,” said Igor Fisch, PhD, CEO, Selexis SA. “There are currently 122 clinical programs in development utilizing our platform. The increasing number of Selexis-generated research cell banks used in clinical programs, and now a sixth marketed product, continue to validate the value of our scientific innovation. We are extremely proud of our ability to help our partners address complicated and intractable diseases by developing complex protein therapeutics faster, safer and more cost efficiently.”</p>
<p class=""selectionShareable"">“We believe patients will be able to maintain a higher quality of life on our dornase alfa inhalation solution,” said Prof. Dmitriy Kudlay, CEO, Generium JSC. “The orphan drugs market has been growing significantly over the last several years. Biotechnology, as a science, is developing rapidly, providing new products for the treatment of the most severe and rare diseases.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""selectionShareable"">Selexis’ SURE<em>technology</em> Platform is based on Selexis SGE<sup>®</sup> (Selexis Genetic Elements) — novel human DNA-based elements that control the dynamic organization of chromatin across mammalian cells. These elements increase transcription rates of transgenes by rendering the expression cassette independent of the locus of integration and thus allowing higher and more stable expression of any recombinant protein. SURE<em>technology</em> improves the way cells are used in the discovery, development and manufacturing of recombinant proteins.</p>
<p class=""selectionShareable"">The Selexis SURE CHO-M Cell Line™ is a proprietary high-performance mammalian cell line derived from CHO-K1 cells. The genome of Selexis SURE CHO-M Cell Line has been fully sequenced and is used to characterize the sequence of the transgene, identify transgene integration loci and to document the monoclonality of cell populations. Selexis SURE CHO-M Cell Line is used for the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","AstraZeneca has amended its collaboration agreement with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ironwood) in China mainland, China Hong Kong and China Macau for Linzess* (linaclotide), a first-in-class new treatment for patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). IBS-C is characterised by symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation, is a chronic and prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder in China and there are currently few treatment options for this condition.
The amended agreement gives AstraZeneca sole responsibility for developing, manufacturing and commercialising Linzessin China mainland, China Hong Kong and China Macau. Ironwood will no longer be involved in the research and development or the commercialisation of Linzess; it will also transfer manufacturing responsibility to AstraZeneca.
The two companies first entered into a collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Linzess in 2012. Under the original collaboration agreement, AstraZeneca and Ironwood were jointly responsible for strategic oversight of the development and commercialisation of Linzess in China, while AstraZeneca had primary responsibility for local operational execution.
Linzess was approved by the National Medical Products Administration for adults with IBS-C in January 2019 in China, where it is expected to be launched in 2019.
Leon Wang, Executive Vice President, International and President of AstraZeneca China, said: “Linzess is an important new treatment for this type of IBS in China, where there is a specific high unmet medical need. Today’s amended agreement allows us to bring this innovative medicine to patients more efficiently and will contribute further to our strong growth in this significant market.”
Mark Mallon, Chief Executive Officer of Ironwood, said: “AstraZeneca has substantial experience and capabilities in developing and commercialising medicines in China. There are approximately 14 million adults suffering from IBS-C in China alone and we believe AstraZeneca is well-positioned to bring Linzess to these patients.”
Financial considerations
AstraZeneca will pay Ironwood three non-contingent payments, totalling $35m, between 2021 and 2024. In addition, Ironwood could receive up to $90m in milestone payments, contingent on the achievement of certain sales targets. Ironwood will also be eligible for royalties beginning in the mid-single-digit percent, based on the annual net sales of Linzess in China mainland, China Hong Kong and China Macau where Ironwood will no longer jointly fund the development and commercialisation of Linzess or share in the profit from sales.
About Linzess
Linzess is a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist that is thought, based on learnings from non-clinical trials, to work in two ways. Linzess binds to the GC-C receptor locally within the intestinal epithelium. Activation of GC-C results in increased intestinal fluid secretion and accelerated transit and a decrease in the activity of pain-sensing nerves in the intestine. The clinical relevance of the effect on pain fibres, based on non-clinical trials, has not been established. *Linzess® is a registered trademark of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
About AstraZeneca
AstraZeneca is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three therapy areas – Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism (CVRM), and Respiratory. AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide. Please visit astrazeneca.com and follow us on Twitter @AstraZeneca.

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>There are currently no U.S. FDA-approved medicines for lupus nephritis</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>The designation is based on the results of the phase II NOBILITY study that showed Gazyva, in combination with standard of care, helped more people achieve a complete renal response than standard of care alone</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Full results from the NOBILITY study will be presented at a medical meeting later this year
</strong></li>
</ul>
Basel, 18 September 2019 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to Gazyva® (obinutuzumab) for adults with lupus nephritis. This designation was granted based on data from the phase II NOBILITY study in adult patients with proliferative lupus nephritis which showed Gazyva, in combination with standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid and corticosteroids), demonstrated enhanced efficacy compared to placebo plus standard of care alone in achieving complete renal response at one year.
“New treatment options are needed for lupus nephritis, a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the kidneys that most commonly affects women,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are committed to developing Gazyva as a potential new therapy for lupus nephritis and plan to begin enrolling patients in a phase III trial next year.”
Lupus nephritis is a potentially life-threatening manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus resulting from inflammation of the kidneys and is associated with a high risk of end-stage renal disease or death. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to accelerate the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. This is the 27th Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Roche’s portfolio of medicines.
<strong>About the NOBILITY Study</strong>
The phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study, NOBILITY (NCT02550652), compared the safety and efficacy of Gazyva, combined with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic acid (MPA) and corticosteroids, to placebo, combined with MMF or MPA and corticosteroids, in adult patients with ISN/RPS 2003 class III or IV proliferative lupus nephritis. The study enrolled 126 people who were randomised to receive Gazyva or placebo infusions on days 1, 15, 168, and 182. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who achieved a protocol-defined complete renal response (CRR) at 52 weeks.
The study met its primary endpoint, showing Gazyva, in combination with standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid and corticosteroids), demonstrated enhanced efficacy compared to placebo plus standard of care alone in achieving complete renal response at one year. In addition, Gazyva met key secondary endpoints showing improved overall renal responses (complete and partial renal response) and serologic markers of disease activity as compared to placebo. No new safety signals were observed with Gazyva in the study at the time of this analysis. The full results from the study will be presented at a future medical meeting.
<strong>About Lupus Nephritis</strong>
Lupus nephritis is a severe and potentially life-threatening disorder of the kidneys. Lupus nephritis is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease where a person's own immune system attacks healthy cells and organs.<sup>1 </sup>It is estimated that SLE affects 24 per 100,000 in the population globally.<sup>2 </sup>Up to 60% of people with SLE will develop lupus nephritis, and up to 25% of people with the condition develop end-stage renal disease.<sup>1,3</sup> Lupus overwhelmingly impacts women, making up 90% of the patient population. Women from African, Hispanic and Asian ethnic groups are two to three times more likely than Caucasian women to be diagnosed with lupus.<sup>4</sup> Currently, there is no cure for lupus or lupus nephritis.<sup>4</sup>
<strong>About Gazyva</strong>
Gazyva is an engineered monoclonal antibody designed to attach to CD20, a protein found only on certain types of B-cells. It is thought to work by attacking targeted cells both directly and together with the body's immune system. In the United States, Gazyva is part of a collaboration between Genentech and Biogen. Combination studies investigating Gazyva with other approved or investigational medicines, including cancer immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors, are underway across a range of blood cancers.

<b><i>Understand AD</i></b><b> program brings together a team of experts to help a teen with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) and his parents navigate the disease</b>
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: <b>REGN</b>) and Sanofi, in partnership with the National Eczema Association (NEA), today launched the next phase of <i>Understand AD</i>, a disease awareness initiative focused on educating about moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).
Teenagers face many challenges, and growing up with AD can impact the ups and downs and transitions to young adulthood even harder. The new phase of <i>Understand AD</i> deploys a team of experts – a dermatologist, psychotherapist and peer living with severe AD, together known as <i>The Understand AD Squad</i> – into the home of Isaiah Dixon, a 17-year-old who has been living with severe AD since he was two years old. This experience with Isaiah and his family is shared through a video series and downloadable resources on <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2584447-1&amp;h=2504798969&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.understandad.com%2F&amp;a=www.UnderstandAD.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">www.UnderstandAD.com</a> that aim to provide support to teens and their families on how to navigate life with AD.
Like the 400,000 adolescents in the U.S. with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, Isaiah has lived with debilitating, burdensome disease symptoms including intense, persistent itching, skin lesions and skin dryness, cracking, redness, crusting and oozing. AD flares are reported to impact school life in 46 percent of 14-17 year-olds with the disease. Teens reported missing an average of 26 days of school per year due to flares.
The Dixon family has been impacted physically and mentally by severe AD. Throughout his life, Isaiah's symptoms have caused frequent hospitalizations, school absences and emotional stress for him and his loved ones.
""Living with severe atopic dermatitis requires constant care. My family has always helped me manage my disease,"" said Isaiah. ""Like many teens with atopic dermatitis, I know that I will need to start taking care of my disease more independently as I get older. <i>The Understand AD Squad</i> expanded my support system and helped me become more independent in managing my atopic dermatitis.""
<i>The Understand AD Squad</i> features eczema specialist Dr. Mercedes E. Gonzalez, psychotherapist Christine Triano, MSW, LCSW and AD patient-peer Tyler Berryman, who came together to each lend their unique perspectives of AD to support teens and their families on their journey.
""The<i> Understand AD </i>program aligns with NEA's commitment to educating the public and supporting patients impacted by atopic dermatitis, not only physically, but also emotionally,"" said Julie Block, President and CEO, National Eczema Association. ""NEA wants teens living with this disease and their families to know that they are not alone and that NEA is committed to advocating for better care and treatments, providing support and raising the level of awareness about this serious, and often overlooked, disease.""

<b>About the Understand AD Squad</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Dr. Mercedes E. Gonzalez</b> is a pediatric dermatologist and Clinical Assistant Professor of Dermatology at the Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine and at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, where she serves as faculty advisor for the dermatology interest group. As an <i>Understand AD Squad</i> member, Dr. Gonzalez discusses the science behind AD and how teens can address this with their doctor.</li>
 	<li><b>Christine Triano, MSW, LCSW</b> is a psychotherapist and Director of Mental Health at The Center for Connection in Pasadena, California. As an <i>Understand AD Squad</i> member, Christine highlights the emotional burden of moderate-to-severe AD and the importance of communication among families who are battling the disease.</li>
 	<li><b>Tyler Berryman</b>is a young adult who has lived with severe AD since childhood. As an <i>Understand AD Squad</i> member, Tyler shares the lessons he's learned from managing AD most of his life, and why he's passionate about helping other teens with the disease.</li>
</ul>
<b>About Understand AD
</b><i>Understand AD</i> launched in 2016 to empower and give a voice to people living with this devastating disease. Previous programs include <i>A Day in the Life</i>, which provided resources and a short film, written and narrated by Peter Moffat, award-winning screen writer and the Executive Producer of the HBO series ""The Night Of"", that demonstrated the helplessness and desperation those suffering with AD feel every day.
<i>The Understand AD Squad</i> video series is the next phase of this initiative, targeted to adolescents with AD and their caregivers. Through insights from <i>The Understand AD Squad</i>experts, Isaiah and his family, and NEA's Teen Steering Committee, the program shines a light on the everyday burdens that teens with AD and their caregivers face managing the disease, and ways to navigate these struggles.

<b>About the National Eczema Association
</b>Founded in 1988, the National Eczema Association (NEA) is the sole patient advocacy organization serving people with eczema in the United States. NEA works to improve the health and quality of life for individuals with eczema through research, support, and education. In 2015, NEA created the Roadmap to Advocacy, a refreshed organizational vision that would unify and stand up for patients, to pull back the curtain on eczema, a long silent and under-served disease, by revealing that the disease not only damages the skin, but also breaks apart lives and still further, poses serious public health risks. The strategic priorities of the NEA Roadmap rest on five transformation keys; break through negative stereotypes to promote understanding of eczema and reduce burden of disease; equip medical practices for a new era in eczema care; promote new models of care to better leverage resources; support a research agenda of high-value/high-yield projects; and, advocate for accessible and affordable treatments for all eczema patients.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is announcing <a title=""Project Orbis"" href=""https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/project-orbis"" data-entity-substitution=""canonical"" data-entity-type=""node"" data-entity-uuid=""6ba93f36-fd43-4df6-9291-b4ac8a275a31"">Project Orbis</a>, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE). Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among its international partners. Under this project, the FDA, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada collaboratively reviewed applications for two oncology drugs, allowing for simultaneous decisions in all three countries.
“We are pleased to be working alongside our Australian and Canadian colleagues to help make potentially life-changing treatments available to patients as quickly as possible while still ensuring the FDA’s high standards of safety and effectiveness,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. “As Project Orbis expands, we look forward to welcoming additional international partners to collaborate with us in this important initiative as we work to help further serve the global patient community.”
Collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions, regardless of whether the product has received FDA approval. This is partly due to different standards of care around the world that also have an impact on the increasingly international conduct of cancer clinical trials, potentially slowing the development of anticancer products. With a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs, Project Orbis facilitates a collaborative review to identify any regulatory divergence across review teams.
As part of Project Orbis, in conjunction with decisions by TGA and Health Canada, the FDA today granted accelerated approval to Lenvima (lenvatinib) in combination with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), and who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy but are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.
Endometrial cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium). Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female genital tract. Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and certain estrogen promoting medications may increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Symptoms may include unusual vaginal bleeding or pain in the pelvis.
“In addition to the international collaboration with Australia and Canada, this review used the ‘Real-Time Oncology Review’ (RTOR) pilot program, which can streamline the submission of data prior to the completion and submission of the entire clinical application,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “RTOR, and its accompanying Assessment Aid, facilitated discussions among the regulatory agencies, expediting the approval in the three countries. These applications were approved three months prior to the FDA goal date.”
Lenvima was initially approved by the FDA in 2015 and Keytruda was initially approved in 2014. Today’s approval of Lenvima in combination with Keytruda was based on the results of a clinical trial of 94 patients with endometrial carcinoma tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR. Of the 94 patients, 10 patients (10.6% of responders) had a complete response, or disappearance of all lesions on imaging, and 26 patients (27.7% of responders) had a partial response, or shrinkage of lesions by at least 30%, leading to an objective response rate of 38.3%. Of these, 25 patients (69% of responders) have a duration of response of greater than 6 months.
Common side effects for patients in the clinical trial included fatigue, high blood pressure, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), nausea and stomatitis (inflamed and sore mouth). Additional side effects included vomiting, decreased weight, abdominal pain, headache, constipation, urinary tract infection, dysphonia (voice difficulty), hemorrhagic events (bleeding), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand foot syndrome), dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough and rash. Health care professionals should inform females of reproductive age and males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Lenvima in combination with Keytruda. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take this combination because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby.

KENILWORTH, N.J., &amp; WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.--(<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Eisai today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination of KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, plus LENVIMA, the orally available kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. This marks the first U.S. approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA and the first time an anti-PD-1 therapy is approved in combination with a kinase inhibitor for advanced endometrial carcinoma in the U.S. Following submission on June 17, this is an accelerated approval reviewed under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to improve the efficiency of the review process for applications to ensure that treatments are available to patients as early as possible. This approval is based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial. According to the FDA, this review was conducted under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among its international partners. Under this project, the FDA, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Health Canada collaboratively reviewed applications for two oncology drugs, allowing for simultaneous decisions in all three countries.
“When diagnosed early, endometrial carcinoma can have a good prognosis; however, for women whose cancer has progressed following prior systemic therapy, there are few FDA-approved treatment options,” said Dr. Vicky Makker, medical oncologist, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “Based on objective response rate and the duration of response, this approval of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination will help address a significant unmet medical need for patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not MSI-H or dMMR, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.”
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.
Adverse reactions, some of which can be serious or fatal, may occur with LENVIMA, including hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, arterial thromboembolic events, hepatotoxicity, renal failure or impairment, proteinuria, diarrhea, fistula formation and gastrointestinal perforation, QT interval prolongation, hypocalcemia, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, hemorrhagic events, impairment of thyroid stimulating hormone suppression/thyroid dysfunction, and wound healing complications. Based on the type and/or severity of the adverse reaction, LENVIMA may be interrupted, reduced and/or discontinued. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception. For more information, see “Selected Safety Information” below.
“Today’s approval of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination for advanced endometrial carcinoma that has progressed following prior systemic therapy brings the first approved combination treatment to women with this type of cancer whose tumors are not MSI-H or dMMR and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, and demonstrates the potential of our collaboration with Eisai,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, Vice President, Oncology Clinical Research, Merck Research Laboratories. “Merck is committed to developing this combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program, which is under active investigation.”
“At least 75% of endometrial cancer cases are not microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient, and these women have been in need of new treatment options,” said Dr. Takashi Owa, Vice President, Chief Medicine Creation and Chief Discovery Officer, Oncology Business Group at Eisai. “We are excited for the advancement that today’s approval of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination treatment represents for these women whose advanced endometrial carcinoma is not microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient, has progressed following prior systemic therapy and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, and we look forward to the possibilities that our collaboration holds.”
<b>Data Supporting the Approval</b>
The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-146/Study 111, a Phase 2, multi-cohort, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial that enrolled 108 patients with metastatic endometrial carcinoma that had progressed following at least one prior systemic therapy in any setting. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients were treated with KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks in combination with LENVIMA 20 mg orally once daily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression as determined by the investigator.
Administration of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA was permitted beyond Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. KEYTRUDA dosing was continued for a maximum of 24 months; however, treatment with LENVIMA could be continued beyond 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline and then every six weeks until week 24, followed by every nine weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by independent radiologic review committee (IRC) using RECIST 1.1.
Among the 108 patients, 87% (n=94) had tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR, 10% (n=11) had tumors that were MSI-H or dMMR, and 3% (n=3) had tumors that had unknown status. The baseline characteristics of the 94 patients with tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR were: median age of 66 years, with 62% age 65 or older; 86% White, 6% Black, 4% Asian, and 3% other races; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 (52%) or 1 (48%). All 94 patients had received prior systemic therapy for endometrial carcinoma; 51% had one, 38% had two, and 11% had three or more prior systemic therapies.
In the 94 patients with tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR, the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination demonstrated an ORR of 38.3% (95% CI, 29%-49%), with a complete response rate of 10.6% (n=10) and a partial response rate of 27.7% (n=26). The median follow-up time was 18.7 months. In the patients who had a response as determined by independent review (n=36), at the time of data cutoff, the median DOR was not reached (range: 1.2+ to 33.1+ months), and 69% of these patients experienced responses lasting six months or greater.
The median duration of study treatment was seven months (range: 0.03 to 37.8 months), and the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was six months (range: 0.03 to 23.8 months). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA, including gastrointestinal perforation, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) with intraventricular hemorrhage, and intracranial hemorrhage. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA. The most common serious adverse reactions (=3%) with the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination were hypertension (9%), abdominal pain (6%), musculoskeletal pain (5%), hemorrhage, fatigue, nausea, confusional state, and pleural effusion (4% each), adrenal insufficiency, colitis, dyspnea, and pyrexia (3% each).
KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions (Grade 1-4) in 19% of patients, regardless of action taken with LENVIMA. The most common adverse reactions (=2%) leading to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were adrenal insufficiency, colitis, pancreatitis, and muscular weakness (2% each). Permanent discontinuation due to adverse reactions (Grade 1-4) occurred in 21% of patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA. The most common adverse reactions (=2%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were gastrointestinal perforation or fistula, muscular weakness, and pancreatitis (2% each).
Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 49% of patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (=2%) were fatigue (14%), diarrhea and decreased appetite (6% each), rash (5%), renal impairment, vomiting, increased lipase, and decreased weight (4% each), nausea, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, and skin ulcer (3% each), adrenal insufficiency, increased amylase, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, peripheral edema, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis, and syncope (2% each). Adverse reactions led to dose reduction or interruption in 88% of patients receiving LENVIMA. The most common adverse reactions (=5%) resulting in dose reduction or interruption of LENVIMA were fatigue (32%), hypertension (26%), diarrhea (18%), nausea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and vomiting (13% each), decreased appetite (12%), musculoskeletal pain (11%), stomatitis (9%), abdominal pain, hemorrhages (7% each), renal impairment and decreased weight (6% each), rash, headache, increased lipase, and proteinuria (5% each).
The most common adverse reactions (=20%) with the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and hypertension (65% each), diarrhea (64%),<b> </b>decreased appetite (52%),<b> </b>hypothyroidism (51%), nausea (48%), stomatitis (43%), vomiting (39%), decreased weight (36%), abdominal pain and headache (33% each), constipation (32%), urinary tract infection (31%), dysphonia (29%), hemorrhagic events (28%), hypomagnesemia (27%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (26%), dyspnea (24%), cough and rash (21% each).
<b>Recommended Dosage for Endometrial Carcinoma</b>
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks in combination with LENVIMA 20 mg orally once daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for KEYTRUDA, up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Refer to the LENVIMA prescribing information for recommended dosing information, as appropriate.
<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<strong>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</strong>
<strong>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</strong>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)</b>
<i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis</i>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib</i>
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%).

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.
<b>Adverse Reactions</b>
In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permane",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/merck.jpg,Regulatory,Merck|Eisai,Keytruda|pembrolizumab|Lenvima|lenvatinib,Endometrial Carcinoma|Regulatory|approval|FDA|Project Orbis|receives,publish,18-9-2019,2,,,,,,,,,,

Basel, 19 September 2019 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced its renewed support of the Phelophepa primary healthcare trains in South Africa as the main external sponsor to mark this milestone 25th anniversary.
The Phelophepa trains offer free, mobile, primary healthcare clinics that travel to rural areas of South Africa, where there is just one doctor for every 5,000 patients. Phelophepa (pronounced pay-lo-pe-pa) means ""good, clean health"" and is owned and operated by Transnet, with Roche being Phelophepa’s main external sponsor since it began in 1994.
“We are very proud that we have helped to provide important primary healthcare services including diagnostics, treatments and education to rural communities in South Africa for 25 years,” says Roche CEO Severin Schwan. “We look forward to our continued partnership with Transnet in support of Phelophepa for many years to come.”
Starting as a three-car train, the service was expanded to two 19-coach trains in 2012. The two trains (Phelophepa I and Phelophepa II) are fitted with diagnostic tools and offer diabetes and cancer screenings, such as breast exams, pap smears and prostate checks. There are six clinics onboard including an eye clinic, providing vision tests, cataract screenings, and glasses; a dental clinic, providing dental exams, x-rays, and teeth cleanings; and a psychology clinic, providing individual counselling and group workshops to help people cope with issues such as stress and depression.
In addition, Phelophepa runs an extensive health education programme. This includes basic health education for the local schools, HIV/AIDS and cancer awareness programmes for the surrounding communities, and primary healthcare training for student doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. Phelophepa employees over 40 permanent staff, who live and work on the trains nine months of the year, hires temporary staff from the communities where it stops along its route, and works with thousands of volunteers to deliver this broad range of primary healthcare services.
Since the journey first started 25 years ago, the trains have touched the lives of over 14 million people, providing essential primary healthcare services including health screenings and medicines to millions of South Africans. Phelophepa has received the United Nations Public Service Award for its excellence in public service delivery.

<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><em>Early combination treatment strategy with vildagliptin (Galvus®) and metformin was superior to standard of care in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients[1],[2]</em></li>
 	<li><em>The landmark VERIFY study is the first to investigate the long-term clinical benefits of this early combination strategy in type 2 diabetes (T2DM)[1]</em></li>
 	<li><em>Novartis is committed to optimizing patient management of T2DM to achieve better glycemic control and favorable long-term clinical outcomes </em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Basel, September 18, 2019</strong> — Novartis today announced the key results from the Phase IV clinical study VERIFY evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of early combination treatment strategy with metformin plus vildagliptin (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitor) compared to the traditional stepwise approach with metformin as initial therapy followed by vildagliptin, added at the time of metformin failure[1],[2]<strong>. </strong>The key study findings were presented today at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting and published simultaneously in <em>The Lancet</em>.
VERIFY is a unique study designed to determine durability, over a pre-specified five-year follow-up of early use of combination therapy strategy with vildagliptin-metformin. The study was conducted across 254 centers in 34 countries and involved 2001 treatment-naïve diverse individuals recently diagnosed with T2DM (HbA1c between 6.5–7.5% [48–58 mmol/mol])[1],[2].
In the randomized, double-blind Phase IV study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01528254), early combination therapy of vildagliptin (50 mg, twice daily) and metformin (individually, 1000–2000 mg, daily) met the primary endpoint with a statistically significant 49% reduction in the relative risk for time to initial treatment failure (HbA1c &gt;= 7.0% twice, consecutively, 13 weeks apart), versus metformin alone (HR: 0.51, 95% CI [0.45, 0.58]; P&lt;0·0001)[1],[2].
The combination treatment strategy also showed a lower frequency of secondary failure when all patients were receiving combination therapy (HR: 0.74, 95% CI [0.63, 0.86]; P&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, patients treated with early combination had consecutively lower HbA1c levels (below 6.0%, 6.5% or 7.0%) for 5 years versus those receiving combination therapy only after metformin monotherapy failure[1].
“The initial findings from the VERIFY study uniquely demonstrate that early intervention with a combination therapy strategy provides greater and durable long-term benefits for patients. The currently recommended initial monotherapy approach with later treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes management is now shown to be an inferior strategy,” said Professor David Matthews, EASD President and Emeritus Professor of Diabetic Medicine, University of Oxford, UK.
The overall safety and tolerability profile was similar between the treatment approaches, with no unexpected or new safety findings reported[1].
“Despite type 2 diabetes having become an epidemic with growing mortality and morbidity rates, there is a distinct lack of optimized management strategies at diagnosis that can induce durability and slow down disease progression,” said Marcia Kayath, Global Head Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “These promising results from the VERIFY study have the potential to improve patient outcomes and the way in which we treat type 2 diabetes in the future”.
Additional pre-defined secondary analyses of the VERIFY study results are ongoing and data will be disclosed over the coming months at international and local medical congresses and in scientific journals.
<strong>About vildagliptin/metformin combination (Eucreas<sup>® </sup>/Galvusmet<sup>®</sup>)</strong>
The combination of these two anti-diabetic agents with complementary mechanisms of action provides superior efficacy and allows patients to reach glycemic targets without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain and other CV risk factors[3]. Vildagliptin-metformin combination was the first single-pill dual therapy of a DPP-4 inhibitor with metformin approved in Japan and Europe[4]. The vildagliptin and metformin dual therapy is used when the patient’s T2DM is insufficiently controlled by metformin monotherapy[5].
<strong>About</strong><strong> vildagliptin (Galvus<sup>®</sup>)</strong>
Vildagliptin is approved as an oral treatment for adults with T2DM in more than 120 countries, including the EU, Japan, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Vildagliptin is approved for use as monotherapy, dual therapy in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea (SU) or a thiazolidinedione, as a triple oral therapy in combination with a SU and metformin or as an add-on to insulin (with or without metformin)[4],[5],[6].
Vildagliptin is a selective and potent DPP-4 inhibitor that acts by preventing the usually rapid degradation of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which in turn, enhances the alpha- and ß-cell sensitivity to glucose and inhibits glucagon secretion, thereby improving glycemic control in T2DM[7],[8],[9],[10]. Vildagliptin has been widely studied in randomized clinical trials but it also has an extensive pool of evidence in real world settings within diverse patient populations across the disease continuum[11].
<strong>About metformin</strong>
Metformin hydrochloride is widely-used and is the recommended first-line therapy in patients with newly-diagnosed T2DM either immediately after diagnosis, or in those not able to achieve glycemic targets despite diet and other lifestyle interventions[12].
Despite its discovery already in 1922, the exact mode of action for metformin is not yet known. However, its effect in management of diabetes is through reduction of glucose output in the liver and secondarily, through increase of glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues. However, recent data suggests that some clinical activity may also arise from the synthesis and stimulation of intestinal release of incretin hormones[12],[13].
<strong>About VERIFY study[1],[2]</strong>
The VERIFY study is a five-year, multi-center, randomized, double-blind Phase IV trial designed to assess the durability of glycemic control of a combination regimen strategy with vildagliptin and metformin compared with standard-of-care monotherapy approach with metformin initiated in treatment-naïve, diverse patients with recently diagnosed T2DM (HbA1c between 6.5-7.5% [48–58 mmol/mol]).
The study involved 2001 patients prescribed with stable dose of metformin (1000–2000 mg daily) 4 weeks prior to or during the trial and randomized (1:1) to receive additional vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily or placebo. Dose adjustment of metformin in both treatment arms was permitted during the first 4 weeks in the trial, to allow adjustment to a dose of up to 2000 mg/day or the maximum tolerable dose of at least 1000 mg/day post-randomization. If the initial treatment strategy failed to maintain an HbA1c level &lt;7.0%, participants in the metformin monotherapy group were administered vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily in place of the placebo.
The primary endpoint was time to confirmed initial treatment failure, defined as HbA1c &gt;=7% at two consecutive scheduled visits, 13 weeks apart. Secondary endpoints included rate of loss of glycemic control, HbA1c development over time, rate of loss in glycemic control in fasting plasma glucose, rate of loss of beta cell function from baseline to end of study, rate of change in insulin sensitivity from baseline to end of study, and rate of adverse events. Exploratory endpoints include adjudication of cardiovascular events and changes in glucose homeostasis (HOMA).
<strong>About T2DM</strong>
Diabetes mellitus is a condition characterized by increasing hyperglycemia due to defects in both insulin production and insulin sensitivity[14]. The prevalence of diabetes has quadrupled in the past three decades with approximately 1 in 11 adults now having the disease worldwide, of these approximately 90% have T2DM[15]. Additionally, factors such as glucose intolerance (pre-diabetes), underdiagnosed and/or delayed diagnosis of T2DM are causing a rapid increase in disease burden. This is especially seen in developing countries, which contributes to the continuously growing burden of diabetes. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that there is a new diagnosis every 6 seconds somewhere in the world[16].
After diagnosis, the majority of patients are unable to achieve and maintain the recommended glycemic control targets as defined by the guidelines[17].  This universal lack of achievement of glycemic control is partly attributed to the current treatment paradigm involving sequential monotherapy, frequent early treatment failure and delayed therapy intensification leading to prolonged periods of sustained hyperglycemia. Combatting inertia in treatment intensification could also include a strategy of earlier and more comprehensive introduction combination therapy approach[11],[18].

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 18, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xxhu7ePME4kEqCrXX99v0dChvftuYbJkWj74-0x5BmnNyH0bYHmeUgJ-xbc2FkdQV3MqUDDuDD3DKCswKx7ygA=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>Biogen Inc.</u></a> (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced updates to the SPINRAZA (nusinersen) clinical development program including the initiation of a new global clinical trial, DEVOTE. The DEVOTE study will evaluate if a higher dose of SPINRAZA can provide even greater efficacy in the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) across a broad patient population. In addition, new data further demonstrating the safety and efficacy of treatment with SPINRAZA in individuals with later-onset SMA will be featured in a podium presentation at the 13<sup>th</sup>Congress of the European Paediatric Neurology Society (EPNS) in Athens (September 17-21).
A foundation of care in SMA, SPINRAZA is the only treatment approved for infants, children and adults with evidence across a broad range of patients and real-world experience treating more than 8,400 patients of all ages in over 40 countries.<sup>1</sup> These clinical program updates will add to the largest and longest clinical data set available to date in SMA.
<strong>New study, DEVOTE, to evaluate if SPINRAZA can offer even greater efficacy in treating SMA  </strong>
Building on the demonstrated long-term safety profile and proven efficacy of SPINRAZA in a broad range of patients, the DEVOTE trial will examine the potential for even greater efficacy, as well as the safety and tolerability of SPINRAZA, when administered at a higher dose. The trial is a Phase 2/3 randomized, controlled dose-escalating study that will be conducted at 50 sites around the world with a projected enrollment of 126 individuals with SMA of all ages, including adults.
“SPINRAZA has fundamentally changed the natural history of SMA,” said Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Biogen. “Antisense oligonucleotides directly intervene at the origin of disease providing a transformative therapeutic option. SPINRAZA’s highly targeted approach and well-characterized safety profile allows us to continue exploring ways to potentially address the remaining medical needs in the SMA community.”
The three-part trial will include an open-label safety evaluation and a pivotal, double-blind, active control randomized treatment period followed by an open-label treatment period. After the safety evaluation, the trial will compare two loading doses of 50 milligrams (mg) 15 days apart followed by a maintenance dose of 28 mg every four months with the current U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved administration of SPINRAZA, which is four loading doses with 12 mg maintenance doses every four months. The third part of the trial will be an open-label evaluation to determine how to safely and efficiently transition patients from the currently approved dose of SPINRAZA to the higher dose being tested in the study.
More information on the trial (NCT04089566) is available at <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5FNg7bVqTkd0jTvhYmn4nCnj1VNKo8hhw_tCPnc9NiKvkRH24N8ro8UpdN2Dk-iG33qoJ8GEX94cYHx_oAWdL_GxdbgyDdiBLoHTfeeq_-Ty-vv6sV_Wxe0xZANDeb8W"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>clinicaltrials.gov</u></a>.
<strong>Data to be presented at EPNS demonstrate improvements or stabilization in motor function following longer-term treatment</strong>
An integrated analysis from SHINE (<a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wEEK0AAbt1AV8W36R6-wJVX-sryrXRl3Zm6PVDWdLa9A2VWnquCiwuiJVtOYXgEZaMXis4RFGyNMFQO_a_j8wWVYs1_F-S-rDpPEyHFSJhw="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">NCT02594124</a>), an open-label extension study for patients with SMA who participated in prior SPINRAZA studies, found that children with later-onset SMA (Type 2 or Type 3) experienced improvements or stabilization in one or more measures of motor function for up to nearly six years, in contrast to the expected decline observed in natural history cohorts. SHINE is following 24 patients aged 2-15 at treatment initiation (SMA Type 2; n=10 and Type 3; n=14) who transitioned from the CS2/CS12 studies, which previously showed that individuals with later-onset SMA who were treated with SPINRAZA demonstrated improvements in motor function and disease stabilization over approximately three years, that were not observed in natural history cohorts.<sup>2</sup>  Patients in the study were between 7 and 21 years old at the last study visit.
Motor function measures in this analysis of the SHINE study included the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale–Expanded (HFMSE), Upper Limb Module (ULM), and Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). No participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events, and no new safety concerns were identified during the nearly six-year follow-up period.
“These findings are important in understanding the need for long-term treatment in individuals with SMA,” said Basil Darras, M.D., lead study author, director of the Neuromuscular Center and Spinal Muscular Atrophy Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. “These data reinforce the long-term safety and durability of SPINRAZA to improve or stabilize motor function in individuals with later-onset SMA.”
<strong>About SPINRAZA<sup>® </sup>(nusinersen)<sup>3-4</sup></strong>
SPINRAZA is the first therapy approved to treat infants, children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and is available in more than 40 countries. As of June 30, 2019, more than 8,400 individuals have been treated with SPINRAZA for up to nearly six years, based on patients across the post-marketing setting, Expanded Access Program (EAP) and clinical trial participants. SPINRAZA is the only SMA treatment to combine unsurpassed real-world experience and the highest level of clinical evidence across a broad spectrum of patient populations.
SMA is a rare, genetic, neuromuscular disease that is characterized by a loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe, progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. Approximately one in 10,000 live births have a diagnosis of SMA, and people of all ages are impacted by the disease. It is a leading genetic cause of infant mortality.
SPINRAZA, a foundation of care in SMA, is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to target a root cause of SMA by increasing the amount of full-length survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical to maintaining motor neurons. It is administered by intrathecal injection into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord where motor neurons reside to deliver the treatment where the disease starts.
SPINRAZA currently maintains the largest clinical data set in SMA based on data from over 300 patients across a broad range of SMA populations demonstrating a favorable benefit:risk profile. SPINRAZA was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled studies (ENDEAR and CHERISH) in infantile and later-onset SMA patients and supported by open-label studies in pre-symptomatic infants (NURTURE) and individuals who were treated into adulthood with later-onset SMA (CS2/CS12). The most common adverse events observed were respiratory infection, fever, constipation, headache, vomiting and back pain. Meningitis and hydrocephalus have been observed in the post-marketing setting. Renal toxicity and coagulation abnormalities, including acute severe low platelet counts, have been observed after administration of some ASOs. Laboratory tests can monitor for these signs.
Biogen licensed the global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPINRAZA from Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: IONS), a leader in antisense therapeutics. Biogen and Ionis conducted an innovative clinical development program that moved SPINRAZA from its first dose in humans in 2011 to its first regulatory approval in five years.

<p class=""lead-text-medium"">Pretomanid, developed by the non-profit TB Alliance, has received U.S. approval in combination regimen with bedaquiline and linezolid for people with XDR-TB or treatment-intolerant/non-responsive MDR-TB</p>
August 14, 2019
NEW YORK (August 14, 2019)—Pretomanid, a novel compound developed by the non-profit organization TB Alliance, was approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) today for treating some of the most drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (TB).<sup>1</sup> The new drug was approved under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD pathway) as part of a three-drug, six-month, all-oral regimen for the treatment of people with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) who are treatment-intolerant or non-responsive (collectively “highly drug-resistant TB”).<sup>1,2</sup>
The LPAD pathway was established by FDA as a tool to encourage further development of antibacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious, life-threatening infections that affect a limited population of patients with unmet needs.
“FDA approval of this treatment represents a victory for the people suffering from these highly drug-resistant forms of the world’s deadliest infectious disease,” said Mel Spigelman, MD, president and CEO of TB Alliance. “The associated novel regimen will hopefully provide a shorter, more easily manageable and highly efficacious treatment for those in need.”
The three-drug regimen consisting of bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid – collectively referred to as the BPaL regimen – was studied in the pivotal Nix-TB trial across three sites in South Africa. The trial enrolled 109 people with XDR-TB as well as treatment-intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB.<sup>2</sup>
Nix-TB data have demonstrated a successful outcome in 95 of the first 107 patients after six months of treatment with BPaL and six months of post-treatment follow-up.<sup>2</sup> For two patients, treatment was extended to nine months. The new drug application contains data on 1,168 people who have received pretomanid in 19 clinical trials that have evaluated the drug’s safety and efficacy.<sup>2</sup> Pretomanid has been clinically studied in 14 countries.
TB, in all forms, must be treated with a combination of drugs; the most drug-sensitive forms of TB require six months of treatment using four anti-TB drugs.<sup>3</sup> Treatment of XDR-TB or treatment-intolerant/non-responsive MDR-TB has historically been lengthy and complex; most XDR-TB patients currently take a combination of as many as eight antibiotics, some involving daily injections, for 18 months or longer.<sup>3,4</sup> Prior to recent introduction of new drugs for drug-resistant TB, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported estimates for treatment success rates of XDR-TB therapy at approximately 34 percent and about 55 percent for MDR-TB therapy.<sup>4</sup>
“Until very recently, people infected with highly drug-resistant TB had poor treatment options and a poor prognosis,” said Dr. Francesca Conradie, principal investigator of the Nix-TB trial. “This new regimen provides hope with 9 out of 10 patients achieving culture negative status at 6 months post-treatment  with this short, all-oral regimen.""
Pretomanid is a new chemical entity and a member of a class of compounds known as nitroimidazooxazines. TB Alliance acquired the developmental rights to the compound in 2002. It has been developed as an oral tablet formulation for the treatment of TB in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, two other anti-TB agents, and is now indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.<sup>1 </sup>Adverse reactions reported during the Nix-TB trial of the BPaL regimen include hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression, as well as peripheral and optic neuropathy.<sup>1</sup> Please see additional safety information in the Important Safety Information below and in the accompanying pretomanid Full Prescribing Information.
Pretomanid is only the third new anti-TB drug approved for use by FDA in more than 40 years, as well as the first to be developed and registered by a not-for-profit organization.<sup>5,6</sup> Pretomanid was granted Priority Review, Qualified Infectious Disease Product, and Orphan Drug status. As a product development partnership, TB Alliance has collaborated with and received significant support from numerous governments, academia, philanthropic institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations and other partners over the course of pretomanid’s development.
Pretomanid is expected to be available in the United States by the end of this year. In addition to the U.S. FDA, TB Alliance has submitted pretomanid as part of the BPaL regimen for review by the European Medicines Agency and has provided data to the World Health Organization for consideration of inclusion in treatment guidelines for highly drug-resistant TB.

WAKIX represents the first and only non-scheduled treatment approved for patients with narcolepsy in the U.S.
<span class=""xn-location"">PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Aug. 15, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Harmony Biosciences, LLC (Harmony) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved WAKIX® (pitolisant) for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult patients with narcolepsy. WAKIX is the first and only treatment approved for patients with narcolepsy that is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">
We are extremely proud to bring WAKIX to market for those living with narcolepsy, a chronic, debilitating, rare neurologic disorder,"" said Harmony's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, <span class=""xn-person"">John C. Jacobs</span>. ""At Harmony, we share a vision to develop novel treatment options for people living with rare diseases, with a focus on those that affect the central nervous system. The approval of WAKIX strengthens our commitment to making that vision a reality.""

</div>
<div class=""row"">
<div class=""col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"">
WAKIX, a first-in-class medication, is a selective histamine 3 (H3) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist that works through a novel mechanism of action to increase the synthesis and release of histamine, a wake-promoting neurotransmitter in the brain. WAKIX is administered orally once daily in the morning upon wakening.
""The approval of WAKIX provides healthcare professionals managing people living with narcolepsy a new and important treatment option for their patients,"" said Harmony's Chief Medical Officer, <span class=""xn-person"">Jeffrey Dayno</span>, M.D. ""Additionally, WAKIX is the only non-scheduled treatment option approved for adult patients with narcolepsy, and it offers an important benefit/risk profile to address the unmet medical need that exists in people living with narcolepsy.""
The efficacy of WAKIX for the treatment of EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy was evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (HARMONY 1 and HARMONY 1bis). These studies included a total of 261 patients who were randomized to receive WAKIX, placebo, or active control; these patients had a median age of 37 (HARMONY 1) and 40 (HARMONY 1bis). Treatment duration was eight weeks, with a three-week dose titration phase followed by a 5-week stable dose phase; 75% to 80% of the patients in these studies had a history of cataplexy. In both of these studies, WAKIX demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in EDS as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score. In the placebo-controlled trials conducted in patients with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, the most common adverse reactions (occurring in =5% of patients and at twice the rate of placebo) with the use of WAKIX were insomnia (6%), nausea (6%), and anxiety (5%).
WAKIX will be commercially available to healthcare professionals and appropriate patients in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2019.
<b>About WAKIX (pitolisant)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>WAKIX is a first-in-class medication approved for use in the U.S. for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy. It was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of narcolepsy in 2010. WAKIX is a selective histamine 3 (H3) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist. The mechanism of action of WAKIX is unclear; however, its efficacy could be mediated through its activity at H3 receptors, thereby increasing the synthesis and release of histamine, a wake promoting neurotransmitter. WAKIX was designed and developed by Bioprojet Societe Civile de Recherche (Bioprojet), who has marketed the product in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> since its approval by the European Medicines Agency in 2016. Harmony has an exclusive license from Bioprojet to develop, manufacture and commercialize pitolisant in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>.
<b>Indication and </b><b>Usage</b>
WAKIX<sup>®</sup> (pitolisant) is approved for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult patients with narcolepsy.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>Do not use WAKIX if you have severe liver disease.</b>
<b>Tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you have heart rhythm irregularities, were born with a heart condition, or the levels of electrolytes in your blood are too high or too low.</b> WAKIX has an effect on the electrical activity of the heart known as QT/QTc prolongation. Medicines with this effect can lead to disturbances in heart rhythm, which are more likely in patients with risk factors such as certain heart conditions, or when taken in combination with other interacting medicines<i>. </i>Tell your healthcare provider about all the other medicines you take.
The risk of QT prolongation may be greater in patients with liver or kidney disease. WAKIX is not recommended in patients with end stage kidney disease.
<b>The most common side effects seen with WAKIX</b> were insomnia, nausea and anxiety. Other side effects included headache, upper respiratory infection, musculoskeletal pain, heart rate increased, and decreased appetite. These are not all the possible side effects of WAKIX. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.
<b>Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take or plan to take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines.</b> Some medicines can increase the amount of WAKIX that gets into your blood and some medicines can decrease the amount of WAKIX that gets into your blood. The dosage of WAKIX may need to be adjusted if you are taking these medicines.
WAKIX can also decrease the effectiveness of some medicines, including hormonal birth control methods. You should use an alternative non-hormonal birth control method during treatment with WAKIX and for at least 21 days after discontinuation of treatment.
<b>Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.</b> There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women who are exposed to WAKIX during pregnancy. You are encouraged to enroll in the WAKIX pregnancy registry if you become pregnant while taking WAKIX. To enroll or obtain information from the registry, call 1-800-833-7460.
<b>The safety and effectiveness of WAKIX have not been established in patients less than 18 years of age.</b>

<b>About Narcolepsy<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Narcolepsy is a rare, chronic, debilitating neurologic disorder of sleep-wake state instability that impacts up to 200,000 Americans and is primarily characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy – its two cardinal symptoms – along with other manifestations of REM sleep dysregulation, which intrude into wakefulness. EDS is the inability to stay awake and alert during the day and is the symptom that is present in all people living with narcolepsy. In most patients, narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin, a neuropeptide in the brain that supports sleep-wake state stability. This disorder affects men and women equally, with typical symptom onset in adolescence or young adulthood; however, it can take up to a decade to be properly diagnosed.

<span class=""xn-location"">BARCELONA, Spain</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 19, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- According to new data from the CONCLUDE head-to-head trial, Tresiba<sup>®</sup> (insulin degludec) showed an overall lower risk of hypoglycaemia, also known as a hypo or low blood sugar, at a significantly lower HbA<sub>1c</sub>, compared with insulin glargine U300 in adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on basal insulin with or without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs). Results from the CONCLUDE trial were presented today at the 55<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD 2019) in <span class=""xn-location"">Barcelona, Spain</span>.<sup>1</sup>
The primary endpoint, the rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycaemia in the maintenance period of 36 weeks which was tested for superiority, was numerically lower but not statistically significant versus insulin glargine U300. The rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycaemia was statistically significantly lower in favour of Tresiba<sup>®</sup> during the total treatment period of up to 88 weeks.<sup>1</sup>
In this head-to-head trial, Tresiba<sup>®</sup> significantly reduced the rate of severe hypoglycaemia by 80% and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia by 37% when compared with insulin glargine U300 during the maintenance period, and by 62% and 43% respectively in the total treatment period when compared with insulin glargine U300.<sup>1</sup>
""Severe hypoglycaemia can be very worrying and potentially dangerous for people with diabetes and is important to consider as part of long-term diabetes care,"" said Dr <span class=""xn-person"">Athena Philis-Tsimikas</span>, CONCLUDE lead investigator and corporate vice president, Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute. ""The results of this trial reinforce the safety profile of Tresiba<sup>®</sup> as it demonstrated a significant reduction in severe hypoglycaemia<b> </b>compared to insulin glargine U300 alongside effective blood glucose control.""
The proportion of participants experiencing hypoglycaemia was also significantly lower in favour of Tresiba<sup>®</sup> during both the maintenance and total treatment periods for all hypoglycaemia endpoints. These reductions in rates and proportions of patients experiencing hypoglycaemia with Tresiba<sup>®</sup> were seen alongside significant reductions from baseline in HbA<sub>1c </sub>(estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.1%) and fasting plasma glucose (ETD -0.62 mmol/L). Furthermore, Tresiba<sup>®</sup> showed a 12% lower insulin dose requirement with an end-of-trial mean daily insulin dose of 67U, compared with 73U for insulin glargine U300.<sup>1</sup>
""We are delighted that the findings of the CONCLUDE trial support what we have seen previously across the Tresiba<sup>®</sup>clinical development programme,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen</span>, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. ""These findings offer further confidence that Tresiba<sup>®</sup> can help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their risk of hypoglycaemia, without having to compromise their treatment goals.""
<b>About the CONCLUDE trial</b>
The CONCLUDE clinical trial (NCT03078478) was a randomised, open-label, treat-to-target, multinational trial comparing the risk of hypoglycaemia with Tresiba<sup>®</sup> vs insulin glargine U300 in 1,609 adults with type 2 diabetes. Both treatments were administered once daily, with or without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), in insulin-experienced participants. Endpoints were assessed during a 36-week maintenance period and a total treatment period of up to 88 weeks.<sup>1</sup>
The primary endpoint was the overall number of severe (defined as an event requiring third party assistance) or blood glucose confirmed (&lt;3.1 mmol/L) symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes during the maintenance period. Secondary hypoglycaemia endpoints included the number of nocturnal symptomatic and the number of severe hypoglycaemic events during the maintenance period, as well as basal insulin dose (U) at end of treatment.

Hypoglycaemia is when blood sugar levels are too low and cannot provide the body's organs with the energy they need. Hypoglycaemia can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, trembling, sweating, increased heart rate, difficulty with concentration and speech, and in severe cases it can lead to seizures, coma or even death.<sup>2-5</sup>
<b>About Tresiba<sup>®</sup></b>
Tresiba<sup>®</sup> (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect.<sup>6,7</sup> Tresiba<sup>®</sup> led to an effective reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in clinical trials and showed a lower risk of hypoglycaemia in studies compared to insulin glargine U100, in particular in type 2 diabetes. It also provides a lower day-to-day variability in glucose lowering effect versus insulin glargine U100 and insulin glargine U300.<sup>8,9</sup> Tresiba<sup>®</sup>received its first regulatory approval in <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2012</span> and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It is commercially available in more than 61 countries.

<ul>
 	<li><i>Provincial reimbursement provides public access to treatment that may delay the progression of advanced breast cancer</i></li>
</ul>
<span class=""xn-location"">DORVAL, QUEBEC</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">September 19, 2019</span> /CNW/ - Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (Novartis) is pleased to announce that <span class=""xn-location"">Quebec</span> will now reimburse KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b> (ribociclib) for eligible patients in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) under the province's public drug program for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women living with hormone receptor (HR)<b>-</b>positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.<sup>1</sup>
For women living with metastatic breast cancer, also known as Stage IV breast cancer, the cancer has spread beyond the breast to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bones or brain.<sup>2</sup> It may happen before or after treatment, or it may develop from reoccurring breast cancer.<sup>3</sup> Although there have been advancements in early detection and treatment, there is still no cure for metastatic breast cancer.<sup>4 </sup>While overall 5-year survival rates for female breast cancer are relatively high, at 87%, women with advanced breast cancer face a 22% survival rate over 5 years.<sup>5</sup>
""The public reimbursement of KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b> for metastatic breast cancer in <span class=""xn-location"">Quebec</span> represents a promising milestone for women living with metastatic breast cancer,"" said Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Nathaniel Bouganim</span>, Medical Oncologist, <span class=""xn-org"">McGill University</span> Health Centre. ""Now, patients will have access to more options to potentially help slow disease progression.""
""We are thrilled to see the province of <span class=""xn-location"">Quebec</span> grant access to therapeutic options that help improve the quality of life of women living with metastatic breast cancer,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Nathalie Tremblay</span>, Chief Executive Officer, Quebec Breast Cancer Foundation.
KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b> belongs to a family of medications called protein kinase inhibitors. These medications work by stopping cancer cells from dividing and growing. KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b> received Health Canada approval for use with letrozole on <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2, 2018</span>, for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer as first-line endocrine-based therapy based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. When given together with letrozole, KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b> may help slow down the growth and spread of breast cancer cells.<sup>6</sup>
""Novartis is committed to bringing innovative therapies that can improve the quality of life for those impacted by breast cancer,"" said Daniel Hébert, Country Medical Head Oncology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. ""The reimbursement of KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b> is a testament to the ongoing need for public access to this treatment, and we continue to work collaboratively with the remaining provinces and territories to ensure patients from across <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> with metastatic breast cancer and their healthcare providers have public access to KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b>.""
<b>About KISQALI</b><b><sup>®</sup></b> <b>(ribociclib)<br class=""dnr"" /></b>KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b> is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a class of drugs that help slow the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins, when over-activated, can enable cancer cells to grow and divide too quickly. Targeting CDK4/6 may play a role in ensuring that cancer cells do not continue to replicate uncontrollably. KISQALI<b><sup>®</sup></b> was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.
<b>About Novartis in Advanced Breast Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Novartis tackles breast cancer with advanced science, collaboration and a passion for transforming patient care. We've taken a bold approach to our research by including patient populations often neglected in clinical trials, identifying new pathways or mutations that may play a role in disease progression and developing therapies that not only maintain, but also improve, quality of life for patients. Our priority over the past 30 years and today is to deliver treatments proven to improve and extend lives for those diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.

 	<li><strong>Roche is dedicated to helping save patients’ lives by delivering state-of-the-art solutions to aid in the protection of the global blood supply from infectious diseases</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>If undetected, Babesia infection can be fatal in patients receiving blood transfusions from infected donors</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>The availability of the new whole blood collection tube simplifies Babesia sample preparation, enabling more efficient laboratory processing and future menu expansion</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the cobas Babesia test for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems for individual blood donation testing. This is Roche’s first commercially available whole blood test to screen donations and follows May 2019 FDA-updated industry guidance recommending screening and testing for Babesia, to reduce the risk of transmitting the parasite through transfusions.<sup>1</sup>
cobas Babesia detects parasites that live in red blood cells. This test is an important advancement because the Babesia parasite cannot be detected in traditional plasma or serum samples. The test is able to detect the four common species of Babesia and employs the new whole blood collection tube, which simplifies Babesia sample preparation by consolidating steps within the tube itself to provide an efficient solution for testing laboratories.
In most cases, the Babesia parasite is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick; however, the parasite can also be transmitted through blood transfusions or from mother to foetus during pregnancy. The parasite infects and destroys red blood cells which can lead to anaemia and related life-threatening complications, particularly in the elderly or otherwise immunocompromised patients. In healthy people, the infection can be asymptomatic, or cause a range of mild flu-like symptoms.
“We are dedicated to helping save patients’ lives by providing advanced solutions to enable the protection of the global blood supply from infectious diseases. With the approval of Roche’s first whole blood test used in blood screening we can help healthcare professionals further diminish potential risks of infection from transfused blood products,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “In addition, we hope to help customers improve their lab efficiency by simplifying sample prep while ensuring maximum detection of infectious pathogens in the blood and the safety of the blood supply for the patients we serve.”
The Roche Blood Safety Solutions offering now provides the most comprehensive testing solution for blood donor screening utilising the fully automated cobas 6800/8800 System. This novel test approval follows the successful launch of the cobas Zika test, which was the first Zika test available for donor screening in the U.S. This new Babesia test expands the menu of tests available for the cobas 6800/8800 Systems for use in U.S. donor screening laboratories. This menu includes cobas MPX, cobas WNV and cobas Zika. In addition, the menu includes cobas DPX<sup>2</sup>, which is used in testing labs that support plasma fractionators.
<h3>About the cobas Babesia test for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems</h3>
The cobas Babesia test for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems is a qualitative in vitro nucleic acid screening test for the direct detection of Babesia DNA and RNA in whole blood specimens from individual human blood donors. It detects the four species of Babesia known to cause disease in humans and can be performed with the other routine blood donor screening tests.
The fully automated cobas 6800/8800 Systems offer the fastest time to results with the highest throughput and the longest walk-away time available among automated molecular platforms, providing donor screening laboratories with improved operating efficiency and the flexibility to adapt to changing testing demands. The cobas Babesia test is the latest addition to Roche’s assay menu for donor screening laboratories — which includes cobas MPX, cobas DPX, cobas HEV, cobas WNV, cobas CHIKV/DENV and cobas Zika (US-IVD) — all of which are run on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems. Not all assays are available in all markets.
Since 2014, the cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 Systems have established the new standard for routine molecular testing by delivering fully integrated, automated solutions that serve the areas of donor screening, infectious disease, sexual health, transplant, respiratory and antimicrobial stewardship.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","- New treatment option with a new pharmacological profile for patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in Japan
- Phase III clinical trial in Japan with 493 adults with major depressive disorder show that the vortioxetine groups demonstrated statistically significant antidepressant efficacy compared to the placebo group
- There are approximately three million patients with the disease in Japan, affecting 2.5% of the population*
Osaka, Japan and Valby, Denmark, September 20 2019 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited  (TSE: 4502/NYSE: TAK)  (“Takeda”) and H. Lundbeck A/S (“Lundbeck”) jointly announced today that the MHLW of Japan approved Trintellix® (vortioxetine) for the treatment of depression and depressed state. Vortioxetine is already approved in 83 countries, including US, Europe, Canada, Chile, China, Mexico, Argentina, South Korea, Turkey, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Africa
The NDA filing submitted to the MHLW in September 2018 included data from a pivotal phase III trial (NCT02389816), which demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall symptoms of depression in adults as compared to placebo. The regulatory submission also featured data from three other pivotal studies conducted globally (NCT01255787) and in Japan (NCT01355081, NCT01395147).
This study was conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 493 adult patients in Japan with recurrent depression. Patients were randomly assigned to a vortioxetine 10mg, 20mg or placebo group. The primary endpoint was change in total score from baseline (at the onset of double blinding) on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to week 8 of administration compared to placebo. The study demonstrated positive results of vortioxetine including the primary endpoint as compared to placebo for the treatment of MDD in adults.
“MDD remains a serious and complicated disease and I firmly believe that Trintellix will be an important new treatment option for patients in Japan, and health care professionals” said Naoyoshi Hirota, head of Takeda Development Center Japan.
“I am pleased that individuals suffering from depression in Japan now also have access to this important treatment option. Today’s approval of Trintellix, furthermore, represents a new chapter in Lundbeck’s commercial expansion as we will have our own commercial organization behind the launch of Trintellix in Japan in collaboration with our partner Takeda“  said Jacob Tolstrup, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations at Lundbeck.
In 2007 Lundbeck formed an agreement with Takeda on the co-development and potential co-commercialization in Japan of Lundbeck’s vortioxetine. As communicated in September 2018, Takeda and Lundbeck will co-commercialize Trintellix® in Japan following this approval.
About Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
MDD is a complex mental health illness that affects approximately 160 million people globally*. MDD is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. MDD may trigger emotional, cognitive and physical symptoms, which include depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, significant weight loss or gain or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, and recurrent suicidal ideation.
About vortioxetine
Vortioxetine has functions of an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and  a regulatory action on serotonin receptor (an antagonist at serotonin 3, 7, and 1D receptors, a partial agonist at serotonin 1B receptors and an agonist at serotonin 1A receptors). It is believed to regulate neurotransmission through several systems including the serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine and histamine. It is considered to be  the first and only compound with this combination of pharmacological activity.
Vortioxetine was invented by Lundbeck researchers in Copenhagen, Denmark. Takeda collaborating with Lundbeck has conducted  clinical trials with vortioxetine in Japan.
The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vortioxetine (Trintellix®) on 30 September 2013 for the treatment of MDD in adults. Vortioxetine is furthermore approved in 83 countries (including Europe, Canada, Chile, China, Mexico, Argentina, South Korea, Turkey, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Africa). Outside North America, vortioxetine is sold as Brintellix®.

<div class=""xn-content"">
INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 20, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today that the European Medicines Agency'sCommittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending an update to the Trulicity® (dulaglutide) label and indication statement. The committee agreed the label should include results from the REWIND cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial, which achieved a significant 12 percent risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
The CHMP has recommended updating the Trulicity® indication to reflect both glycemic control and the impact on cardiovascular events as fundamental considerations in a treatment for people with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, the updated label will reflect the consistent MACE risk reduction with Trulicity across major demographic and disease subgroups.
""Millions of people with diabetes are at a higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease. The REWIND trial found that Trulicity significantly reduced major cardiovascular events and had a consistent effect in people with and without established cardiovascular disease,"" said Dawn Brooks, Ph.D., global development leader, Trulicity, Lilly. ""We are pleased with this opinion recognizing the importance of these data, which demonstrate the benefits of Trulicity in a broad range of people with type 2 diabetes.""
REWIND is the longest CV outcomes trial in the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) class (median follow-up of 5.4 years) and consisted primarily of people without established CV disease. The study had a more balanced ratio of women (46.3 percent) to men (53.7 percent) and one of the lowest median baseline A1Cs of any diabetes CV outcome trial to date (7.2 percent).
This decision is now referred for final action to the European Commission, which grants approval in the European Union.
<b>About the REWIND Study
</b>REWIND (Researching cardiovascular Events with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the effect of Trulicity 1.5 mg, a weekly GLP-1 RA, compared to placebo, both added to standard of care (according to local standard of care guidelines), on CV events in adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of MACE (the composite of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke). Secondary endpoints included each component of the primary composite endpoint, a composite clinical microvascular endpoint comprising retinal or renal disease, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure requiring hospitalization or an urgent heart failure visit, and all-cause mortality. The 9,901 participants from 24 countries had a mean duration of diabetes of 10.5 years and a median baseline HbA1c of 7.2 percent. While all participants had CV risk factors, only 31 percent of the study participants had established CV disease. Prior (or established) CV disease in REWIND was defined as prior myocardial infarction, prior ischemic stroke, prior unstable angina, prior revascularization (coronary, carotid, or peripheral), prior hospitalization for ischemia-related events (unstable angina or myocardial ischemia on imaging, or need for percutaneous coronary intervention), or prior documented myocardial ischemia.
The REWIND trial's international scope, high proportion of women, high proportion of people without established CV disease and inclusion of participants with a lower mean baseline HbA1c suggest that the findings will be directly relevant to the typical patient with type 2 diabetes seen in general practice throughout the world.
<b>Indication and Limitations of Use for Trulicity
</b>Trulicity is a once-weekly injectable prescription medicine to improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes (mellitus). It should be used along with diet and exercise.
Trulicity is not recommended as the first medication to treat diabetes. It has not been studied in people who have had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Trulicity should not be used by people with type 1 diabetes, people with diabetic ketoacidosis, or people with a history of severe gastrointestinal (GI) disease. It is not a substitute for insulin. It has not been studied in children under 18 years of age.

<span class=""xn-location"">TOKYO</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 20, 2019</span> /<a class=""ext"" href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: <span class=""xn-person"">Kenji Yasukawa</span>, Ph.D., ""Astellas"") and FibroGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: FGEN, Interim CEO: James A Schoeneck., ""FibroGen"") today announced that <span class=""xn-location"">Japan's</span> Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved Evrenzo<sup>®</sup> (generic name: roxadustat) for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in dialysis patients.
Roxadustat is a first-in-class orally administered inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl­ hydroxylase that corrects anemia by a mechanism of action that is different from that of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). As a HIF-PH inhibitor, roxadustat activates a response that occurs naturally when the body responds to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. The response activated by roxadustat involves the regulation of multiple, complementary processes to promote erythropoiesis and increase the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity.
""Evrenzo<sup>®</sup> is a valuable new treatment option for dialysis patients with CKD anemia,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Bernhardt G. Zeiher</span>, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Astellas. ""Astellas is committed to improving the health of people worldwide and expanding treatment options, especially within the dialysis community where there is high-unmet need. We are delighted to bring this important new treatment option to both patients suffering from, and healthcare professionals treating, this debilitating condition.""
CKD anemia can severely worsen the outcomes of kidney disease, increasing the rate of progression to renal failure<sup>1</sup> and the likelihood of cardiovascular complications.<sup>2</sup> It also significantly reduces patients' quality of life and their cognitive ability.<sup>3</sup> Reaching and maintaining target hemoglobin levels can present challenges and roxadustat provides an alternative therapeutic option.
""We appreciate the commitment and focus of our partner Astellas as we work together to bring a new therapy to CKD anemia patients on dialysis in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>,"" said K. Peony Yu, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, FibroGen. ""With this approval in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, NDA approval in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, and EU MAA and US NDA preparations underway, we are another step closer to our goal of addressing the significant unmet medical need of patients living with anemia of CKD, worldwide.""
The approval is based on four Phase 3 studies conducted in CKD anemia patients on dialysis in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>.<sup>4,5,6,7</sup> The studies demonstrated that roxadustat was effective at raising hemoglobin and that it was well-tolerated. This marks the first approval for roxadustat through the Astellas and FibroGen collaboration.

<b>About Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) </b><b>and Anemia</b>
CKD is a progressive loss of kidney function caused by damage to the kidneys resulting from conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or immune-regulated inflammatory conditions.<sup>8</sup> Worldwide, more than 1 in 10 people are living with CKD.<sup>9</sup> In <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, specifically, the prevalence of CKD has increased significantly over time.<sup>10</sup> Although CKD can occur at any age, it becomes more common in aging populations, and the prevalence is increasing. CKD is a critical worldwide healthcare issue that represents a large and growing unmet medical need.
Anemia is a common early complication of CKD<sup>11</sup>, affecting approximately 20% of patients with CKD.<sup>12</sup> It results from the failing kidneys' diminished ability to produce erythropoietin that stimulates red blood cell production from the bone marrow, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in dialysis and non-dialysis populations, increasing in both prevalence and severity as kidney disease worsens.<sup>13</sup>CKD anemia increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, worsens renal outcomes and negatively impacts patients' quality of life.<sup>14,15</sup> In addition, CKD can be both a cause and a consequence of cardiovascular disease and is now a critical worldwide healthcare issue that represents a large and growing unmet medical need.
<b>About Roxadustat</b>
In addition to receiving approval from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, roxadustat is approved for treatment of anemia associated with CKD in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">
INGELHEIM, Germany and NEWTON, Mass.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Boehringer Ingelheim and Inflammasome Therapeutics Inc. (Inflammasome) today announced they have entered into a co-development and license agreement to develop up to three therapies for patients with retinal diseases. By combining Inflammasome’s unique intravitreal (IVT) drug delivery technologies with Boehringer Ingelheim’s compounds from its retinal disease pipeline portfolio, Boehringer Ingelheim aims to develop novel therapies for retinal diseases.
In 2019 there were an estimated 82 million patients in the seven key countries (U.S., Japan, Germany, U.K., Spain, Italy, France) affected by one of the three major forms of retinal disease: Age related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and diabetic macular edema (DME). Globally, the prevalence rates of these and other retinal diseases are expected to increase over the next 10 years primarily due to aging populations and the global diabetes epidemic. Despite therapeutic advances in some disease areas during the past years, the real world results are poor, and there are no or only limited treatment options in many areas, resulting in an overall high unmet need. The collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and Inflammasome aims to address this challenge by using Inflammasome’s technology to deliver therapeutics in a biodegradable gel formulation into the eye.
“We are delighted to enter into a collaboration with a company of Boehringer Ingelheim’s stature,” said Paul Ashton, Chief Executive Officer of Inflammasome Therapeutics. “We look forward to working with their team to leverage our respective technologies and expertise to develop new therapies for devastating retinal diseases leading to blindness. This collaboration fits our strategy of advancing the company via both collaborations and internal development.”
“Boehringer Ingelheim is looking forward to developing Inflammasome’s novel technology for the delivery of our first-in- class retinal disease compounds working jointly with Inflammasome’s highly experienced scientific team,” said Clive R. Wood, PhD, Senior Corporate Vice President, Discovery Research at Boehringer Ingelheim. “This will enable us to develop a broad range of novel therapy options for the many patients with retinal diseases waiting urgently for better and new therapy options.”
Boehringer Ingelheim takes a holistic approach in the development of novel retinal disease therapies, targeting key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases. The company has built a comprehensive pipeline portfolio of next generation therapy approaches in various stages of development up to Phase 2 in macular degeneration, diabetic retinal diseases and beyond. Inflammasome’s novel delivery technology using a long-acting degradable IVT implant complements this portfolio.
Inflammasome is entitled to receive up to $160 million in up-front, research and development support and milestone gated development payments as well as tiered royalties based on future commercial sales of developed products and other milestones due on commercialization.

AstraZeneca today announced that <i>Qtrilmet</i> (metformin hydrochloride, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin) modified-release tablets have been recommended for marketing authorisation in the European Union for the treatment of adults with type-2 diabetes (T2D).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) based its positive opinion on data from five Phase III trials which evaluated combinations of <i>Forxiga</i> (dapagliflozin) and <i>Onglyza</i> (saxagliptin) on a background of metformin in patients with inadequately-controlled T2D. The primary endpoint in these trials was mean change from baseline in HbA1c (average blood glucose levels) at week 24 or 52.
Across the trials, the combination of <i>Forxiga</i>, <i>Onglyza</i> and metformin was superior in reducing HbA1c versus <i>Forxiga </i>combined with metformin, <i>Onglyza</i> combined with metformin, or glimepiride combined with metformin. The combination of <i>Forxiga</i>, <i>Onglyza</i> and metformin with or without sulphonylurea (SU) was non-inferior to the combined use of insulin and metformin with or without SU in reducing HbA1c.
The safety results of the individual medicines in these trials were consistent with their known profile.
The CHMP recommended the marketing authorisation for <i>Qtrilmet</i> to improve glycaemic control when metformin with or without SU and either saxagliptin or dapagliflozin does not provide adequate glycaemic control, or when T2D patients are already being treated with metformin, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin.
<i>Qtrilmet<b> </b></i>is approved in the US under the name <i>Qternmet XR</i> as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D.
<b>About <i>Qtrilmet</i></b>
<i>Qtrilmet<b> </b></i>is a once-daily, oral medicine comprised of the selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor <i>Forxiga</i>, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor <i>Onglyza</i> and metformin hydrochloride extended release indicated as treatment in adults with T2D.

<span class=""xn-location"">PLAINSBORO, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 20, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ --<b> </b>Novo Nordisk today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Rybelsus<sup>® </sup>(semaglutide) tablets 7 mg or 14 mg for adults with type 2 diabetes that along with diet and exercise may improve blood sugar (glucose).<sup>1</sup> Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> is the first and only glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog in a pill and a new option for adults with type 2 diabetes who are not achieving their A1C goal with current antidiabetic treatment.
Type 2 diabetes is a global public health issue that impacts more than 28 million people in the U.S. alone.<sup>2</sup> Despite existing treatment options, many adults with type 2 diabetes have poorly managed blood sugar that can increase the risk of developing serious diabetes-related complications.<sup>2-3</sup>
""GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective medications for people with type 2 diabetes but have been underutilized in part because they have, until now, only been available as an injectable treatment,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Vanita R. Aroda</span>, MD, Director of Diabetes Clinical Research, Brigham and Women's Hospital, <span class=""xn-location"">Boston, MA</span> and a PIONEER clinical trial investigator. ""The availability of an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist represents a significant development and primary care providers, specialists and patients alike may now be more receptive to the use of a GLP-1 therapy to help them achieve their blood sugar goals.""
The approval of Rybelsus<sup>® </sup>is based on results from 10 PIONEER clinical trials, which enrolled 9,543 participants and included head-to-head studies of Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> vs. sitagliptin, empagliflozin and liraglutide 1.8 mg.<sup>4</sup> In the trials, Rybelsus<sup>®</sup>reduced A1C and, as a secondary endpoint, showed reductions in body weight. The most common adverse reactions in the PIONEER trials, reported in =5% of patients, were nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, decreased appetite, vomiting and constipation. The types and frequency of the adverse reactions were similar across trials.<sup>1,5-7</sup>
""People living with type 2 diabetes deserve more innovation, research and support to help them achieve their individual A1C goals,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Todd Hobbs</span>, vice president and U.S. chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk. ""With Rybelsus<sup>®</sup>, we have the opportunity to expand use of effective GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy by providing adults with type 2 diabetes an oral medication which was previously only available as an injection to help with managing their blood sugar.""
Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> is approved for once-daily use in two therapeutic doses, 7 mg and 14 mg, and will be available in the U.S. beginning in Q4 2019. Initial supply of Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> will come from manufacturing facilities in <span class=""xn-location"">Denmark</span>; however, future supply for Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> will come from manufacturing facilities in the U.S. In 2015, Novo Nordisk made a strategic investment to build a new manufacturing facility in <span class=""xn-location"">Clayton, NC</span> to prepare for the future demand for Rybelsus<sup>®</sup>. Additionally, earlier this year Novo Nordisk acquired a tableting and packaging facility in <span class=""xn-location"">Durham, NC</span> to meet anticipated supply needs for Rybelsus<sup>®</sup>.
Novo Nordisk is working with health insurance providers with a goal of ensuring broad insurance coverage and patient access to the product. A savings card program will be available at the time of launch for eligible commercially-insured patients to keep out of pocket costs down to as little as <span class=""xn-money"">$10</span> a month.
The U.S. FDA is still reviewing Novo Nordisk's new drug application (NDA) for Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> seeking an additional indication to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD). A decision is expected in Q1 2020.
Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> is currently under review by several regulatory agencies around the world, including the European Medicines Agency and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.
<b>What is Rybelsus</b><b><sup>®</sup></b><b>?</b>
Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> (semaglutide) tablets 7 mg or 14 mg is a prescription medicine for adults with type 2 diabetes that along with diet and exercise may improve blood sugar (glucose).
<ul>
 	<li>Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> is not recommended as the first choice of medicine for treating diabetes</li>
 	<li>It is not known if Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> can be used in people who have had pancreatitis</li>
 	<li>Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> is not for use in people with type 1 diabetes and people with diabetic ketoacidosis</li>
 	<li>It is not known if Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> is safe and effective for use in children under 18 years of age</li>
</ul>
<b>Important Safety Information</b>
<b>What is the most important information I should know about Rybelsus<sup>®</sup>?</b>
<b>Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> may cause serious side effects, including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Possible thyroid tumors, including cancer.</b> Tell your healthcare provider if you get a lump or swelling in your neck, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of thyroid cancer. In studies with rodents, Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> and medicines that work like Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> caused thyroid tumors, including thyroid cancer. It is not known if Rybelsus<sup>®</sup> will cause thyroid tumors or a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in people<b>  </b></li>
</ul>

<div class=""bw-release-story"">
BOULDER, Colo. &amp; BERLIN--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Clovis Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLVS) has entered into a global licensing and collaboration agreement with 3B Pharmaceuticals GmbH (3BP), a private German biotechnology company developing targeted radiopharmaceutical drugs and diagnostics for oncology indications with a high unmet medical need. The initial focus is on developing a peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy (PTRT) and imaging agent targeting fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP). FAP is highly expressed in many epithelial cancers, including more than 90 percent of breast, lung, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas.<sup>1</sup> Clovis will conduct global clinical trials and has obtained U.S. and global rights, excluding Europe (inclusive of Russia, Turkey and Israel), where 3BP retains rights. The parties have also agreed to collaborate on a discovery program directed at three additional targets for radionuclide therapy, to which Clovis will have global rights.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“Additionally, as a result of our discovery collaboration, Clovis intends to further expand its pipeline with additional targeted radiopharmaceutical candidates that result from the discovery program using 3BP’s technology platform. We are delighted to work with 3BP given their leadership in the discovery and development of peptide-targeted radionuclide therapies.”</p>
<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190923005267/en/Clovis-Oncology-Acquires-Rights-FAP-Targeted-Radiopharmaceutical-Program#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
Terms of the transactions include approximately $12 million in upfront payments to 3BP. Upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, additional potential milestone payments and single- to low-double-digit commercial royalties would be paid to 3BP by Clovis. Clovis will be responsible for a limited number of 3BP full-time employees (FTEs) and external costs during the pre-clinical development. Research and development expense guidance provided by Clovis on its August 1 financial results call does not change as a result of today’s announcement.
“We are extremely enthusiastic about the opportunity to develop this novel class of targeted radiopharmaceutical therapies, with an initial focus on fibroblast activation protein alpha. Targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy represents a next frontier in oncology drug development, with potential application across multiple tumor types. In particular, FAP represents a very compelling target given its overexpression across numerous tumor types and limited expression in healthy tissue,” said Patrick J. Mahaffy, President and CEO of Clovis Oncology. “Additionally, as a result of our discovery collaboration, Clovis intends to further expand its pipeline with additional targeted radiopharmaceutical candidates that result from the discovery program using 3BP’s technology platform. We are delighted to work with 3BP given their leadership in the discovery and development of peptide-targeted radionuclide therapies.”
The collaboration is initially focused on the development of an FAP-targeted preclinical candidate identified by 3BP’s technology platform. FAP is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which are found in the majority of cancer types and play an intricate role in driving tumor growth. Targeting CAFs with an FAP radiopharmaceutical is believed to have multiple modes of anti-tumor action, but principally relies on the induction of DNA damage in tumor cells by ionizing radiation emitted locally from neighboring CAFs targeted by the therapy.
Clovis and 3BP also announced their intention to enter into a collaboration for the discovery and development of radiopharmaceuticals for three additional targets using 3BP’s technology platform. 3BP will be responsible for discovery activities for the three targets. Once lead molecules have been identified, responsibilities will transition to Clovis for Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies.
“We have focused for many years on developing a peptide technology platform for the discovery and development of innovative radiopharmaceuticals, which we believe represents the best means of selectively delivering potent radiation to tumors,” said Dr. Ulrich Reineke, Managing Director of 3BP. “As we are approaching clinical development, we are very enthusiastic about partnering with Clovis Oncology to move our FAP-targeted product forward and to collaborate further on building a portfolio of targeted radiopharmaceutical therapeutics. We believe this is an ideal partnership for the rapid clinical development of our radiopharmaceuticals for the benefit of patients with many different types of cancer.”
<b>About Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha (FAP)</b>
Fibroblast activation protein alpha, or FAP, is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which are found in the majority of cancer types, potentially making it a suitable target across a wide array of solid tumors. FAP is highly expressed in many epithelial cancers, including more than 90 percent of breast, lung, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas.<sup>1</sup> CAFs are highly prevalent in the tumor microenvironment of many cancers and persist through all malignant stages of a tumor, from primary tumor to metastasis. FAP has limited expression on normal fibroblasts, reducing the potential for effects in normal tissue.
<b>About Peptide-Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (PTRT)</b>
Peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy involves a small amount of radioactive material (radionuclide) that is combined with a cell-targeting moiety peptide for the treatment of cancer; PTRT is considered a form of radiopharmaceuticals. The targeting peptide is able to recognize and bind to specific features of tumors, such as antigens and cell receptors. When injected into the patient’s bloodstream, the peptide attaches to cancer cells or cancer-associated stromal cells, delivering a high dose of radiation to the tumor while sparing normal tissues.
<b>About FAP-Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals</b>
Clinical studies of small molecule imaging agents targeting FAP have validated this target in a diverse number of cancer indications and support the further evaluation of peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy. FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals have at least two potential modes of anti-tumor activity: radiation crossfire, in which tumor cells are irradiated due to their close proximity to CAFs; and depletion of CAFs, disrupting the communication between the tumor cells and the tumor stroma. In addition, in certain tumor types, such as sarcoma and mesothelioma, FAP is expressed on the tumor cells themselves, and in those tumors, FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals may have a direct antitumor effect.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 23, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RaMofL5e0Giys7xP-vg_3M3LzacD7IQ2cDFNh7VInWPbKqJ0mW_bGlm86N2L1iofm5dUvcZaPWy-oJ3tbv16nw=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Biogen Inc.</a> (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), part of the of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), recommended an update to marketing authorizations of approved interferon beta treatments, including PLEGRIDY<sup>®</sup> (peginterferon beta-1a) and AVONEX<sup>®</sup> (interferon beta-1a), to remove pregnancy contraindications and, where clinically needed, to allow use during pregnancy and breastfeeding in women with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).
“Women are diagnosed with MS at least two to three times more frequently than men,<sup>1</sup> and the disease may strike during their child-bearing years.<sup>2</sup>Choosing a treatment plan that allows women to continue or start their MS therapy while pregnant or breastfeeding is a step forward for those living with this chronic, debilitating disease and their partners,” said Alfred Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Biogen. “This CHMP opinion gives physicians and their patients added confidence when considering treatment with PLEGRIDY or AVONEX, two important therapies for relapsing MS that have been prescribed to more than half a million people living with the disease.”
The CHMP opinion is based on data from the European Interferon Beta Pregnancy Registry, as well as the national health registers in Finland and Sweden, which together created the largest cohort studies providing safety data related to interferon beta exposure in women of child-bearing age with MS.
Data collected from more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes from registries and post-marketing experience indicate no increased risk of major congenital anomalies following exposure to interferon beta before conception or during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment was likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Additionally, experience with exposure in the second and third trimesters is very limited. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. Limited data suggest the levels of interferon beta-1a excreted in human milk are negligible, and no harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.
<strong>About PLEGRIDY<sup>®</sup></strong>
PLEGRIDY is a subcutaneous pegylated interferon dosed once every two weeks for relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), the most common form of MS. PLEGRIDY is currently approved in over 60 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and Switzerland, and across the European Union. Nearly 50,000 people worldwide have been treated with PLEGRIDY, with over 88,000 patient-years of experience, based on prescription data.<sup>3</sup> Biogen continues to work toward making PLEGRIDY available in additional countries across the globe.
The efficacy and safety of PLEGRIDY is supported by one of the largest pivotal studies with interferons conducted in people living with RRMS. In clinical studies, PLEGRIDY has been proven to significantly reduce the rate of MS relapses, slow the progression of disability and reduce the number of MS brain lesions while demonstrating a favorable safety profile for patients with relapsing forms of MS. Side effects reported include liver problems, including liver failure and increases in liver enzymes; depression or suicidal thoughts; serious allergic reactions; cardiac problems, including congestive heart failure; autoimmune disorders; decreases in white blood cell or platelet counts; and seizures. In clinical trials, the most common adverse events associated with PLEGRIDY were injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. A list of adverse events can be found in the full PLEGRIDY product labeling for each country where it is approved.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","– Study met both co-primary endpoints with high statistical significance, demonstrating autograft sparing and durable wound closure at three months with StrataGraft – 
– Company plans to submit Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first half of 2020 – 
STAINES-UPON-THAMES, United Kingdom, Sept. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE: MNK), a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced positive top-line results from its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of its investigational StrataGraft® regenerative tissue. The study, which met both primary endpoints, evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single application of StrataGraft in the treatment of deep partial-thickness thermal burns. Each study participant served as his or her own control.
Mallinckrodt logo
Results showed that a significantly smaller area of burn wounds treated with StrataGraft tissue required autografting by three months compared to the area of burn wounds treated exclusively with autograft (p<0.0001). Additionally, results showed that the proportion of StrataGraft-treated wounds that achieved durable wound closure at three months exceeded the pre-defined threshold for statistical significance.
Based on the positive Phase 3 data, Mallinckrodt plans to submit a Biologics License Application for StrataGraft tissue to the FDA in the first half of 2020. StrataGraft tissue is an investigational product, and its safety and effectiveness have not yet been established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“Treatment advances are needed that can help minimize or eliminate the need to harvest skin tissue for autografting, as the second wound created by removing healthy skin can be associated with complications and can be even more painful than the burn wound itself,” said Dr. James H. Holmes IV, study co-lead investigator and Director of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center’s Burn Center. “The positive top-line results of the Phase 3 trial suggest that this investigational regenerative tissue, if approved, could provide burn surgeons with an alternative treatment option for deep partial-thickness burns.”
Autograft is considered to be a standard of care by many for deep partial-thickness thermal burns. Such burns are complex skin injuries in which the damage extends through the entire epidermis (outermost layer of skin) and into the lower part of the dermis (innermost layer of skin). As autograft involves the surgical harvesting of healthy skin from an uninjured site on the patient and transplanting the skin graft to the injury, patients are left with two wounds requiring care. Patients who receive an autograft may experience pain, itching, scarring and impaired function at the donor site.
“Achieving the co-primary endpoints in our pivotal Phase 3 trial and exceeding statistical thresholds for both endpoints represents an important development milestone for StrataGraft tissue, which has the potential to help patients suffering from deep partial-thickness thermal burns. Coupled with the recently announced positive Phase 3 results for terlipressin in hepatorenal syndrome, or HRS, type 1, these Phase 3 results demonstrate our ability to design and execute successful development programs targeting complicated, serious conditions,” said Steven Romano, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at Mallinckrodt. “We are committed to providing StrataGraft to patients in need as a potential paradigm-changing treatment and alternative to autograft, if approved. We would like to thank the study participants and investigators in the Phase 3 clinical trial and all of the others who have helped us advance the clinical development program for this investigational product.”
Design and Results of Phase 3 Study (STRATA2016)
The pivotal open-label, controlled, randomized, multicenter Phase 3 trial in adults evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single application of StrataGraft tissue in the treatment of deep partial-thickness thermal burns. The study enrolled 71 study participants across 12 clinical sites in the United States. Study participants were age 18 years and older and had 3-49% total body surface area complex skin defects caused by thermal burns that contained intact dermal elements for which surgical excision and autografts were clinically indicated. The study design used an intra-patient control, in which two similar areas of burn injury on the same study participant were randomly assigned to either standard of care (autograft) or StrataGraft treatment.
The co-primary endpoints included autograft sparing (the difference in the percent area of thermal burn wounds treated with StrataGraft tissue that required autografting compared with the control autograft treatment sites by three months), and durable wound closure (the proportion of study participants achieving durable wound closure of the StrataGraft-treated site at three months without autograft placement).
Key co-primary endpoints findings included the following:

On average, 4% of the area of StrataGraft-treated sites required autografting by three months. By design, 100% of the area of control-treated sites was autografted and an additional 2% of the area required subsequent autografting by three months. This resulted in a 98% reduction in the area requiring autograft in the StrataGraft-treated sites compared to the control-treated sites (p<0.0001).
83% of burn wounds treated with StrataGraft tissue alone achieved durable wound closure at the treatment site at three months post-placement (95% confidence interval: 74.4-91.8%, meeting the pre-defined threshold of statistical significance). As a reference, 86% of the burn wounds treated with a single application of autograft achieved durable wound closure at three months post-placement (95% confidence interval: 77.8-94.0%).
The safety profile of StrataGraft tissue was comparable to that of autograft. Pruritus was the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), occurring in 25 of 71 (35%) study participants treated with StrataGraft tissue (of which 11 of the 25 were possibly related to study treatment). All study treatment-related TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. No local infections were related to StrataGraft treatment.

About StrataGraft Regenerative Tissue
StrataGraft regenerative tissue is an investigational treatment being developed to reduce or eliminate autograft in patients with severe thermal burns. An engineered, bilayer tissue, StrataGraft is designed to mimic natural human skin with both inner dermis-like and outer epidermis-like layers. StrataGraft can be sutured, stapled or secured with an adhesive. StrataGraft tissue is cryopreserved in order to deliver viable cells upon application.
Mallinckrodt is currently evaluating StrataGraft tissue in an ongoing Phase 2 trial for the treatment of adults with full-thickness burns (also referred to as third-degree burns). Mallinckrodt also plans to study StrataGraft tissue in pediatric populations, and to initiate a continued access clinical trial under an Expanded Access Program (EAP) in the fall of 2019. The trial sites involved in the pivotal Phase 3 trial (STRATA2016) will have the opportunity to participate in that trial.
StrataGraft tissue is an investigational product, and its safety and effectiveness have not yet been established by the FDA.
The FDA has granted StrataGraft tissue orphan drug status, and it was among the first products designated by the Agency as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act.
Funding and technical support for the continued development of StrataGraft regenerative tissue, including the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (STRATA2016) and the marketing approval registration process for StrataGraft tissue in the United States, is being provided by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Project BioShield Contract No. HHSO100201500027C. The BARDA contract supports additional projects, including clinical trials for use in pediatric populations. These efforts are part of BARDA’s strategy to build emergency preparedness in response to mass casualty events involving trauma and thermal burns by developing novel medical countermeasures for adult and pediatric populations. In the case of a mass casualty thermal burn event, the Government Accountability Office estimates that more than 10,000 patients might require thermal burn care.1 The limited number of specialized burn centers and related medical infrastructure in the United States creates a public health need for therapies that could be deployed quickly for use in these and other care sites.
About Deep Partial-thickness Thermal Burns
Deep partial-thickness thermal burns are complex skin injuries in which the damage extends through the entire epidermis (outermost layer of skin) and into the lower part of the dermis (innermost layer of skin).
Autograft is considered to be a standard of care by many for deep partial-thickness thermal burns. It involves the surgical harvesting of healthy skin tissue from an uninjured site on the patient and transplanting the skin graft to the injury. While this process can be effective in providing closure of the original wound, it has significant limitations related to the donor site wounds created during surgical removal of the skin tissue for grafting. Donor site wounds are extremely painful and can create risks of additional scarring and infection. In addition, the amount of healthy skin available for harvesting is frequently limited in those patients with large burns, necessitating sequential re-harvesting of available donor sites. As a result, there is an urgent need for alternatives to donor site harvesting for the treatment of severe burns.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">
INCHEON, South Korea--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Celltrion Healthcare today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion for CT-P13 SC for marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CT-P13 SC is the subcutaneous version of Remsima<sup>®</sup>(biosimilar infliximab, CT-P13). This recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines in the EU.
A subcutaneous formulation has the potential to enhance treatment options for the use of biosimilar infliximab by providing high consistency in drug exposure and a convenient method of administration.<sup>1,2</sup>
“Today’s positive CHMP opinion brings us one step closer to providing a personalised treatment approach for people living with rheumatoid arthritis. This marks an important milestone for our business providing people with a new route of administration, and a novel formulation of infliximab,” said Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare. “If approved, we will begin a new era in the biotherapeutic class, as CT-P13 SC would be the world’s first subcutaneous version of infliximab, expanding treatment options for physicians and their patients.”
This positive opinion is based on the phase I/III study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety between CT-P13 SC and the intravenous (IV) version in people with active RA.
Part one of the study demonstrated that CT-P13 SC showed comparable efficacy to CT-P13 IV up to week 54 with comparable DAS28 (CRP) / DAS28 (ESR) and ACR20 scores (measures of disease activity) demonstrated for both routes of administration. The safety profile of CT-P13 SC was also comparable to CT-P13 IV.<sup>1</sup> The study was followed up by a phase I/III randomised controlled trial (part two) which demonstrated non-inferiority in efficacy of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV in people with RA over 30 weeks with similar DAS28 and ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 scores and EULAR-CRP response. The safety profile of CT-13 SC was comparable to CT-13 IV up to week 30.<sup>2</sup>
Global Principal Investigator Professor Rene Westhovens, Rheumatologist at the University Hospitals KU Leuven, Belgium said, “This announcement is very encouraging as CT-P13 SC has demonstrated a comparable safety and efficacy profile to the well-established intravenous version of infliximab. This new SC formulation of infliximab could give patients the opportunity to administer the treatment themselves as an injection, giving them more control over their own treatment. Having two formulations of CT-P13 could also benefit patients by offering a more personalised treatment option whilst also reducing the time spent in hospital having intravenous treatment alone.”
A phase III study of CT-P13 SC for people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is underway. Celltrion hope to seek expanded indications following the results of this trial.
Celltrion Healthcare will adopt a different business strategy for CT-P13<sup> </sup>SC, compared to strategies for previous products in the portfolio and is considering both direct and indirect sales based on the optimal model in each local country.
Celltrion has applied for a patent for CT-P13 SC in approximately 130 countries throughout the US, Europe and Asia.
<p class=""bwalignc""><b>-- ENDS --</b></p>
<b>Notes to Editors:</b>
<b>About CT-P13 intravenous (IV) formulation<sup>3</sup></b>
CT-P13 IV is usually given as 3mg per kg/body weight in RA and as 5mg per kg/body weight for the other indications. Infliximab IV is given as an infusion over two hours. All patients are monitored for any reactions during the infusion and for at least one to two hours afterwards.
<b>About CT-P13 subcutaneous (SC) formulation<sup>1,2</sup></b>
CT-P13 SC has three administration options; via a pre-filled pen (auto injector), pre-filled syringe or pre-filled syringe with needle safeguard. The SC formulation has the potential to enhance treatment options for the use of infliximab biosimilar by providing high consistency in drug exposure and a convenient method of administration.
<b>About CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab)</b>
CT-P13 is developed and manufactured by Celltrion, Inc. and was the world’s first monoclonal antibody biosimilar approved by the European Commission (EC). It is indicated for the treatment of eight autoimmune diseases including RA and IBD. It was approved by the EC under the trade name Remsima<sup>®</sup> in September 2013 and launched in major EU countries in early 2015. The US FDA approved CT-P13 in April 2016 under the trade name Inflectra<sup>®</sup>. CT-P13 is approved in more than 89 countries (as of September 2019) including the US, Canada, Japan and throughout Europe.

<b>About TJC4</b>
CD47 represents one of the most promising immuno-oncology targets. The current investigational drugs targeting the CD47-SIRPa pathway have undesirable properties of binding to human red blood cells (RBC) or platelets. Such unwanted binding properties have been shown in pre-clinical and clinical settings to cause hematologic side-effects, e.g., anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the so-called ""antigen sink effect"" that affects pharmacokinetics of the investigational drugs. TJC4 is a highly differentiated monoclonal antibody made, by design, to recognize a unique epitope on CD47 and avoid strong binding to red blood cells. As such, TJC4 did not cause anemia in non-human primate studies,while it was shown to maintain anti-tumor activities. TJC4 is currently under clinical development in the U.S. and has been granted an IND approval by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to start clinical trials in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>.

<div class=""bd plntxt"">
<b>Berlin, 23. September 2019</b> – Bayer today announced that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) for the precision oncology treatment Vitrakvi® (larotrectinib). The drug is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (<i>NTRK</i>) gene fusion, who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and who have no satisfactory treatment options. Vitrakvi, a first-in-class oral TRK inhibitor exclusively designed to treat tumors that have an <i>NTRK</i>gene fusion, is the first treatment in the EU to receive a tumor-agnostic indication. Vitrakvi has demonstrated high response rates and durable responses in adults and children with TRK fusion cancer, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors. It is already approved in the U.S., Brazil and Canada.
“With this first-ever tumor-agnostic approval in the EU, physicians in Europe now have the option to replace less tailored treatment approaches with a precision oncology treatment exclusively designed to treat tumors that have an <i>NTRK</i> gene fusion – a rare cancer which affects both children and adults and occurs in varying frequencies across various tumor types,” said Prof. Jesus Garcia-Foncillas, Director of the University Cancer Institute and the Department of Oncology at the University Hospital “Fundacion Jimenez Diaz” and Professor of Oncology at the Autonomous University of Madrid, Director of the Translational Oncology Division at the Health Research Institute FJD-UAM and Coordinator of the Comprehensive Cancer Program of four University Hospitals in Madrid. “Existing therapies commonly used to treat TRK fusion cancer patients such as chemotherapy or immuno-oncology therapies have shown limited efficacy, and may have significant side effects. With Vitrakvi, we have seen rapid, robust and durable responses with a consistent and manageable safety profile in patients with TRK fusion cancer, regardless of the age of the patient or where in the body the tumor is located.”
The EMA approval of larotrectinib is based on pooled clinical trial data of 102 patients (93 patients from the primary analysis population and an additional 9 patients with primary CNS tumors) across the Phase I trial of adult patients, the Phase II NAVIGATE trial in adult and adolescent patients and the Phase I/II pediatric SCOUT trial. Results in the primary analysis population (n=93) demonstrate an overall response rate (ORR) of 72% (95% CI: 62, 81) including 16% complete responses (CR) and 55% partial responses (PR). In an additional analysis including primary CNS patients, the ORR was 67% (95% CI: 57, 76) including 15% CR, and 51% PR. In the pooled analysis set (n=102), neither the median duration of response nor median progression free survival had been reached at time of analysis. Responses ranged from 1.6+ to 38.7+ months and 75% of responding patients had a duration of response of 12 months or longer. At one year after the start of therapy, 88% (95% CI: 81, 95) of patients from the primary analysis population (n=93) were still alive. The safety of larotrectinib was evaluated in 125 patients with an <i>NTRK</i>gene fusion. Larotrectinib showed a favorable safety profile, with the majority of adverse events (AEs) being grade 1 or 2. Only 3% of patients had to stop therapy due to treatment-emergent AEs.
TRK fusion cancer is rare overall, affecting no more than a few thousand patients across Europe annually. It affects both children and adults and occurs in varying frequencies across various tumor types. TRK fusion cancer occurs when an <i>NTRK</i>gene fuses with another unrelated gene, producing an altered TRK protein. The altered protein, or TRK fusion protein, becomes constitutively active or overexpressed, triggering a signaling cascade. These TRK fusion proteins act as oncogenic drivers that fuel the spread and growth of the patients’ cancer, regardless of where it originates in the body. Larotrectinib, an oral, highly selective TRK inhibitor, was investigated in clinical trials across 29 different histologies of solid tumors including lung, thyroid, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, colon, soft tissue sarcomas, salivary gland and infantile fibrosarcoma. The compound has shown efficacy in primary CNS tumors as well as patients with brain metastases, across age or tumor histology.
“The approval of Vitrakvi® in the EU, a first-of-its-kind treatment exclusively designed for adults and children with TRK fusion cancer, represents a meaningful advancement in the fight against cancer, as it treats the oncogenic driver that causes tumor spread and growth, rather than where the tumor originates in the body,” said Robert LaCaze, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer's Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of the Oncology Strategic Business Unit. “Cancer care is currently undergoing a paradigm shift and as this new era of precision oncology treatment unfolds, we are continuing our effort of delivering innovative medicines such as Vitrakvi, which can provide value to patients and their treating physicians around the world.”
“As researchers learn more about tumor genomics, precision oncology treatments that directly address the genomic abnormality driving tumor growth become increasingly relevant for patients. We now have the tools to move beyond a one-size fits all treatment approach,” said Marcia K. Horn, President and CEO of ICAN, the International Cancer Advocacy Network. “We welcome the approval of Vitrakvi for patients with TRK fusion cancer in the EU, which also underscores the importance of implementing consistent, widespread high quality molecular testing into the clinical practice to identify more patients through genomic insights and ultimately benefit their care.”
Only specific tests can identify <i>NTRK</i> gene fusions or TRK fusion proteins, these include next generation sequencing (NGS), flourescense in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC is a useful screening tool. However, IHC detects both the expression of the wildtype TRK protein as well as the TRK fusion protein; therefore, positive results need to be confirmed by more specific tests such as next-generation sequencing. Patients eligible for treatment with Vitrakvi should be selected based on the presence of an <i>NTRK</i> gene fusion in their tumor.
<b>About Vitrakvi® (larotrectinib)</b>
Larotrectinib was approved in September 2019 in the European Union under the brand name Vitrakvi® for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (<i>NTRK</i>) gene fusion, who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and who have no satisfactory treatment options. Vitrakvi has also received regulatory approval in the U.S, Brazil and Canada. Filings in other regions are underway or planned.
Larotrectinib patients have been treated for up to 38.7 months with many patients continuing treatment. To date, larotrectinib has the largest dataset (n=139) and experience in TRK fusion cancer patients.
Following the acquisition of Loxo Oncology by Eli Lilly and Company in February 2019, Bayer has obtained the exclusive licensing rights for the global development and commercialization, including in the U.S., for larotrectinib and the investigational TRK inhibitor BAY 2731954 (previously LOXO-195) progressing through clinical development.
<b>About TRK Fusion Cancer</b>
TRK fusion cancer occurs when an <i>NTRK</i> gene fuses with another unrelated gene, producing an altered TRK protein. The altered protein, or TRK fusion protein, becomes constitutively active or overexpressed, triggering a signaling cascade. These TRK fusion proteins act as oncogenic drivers promoting cell growth and survival, leading to TRK fusion cancer, regardless of where it originates in the body.

<div class=""introtext"">Investment of over USD 30 million spanning five years to research and develop new treatments for chronic lung diseases / Joint lab to broaden Bayer’s presence in the Boston ecosystem</div>
</header></article>
<div class=""media float"">
<div class=""bd plntxt"">
<b>Berlin / Boston, MA, September 24, 2019</b> – Bayer and Partners HealthCare’s founding members Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) today announced the launch of a joint lab to research new drug candidates to treat chronic lung diseases. The joint lab will host scientists from all three parties and Bayer is investing more than USD 30 million to fund joint research projects over the next five years.
Chronic lung disease is a broad term for a number of diseases of the airways and other structures of the lung, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). About 65 million people suffer from COPD and 3 million die from it each year, making it the third leading cause of death worldwide.
Within the framework of this new collaboration, four leading experts will combine their expertise in the search for new treatment options for patients who suffer from chronic lung diseases: Edwin Silverman, MD, PhD, Chief of the Channing Division of Network Medicine at BWH, Bruce Levy, MD, Chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at BWH, Benjamin Medoff, MD, Chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care at MGH, Markus Koch, PhD, Head of Preclinical Research, Lung Diseases at Bayer.
“This strategic collaboration complements our in-house research and will bring us closer to providing life-changing treatment options for patients living with chronic lung diseases,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG's Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “The joint lab concept continues to be an innovative model for collaboration between academia and industry, enabling novel approaches to drug discovery.”
“We strongly believe that this model will significantly accelerate the pace of discovery toward the goal of getting new therapies from the lab to patients safely and efficiently,” said Paul Anderson, MD, PhD, SVP and Chief Academic Officer, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “This collaboration provides the opportunity to integrate novel findings directly into the drug development pipeline, thus speeding up the time to move a new treatment into the clinic.”
Scientists will work side-by-side, combining Bayer’s capabilities in drug discovery and development with the complementary clinical expertise, understanding of disease mechanisms, data analysis capabilities and insights from leading physician scientists of Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The lab, located at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, will see more than 20 people from all three organizations work in combined teams. The rights to the research findings will be shared equally between the organizations.
The new lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, located in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, bolsters Bayer’s existing presence in Boston. Earlier this year, Bayer committed to opening lab and office space in the heart of Kendall Square to further expand its research and development efforts. In 2018, Bayer established a first joint lab in Boston together with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in the area of cardiovascular diseases. The Pharmaceuticals Business Development &amp; Licensing team of Bayer facilitated this collaboration.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","Bristol-Myers Squibb Receives Positive CHMP Opinion Recommending Approval of Opdivo (nivolumab) Four-Week Dosing Schedule for the Adjuvant Treatment of Adult Patients with Melanoma with Involvement of Lymph Nodes or Metastatic Disease who have Undergone Complete Resection

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 6:59 AM EDT
PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approval of Opdivo (nivolumab) flat dosing schedule of 240 mg infused over 30 minutes every two weeks (Q2W) or 480 mg infused over 60 minutes every four weeks (Q4W) for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection. The CHMP recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union (EU).
“This positive CHMP opinion for Opdivo two and four-week dosing reinforces our commitment to offering flexible dosing options for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers,” said Ralu Vlad, Pharm.D, development team lead, product design and delivery, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “We look forward to the European Commission’s decision and potentially bringing this new Opdivo dosing regimen to patients as quickly as possible.”
About Melanoma
Melanoma is a form of skin cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) located in the skin. Metastatic melanoma is the deadliest form of the disease and occurs when cancer spreads beyond the surface of the skin to other organs. The incidence of melanoma has been increasing steadily for the last 30 years. In the United States, 91,270 new diagnoses of melanoma and more than 9,320 related deaths are estimated for 2018. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that by 2035, melanoma incidence will reach 424,102, with 94,308 related deaths. Melanoma is mostly curable when treated in its very early stages; however, survival rates are roughly halved if regional lymph nodes are involved. Patients in the United States diagnosed with advanced melanoma classified as Stage IV historically have a five-year survival rate of 15% to 20% and a 10-year survival of 10% to 15%.
Adjuvant Therapy in Melanoma
Melanoma is separated into five staging categories (stages 0-4) based on the in-situ feature, thickness and ulceration of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and how far the cancer has spread beyond lymph nodes.
Stage 3 melanoma has reached the regional lymph nodes but has not yet spread to distant lymph nodes or to other parts of the body (metastasized) and requires surgical resection of the primary tumor as well as the involved lymph nodes. Some patients may also be treated with adjuvant therapy. Despite surgical intervention, most patients experience disease recurrence and progress to metastatic disease.
Bristol-Myers Squibb: Advancing Oncology Research
At Bristol-Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The focus of our research is to increase quality, long-term survival for patients and make cure a possibility. Through a unique multidisciplinary approach powered by translational science, we harness our deep scientific experience in oncology and Immuno-Oncology (I-O) research to identify novel treatments tailored to individual patient needs. Our researchers are developing a diverse, purposefully built pipeline designed to target different immune system pathways and address the complex and specific interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment and the immune system. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines, like I-O, a reality for patients.
About Opdivo
Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
Opdivo’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
Infusion Reactions
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
Lactation
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.

LEXINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 24, 2019-- Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALDX) (Aldeyra) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted fast track designation to ADX-2191 for the prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). PVR is a serious, sight-threatening condition with no approved treatment.
“Fast track designation is an important milestone for our retinal disease platform, and promising news for PVR patients,” said Todd C. Brady, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aldeyra. “The FDA’s decision underscores the potential of ADX-2191 to prevent this devastating condition and creates the framework for ADX-2191 to reach the market promptly if approved.”
PVR, a rare inflammatory disorder of the retina that leads to severe retinal scarring and blindness, occurs most commonly following retinal detachment repair surgery or ocular injury. More than 50% of PVR cases result in severe uncorrectable vision loss, and 76% of PVR patients suffer from at least moderate uncorrectable vision loss.
Aldeyra expects to initiate its adaptive Phase 3 GUARD Trial of ADX-2191 for the prevention of PVR in the fourth quarter of 2019. The trial will compare recurrence rates of PVR-related retinal detachment across patients treated with ADX-2191 or standard of care following surgical repair of retinal detachment.
The fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that treat serious conditions, potentially accelerating patient access to new therapies.
“Fast track designation enables us to engage in more frequent communications with the FDA to discuss our development plan for ADX-2191, and provides eligibility for Priority Review and rolling New Drug Application submission,” said David J. Clark, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Aldeyra. “We look forward to working with the FDA as we advance ADX-2191 into Phase 3 development.”
<b>About ADX-2191
</b>ADX-2191, an intravitreal formulation of methotrexate, has been granted orphan drug designation for the prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). The observed clinical activity of ADX-2191 in patients with PVR is believed to be the result of down-regulation of aberrant retinal cell proliferation and activity, thereby leading to reduced retinal scarring that is characteristic of PVR. Aldeyra retains an exclusive license to certain patents related to the use of ADX-2191 for the prevention of PVR.
<b><i>About Aldeyra Therapeutics
</i></b>Aldeyra Therapeutics is a biotechnology company devoted to developing and commercializing next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases. Aldeyra's lead investigational drug product candidates are first-in-class potential treatments in development for dry eye disease, allergic conjunctivitis, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome.

<b>Phase 3 '215 and Children's Oncology Group (COG) Studies Both Stopped Early Due to Treatment Benefit of BLINCYTO Over Chemotherapy</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Sept. 24, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the results of a prespecified interim analysis of an open-label, randomized, controlled global multicenter Phase 3 trial (20120215) showed that the primary endpoint of event-free survival was met. The study evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (blinatumomab) compared to conventional consolidation chemotherapy in pediatric patients with high-risk, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at first relapse. Enrollment was terminated early due to encouraging efficacy in the BLINCYTO arm and was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Follow up will continue as prescribed per protocol.
In addition, a randomized, Phase 3 trial (AALL1331) conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) using BLINCYTO in pediatric B-cell ALL patients at first relapse has closed to accrual for the high-risk and intermediate risk-arm based on the recommendation of the COG DMC. The DMC closure decision was based on a strong trend towards improved disease-free survival and improved overall survival, markedly lower toxicity, and better minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance for BLINCYTO compared to chemotherapy. The COG DMC recommended that the AALL1331 low-risk group continue to enroll and randomize patients until enrollment goals are reached. AALL1331 is sponsored by the Cancer Therapy Evaulation Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and is conducted by the NCI-funded COG. Amgen provided BLINCYTO for AALL1331 under a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement between the NCI and Amgen.
""Considered together, the results of these studies are remarkable. Children and adolescents who relapse with acute lymphoblastic leukemia face a poor prognosis and there remains a need for additional treatment options, particularly for those that are identified as high-risk. These data have the potential to be practice-changing and may provide a treatment approach to prevent further relapse that is superior to chemotherapy,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""We look forward to discussing these data with regulatory authorities.""
The BLINCYTO adverse events observed in the Phase 3 20120215 and the COG AALL1331 studies were consistent with the known safety profile of BLINCYTO. These interim data will be submitted to a future medical conference and for publication.
<b>About the 20120215 Study</b>
Study 20120215 is a Phase 3 open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate event-free survival after treatment with BLINCYTO compared with standard of care consolidation chemotherapy in pediatric patients with high-risk first relapsed B-cell ALL. Key secondary endpoints included incidence of overall survival and MRD response, AEs, 100-day mortality after alloHSCT, incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation, cumulative incidence of relapse. This is a global study that is being conducted as part of the PIP (Pediatric Investigation Plan) agreed to between Amgen and the EMA. The study is being conducted in Australia and various countries in EU and Latin America.

<b>About the COG AALL1331 Study</b>
The COG AALL1331 study is a risk-stratified, randomized, Phase 3 trial of blinatumomab in first relapse of pediatric B-ALL to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) of high-risk (HR) and intermediate-risk (IR) relapsed B-ALL patients who are randomized following induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab. It also compares the DFS of low risk (LR) relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following block 1 chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival of HR, IR, and LR relapsed B-ALL patients. This is a global study that is being conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and United States.

<b>About BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (blinatumomab)</b>
BLINCYTO is a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T cell engager (BiTE<sup>®</sup>) antibody construct that binds specifically to CD19 expressed on the surface of cells of B-lineage origin and CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells.
BiTE antibody constructs are a type of immunotherapy being investigated for fighting cancer by helping the body's immune system to detect and target malignant cells. The modified antibodies are designed to engage two different targets simultaneously, thereby juxtaposing T cells (a type of white blood cell capable of killing other cells perceived as threats) to cancer cells. BiTE antibody constructs help place the T cells within reach of the targeted cell, with the intent of allowing T cells to inject toxins and trigger the cancer cell to die (apoptosis). BiTE antibody constructs are currently being investigated for their potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.
BLINCYTO was granted breakthrough therapy and priority review designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children.</li>
 	<li>B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and children.
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD response rate and hematological relapse-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.</li>
</ul>
In the EU, BLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).</li>
 	<li>adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%.</li>
 	<li>paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</li>
</ul>
<b>About BiTE<sup>®</sup> Technology</b>
Bispecific T cell engager (BiTE<sup>®</sup>) technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform designed to engage patients' own T cells to any tumor-specific antigen, activating the cytotoxic potential of T cells to eliminate detectable cancer. BiTE antibody constructs are currently being investigated for their potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.

<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME and NEUROLOGICAL TOXICITIES</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> and treat with corticosteroids as recommended.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Neurological toxicities, which may be severe, life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> as recommended.</b></li>
</ul>
Contraindications
BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to blinatumomab or to any component of the product formulation.
Warnings and Precautions
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in 15% of patients with R/R ALL and in 7% of patients with MRD-positive ALL. The median time to onset of CRS is 2 days after the start of infusion and the median time to resolution of CRS was 5 days among cases that resolved. Closely monitor and advise patients to contact their healthcare professional for signs and symptoms of serious adverse events such as fever, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased total bilirubin (TBILI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The manifestations of CRS after treatment with BLINCYTO<b><sup>®</sup></b> overlap with those of infusion reactions, capillary leak syndrome, and hemophagocytic histiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. If severe CRS occurs, interrupt BLINCYTO<b><sup>®</sup></b> until CRS resolves. Discontinue BLINCYTO<b><sup>®</sup></b>permanently if life-threatening CRS occurs. Administer corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CRS.</li>
 	<li>Neurological Toxicities: Approximately 65% of patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> in clinical trials experienced neurological toxicities. The median time to the first event was within the first 2 weeks of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment and the majority of events resolved. The most common (= 10%) manifestations of neurological toxicity were headache and tremor. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal neurological toxicities occurred in approximately 13% of patients, including encephalopathy, convulsions, speech disorders, disturbances in consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. Manifestations of neurological toxicity included cranial nerve disorders. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> as outlined in the PI.</li>
 	<li>Infections: Approximately 25% of patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> in clinical trials experienced serious infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, and catheter-site infections, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. Administer prophylactic antibiotics and employ surveillance testing as appropriate during treatment. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of infection and treat appropriately, including interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> as needed.</li>
 	<li>Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed. Preventive measures, including pretreatment nontoxic cytoreduction and on-treatment hydration, should be used during BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of TLS and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> as needed to manage these events.</li>
 	<li>Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed. Monitor appropriate laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count) during BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> infusion and interrupt BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> if prolonged neutropenia occurs.</li>
 	<li>Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Due to the possibility of neurological events, including seizures, patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> are at risk for loss of consciousness, and should be advised against driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> is being administered.</li>
 	<li>Elevated Liver Enzymes: Transient elevations in liver enzymes have been associated with BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment with a median time to onset of 3 days. In patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>, although the majority of these events were observed in the setting of CRS, some cases of elevated liver enzymes were observed outside the setting of CRS, with a median time to onset of 19 days. Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes occurred in approximately 7% of patients outside the setting of CRS and resulted in treatment discontinuation in less than 1% of patients. Monitor ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and TBILI prior to the start of and during BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment. BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment should be interrupted if transaminases rise to &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if TBILI rises to &gt; 3 times ULN.</li>
 	<li>Pancreatitis: Fatal pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> in combination with dexamethasone in clinical trials and the post-marketing setting. Evaluate patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> and dexamethasone as needed.</li>
 	<li>Leukoencephalopathy: Although the clinical significance is unknown, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>, especially in patients previously treated with cranial irradiation and antileukemic chemotherapy.</li>
 	<li>Preparation and administration errors have occurred with BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment. Follow instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration in the PI strictly to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose).</li>
 	<li>Immunization: Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> treatment, during treatment, and until immune recovery following last cycle of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup>.</li>
 	<li>Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative: Serious and fatal adverse reactions including ""gasping syndrome,"" which is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations, can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs including BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (with preservative). When prescribing BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (with preservative) for pediatric patients, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> (with preservative) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. Due to the addition of bacteriostatic saline, 7-day bags of BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> solution for infusion with preservative contain benzyl alcohol and are not recommended for use in any patients weighing &lt; 22 kg.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Adverse Reactions</u></b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The most common adverse reactions (= 20%) in clinical trial experience of patients with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL (BLAST Study) treated with BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> were pyrexia (91%), infusion-related reactions (77%), headache (39%), infections (pathogen unspecified [39%]), tremor (31%), and chills (28%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 61% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (= 2%) included pyrexia, tremor, encephalopathy, aphasia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, overdose, device related infection, seizure, and staphylococcal infection.</li>
 	<li>The most common adverse reactions (= 20%) in clinical trial experience of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL (TOWER Study) treated with BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> were infections (bacterial and pathogen unspecified), pyrexia, headache, infusion-related reactions, anemia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 62% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (= 2%) included febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, sepsis, pneumonia, overdose, septic shock, CRS, bacterial sepsis, device related infection, and bacteremia.</li>
 	<li>Adverse reactions that were observed more frequently (= 10%) in the pediatric population compared to the adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL were pyrexia (80% vs. 61%), hypertension (26% vs. 8%), anemia (41% vs. 24%), infusion-related reaction (49% vs. 34%), thrombocytopenia (34% vs. 21%), leukopenia (24% vs. 11%), and weight increased (17% vs. 6%).</li>
 	<li>In pediatric patients less than 2 years old (infants), the incidence of neurologic toxicities was not significantly different than for the other age groups, but its manifestations were different; the only event terms reported were agitation, headache, insomnia, somnolence, and irritability. Infants also had an increased incidence of hypokalemia (50%) compared to other pediatric age cohorts (15-20%) or adults (17%).</li>
</ul>
Dosage and Administration Guidelines
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>BLINCYTO<sup>®</sup> is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at a constant flow rate using an infusion pump which should be programmable, lockable, non-elastomeric, and have an alarm.</li>

<b>Forward-Looking Statements</b>
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on  Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project.  Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.
Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

<strong>COPENHAGEN, Denmark, September 24, 2019</strong> – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA, OTC: BVNRY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved JYNNEOS™ (Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine, Live, Non-replicating) (MVA-BN<sup>®</sup>, liquid-frozen) for prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection. JYNNEOS is the only approved non-replicating smallpox vaccine in the U.S. and the only approved monkeypox vaccine anywhere in the world.
JYNNEOS is approved for use broadly, including in people with weakened immune systems and those with eczema or with household members with eczema. This approval is a major breakthrough in meeting the U.S. government’s long-standing commitment to developing a vaccine that can be administered to people who are at high risk of adverse reaction to traditional, replicating smallpox vaccines.
“The licensure of this vaccine not only enhances domestic biodefense and global health security but also demonstrates what can be accomplished for the American people through public-private partnerships,” said Rick Bright, Ph.D., HHS deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response and director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). “The years of dedication working with Bavarian Nordic on this vaccine ultimately mean that the U.S. is better prepared to save lives if an emergency occurs involving one of the deadliest diseases the world has ever known.”
“The FDA approval of JYNNEOS is a tremendous milestone for both our company and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,” said Paul Chaplin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bavarian Nordic. “Together, we have shown that it is possible to develop a safe and effective medical countermeasure for national security threats like smallpox. JYNNEOS is the culmination of a fifteen-year partnership that started with a call from the NIH for a safer smallpox vaccine, successfully transitioned to BARDA and was delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile for use in an emergency. We are committed to the continued supply of vaccines to the U.S. and thank them for their global leadership on biodefense. We are also particularly pleased with the additional indication to protect against monkeypox that creates new commercial opportunities for JYNNEOS.”
Concurrent with the approval, FDA granted Bavarian Nordic a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) under the Material Threat Medical Countermeasure PRV program. A PRV can be used to accelerate the FDA’s review of a future human drug application and is also transferrable. The Company intends to sell the voucher to a third party.
<strong>Conference call and webcast
</strong>The management of Bavarian Nordic will host a conference call tomorrow, September 25, 2019 at 3 pm CEST (9 am EST) to discuss the FDA approval of JYNNEOS. Dial-in numbers and further details will be provided in advance of the call on: <a href=""http://www.bavarian-nordic.com/investor/events.aspx?event=5713"">/investor/events.aspx?event=5713</a>.
<strong>About monkeypox</strong>
Monkeypox is a rare viral zoonotic disease (transmission from animals to humans) similar to human smallpox, whose causative agent, variola virus, is also a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus. However, monkeypox infection is less transmissible human-to-human than smallpox and also less deadly (case fatality estimates for monkeypox are up to 10%). Orthopoxvirus infections produce antibody responses that are cross-protective against other viruses within the genus. It is this property of orthopoxviruses that allows JYNNEOS to be used as a vaccine against both smallpox and monkeypox.
Until recently, infections of monkeypox in humans had mostly been limited to central and western regions of Africa, where the virus is naturally occurring. However, during the ongoing monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria, increased human-to-human transmission has been observed and the wide geographic spread, predominantly in urban areas, has raised concerns over the disease. The recent cases of monkeypox observed in the UK, Israel and Singapore all originated from Nigeria, demonstrating that the virus is no longer a domestic challenge only. Nigeria is Africa’s largest country by both population and economy, including the large oil and gas industry, which employs a significant number of local and foreign employees. It is estimated that more than five million people travel to countries affected by monkeypox in Central Africa each year, suggesting a market potential for a monkeypox vaccine for travelers.
<strong>About smallpox</strong>
Smallpox is a highly contagious and deadly disease, which was eradicated worldwide by 1980 after a global vaccination campaign, and no longer occurs naturally. Unique to humans, the disease is caused by the variola virus, and is transmitted from person to person through direct contact with contaminated fluids and objects, as well as through the air. Historically, about 30% of those who became infected with smallpox died from the illness.
Despite being eradicated, smallpox is considered by many governments to be a significant bioterrorism threat and as routine vaccination stopped in the 1970’s, the majority of the world’s population today are highly vulnerable. Re-emergence of smallpox could occur as result of deliberate or accidental release of samples that are kept for research purposes or may be synthesized in a lab.
<strong>About JYNNEOS™</strong>
JYNNEOS is a suspension for subcutaneous injection (0.5 mL) based on a live, attenuated vaccinia virus (Modified Vaccinia Ankara, MVA-BN), incapable of replicating in the body, yet still capable of eliciting a potent immune response. The vaccine was developed in partnership with the U.S. Government to ensure all populations can be protected from smallpox, including people with weakened immune systems or who are at high risk of adverse reactions to traditional smallpox vaccines, which are based on replicating vaccinia virus strains. Typical severe adverse reactions known for replicating vaccinia virus strains, such as myocarditis, encephalitis, generalized vaccinia or eczema vaccinatum, were not observed during the clinical development program of JYNNEOS.
The approval of JYNNEOS for smallpox is based on a comprehensive development program, comprising a total of 7871 individuals aged 18 through 80 years who received at least 1 dose (7109 smallpox vaccine-naïve and 762 smallpox vaccine-experienced individuals) in 22 clinical trials, including two Phase 3 studies, the latter of which showed non-inferiority in terms of immunogenicity measured by plaque reduction neutralization test of JYNNEOS compared to ACAM2000, the other U.S. licensed, replicating smallpox vaccine.
The approval for monkeypox is based on survival data obtained in lethal monkeypox virus challenge studies in non-human primates. Overall survival in various models ranged from 80% to 100% of JYNNEOS-vaccinated animals compared to 0-40% in control animals.
The safety of JYNNEOS was evaluated in smallpox vaccine-naïve healthy adults, in healthy adults previously vaccinated with a smallpox vaccine, in HIV-infected adults, and in adults with atopic dermatitis.
The most common (&gt;10%) adverse reactions associated with JYNNEOS were injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, induration, itching) and systemic adverse reactions such as muscle pain, headache, fatigue, nausea, myalgia and chills. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 0.05% of subjects who received JYNNEOS and included Crohn’s disease, sarcoidosis, extraocular muscle paresis and throat tightness. Cardiac adverse reactions of special interest were reported in 0.08% of subjects who received JYNNEOS and included tachycardia, electrocardiogram T wave inversion, electrocardiogram abnormal, electrocardiogram ST segment elevation, electrocardiogram T wave abnormal, and palpitations.

Bavarian Nordic has received significant support during the development of JYNNEOS from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Bavarian Nordic has to-date delivered 28 million doses of liquid-frozen MVA-BN to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile for emergency use. The Company has an ongoing ten-year contract with BARDA to replenish and potentially expand the stockpile, which has expired, with a freeze-dried formulation of the vaccine. A Phase 3 lot consistency study of the freeze-dried formulation is currently ongoing to support the approval of this formulation.
MVA-BN is also approved in the EU under the trade name IMVANEX<sup>®</sup> for active immunization against smallpox of the general adult population, including people with weakened immune systems (people diagnosed with HIV or atopic dermatitis), and in Canada under the trade name IMVAMUNE<sup>®</sup> for active immunization against smallpox in a public health emergency for persons 18 years of age and older who are contraindicated to replicating smallpox vaccines.

<p align=""center""><em>– Danicopan Phase 2 PNH combination therapy topline data expected Q4 2019 –</em>
<em>– Initiation of Phase 3 planned for early 2020 –</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">BLUE BELL, Pa., Sept. 25, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACHN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients and families affected by complement-mediated diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for danicopan (ACH-4471) for treatment in combination with a C5 monoclonal antibody for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who are sub-optimal responders to  a C5 inhibitor alone.  The FDA’s decision was based on positive safety and efficacy data from the ongoing danicopan Phase 2 PNH combination trial. Interim data was reported at the New Era of Aplastic Anemia and PNH Meeting in May 2019. The top line data from this combination trial is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>
“The FDA’s granting of Breakthrough Therapy designation for our lead oral factor D inhibitor, danicopan, underscores the urgent need for new treatment options for patients living with PNH,” said Joe Truitt, President and Chief Executive Officer at Achillion. “Danicopan, with its demonstrated ability to limit both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis with oral administration, has the potential to benefit a significant number of patients with PNH that continue to have an unmet medical need on standard of care. We appreciate the review and decision by the FDA and plan to work closely with the Agency in advancing the development of danicopan into Phase 3 in early 2020.”
<p align=""justify"">FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions. Receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA indicates preliminary clinical evidence has demonstrated the drug may provide substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint compared with currently available therapy. The benefits of this Breakthrough Therapy designation include more intensive guidance from FDA on an efficient drug development program, access to a scientific liaison to help accelerate review time and eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review if relevant criteria are met. Danicopan (ACH-4471) has previously received orphan drug designation for the treatment of PNH in 2017.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)</strong></p>
PNH is a rare, acquired blood disease caused by a somatic mutation resulting in the absence of key receptors, CD55 and CD59, on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). The alternative pathway (AP) of the complement system recognizes these unprotected RBCs as foreign and destroys them in the circulatory system (intravascular hemolysis) and in the liver or spleen (extravascular hemolysis). The current standard of care for PNH targets intravascular hemolysis by inhibiting C5 complement protein (C5), leaving some patients with persistent extravascular hemolysis from early phases of complement activation (AP Activity) which C5 inhibition cannot address leaving patients with partial control of their PNH. Up to seventy-five percent of PNH patients treated with C5 inhibitors remain anemic during treatment, with up to one-third of those patients reporting the need for blood transfusions within the last year. Factor D is the critical, rate-limiting protein within the AP. By targeting Factor D, proximal AP inhibition may disable both downstream terminal complement activation (IVH) and upstream C3 fragment opsonization (EVH). Achillion is developing a potentially more complete approach to PNH with factor D inhibition to selectively block alternative pathway activity and protect against both destructive processes of RBCs in PNH with convenient oral therapies.

<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Achillion Complement Factor D Portfolio</strong>
Achillion has leveraged its internal discovery capabilities and a novel complement-related platform to develop oral small molecule drug candidates that are inhibitors of complement factor D. Factor D is an essential serine protease involved in the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement system, a part of the innate immune system. Achillion's complement platform is focused on seeking to advance oral small molecules that inhibit the AP and can potentially be used in the treatment of immune-related diseases in which complement AP plays a critical role. Potential indications currently being evaluated for these compounds include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), and immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN).</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Achillion Pharmaceuticals
</strong>Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACHN) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing its oral small molecule complement inhibitors into late-stage development and commercialization. Research has shown that an overactive complement system plays a critical role in multiple disease conditions including the therapeutic areas of nephrology, hematology, ophthalmology and neurology. Achillion is initially focusing its drug development activities on complement-mediated diseases where there are no approved therapies or where existing therapies are inadequate for patients. Potential indications being evaluated for its compounds include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), and immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN).

New ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler Results in 61% Fewer Leaks at the Staple Line1
<strong>Cincinnati, OH – Sept. 24, 2019 –</strong> To help address a serious complication associated with colorectal, gastric and thoracic surgery, Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Devices Companies* announced today that Ethicon** has launched the industry’s first powered circular stapler. The ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler reduces leaks by 61% at the staple line compared to Medtronic’s DST Series™ EEA™ Stapler.<sup> 1</sup>
The new ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler combines two innovative Ethicon technologies -- 3D Stapling Technology that evenly distributes compression<sup>2</sup> and Gripping Surface Technology (GST), which provides gentler handling to reduce compressive forces on tissues.<sup>3</sup> Together these technologies significantly reduce leaks at the staple line without compromising perfusion,<sup>4</sup> which includes the passage of fluid through the blood stream or lymphatic system.
Anastomosis is a procedure where surgeons reconnect healthy tissue after a diseased area is removed. For example, in colorectal surgery, when part of an intestine is taken out during surgery, the remaining two ends are surgically reattached with sutures or staples. If not attached securely, an anastomotic leak can occur, which can lead to increased length of hospital stay, increased healthcare costs, and/or death.<sup>5,6 </sup>
“The ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler gives me the confidence that I can create a secure and more reproducible anastomosis,” said Ron Landmann, MD, FASCRS, Section Chief of Colon and Rectal Surgery at Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center, Jacksonville, Florida.*** “The new 3D technology and Gripping Surface Technology allows for the creation of air-tight and fluid-tight anastomoses that can help reduce the risk of complications from leaks which can have a significant impact on patient outcomes.”
The ECHELON CIRCULAR’s one-finger push button firing reduces force to fire by 97 percent<sup>7</sup> and delivers 37 percent less movement at the distal tip for increased stability.<sup>8</sup> By significantly reducing force to fire<sup>7</sup> and increasing stability<sup>8</sup>, the advanced stapling device standardizes performance and helps minimize variation in usage, which may lead to improved outcomes.
“Ethicon looks at the entire surgical experience for opportunities to enhance patient outcomes, increase patient satisfaction and reduce cost to healthcare systems. We then bring together our latest science, technology, and evidence to create surgical solutions like the ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler,” said Tom O’Brien, Worldwide President Endomechanical, Ethicon, Inc. “We are relentless in our pursuit of surgical solutions to the most complex and challenging surgical problems and focus on delivering those solutions that deliver the best outcomes in real world clinical settings.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","September 26, 2019 Osaka, JAPAN
Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced further results from the VARSITY study, which demonstrated the superiority of the gut-selective biologic vedolizumab (Entyvio®) to the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNFa) biologic adalimumab (Humira®) in achieving the primary endpoint of clinical remission* at week 52 in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), have been published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).1 Clinical remission rates at week 52 were superior with vedolizumab at 31.3% (n=120/383) versus 22.5% (n=87/386) with adalimumab (p=0.006).1
 
New exploratory data^ published in the NEJM showed vedolizumab achieved higher percentages of clinical remission at week 52 compared to adalimumab in both anti-TNFa-naïve patients (34.2% [n=104/304] vedolizumab vs. 24.3% [n=74/305] adalimumab) and anti-TNFa-experienced patients with UC (20.3% [n=16/79] vedolizumab vs. 16.0% [n=13/81] adalimumab).1 Further exploratory data showed 26.6% (n=102/383) of vedolizumab-treated patients achieved clinical remission at week 14 as compared to 21.2% (n=82/386) treated with adalimumab.1 Durable clinical remission† was achieved in 18.3% (n=70/383) of patients with vedolizumab and 11.9% (n=46/386) of patients with adalimumab respectively.1
 
In the secondary endpoints of the study, treatment with vedolizumab was associated with significantly higher percentages of mucosal healing** at week 52 compared to patients treated with adalimumab (39.7% [n=152/383] vs. 27.7% [n=107/386]; p<0.001).1 Vedolizumab was not superior to adalimumab in the percentage of patients using oral corticosteroids at baseline who discontinued corticosteroids and were in clinical remission*** at week 52 (12.6% [n=14/111] vs. 21.8% [n=26/119]).1 Exploratory results for the median change in oral corticosteroid use from baseline to week 52 were -10.0 mg in the vedolizumab group compared to -7.0 mg in the adalimumab group.1
 
Further exploratory results published in the NEJM showed that treatment with vedolizumab was associated with improvements in quality of life, with 52.0% (n=199/383) of vedolizumab-treated versus 42.2% (n=163/386) of adalimumab-treated patients reporting a =16-point improvement in total Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) scores from baseline to week 52.1 The IBDQ examines the impact of inflammatory bowel disease on four aspects of patients’ lives: symptoms directly related to the primary bowel disturbance, systemic symptoms, and emotional and social function.2
 
“In a chronic, debilitating condition like ulcerative colitis, it is essential that patients gain relief from the many different aspects of the disease,” said Dr. Bruce E. Sands, primary investigator of the VARSITY study and Chief of the Dr. Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology at The Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “The VARSITY results provide physicians with valuable insights to support their treatment decisions when initiating biologic therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis.”
 
An exploratory analysis was also performed to evaluate the effect of vedolizumab and adalimumab therapy on clinical response and absence of active histologic disease. The exploratory analysis showed that 67.1% (n=257/383) of patients receiving vedolizumab achieved clinical response? at week 14 compared to 45.9% (n=177/386) treated with adalimumab.1 A separation between the treatment groups was seen as early as week 6, favoring vedolizumab.3 Absence of active histologic disease±, as defined by the Geboes Score (<3.2) and Robarts Histopathology Index (<5), was achieved at week 52 in 33.4% (n=128/383) and 42.3% (n=162/383) of patients treated with vedolizumab, respectively, compared with 13.7% (n=53/386) and 25.6% (n=99/386) of patients treated with adalimumab, respectively.1
 
“The VARSITY study, a first-of-its-kind comparison of two biologics in ulcerative colitis, shows the benefits vedolizumab treatment provides to patients versus adalimumab across efficacy outcomes, in addition to improvements in overall quality of life,” said Jeff Bornstein, M.D., Executive Medical Director, Takeda. “These data further support the use of vedolizumab as a first-line biologic therapy in ulcerative colitis.”
 
While the study was not powered to compare the safety of the two biologics, patients treated with vedolizumab (62.7%; n=240/383) had a lower percentage of overall adverse events over 52 weeks than patients treated with adalimumab (69.2%; n=267/386). The percentage of serious adverse events was also lower in vedolizumab-treated patients than adalimumab (11.0% [n=42/383] vs. 13.7% [n=53/386] respectively).1 The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was similar in both groups.1
^Exploratory endpoints were not powered for superiority in the VARSITY study. All endpoints other than the primary and two secondary endpoints are considered exploratory endpoints.
* Primary endpoint: Clinical remission is defined as a complete Mayo score of =2 points and no individual subscore ?1 point. Mayo score: instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis.1,4
** Secondary endpoint: Mucosal healing (termed endoscopic improvement in the NEJM publication) is defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of =1 point.1,4
*** Secondary endpoint: Corticosteroid-free clinical remission is defined as patients using oral corticosteroids at baseline (week 0) who have discontinued oral corticosteroids and are in clinical remission at week 52.1,4
† Exploratory endpoint: Durable clinical remission is defined as clinical remission at week 52 among patients in clinical remission at week 14.1
? Exploratory endpoint: Clinical response based on complete Mayo score at week 14 is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of =3 points and =30% from baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of =1point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of =1 point. Patients with missing clinical response status were considered non-responders.1
± Exploratory endpoint: Histologic disease activity is an endpoint assessing the degree of microscopic inflammation in the gut. Absence of active histologic disease (termed minimal histologic disease activity in the NEJM manuscript) is achieved when inflammation is less than a pre-defined severity threshold. Absence of active histologic disease is defined as a Geboes Score (<3.2) or Robarts Histopathology Index (<5).1,5,6

 
About VARSITY
VARSITY is a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multi-center, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab intravenous (IV) compared to adalimumab subcutaneous (SC) at week 52 in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The study treated 769 patients (vedolizumab n=383 or adalimumab n=386), all of whom had inadequate response with, loss of response to, or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or one tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa)-antagonist other than adalimumab prior to being enrolled. Prior TNFa-antagonist exposure was capped at 25% of the patient population in the study, with 609 patients being anti-TNFa-naïve versus 160 being anti-TNFa-experienced.1,4
 
Patients were randomized into one of two treatment groups, vedolizumab IV and placebo SC or adalimumab SC and placebo IV. Patients in the vedolizumab group were administered vedolizumab IV 300 mg at weeks 0, 2, 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter until week 46, along with placebo SC at week 0 and every 2 weeks until week 50. The adalimumab group were administered adalimumab SC 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg every 2 weeks until week 50, along with placebo IV at weeks 0, 2, 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter until week 46. Dose escalation was not permitted in either treatment arm during the study.1,4
 

About Ulcerative Colitis
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).7 UC is a chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract that is often progressive in nature, and involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.8,9 UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort and loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.9,10 The cause of UC is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to the condition.9,11,12
 

About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation.13 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).14 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.15 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.14These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).14,16,17 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.14
 
Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa)-antagonist.13 Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 330,000 patient years of exposure to date.18
 

Therapeutic Indications
 
Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) antagonist.
 
Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) antagonist.
 

Important Safety Information
 
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
 
Special warnings and special precautions for use
Vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.
 
Infusion-related reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.
 
Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the a4ß7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.
 
Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.
 
Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.
 
Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
 
Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 25, 2019</span> /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that its ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I blood test has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As one of the most researched troponin diagnostic tests, doctors in the U.S. can now utilize this proven technology to help detect heart attacks faster and more accurately than contemporary troponin tests.
<b>Transforming cardiac disease diagnosis</b>
An estimated 840,000 Americans die of cardiovascular diseases each year.<sup>1</sup> Even as cardiovascular care advances, heart disease remains the leading cause of death.<sup>1</sup> Timing is a critical factor in helping doctors diagnose and treat those having a potential heart attack.
When people enter the emergency room with a suspected heart attack, doctors typically use a troponin blood test to help aid in their diagnosis. Troponin-I proteins are released from the heart and can be found at elevated levels in the blood when the heart muscle has been damaged. Abbott's High Sensitivity Troponin-I blood test measures very low levels of troponin, allowing doctors to evaluate heart attack in patients within two to four hours of admission.
Women may particularly benefit from this technology as they often have lower levels of troponin than men, which could lead to an undiagnosed heart attack with contemporary troponin tests.<sup> 2</sup>
""The addition of Abbott's high sensitivity troponin-I assay to the laboratory's diagnostic testing menu is a great step forward to help laboratory scientists and clinicians better evaluate patients suspected of having a heart attack,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Fred Apple</span>, Ph.D., co-director of Clinical and Forensic Toxicology Laboratory at Hennepin Healthcare/Hennepin County Medical Center and professor, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at the <span class=""xn-org"">University of Minnesota</span>.
""Our research using this high sensitivity assay has demonstrated it can provide doctors with the ability to detect or rule out a heart attack earlier. This ability could help hospitals with more rapid triage and management of those diagnosed with a heart attack, as well as being able to safely discharge patients earlier on, resulting in savings to the healthcare system.""
<b>Robust body of evidence supports Abbott's highly sensitive troponin-I test</b>
Abbott's blood test, known as High Sensitive Troponin-I in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span>, has been used throughout hospitals internationally and researched in more than 200 studies for its role in identifying heart disease and cardiac events, including:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Abbott's High Sensitive Troponin-I test was the first test outside of the U.S. to offer gender-specific cut-offs, allowing physicians to more accurately diagnose heart attacks in women. A study published in the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2590891-1&amp;h=2158798971&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1136%2Fbmj.g7873&amp;a=British+Medical+Journal"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">British Medical Journal</a> found Abbott's test uncovered twice as many heart attacks in women than standard troponin tests.<sup>2</sup></li>
 	<li>A study published in <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2590891-1&amp;h=1088016&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736(15)00391-8%2Ffulltext&amp;a=The+Lancet"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">The Lancet</a> found the test may help doctors rule out heart attack sooner for two-thirds of patients who were suspected of having a heart attack.<sup>3</sup> This allows doctors to discharge patients more quickly and avoid unnecessary further testing.</li>
 	<li>Research in the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2590891-1&amp;h=2985627142&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F22203537&amp;a=Journal+of+the+American+Medical+Association+(JAMA)"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</a> found that detecting a change in troponin levels using the high sensitivity test over the first three hours after admission could facilitate an early diagnosis of heart attacks.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>
Doctors can also be confident in the results they receive because Abbott's core laboratory diagnostic tests, including our troponin test, are by design not affected by biotin interference. Biotin is growing in popularity as a supplement that people believe may improve hair, skin and nails. Recently, the <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2590891-1&amp;h=2151163694&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fnews-events%2Ffda-brief%2Ffda-brief-fda-provides-draft-recommendations-diagnostic-manufacturers-help-reduce-risks-biotin&amp;a=FDA+alerted"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">FDA alerted</a> the public and medical community that biotin can significantly alter some lab test results, including some cardiac tests.
""This important milestone will allow U.S. physicians to utilize the advanced, proven capabilities of this blood test as they evaluate patients suspected of a heart attack,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Agim Beshiri</span>, M.D., senior medical director, global medical and scientific affairs, Diagnostics, Abbott. ""As one of the most widely researched high sensitivity troponin tests, this technology could help address several challenges in emergency departments today, including overcrowding and more accurately identifying heart attacks in women.""
As U.S. hospitals are beginning to use high sensitivity troponin blood tests, education and collaboration among emergency room physicians, lab clinicians and cardiologists are critical. To help with this effort, Abbott will be introducing the Heart Partnership Program. The new program will help hospital care teams implement the blood test into their care pathway – including utilizing technologies that can automate the process – and use the test results to help diagnose patients and better inform treatment plans.
With this clearance, the blood test may be sold in the U.S. for use on Abbott's fully-automated ARCHITECT analyzer. The ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity Troponin-I results should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic information such as electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical observations and information and patient symptoms to aid in the diagnosis of heart attacks.

<span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span>, Sept. 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jazz-pharmaceuticals-presents-positive-jzp-258-phase-3-study-data-at-world-sleep-2019-300925650.html#financial-modal"">JAZZ</a>) announced today that positive data from the Phase 3 study of its investigational medicine, JZP-258, for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy were presented at World Sleep 2019 in <span class=""xn-location"">Vancouver, Canada</span>. Data from the study were presented in an oral presentation today at <span class=""xn-chron"">5:00 p.m. PDT</span> and in a poster presentation on <span class=""xn-chron"">September 24</span>.
""We are pleased with the positive results from the Phase 3 study of JZP-258, which demonstrate the efficacy of JZP-258 for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jed Black</span>, M.D., senior vice president, Sleep and Neuroscience at Jazz Pharmaceuticals and adjunct professor, <span class=""xn-org"">Stanford University</span> Medical Center, Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. ""These data support the efficacy and overall safety profile of a lower-sodium oxybate formulation for people living with narcolepsy, a chronic condition that may require lifelong therapy. There is broad consensus among health care organizations, like the National Academy of Sciences and American Heart Association, that lowering sodium intake lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease. We believe that JZP-258, if approved, will provide a clinically meaningful benefit to patients prescribed oxybate.""
The Phase 3 study of JZP-258 was a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of JZP-258 in the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in adults with narcolepsy. The primary endpoint was the change in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks, and the key secondary endpoint was the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score with JZP-258 compared to placebo. The study enrolled 201 participants and randomized 134 participants, comprising a heterogeneous population, which included those previously treated with sodium oxybate and naïve to sodium oxybate, with or without other anticataplectic treatments. A randomized-withdrawal study design aims to measure efficacy – specifically, maintenance of effect – for participants who continue on active treatment – and worsening for participants randomized to placebo.
The study design included an optimization and titration period of up to 12 weeks, a JZP-258 stable-dose period of two weeks, followed by 1:1 randomization to either JZP-258 or placebo for two weeks. After the completion of the double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period, patients had the opportunity to receive JZP-258 in an optional 24 week open-label safety extension period. More information about the study design is available at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2590283-1&amp;h=2029541057&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2F&amp;a=www.clinicaltrials.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>(identifier: NCT03030599).
During the double-blind withdrawal period, there was a significant increase in median weekly number of cataplexy attacks in participants randomized to placebo compared with participants randomized to JZP-258 (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.35 [0.00, 11.61] vs 0.00 [-0.49, 1.75], respectively; treatment difference, P&lt;0.0001).
As expected, initial cataplexy rates differed based on prior therapy at study entry, with participants taking sodium oxybate only or sodium oxybate and an antidepressant/anticataplectic reporting the least cataplexy at study entry. In participants taking sodium oxybate only at study entry, cataplexy was stable with JZP-258 treatment across the open-label treatment titration and optimization period and the stable dose period (SDP). In those taking sodium oxybate and an antidepressant/anticataplectic at study entry, cataplexy was  stable during initial titration of JZP-258, increased during taper and discontinuation of the other anticataplectic, and stabilized during SDP. In participants taking an anticataplectic other than sodium oxybate at study entry, cataplexy decreased during initial titration of JZP-258, increased during taper and discontinuation of the other anticataplectic and stabilized during SDP. In cataplexy treatment-naïve participants, cataplexy decreased consistently from week one of JZP- 258 titration through the end of SDP.
At the end of the double-blind withdrawal period, there was a significant increase in median ESS scores in participants randomized to placebo compared with participants randomized to JZP- 258 (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.0 [0.0, 5.0] vs 0.0 [-1.0, 1.0], respectively; treatment difference, P&lt;0.0001). Additionally, both patient and clinician ratings of change in narcolepsy symptoms overall (PGIc and CGIc) indicated worsening in more participants randomized to placebo compared with participants randomized to JZP-258 ('Much Worse' or 'Very Much Worse' scores for placebo vs JZP-258: PGIc, 44.6% vs 4.3%; CGIc, 60.0% vs 5.9%; P&lt;0.0001 [nominal]).
""It's encouraging to see these positive results from the Phase 3 study, as JZP-258 may represent an important and novel product candidate for people with narcolepsy with the benefit of a 92% reduction in sodium compared to sodium oxybate,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Richard K. Bogan</span>, MD, FCCP, FAASM, associate clinical professor at the <span class=""xn-org"">University of South Carolina</span> School of Medicine, chief medical officer at SleepMed in <span class=""xn-location"">Columbia, SC</span> and lead investigator of this study. ""This is important for people living with narcolepsy because narcolepsy is a chronic condition that may require lifelong treatment, and is associated with increased risk of comorbid conditions, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease.""
The overall safety profile in the Phase 3 study of JZP-258 was consistent with that reported in clinical trials of sodium oxybate. The most common adverse events reported by =5% of participants while taking JZP-258 in the Phase 3 study were headache, nausea and dizziness. Two participants experienced serious adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be treatment-related (confusional state and visual hallucination after accidental JZP-258 overdose; muscle enzymes increased one day after the end of placebo treatment).
<b>About Narcolepsy<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.<sup>1</sup> It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, with symptoms typically appearing in childhood. It is estimated that more than 50% of people with narcolepsy have not been diagnosed.<sup>2</sup> Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis.<sup>3</sup>Excessive daytime sleepiness is the primary symptom of narcolepsy and is present in all people with the disorder.<sup>4</sup>Excessive daytime sleepiness is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in drowsiness and unplanned lapses into sleep.<sup>2,4,5</sup> There are five primary symptoms of narcolepsy, including excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.<sup>6</sup> While all people with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness, not all individuals with narcolepsy experience all five symptoms.<sup>7,8</sup>
<b>About Cataplexy<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Cataplexy, the most specific symptom of narcolepsy, is the sudden, generally brief (&lt;2 minutes) loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness. It is usually triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, surprise, or anger.<sup>7,8,9</sup> Although many emotions can potentially lead to cataplexy, those associated with mirth are usually the most potent.<sup>7</sup> Cataplexy occurs in about 70% of people with narcolepsy.<sup>10</sup> Presentation differs widely among people with narcolepsy, ranging from sporadic partial attacks triggered by laughter to frequent complete collapse brought about by a variety of emotions.<sup>6,7</sup> Complete collapse is less common.<sup>8</sup> More commonly, episodes of cataplexy involve only certain muscle groups, such as arms and legs (e.g., knees buckling), the head and neck (e.g., head dropping), or the face and jaw (e.g., sagging, slurred speech, eyelid drooping).<sup>7,8,9,10</sup>
<b>About JZP-258<br class=""dnr"" /></b>JZP-258 is an investigational product being evaluated in adults for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, as well as for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia. JZP-258 is a novel oxybate product candidate with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92% less sodium than Xyrem<sup>®</sup> (sodium oxybate). While the exact mechanism of action of JZP-258 is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of JZP-258 on sleep/wake symptoms are mediated through modulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> during sleep.

<p align=""justify"">Innate Pharma SA (the “Company” or “Innate” - Euronext Paris: FR0010331421 – IPH), today announced that AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) will advance monalizumab into a Phase III randomized clinical trial evaluating monalizumab in combination with cetuximab in patients suffering from recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and the companies will co-fund the trial. The trial initiation is expected in 2020, subject to regulatory and compliance approvals.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>“This is an important scientific milestone as we continue to invest in innovation and advance our late-stage clinical development pipeline,”</em> <strong>said Mondher Mahjoubi, Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma</strong>.<em> “Together with AstraZeneca, we are working diligently to progress this potential novel treatment for head and neck cancer patients, a population with a high unmet medical need.”      </em></p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Innate-AstraZeneca monalizumab agreement:</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">On April 24 2015, the Company signed a co-development and commercialization agreement with AstraZeneca to accelerate and broaden the development of monalizumab.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The financial terms of the agreement include potential cash payments of up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma. The Company has already received $350 million, and the next payment due by AstraZeneca is $100 million upon dosing of the first patient in a first Phase III clinical trial. AstraZeneca will book all sales and will pay Innate low double-digit to mid-teen percentage royalties on net sales worldwide except in Europe where Innate Pharma will receive 50% share of the profits and losses in the territory. Innate will co-fund 30% of the costs of the Phase III development program of monalizumab with a pre-agreed limitation of Innate’s financial commitment.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Monalizumab:</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.</p>
<p align=""justify"">NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E, cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Hence, monalizumab may re-establish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells. Monalizumab may also enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies.</p>
<p align=""justify"">AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab in October 2018 through a co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015. The ongoing Phase II development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in combination strategies.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Cetuximab:</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody.  NK cells mediate cetuximab-induced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against SCCHN, and genetic and preclinical experiments suggest that ADCC can be enhanced by NK-stimulators.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The activity of cetuximab as a single agent in recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN is limited, with a 12.6% overall response rate, a median time to progression of 2.3 months and a median overall survival of 5.8 months (Vermorken et al, JCO 2007).</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Innate Pharma:</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Innate is a commercial stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Innate’s commercial-stage product, Lumoxiti, in-licensed from AstraZeneca, was approved by the FDA in September 2018. Lumoxiti is a first-in class specialty oncology product for hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Innate’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Innate has been a pioneer in the understanding of NK cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens, as well as antibody engineering. This innovative approach has resulted in a diversified proprietary portfolio and major alliances with leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry including Bristol-Myers Squibb Novo Nordisk A/S, Sanofi, and a multi-products collaboration with AstraZeneca.</p>

<h3 class=""subhead-gnw"">Medtronic Continues to Invest in Scientific Evidence for Expansion of Indications and Greater Clinical Understanding of Infuse™ Bone Graft</h3>
<strong>DUBLIN and CHICAGO, Sept. 26, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- </strong>Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced U.S. FDA approval of a prospective, randomized pivotal clinical trial for the use of Infuse™ Bone Graft in Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) spine procedures. A TLIF is a type of surgery that fuses – or joins – bones of the spine through a posterior approach. It is used to treat certain painful conditions of the lumbar – or low back – region of the spine.
<p align=""start"">""The potential to expand the indications for use of Infuse in posterior spine procedures may give a broader group of patients access to this novel biologic technology,"" said Dr. Joseph D. Smucker, an orthopedic spine surgeon with the Indiana Spine Group and principal investigator in the clinical trial. “When considering the patient, site, and procedure, Infuse can be a powerful option in a spine surgeon’s armamentarium. This study has the potential to add to the broader clinical and scientific evidence regarding use of Infuse, and may allow surgeons to better understand its safe and effective use in TLIF procedures.”</p>
<p align=""start"">Medtronic has initiated site recruitment for the TLIF clinical trial with the potential to enroll up to 50 sites with over 1,000 patients. In 2017, Medtronic announced the FDA approval of a separate clinical trial to study Infuse Bone Graft in Posterolateral Fusion (PLF) procedures. The company is currently enrolling its prospective pilot PLF clinical trial and is working with the FDA to incorporate retrospective safety and effectiveness data sufficient for indication expansion in PLF.</p>
<p align=""start"">""With 17 years of clinical use, Infuse Bone Graft has become one of the most extensively-researched biologic technologies commercially available today,"" said Jacob Paul, senior vice president and president of Medtronic's Spine division, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group. ""Medtronic continues to invest in scientific evidence on Infuse to continue adding to the growing body of clinical data, and we believe these trials will generate additional data to expand indications, increase access to surgeons, and alleviate pain and restore health for patients around the world.""</p>
<p align=""start"">Infuse Bone Graft has been on the market since 2002 and has been trusted clinically in over two million patients worldwide to date<sup>*</sup>. The product is FDA-approved for certain spine, oral-maxillofacial and orthopedic trauma surgeries. In spine surgery, Infuse is used with certain Medtronic interbody fusion devices at a single level for patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) and eliminates the need to harvest bone from the patient's body in a secondary surgical procedure.</p>
<p align=""start"">The use of Infuse Bone Graft in TLIF and PLF procedures is investigational only.</p>

MAVYRET is a pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free treatment that combines glecaprevir (100mg), an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and pibrentasvir (40mg), an NS5A inhibitor, dosed as three tablets taken at the same time once daily with food.
MAVYRET is an 8-week, pan-genotypic option for treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, who comprise the majority of people living with HCV. MAVYRET is also approved as a treatment for patients with specific treatment challenges, including those (GT1) not cured by prior treatment experience to either a protease inhibitor or NS5A inhibitor (but not both), and in patients with limited treatment options, such as those with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those with genotype 3 chronic HCV. MAVYRET is a pan-genotypic treatment approved for use in patients across all stages of CKD.
Glecaprevir (GLE) was discovered during the ongoing collaboration between AbbVie and Enanta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ENTA) for HCV protease inhibitors and regimens that include protease inhibitors.

<strong>Company Announcement</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>DARZALEX (daratumumab) approved by U.S. FDA in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide (an immunomodulatory agent) and dexamethasone as treatment for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>Approval based on Phase III CASSIOPEIA study</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Copenhagen, Denmark; September 26, 2019 –</strong><strong> Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has approved the use of DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>(daratumumab) in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) as treatment for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). </strong>The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for this indication was submitted by Genmab’s licensing partner, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) in March 2019. The U.S. FDA subsequently granted priority review to the sBLA, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date of September 26, 2019. In August 2012, Genmab granted Janssen Biotech, Inc. an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab.
The approval was based on data from part one of the Phase III CASSIOPEIA study of daratumumab in combination with VTd as treatment for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are candidates for ASCT. The study is sponsored by the French Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) in collaboration with the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) and Janssen.
“Today’s approval is an important step forward for patients with multiple myeloma. There are now three different treatment combinations that include DARZALEX for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma, whether they are eligible for ASCT or not. We are grateful for the efforts of the IMF, HOVON and Janssen that led to the strong data from the CASSIOPEIA trial, which formed the basis of this new approval,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.
<strong>About the CASSIOPEIA (MMY3006) study</strong>
This Phase III study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study, run by the French Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) in collaboration with the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) and Janssen, including 1,085 newly diagnosed patients with previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma who are eligible for high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. In the first part of the study, patients were randomized to receive induction and consolidation treatment with daratumumab combined with bortezomib, thalidomide (an immunomodulatory agent) and dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) or bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone alone. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that achieve a stringent Complete Response (sCR). In the second part of the study (currently ongoing), patients that achieved a response will undergo a second randomization to either receive maintenance treatment of daratumumab 16 mg/kg every 8 weeks for up to 2 years versus no further treatment (observation). The primary endpoint of this part of the study is progression free survival (PFS).
<strong>About multiple myeloma</strong>
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excess proliferation of plasma cells.<sup>1</sup> Multiple myeloma is the third most common blood cancer in the U.S., after leukemia and lymphoma.<sup>2</sup> Approximately 26,000 new patients were expected to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and approximately 13,650 people were expected to die from the disease in the U.S. in 2018.<sup>3</sup> Globally, it was estimated that 160,000 people were diagnosed and 106,000 died from the disease in 2018.<sup>4</sup>  While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms at all, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms which can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.<sup>5</sup>
<strong>About DARZALEX</strong><sup>®</sup><strong>(daratumumab)</strong>
DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> (daratumumab) intravenous infusion is indicated for the treatment of adult patients in the United States:  in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone as treatment for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI); and as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent, or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.<sup>6</sup> DARZALEX is the first monoclonal antibody (mAb) to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) approval to treat multiple myeloma. DARZALEX is indicated in Europe in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; and as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a PI and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. The option to split the first infusion of DARZALEX over two consecutive days has been approved in both Europe and the U.S. In Japan, DARZALEX is approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. DARZALEX is the first human CD38 monoclonal antibody to reach the market in the United Stated, Europe and Japan.

Daratumumab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the CD38 molecule, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells.  Daratumumab triggers a person’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells, resulting in rapid tumor cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action and through immunomodulatory effects, in addition to direct tumor cell death, via apoptosis (programmed cell death).<sup>6,7,8,9,10</sup>
Daratumumab is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. under an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab from Genmab. A comprehensive clinical development program for daratumumab is ongoing, including multiple Phase III studies in smoldering, relapsed and refractory and frontline multiple myeloma settings. Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess the potential of daratumumab in other malignant and pre-malignant diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as amyloidosis, NKT-cell lymphoma and B-cell and T-cell ALL. Daratumumab has received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA for certain indications of multiple myeloma, including as a monotherapy for heavily pretreated multiple myeloma and in combination with certain other therapies for second-line treatment of multiple myeloma.

<p align=""start""><strong>DUBLIN and SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 26, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- </strong>Medtronic plc (NYSE:<a href=""http://www.globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=MDT&amp;exchange=4"">MDT</a>) announced today late-breaking clinical data from the Onyx ONE Global Study, representing the first prospective, multi-center, randomized study evaluating clinical outcomes between two drug-eluting stents (DES) in nearly 2,000 high-bleeding risk (HBR) patients with one month of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). HBR patients are a complex patient population often excluded from stent and drug trials, make up nearly 40% of all percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients, and may be a group that could benefit from shorter DAPT regimens.</p>
<p align=""start"">In the study, Resolute Onyx met its primary composite endpoint of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stent thrombosis (ST) at one-year showing non-inferiority versus the comparator stent, BioFreedom™ DCS<sup>1</sup> – the only DES discussed by the European Society for Cardiology (ESC) in its guidelines for HBR patients that may need one-month DAPT.</p>
<p align=""start"">Results were presented today during a Late-Breaking Clinical Trial session at the 31<sup>st</sup> Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics Conference (TCT), the annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation in San Francisco.</p>
<p align=""start"">“With a growing proportion of PCI patients at a high risk of bleeding, we knew it was critical to generate randomized clinical evidence to evaluate outcomes in this under-represented patient population at increased risk for adverse outcomes,” said Stephan Windecker, M.D., of Bern University Hospital in Switzerland, and principal investigator in the study. “This study provides important advances in evidence for physicians determining the optimal duration of DAPT following PCI among high bleeding risk patients. Data like these are very informative for clinical practice.”</p>
<p align=""start"">In addition to meeting the primary endpoint, the study showed superior acute performance<sup>2</sup> for Resolute Onyx versus BioFreedom, with superior device success of 92.8% versus 89.7%, respectively [p=0.007]. At one year, there was low (2.8%) target lesion revascularization (TLR) for Resolute Onyx versus 4.0% for the comparator stent. Additionally, stent thrombosis (ST) for Resolute Onyx was low (1.3%) versus BioFreedom (2.1%).</p>
<p align=""start"">A landmark analysis conducted after discontinuation of DAPT at one month showed low event rates for Resolute Onyx<sup>3</sup>. At one year, the composite endpoint (cardiac death, ST, myocardial infarction [MI]) of this analysis was 7.5% for Resolute Onyx vs. 8.8% for BioFreedom. Additionally, there was significantly lower MI – 4.3% for Resolute Onyx™ versus 6.8% for BioFreedom (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p align=""start"">The Onyx ONE Global Study is representative of complex clinical practice of HBR patients including those with anticoagulant use, renal failure, upcoming surgery, and recent blood transfusion. The study protocol did not exclude patients based on disease state or anatomical complexity.</p>
<p align=""start"">""We are committed to generating clinical evidence to help clinicians better respond to the needs of complex patient populations,” said Dave Moeller, vice president and general manager of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “Resolute Onyx DES continues to deliver excellent outcomes for a wide range of patients. With these new data presented today, the evidence provides greater confidence in treating complex patients with Resolute Onyx and a shortened course of DAPT.”</p>
<p align=""start"">The Resolute Onyx DES encourages fast vessel healing with its proprietary BioLinx™ polymer, a bio-compatible and non-thrombogenic coating created specifically for use on DES and unique platform design featuring Continuous Sinusoid Technology (CST), which involves forming a single strand of cobalt alloy wire into a sinusoidal wave to construct a stent. The Resolute Onyx DES received CE (Conformité Européene) Mark in September 2014 and FDA approval in April 2017.</p>
<p align=""start"">To date, more than 20,000 patients have been studied in Medtronic clinical trials that have addressed DAPT duration. The Onyx ONE Global Study and Onyx ONE Clear Study make up the Medtronic Onyx ONE Month DAPT Program that has enrolled approximately 2,700 patients at up to 140 sites worldwide.</p>
<p align=""start"">In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers, and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and services that deliver clinical and economic value to the healthcare consumers and providers around the world.</p>

CAMBRIDGE, England--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Ieso Digital Health, a leader in internet-enabled cognitive behavioural therapy (IECBT), today launches Eight Billion Minds™, a new digital therapeutics program aiming to address the global and regional shortages of mental health therapists. Eight Billion Minds is building the next generation of mental healthcare based on analysis of high volume, real-world clinical data from Ieso’s IECBT platform, ThinkWell™, with a vision to make mental health treatments accessible for all. Combining practical knowledge of delivering differentiated clinical outcomes with the application of deep learning to hundreds of thousands of hours of therapy, the company has decoded what works in real-world clinical settings and plans to use new technology to distribute highly personalized therapies on a scale that is just not possible in 1:1 delivery.
Ieso’s real-world data set contains more than 200,000 therapy hours from its ThinkWell technology-enabled 1:1 care platform. Using deep learning models and NLP (natural language processing), Eight Billion Minds quantifies and analyses intervention-outcome associations to gain understanding of therapy-related language and what aspects of psychotherapy are most effective. This learning will be used to create clinically engaging and effective digital therapeutics tools for mental health sufferers where there are simply not enough therapists globally to meet demand. It will also work to improve engagement with, and the efficacy of, traditional therapy delivery. Eight Billion Minds already understands which components of therapy are clinically most effective and has built tools to help enable therapists to diagnose and focus on the elements that have been proven by Ieso to have the most impact on a patient’s chances of recovery.
Dr Andy Blackwell, Group Chief Science and Strategy Officer for Ieso Digital Health, said: “Depression and anxiety impact millions of people from all walks of life, everywhere. Emboldened by significant recent advances in science and engineering, we are launching Eight Billion Minds to catalyse development of a radical new generation of therapeutic solutions for mental health. Using deep learning and our unique data asset we have already made great advances in understanding what works in therapy, right down to individual words. Eight Billion Minds is using the latest technology to encapsulate this in a form that is scalable for distribution globally and removes barriers that are associated with mental healthcare today. We are building the next generation of mental healthcare.”
Depression is now the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting 300 million people across the world<sup>1</sup>, regardless of country income status. Almost two-thirds of lost workdays in the US are caused by mental illness. In the 36 largest countries where treatment is not accessible to everyone, anxiety and depression have resulted in more than 12 billion days of lost productivity<sup>2</sup>. Inaction on mental illness is expected to cost the global economy $16 trillion in the 20-year period ending in 2030<sup>3</sup>.
A global lack of therapists means that this problem cannot be solved through traditional treatment. Half of all countries have 4 or less psychiatrists to every 100,000 people and in low-income countries the ratio is 0.1 to every 100,000<sup>4</sup>. The therapist shortage exists in high-income countries too, with the American Journal of Preventive Medicine reporting that 65% of non-metropolitan US counties do not have a psychiatrist and almost half of non-metropolitan counties (47%) do not have a psychologist<sup>5</sup>.
Dr Blackwell concluded, “With the widespread adoption of consumer technology and substantial advances in mental health science we now have an unprecedented opportunity to take the fight to mental illness globally. We have demonstrated that taking a data-driven approach to mental healthcare results in better outcomes for patients. Empowered by clinical science and deep learning, we will now use these same data to discover and develop a radical new generation of therapeutic solutions for mental health conditions. This is the role of Eight Billion Minds.”

<b>About Gout &amp; URC-102</b>
Gout is a serious, progressive and debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis. In most cases, it is caused by inefficient excretion of uric acid, resulting in hyperuricemia and the formation of crystal deposits of uric acid. At present, the prevalence of hyperuricemia in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> is 10%, and there are about 130 million people at risk. The number of patients who suffer from gout is about 17 million, which has become the second most common metabolic disease in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. In addition, currently available treatments for gout are limited by their efficacy and safety profiles, presenting a huge unmet medical need for the condition.

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today positive top-line results from a second Phase 3 pivotal study evaluating the efficacy and safety of its investigational oral Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, abrocitinib, in patients aged 12 and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). This is the second monotherapy trial in the JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and Safety (JADE) global development program (B7451013, or JADE MONO-2). Pfizer announced positive top-line results from the first trial in the JADE program (B7451012, or JADE MONO-1) on <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.pfizer.com%2Finvestor-news%2Fpress-release-details%2F2019%2FPfizer-Announces-Positive-Top-Line-Results-from-Phase-3-Study-of-Investigational-Oral-JAK1-Candidate-Abrocitinib-PF-04965842-in-Patients-Aged-12-and-Older-with-Moderate-to-Severe-Atopic-Dermatitis%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;esheet=52101789&amp;newsitemid=20190927005071&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=May+15%2C+2019&amp;index=1&amp;md5=e991a12e579c671858b362a5d82de8f2"">May 15, 2019</a>. Complete results from JADE MONO-1 will be presented as a late-breaking abstract at a major upcoming European scientific meeting in Madrid in October 2019.
JADE MONO-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses (100mg and 200mg once daily) of abrocitinib monotherapy over 12 weeks.
Consistent with JADE MONO-1, results showed that by week 12 the percentage of patients achieving each co-primary efficacy endpoint and each key secondary endpoint with either dose of abrocitinib was statistically significantly higher than placebo. In addition, a statistically significant number of patients achieved a reduction in pruritus by week two, as measured by a four-point or larger reduction in itch severity measured with the pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS).
“These findings add to a growing body of evidence supporting the potential of abrocitinib to improve the lives of people living with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis,” said Michael Corbo, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We look forward to continued findings from the JADE program, with results from the next abrocitinib efficacy study, using an active control, becoming available in spring 2020. This will further our understanding of abrocitinib as a potential medicine for patients who suffer from this chronic condition.”
The co-primary study endpoints in JADE MONO-2 were the proportion of patients who achieved an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) skin and two-point or greater improvement; and the proportion of patients who achieved at least a 75% or greater change from baseline in their Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score. The key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving a four-point or larger reduction in itch severity measured with the pruritus NRS and the magnitude of decrease in the Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD).
Safety results showed that both doses of abrocitinib were well-tolerated and were broadly consistent with JADE MONO-1. The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events were 54%, 63%, and 66% for placebo, 100mg, and 200mg, respectively. The frequency of Serious Adverse Events were 1.3%, 3.2%, and 1.3% for placebo, 100mg, and 200mg, respectively. One patient with co-existing cardiovascular risk factors died from unknown etiology three weeks after completing treatment with abrocitinib 100mg once daily, which was deemed unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. The discontinuation rates due to an adverse event were low in each treatment arm (3.8% and 3.2% in 100mg and 200mg, respectively) compared to placebo (12.8%).
Full results from JADE MONO-2 will be submitted for presentation at a future scientific meeting and publication in a medical journal.
<b>Additional Details About the Study</b>
A total of 391 subjects were randomized to abrocitinib 200mg, abrocitinib 100mg, and placebo in the trial. Randomization was stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [IGA=3] and severe [IGA=4] AD) and age (age &lt;18 and =18 years). Eligible subjects completing the 12-week treatment period of the study had the option to enter a long-term extension (LTE) study, B7451015. Subjects discontinuing early from treatment, or who were otherwise ineligible for the LTE study, entered a 4-week follow up period in this study.
JADE MONO-2 is the second trial in the JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and Safety (JADE) global development program. Additional data from other studies in the JADE program will be available later this year and early next.

<b>About Abrocitinib</b>
Abrocitinib is an oral small molecule that selectively inhibits Janus kinase (JAK) 1. Inhibition of JAK1 is thought to modulate multiple cytokines involved in pathophysiology of AD, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-31, and interferon gamma.
Abrocitinib received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD in February 2018. Breakthrough Therapy designation was initiated as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) signed in 2012. As defined by the FDA, a breakthrough therapy is a drug intended to be used alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug.<sup>1</sup>
<b>About Atopic Dermatitis</b>
AD is a chronic skin disease characterized by inflammation of the skin and skin barrier defects.<sup>2,3 </sup>Lesions of AD are characterized by erythema (redness), itching, induration (hardening)/papulation (formulation of papules), and oozing/crusting.<sup>2,3</sup>
AD is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, affecting up to 10% of adults and up to 20% of children worldwide.<sup>4,5</sup>
<b>About Pfizer’s Immunokinase Inhibitor Leadership</b>
The JAK pathways are believed to play an important role in inflammatory processes as they are involved in signaling for over 50 cytokines and growth factors, many of which drive immune-mediated conditions.<sup>6</sup> JAK inhibition may offer patients with these conditions a potential new advanced treatment option.<sup>7</sup>
Pfizer’s leading JAK biology and chemistry expertise from years of JAK research experience, has enabled the company to take a different R&amp;D approach, resulting in the broadest immunokinase inhibitor pipeline. Instead of studying a single molecule for all its potential uses, where it may not be optimal for some, Pfizer’s candidates are purposefully matched to the conditions where we believe they have the greatest potential to, if approved, address unmet need. Pfizer has five unique immunokinase inhibitors in late-stage clinical trials for the potential treatment of nine immune-mediated diseases:
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>Abrocitinib: A JAK inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD among adolescents and adults</li>
 	<li>PF-06651600: An oral, JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of alopecia areata (AA) and in Phase 2 for vitiligo, Crohn’s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC)</li>
 	<li>PF-06700841: A tyrosine kinase 2(TYK2)/JAK1 inhibitor in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of psoriasis and AD in topical formulation, and, in oral formulation for psoriatic arthritis, CD, UC, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and AA</li>
 	<li>PF-06826647: A TYK2 inhibitor under investigation in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of psoriasis</li>
 	<li>PF-06650833: An IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Phase 2 clinical trial</li>

WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 27, 2019-- Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) announces updated results, including the final result for the primary endpoint, from its Phase 2 FIGHT-202 trial evaluating pemigatinib, a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, as a treatment for patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. In patients harboring FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements (Cohort A), pemigatinib monotherapy resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 36 percent (primary endpoint), and median progression free survival (PFS) of 6.9 months (secondary endpoint) with a median follow-up of 15 months. Pemigatinib was generally well tolerated.
These results are being presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 Congress in Barcelona, Spain during a late-breaking oral session today, September 27, from 3:00 p.m. CEST to 3:15 p.m. CEST (9:00 a.m. EDT to 9:15 a.m. EDT) in Madrid Auditorium (Hall 2); Abstract #LBA40.
“We are excited to share updated data for pemigatinib, which may provide a promising and targeted treatment approach for patients with cholangiocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements,” said Peter Langmuir, M.D., Group Vice President, Targeted Therapeutics, Incyte. “Patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma face a poor prognosis, and currently there is no standard of care beyond first-line chemotherapy. We are committed to advancing pemigatinib, a potent and selective therapy targeting a key driver of this disease, and plan to submit the New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shortly.”
Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer that forms in the bile duct. It is classified based on its origin: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) occurs in the bile duct inside the liver and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma occurs in the bile duct outside the liver. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma are often diagnosed at a late or advanced stage when the prognosis is poor.<sup>1,2</sup> The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma varies regionally and ranges between 0.3 – 3.4 per 100,000 in North America and Europe.<sup>1 </sup>FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements occur almost exclusively in iCCA, where they are observed in 10-16 percent of patients.<sup>3-5</sup>
<b>Key Findings from FIGHT-202</b>
Updated data presented today at ESMO show that in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements (Cohort A, n=107), pemigatinib monotherapy resulted in a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 36 percent based on an independent central radiographic review, including 3 patients with a complete response (CR) and 35 patients with a partial response (PR). In these patients, the disease control rate (DCR) was 82 percent, median duration of response (DOR) was 7.5 months, and median progression free survival (PFS) was 6.9 months. Preliminary overall survival (OS) data were encouraging (median: 21.1 months) and follow-up will continue as these data are not yet mature.

The safety analysis, including 146 patients, showed that pemigatinib was generally well tolerated. Grade 1 or 2 hyperphosphatemia, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; 60 percent), was managed with a low phosphate diet, phosphate binders and diuretics, or dose reduction or interruption. The most common Grade =3 TEAE was hypophosphatemia (12 percent); none of the cases was considered clinically significant or serious and none led to dose reduction or discontinuation. Serious retinal detachment was observed in 4 percent of patients (Grade =3, 1 percent) with none of the cases resulting in clinical sequelae.
“Patients with cholangiocarcinoma face a significant challenge as they cope with a life-threatening condition that is often diagnosed once it has progressed into late stages,” said Arndt Vogel, M.D., Senior Consultant and Professor at Hannover Medical School. “As a physician, I am encouraged to see the data from the FIGHT-202 study, which demonstrate the potential that pemigatinib has to become an important and much needed targeted treatment option for this patient population.”
<b>About FIGHT-202</b>
The FIGHT-202 Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study (NCT02924376) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of pemigatinib – a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor – in adult (age = 18 years) patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with documented FGF/FGFR status.
Patients were enrolled into one of three cohorts – Cohort A (FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements), Cohort B (other FGF/FGFR genetic alterations) or Cohort C (no FGF/FGFR genetic alterations). All patients received 13.5 mg pemigatinib orally once daily (QD) on a 21-day cycle (two weeks on/one week off) until radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
The primary endpoint of FIGHT-202 is overall response rate (ORR) in Cohort A, assessed by independent review per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints include ORR in Cohorts B, A plus B, and C; progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety in all cohorts.

<b>About FIGHT </b>
The FIGHT (<b>FI</b>broblast <b>G</b>rowth factor receptor in oncology and <b>H</b>ematology <b>T</b>rials) clinical trial program includes ongoing Phase 2 and 3 studies investigating safety and efficacy of pemigatinib therapy across several FGFR-driven malignancies. Phase 2 monotherapy studies include FIGHT-202, as well as FIGHT-201 investigating pemigatinib in patients with metastatic or surgically unresectable bladder cancer, including with activating FGFR3 mutations or fusions/rearrangements; FIGHT-203 in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms with activating FGFR1 fusions/rearrangements; FIGHT-207 in patients with previously treated, locally-advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable solid tumor malignancies harboring activating FGFR mutations or fusions/rearrangements, irrespective of tumor type. FIGHT-205 is a Phase 2 study investigating pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab combination therapy and pemigatinib monotherapy in patients with previously untreated, metastatic or unresectable bladder cancer harboring FGFR3 mutations or fusions/rearrangements who are not eligible to receive cisplatin. FIGHT-302 is a recently initiated Phase 3 study investigating pemigatinib as a first-line treatment for patients with cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements.
<b>About FGFR and Pemigatinib </b>
Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) play an important role in tumor cell proliferation and survival, migration and angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). Activating fusions, rearrangements, translocations and gene amplifications in FGFRs are closely correlated with the development of various cancers.
Pemigatinib is a potent, selective, oral inhibitor of FGFR isoforms 1, 2 and 3 which, in preclinical studies, has demonstrated selective pharmacologic activity against cancer cells with FGFR alterations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted pemigatinib Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of previously treated, advanced/metastatic or unresectable FGFR2 translocated cholangiocarcinoma. The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious conditions that have shown encouraging early clinical results and may demonstrate substantial improvements over available medicines.

Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi™) (STO:SOBI) today announced a definitive agreement to acquire Dova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOVA) by means of a tender offer. The consideration consists of an upfront payment of USD 27.50 per share in cash and, one non-tradeable Contingent Value Right (CVR). The CVR entitles Dova shareholders to an additional USD 1.50 per share upon approval of Doptelet® for use in Chemotherapy-Induced Thrombocytopenia (CIT) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The upfront cash component of the offer represents a premium of 36 per cent based on Dova’s most recent closing price of USD 20.19. The transaction is valued at up to USD 915 million (approximately SEK 9.0 billion) on a fully diluted basis.
</div>
</div>
<ul>
 	<li>The acquisition of Dova provides Sobi with Doptelet (avatrombopag), a differentiated on-market product in Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP), a well established and growing market, for Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) and an ongoing phase 3 trial in Chemotherapy Induced Thrombocytopenia (CIT)</li>
 	<li>The acquisition of Dova will broaden the scope of Sobi’s product portfolio into haematology and enhance Sobi’s commercial presence in the United States</li>
 	<li>Doptelet will further diversify Sobi’s revenue base adding a new growth driver</li>
 	<li>Sobi will leverage its expertise and existing infrastructure in haematology to grow Doptelet across its indications by expanding patient access outside the US.</li>
</ul>
Dova Pharmaceuticals was founded in 2016 to commercialise Doptelet, a second generation small-molecule thrombopoietin receptor (TPO) agonist used in the treatment of thrombocytopenia by increasing platelet count. In May 2018, Doptelet was approved by the FDA for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure, and in June 2019 for Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. Doptelet was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) in June 2019, and a European filing for the Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) indication is expected in 2020. ITP is a rare autoimmune bleeding disorder characterised by a low number of platelets.
Dova is also conducting a phase 3 trial in Chemotherapy-Induced Thrombocytopenia (CIT) which is a common side effect of chemotherapy that results in a low number of platelets. At present, there are no approved drugs to treat CIT.
<strong>Strategic Rationale</strong>
The acquisition of Dova is the latest in a series of transformative transactions Sobi has conducted to broaden its haematology and immunology portfolios by, adding commercial stage products and a late-stage pipeline. By acquiring Dova, Sobi will enhance its capabilities in the US market with key haematologist callpoints to further develop its existing franchises.
The current TPO market is estimated at USD 2.0 billion and represents an attractive commercial opportunity. Doptelet’s recent launch in ITP in the US is a first step to capturing significant market share in the mid-term. In addition, Doptelet has the potential to become the first-to-market drug to treat CIT.
“The cadence of upcoming launches and approvals across indications and regions that Doptelet provides, enables us to further accelerate growth in our haematology franchise”, said Guido Oelkers CEO and President at Sobi. “There is a large unmet medical need within thrombocytopenia and for us this is a great opportunity to be able to give patients access to new and improved treatments. Furthermore, we are excited to welcome the 125 professionals from Dova who will greatly strengthen Sobi’s haematology infrastructure and broaden our value chain in the US.“
<strong>Transaction Terms</strong>
Under the terms of the agreement, Sobi will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Dova for a purchase price of USD 27.50 per share in cash, as well as one CVR per share. The CVR will entitle the holder to an additional USD 1.50 per share at the time FDA approves Doptelet for the treatment of CIT. The tender offer is conditioned on the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Dova’s common stock. Any shares of Dova common stock not tendered will be acquired through a merger effected as soon as practicable following the tender offer closing, for the same per share consideration. Dova shareholders holding a majority of Dova’s currently outstanding shares, including Paul B. Manning and related entities, have agreed to tender their shares into the offer. The offer is also conditioned upon clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, as well as other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in Q4 2019.
<strong>Financing</strong>
The acquisition of Dova will be financed by a mix of existing cash resources and debt comprised of new committed credit facilities as well as Sobi's existing credit facilities. The new financing consists of a SEK 3 billion term loan facility with a term of up to five years, and a EUR 280 million revolving credit facility with a term of up to five years, both arranged and made available by Danske Bank and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. The remaining part of the debt-financing is intended to be financed through Sobi’s existing credit facilities
<strong>Advisors</strong>
Morgan Stanley is acting as Sobi’s exclusive financial advisor and Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP is acting as legal advisor to Sobi on this transaction. Mannheimer Swartling Advokatbyrå AB is acting as Swedish legal counsel in the transaction.
<strong>About Dova</strong>

Total revenue amounted to USD 10.4 million for 2018 with approximately 125 employees. Dova Pharmaceuticals’ portfolio comprises of one commercial product, Doptelet. Doptelet is an oral thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist administered with food. Doptelet is approved by both United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in adults with chronic liver disease (CLD). In June 2019, Doptelet was approved for chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) by FDA, filing is expected in early 2020 in Europe.

<h3></h3>
<h3><strong style=""font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;font-size: 1rem"">Rituxan is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for paediatric patients 2 years of age and older living with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>These two forms of vasculitis in children are rare and associated with severe, potentially life-threatening symptoms</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>This approval is the first paediatric indication for MabThera/Rituxan</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Rituxan<sup>®</sup> (rituximab), in combination with glucocorticoids, for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older. GPA and MPA are rare, potentially life-threatening diseases affecting small and medium sized blood vessels.
“Rituxan is now approved as the first and only medicine for paediatric patients living with GPA and MPA, two potentially life-threatening blood vessel disorders which are rare in children,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Today’s approval is a result of our ongoing commitment to working with the FDA to develop medicines for paediatric patients with rare diseases where there is a serious unmet need.”
The approval is based on data from the PePRS study, a Phase IIa, global, open-label, multicentre single-arm study investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics, exploratory efficacy and pharmacodynamic outcomes of intravenous MabThera/Rituxan in 25 patients with active GPA or MPA between 6 and 17 years of age. Treatment with four weekly infusions of MabThera/Rituxan in combination with a tapering course of oral glucocorticoids was assessed in newly diagnosed or relapsing active GPA or MPA paediatric patients. Of the 25 patients in the study, 19 had GPA and 6 had MPA at baseline. Efficacy was an exploratory endpoint and primarily assessed using the Paediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS). Efficacy assessment showed that 56% of patients achieved PVAS remission by month 6, 92% by month 12, and 100% of patients achieved remission by month 18. The safety profile of MabThera/Rituxan in patients with paediatric GPA and MPA was consistent in type, nature and severity with the known safety profile of MabThera/Rituxan in adult patients with GPA and MPA, rheumatoid arthritis and pemphigus vulgaris.
The FDA previously granted Priority Review to Rituxan for the treatment of GPA and MPA in paediatric patients. In 2011, Rituxan became the first and only therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with these two rare forms of vasculitis. MabThera/Rituxan is currently indicated for the treatment of four autoimmune conditions and since 2006 more than 900,000 people have been treated with MabThera/Rituxan for autoimmune conditions worldwide. MabThera/Rituxan is not indicated in children less than 2 years of age with GPA or MPA, or in children with conditions outside of GPA and MPA.
<h3>About Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis and Microscopic Polyangiitis</h3>
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (formerly known as Wegener's Granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are two types of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). AAV is a form of vasculitis, or blood vessel inflammation, that primarily affects small blood vessels. In general, GPA and MPA both affect the small blood vessels of the kidneys, lungs, sinuses, and a variety of other organs, but the diseases may affect each person differently. Both GPA and MPA are considered rare diseases, with an estimated prevalence globally of 23 to 160 cases per million in the population. Cases of paediatric onset GPA and MPA are even more rare and are associated with severe, potentially life-threatening symptoms.
<h3>About MabThera/Rituxan in Immunology</h3>
MabThera (Rituxan in the US) is indicated for the treatment of four autoimmune conditions. MabThera/Rituxan in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis, GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in adults. Rituxan, in combination with glucocorticoids, is also indicated for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older.
MabThera/Rituxan in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD), including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies. MabThera/Rituxan is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV). People with serious infections should not receive MabThera/Rituxan.
MabThera/Rituxan is not indicated in children less than 2 years of age with GPA or MPA, or in children with conditions outside of GPA and MPA.

<strong>Issued: London, UK</strong>
GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) today presented new data for Nucala (mepolizumab) from an interim analysis of REALITI-A, the first prospective global real-world study of a biologic treatment in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Results show a significant reduction in exacerbations and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in patients after one year of treatment with Nucala when taken in a routine care setting, compared to the prior 12 months.
Christopher Corsico, Senior Vice President Development, GSK, said: “Exacerbations can be devastating for people living with severe eosinophilic asthma. The interim results from REALITI-A continue to demonstrate Nucala effectively reduces exacerbations, this time in a routine care setting. We look forward to sharing the full results from this study after it completes in 2021.”
REALITI-A is a two year, global, prospective, single-arm, observational study of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma newly prescribed Nucala and is being conducted in a routine care setting. The interim analysis of 368 patients presented at the 2019 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress showed that, compared to the prior 12 months, after a year of treatment there was a:
<ul>
 	<li>69% reduction in the annual rate of clinically significant exacerbations (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.27, 0.35), the primary endpoint of the study.</li>
 	<li>77% reduction in the annual rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation/emergency room visits (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.18, 0.30).</li>
 	<li>Reduction in median OCS dose (n=159) from 10 mg/day to 5mg/day, with 34% of patients (49/143) able to stop OCS completely.</li>
</ul>
Study investigator, Professor Tim Harrison, University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, UK added: “Real-world studies like REALITI-A enhance our understanding of the beneficial effects medicines can make over and above data from randomised controlled trials. REALITI-A included a wider range of patients with severe asthma, studied in a setting that more closely resembles their everyday lives. Severe eosinophilic asthma can have a devastating impact on patients’ quality of life, so to see the interim analysis show patients benefitting from treatment with mepolizumab after a year is encouraging and mirrors my personal experience with using mepolizumab. I look forward to seeing the full results.”
Safety data from the study were consistent with results from previous clinical trials. 14% (53/368) of patients had on-treatment adverse events, with the most common being headache (23/368), nausea (5/368), fatigue (4/368), influenza like illness (4/368), back pain (3/368) and myalgia (3/368) and &lt;1% (2/368) had on-treatment serious adverse events. There were no deaths.
REALITI-A is expected to complete in 2021 and full results will be published and presented at future scientific meetings in due course.
<strong>About real-world studies</strong>
Evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of medicines to support their regulatory approval is typically generated through randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which are considered the ‘gold standard’ of evidence-based medicine because of the highly rigorous controlled and scientific way in which they are conducted.
Real world data are data on patient health or healthcare delivery collected outside of a conventional RCT setting that reflect the everyday patient experience. Real world evidence is evidence derived from these data through the application of scientific research methods. Real world studies are not a replacement for RCTs, as they may not be able to account for certain biases or confounding factors the way an RCT can, however they can complement RCTs, providing information on a medicine’s effectiveness and safety in a routine care setting.
<strong>About REALITI-A</strong>
The REALITI-A (REAL world effectiveness of mepolizumab In paTIent care – Asthma) is a two year, global, prospective, single-arm, observational cohort study enrolling patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and newly prescribed mepolizumab 100mg subcutaneously at physician’s discretion (i.e. with no pre-defined eligibility criteria).
This is the first prospective global real-world study investigating a biologic in severe eosinophilic asthma and aims to recruit 850 patients across seven countries. Data are being collected at routine healthcare visits; one-year pre-exposure data are collected retrospectively at enrolment. The primary endpoint is the rate of clinically significant exacerbations (defined as exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroid use and/or emergency room visit/hospitalisation). Exacerbations requiring emergency room visit/hospitalisation and maintenance oral corticosteroid use are key secondary endpoints. The interim analysis presented at ERS includes patients with one-year post-exposure data. The study is expected to complete in 2021.
<strong>About severe asthma and eosinophilic inflammation  </strong>
Severe asthma is defined as asthma which requires treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming ‘uncontrolled’ or which remains ‘uncontrolled’ despite this therapy. Severe asthma patients are also often categorised by long-term use of oral corticosteroids (OCS). In a sub-set of severe asthma patients, the over-production of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) is known to cause inflammation in the lungs. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. Studies suggest that approximately 60% of patients with severe asthma have eosinophilic airway inflammation.
<strong>About Nucala (mepolizumab)</strong>
First approved in 2015 for severe eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab is the first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets IL-5. It is believed to work by preventing IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils, reducing blood eosinophils without completely depleting them.
Mepolizumab has been developed for the treatment of diseases that are driven by inflammation caused by eosinophils. It has been studied in over 3,000 patients in 21 clinical trials across a number of eosinophilic indications and is the only biologic with 4.8 years of safety and efficacy data in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). Mepolizumab is approved (under the brand name Nucala) in the US, Europe and in over 20 other markets, as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with SEA. It was approved for self-administration by patients aged over 12 in the US and EU in 2019. Mepolizumab is the only anti-IL5 biologic therapy approved for use in asthma patients aged six to 17 years in Europe and the US in SEA. In the US, Japan and Canada and a number of other markets, it is approved as add-on maintenance treatment for patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Mepolizumab is currently being investigated for severe hypereosinophilic syndrome, nasal polyposis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
In the US, Nucala (100mg fixed dose subcutaneous injection of mepolizumab) is licensed as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma aged 12 years and older, and with an eosinophilic phenotype. Nucala (3x 100mg subcutaneous injection of mepolizumab) is licensed for the treatment of adult patients with EGPA. Nucala is not approved for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Full US Prescribing Information is available at <a href=""https://gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribing_Information/Nucala/pdf/NUCALA-PI-PIL.PDF"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">US Prescribing Information Nucala</a>.
<strong>Important safety information for Nucala (mepolizumab)</strong>
The following information is based on the US Prescribing Information for Nucala. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labelled safety information for Nucala.
<strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>
Nucala should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to mepolizumab or excipients in the formulation.
<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>
<strong>Hypersensitivity Reactions</strong>
Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, rash) have occurred following administration of Nucala. These reactions generally occur within hours of administration but in some instances can have a delayed onset (i.e. days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, Nucala should be discontinued.
<strong>Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease </strong>
Nucala should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, or acute bronchospasm.
<strong>Opportunistic Infections: Herpes Zoster</strong>
In controlled clinical trials, 2 serious adverse reactions of herpes zoster occurred in subjects treated with Nucala compared to none in placebo. Consider varicella vaccination if medically appropriate prior to starting therapy with Nucala.
<strong>Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage</strong>
Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) abruptly upon initiation of therapy with Nucala. Decreases in corticosteroid doses, if appropriate, should be gradual and under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.
<strong>Parasitic (Helminth) Infection</strong>
It is unknown if Nucala will influence a patient’s response against parasites. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with Nucala. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with Nucala and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with Nucala until infection resolves.
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
The most common adverse reactions (=3% and more common than placebo) reported in the first 24 weeks of two clinical trials with Nucala (and placebo) were: headache, 19% (18%); injection site reaction, 8% (3%); back pain, 5% (4%); fatigue, 5% (4%); influenza, 3% (2%); urinary tract infection 3% (2%); abdominal pain upper, 3% (2%); pruritus, 3% (2%); eczema, 3% (&lt;1%); and muscle spasm, 3% (&lt;1%).
Systemic Reactions, including Hypersensitivity Reactions:  In 3 clinical trials, 3% of subjects who received Nucala experienced systemic (allergic and nonallergic) reactions compared to 5% in the placebo group. Systemic allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 1% of subjects who received Nucala compared to 2% of subjects in the placebo group. Manifestations included rash, pruritus, headache, and myalgia. Systemic nonallergic reactions were reported by 2% of subjects who received Nucala and 3% of subjects in the placebo group. Manifestations included rash, flushing, and myalgia. A majority of the systemic reactions were experienced on the day of dosing. Reports of anaphylaxis have been received postmarketing.
Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, swelling, itching, burning sensation) occurred at a rate of 8% in subjects treated with Nucala compared with 3% in subjects treated with placebo.
<strong>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</strong>
The data on pregnancy exposures from the clinical trials are insufficient to inform on drug-associated risk. Monoclonal antibodies, such as mepolizumab, are progressively transported across the placenta in a linear fashion as pregnancy progresses; therefore, potential effects on a foetus are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
<strong>GSK’s commitment to respiratory disease</strong>
For 50 years, GSK has led the way in developing medicines that advance the management of asthma and COPD. From introducing the world’s first selective short-acting beta agonist in 1969, to launching six treatments in five years to create today’s industry-leading respiratory portfolio, we continue to innovate so we can reach the right patients, with the right treatment. Working together with the healthcare community, we apply world-class science to discover and understand the molecules that become the medicines of tomorrow. We won’t stand still until the simple act of breathing is made easier for everyone.

<div class=""bw-release-story"">
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the pivotal Phase 3 RECARBRIO™ (imipenem 500 mg, cilastatin 500 mg, and relebactam 250 mg) RESTORE-IMI 2 trial met its primary endpoint. The global, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial investigated the efficacy and safety of Merck’s antibacterial product RECARBRIO for use in adult patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP).
Results from the trial showed RECARBRIO met both the primary and key secondary endpoints of statistical non-inferiority compared to piperacillin/tazobactam in Day 28 all-cause mortality and clinical response at early follow up, respectively, in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population. Rates of adverse events observed in the trial were similar in both groups. Merck plans to present the full data from the trial at a scientific congress in 2020.
“Additional treatment options are needed for critically ill patients with respiratory infections,” said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, senior vice president, clinical research, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. “By evaluating RECARBRIO in this patient population, we have generated robust clinical evidence for its potential use in patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. We look forward to sharing these data with the regulatory agencies.”
Relebactam (the beta lactamase inhibitor component of RECARBRIO) has received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and Fast Track status for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.
RECARBRIO is contraindicated in patients with a history of known severe hypersensitivity (severe systemic allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis) to any component of RECARBRIO. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with beta-lactams. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions, such as seizures, confusional states, and myoclonic activity, have been reported during treatment with imipenem/cilastatin, a component of RECARBRIO, especially when recommended dosages of imipenem were exceeded. These reactions have been reported most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (such as brain lesions or a history of seizures) and/or compromised renal function. Concominant use of RECARBRIO with valproic acid or divalproex sodium may increase the risk of breakthrough seizures. Additionally,<b> </b><i>Clostridium difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including imipenem/cilastatin plus relebactam and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. See Important Safety Information below.
<b>About RECARBRIO™ (imipenem 500 mg, cilastatin 500 mg, and relebactam 250 mg)</b>
RECARBRIO is indicated in patients 18 years of age and older who have limited or no alternative treatment options, for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: <i>Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, </i>and<i> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.
RECARBRIO is also indicated in patients 18 years of age or older who have limited or no alternative treatment options, for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: <i>Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Parabacteroides distasonis </i>and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.
Approval of these indications is based on limited clinical safety and efficacy data for RECARBRIO.
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of RECARBRIO and other antibacterial drugs, RECARBRIO should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information is available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.
RECARBRIO is a combination of imipenem/cilastatin and relebactam, and is administered intravenously. Imipenem is a penem antibacterial drug, cilastatin sodium is a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor, and relebactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Cilastatin limits the renal metabolism of imipenem and does not have antibacterial activity. The bactericidal activity of imipenem results from binding to PBP 2 and PBP 1B in Enterobacteriaceae and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>and the subsequent inhibition of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Inhibition of PBPs leads to the disruption of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Imipenem is stable in the presence of some beta lactamases. Relebactam has no intrinsic antibacterial activity. Relebactam protects imipenem from degradation by certain serine beta lactamases such as Sulhydryl Variable (SHV), Temoneira (TEM), Cefotaximase-Munich (CTX-M), <i>Enterobacter cloacae </i>P99 (P99), <i>Pseudomonas</i>-derived cephalosporinase (PDC), and <i>Klebsiella-pneumoniae </i>carbapenemase (KPC).
<b>Important Safety Information about RECARBRIO (imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam)</b>
<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b>
RECARBRIO is contraindicated in patients with a history of known severe hypersensitivity (severe systemic allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis) to any component of RECARBRIO.
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</b>
<b>Hypersensitivity Reactions: </b>Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with beta lactams. Before initiating therapy with RECARBRIO, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to carbapenems, penicillins, cephalosporins, other beta lactams, and other allergens. If a hypersensitivity reaction to RECARBRIO occurs, discontinue the therapy immediately.
<b>Seizures and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions: </b>CNS adverse reactions, such as seizures, confusional states, and myoclonic activity, have been reported during treatment with imipenem/cilastatin, a component of RECARBRIO, especially when recommended dosages of imipenem were exceeded<i>. </i>These have been reported most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) and/or compromised renal function<i>.</i>
Anticonvulsant therapy should be continued in patients with known seizure disorders. If CNS adverse reactions including seizures occur, patients should undergo a neurological evaluation to determine whether RECARBRIO should be discontinued.
<b>Increased Seizure Potential Due to Interaction with Valproic Acid: </b>Concomitant use of RECARBRIO with valproic acid or divalproex sodium may increase the risk of breakthrough seizures. Avoid concomitant use of RECARBRIO with valproic acid or divalproex sodium or consider alternative antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems.
<b><i>Clostridium difficile</i>-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD): </b><i>Clostridium difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including imipenem/cilastatin plus relebactam, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <i>C. difficile</i>.
<i>C. difficile </i>produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <i>C. difficile </i>cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against <i>C. difficile </i>may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of <i>C. difficile, </i>and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.
<b>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria: </b>Prescribing RECARBRIO in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
<b>Adverse Reactions: </b>The most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in =2% of patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin plus relebactam 250 mg were diarrhea, nausea, headache, vomiting, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, phlebitis/infusion site reactions, pyrexia, and hypertension.

BOSTON &amp; DURHAM, N.C.--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) and RNA therapeutics developer <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fribometrix.com%2F&amp;esheet=52102210&amp;newsitemid=20190930005115&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Ribometrix&amp;index=1&amp;md5=3118f7a2b2b6b2a164453ee7e97d02ab"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Ribometrix</a>, Inc. announced today that the companies have entered into a strategic collaboration to discover and develop novel RNA-targeted small molecule therapeutic candidates for serious diseases. The collaboration will combine Ribometrix’s proprietary discovery platform for identifying and optimizing small molecule therapeutics that modulate RNA function by targeting three-dimensional (3D) RNA structures with Vertex’s scientific, clinical and regulatory capabilities for up to three therapeutic programs, including one ongoing discovery program from Ribometrix.
“Targeting RNA is a potentially powerful new approach for developing small molecule therapeutics, and Ribometrix has developed an innovative technology for the accelerated discovery of selective candidates in this new space,” said Mark Bunnage, Senior Vice President and Site Head, Boston Research at Vertex. “This partnership adds a novel mechanism to our internal toolkit which has the potential to enhance our ongoing research capabilities and support the expansion of our pipeline of transformative medicines in serious diseases.”
“As a company founded on groundbreaking research and expertise in RNA structural biology, we have seen firsthand how new technologies are dramatically expanding the druggability of RNA and the potential for transforming the treatment of previously intractable diseases,” said Michael Solomon, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Ribometrix. “Vertex is a leader in creating transformative medicines through serial innovation, and we are proud to partner with them to rapidly and effectively develop a core discovery platform of small molecule therapeutics targeting RNA.”
<b>About the Collaboration
</b>Under the terms of the agreement, Vertex will pay Ribometrix approximately $20 million upfront, which includes an equity investment in the company. Initially, Ribometrix will undertake two discovery programs with Vertex, and Vertex has an option to add a third program. Following discovery and optimization of novel therapeutic molecules, Vertex has the option to take an exclusive global license for the development and commercialization of molecules for that program. Ribometrix is eligible to receive more than $700 million in total potential payments based upon the successful achievement of specified research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones as part of the collaboration. In addition, Vertex will pay tiered royalties on future net global sales on any products that result from the collaboration.
<b>About the Ribometrix RNA-Targeted Therapeutics Platform
</b>Ribometrix’s platform<b> </b>uses multiple specialized technologies to first identify 3D RNA motifs in therapeutically compelling RNAs and then to discover small molecules that bind to these 3D motifs in therapeutic ways. Ribometrix has shown that many RNAs implicated in disease contain structural pockets that may be targeted with small molecule ligands. Ribometrix scientists use state-of-the-art proprietary assays to identify ligands that bind specifically in these pockets and therapeutically modulate these RNAs. Potential benefits over current protein and RNA-based approaches include potency, selectivity, oral bioavailability, tissue distribution and central nervous system penetration.
<b>About Ribometrix
</b>Ribometrix is a biotechnology company pioneering small molecule therapeutics that directly target and modulate the function of RNA to create a completely new class of medicines to treat human diseases. Ribometrix leverages its world-leading expertise in three-dimensional structural analysis of RNA to drive its discovery platform for the identification of novel small molecules that modulate the function of RNA and proteins associated with human disease.

<em>Includes All Human Indications Excluding Prevention and Treatment of Smallpox</em>
<em>Chimerix to Receive up to $180 Million in Potential Clinical, Regulatory, and Commercial Milestones and is Eligible for Double Digit Royalties</em>
DURHAM, N.C., Sept. 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chimerix (NASDAQ:CMRX), a development-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to accelerating the advancement of innovative medicines that make a meaningful impact in the lives of patients living with cancer and other serious diseases, today announces an exclusive global license agreement with SymBio Pharmaceuticals, Ltd (SymBio), under which SymBio has exclusively licensed the worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize brincidofovir in all human indications, excluding the prevention and treatment of smallpox. Moving forward, SymBio will be responsible for all future development and commercialization as well as manufacturing associated with brincidofovir in the licensed indications.
Under the terms of the agreement, Chimerix will receive an upfront payment of $5 million plus potential clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $180 million. In addition, Chimerix is eligible to receive double digit royalties on net sales of brincidofovir worldwide.
“This transaction marks an important corporate milestone for Chimerix, as we have transitioned our focus to the final stage of development of brincidofovir as a medical countermeasure for smallpox and to the Phase 3 development of dociparstat sodium (CX-01) in front-line therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML remains an area of significant unmet need in which five-year survival rates are less than 30%,” said Mike Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chimerix. “The structure of this agreement with SymBio allows Chimerix shareholders to participate in the value of ongoing development of brincidofovir through potential future milestone payments and royalties.”
“Furthermore, SymBio’s success in transitioning to a commercial-stage biotechnology company, while simultaneously developing a pipeline of novel molecules in oncology and virology, illustrates the strength of their capability and capacity. SymBio is well positioned to explore worldwide development of brincidofovir beyond smallpox and we are excited by the promise of this partnership,” continued Mr. Sherman.
Locust Walk acted as exclusive transaction advisor and Cooley LLP acted as legal counsel to Chimerix.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","India’s largest generics drugmaker Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories said it would develop a biosimilar of Roche’s MabThera (ingredient: rituximab). The Indian company plans to conduct a phase-3 study on the biosimilar in Korea via clinical research service provider Parexel.
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety on Wednesday approved the phase-3 trial on DRL_RI, the biosimilar of rituximab.
Rituximab is used for lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis.
Dr. Reddy’s is a multinational generics company based in India. The upcoming global phase-3 study will test the drug in patients with follicular lymphoma, in comparison with the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the original medicine, MabThera.
The global trial will recruit 284 patients, including 26 Koreans. Patients eligible for the study are those with stage II-IV, cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 positive, and follicular lymphoma who have not been previously treated and have low tumor burden.
Drugmakers have already released biosimilars of MabThera in the market.
Local biosimilar maker Celltrion obtained the license for Truxima, a biosimilar of MabThera, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2018 and from the Canadian health authorities this year. Celltrion is reportedly to release the biosimilar in the U.S. within this year.
Another generics maker Sandoz also developed a rituximab biosimilar, called Rixathon. In July, Pfizer won the FDA nod to sell Ruxience, another rituximab biosimilar.

<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca has agreed to sell the global commercial rights, excluding China, Japan, the US and Mexico, for <i>Losec</i>(omeprazole) and associated brands to Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH (Cheplapharm).
The divestment includes medicines containing omeprazole marketed by AstraZeneca or its collaborators under the <i>Acimax</i>,<i>Antra</i>,<i> Mepral</i>,<i> Mopral</i>,<i> Omepral </i>and<i> Zoltum</i> medicine names<i>.</i>
Ruud Dobber, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals, said: “This agreement forms part of our strategy of reducing the portfolio of mature medicines to enable reinvestment in our main therapy areas, accelerating the number of innovative new medicines for patients with high unmet medical need. We already have an excellent relationship with Cheplapharm, and their strong European presence and global distribution network will help ensure continued patient access to <i>Losec</i>.”
AstraZeneca will continue to manufacture and supply <i>Losec</i> and its associated medicines and commercialise the medicine in markets where it still holds the rights.
<b>Financial considerations</b>
Cheplapharm will pay AstraZeneca approximately $243 million on completion of the agreement, plus sales-contingent milestones of up to $33 million in 2021 and 2022. Income arising from the upfront payment will be reported in the Company’s financial statements in 2019 as Other Operating Income. In 2018, <i>Losec</i> sales in the countries covered by this agreement were $98 million, the majority of which were in Emerging Markets. The agreement does not change the Company’s financial guidance for 2019. As there were no closing considerations to the transaction, the agreement became effective upon signing.
<b>About <i>Losec</i></b>
<i>Losec</i> is a proton pump inhibitor discovered and developed by AstraZeneca, which helps to reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach in patients with gastrointestinal reflux conditions and ulcers. It has a number of approved indications and is commonly prescribed for patients with gastro oesophageal reflux disease.
The commercial rights to <i>Losec</i> and other omeprazole medicines in the US, Japan and Mexico, as well as the commercial rights to the over-the-counter version in France, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand and the Netherlands were previously divested.

RARITAN, N.J., Sept. 30, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new indication for INVOKANA® (canagliflozin) to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) with a certain amount of protein in the urine. INVOKANA® is now the only type 2 diabetes medicine indicated to both treat diabetic kidney disease and reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2D and DKD.
T2D is the leading cause of kidney disease in the United States 1 and the fifth fastest-growing cause of death around the world. 2
""With the approval of these new uses, INVOKANA® is now the only diabetes medicine indicated to help type 2 diabetes patients reduce the risks associated with diabetic kidney disease, including hospitalization for heart failure,"" said James List, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular &amp; Metabolism, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""This significant advancement addresses serious unmet needs and could change the trajectory of care for the many millions of patients living with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease.""
Click to Tweet: #BREAKING: Only type 2 diabetes medicine now approved by FDA to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease and reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 #diabetes #T2D and #DKD. Read more here: https://ctt.ec/Pa0cz+
In the United States, one in three people with T2D has DKD,1 which multiplies the risk of cardiovascular complications including heart failure and CV death, and puts patients on a trajectory to dialysis and kidney transplant.1,2 Additionally, heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospitalization,3 with a high unmet need for effective treatment options. With this approval, INVOKANA® is the only type 2 diabetes medicine indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2D and DKD, and is the first new treatment option in nearly 20 years indicated to slow the progression of DKD in these patients.4,5,6
""Given the nation's heightened focus on kidney health at the highest levels of government, this approval couldn't have come at a better time and offers real hope for patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease,"" said LaVarne A. Burton, President and Chief Executive Officer, American Kidney Fund.* ""We know that the real battle to turn the tide on kidney disease is in early detection and slowing its progression so that patients stay healthier and fewer patients reach kidney failure. We are so grateful that advances in kidney disease research are producing treatment options that help to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease and reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.""
Click to Tweet: .@KidneyFund talks importance of FDA's approval of the first new treatment option in nearly 2 decades to slow the progression of diabetic #kidneydisease and reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 #diabetes #T2D and #DKD. See here for details: https://ctt.ec/7R071+
The new indication is based on results from the landmark Phase 3 CREDENCE study in patients with T2D and DKD, which was stopped early because it met the prespecified criteria for efficacy. In CREDENCE, INVOKANA® 100 mg demonstrated a 30 percent reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint, comprising end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), doubling of serum creatinine and renal or CV death.† Results also showed INVOKANA® reduced the risk of secondary CV endpoints, including a 39 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. Overall, adverse events and serious adverse events were similar but numerically lower in the INVOKANA® group compared to placebo. The rates of diabetic ketoacidosis and genital mycotic infections were numerically higher in the INVOKANA® group, as observed in other clinical trials. Additionally, there was no imbalance in lower limb amputation or bone fracture in this trial and no new safety signals were identified.
""Millions of T2D patients around the world have DKD and almost half of them aren't even aware of it. By the time they are referred to a nephrologist, it is often too late because their disease has progressed to the point where dialysis is inevitable,"" said CREDENCE study investigator George Bakris, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director, Comprehensive Hypertension Center, University of Chicago.‡ ""For nearly two decades, we've been searching for a treatment that can help us intervene earlier to slow kidney disease progression. With the approval for this new indication for INVOKANA®, physicians will not only be able to help reduce the risks associated with diabetic kidney disease, but also reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2D and DKD.""
About CREDENCE
CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) is the first dedicated renal outcomes study of any sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in patients with T2D and DKD in addition to standard of care. The study is a randomized, double-blind, event-driven, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 2-arm, multicenter study, which evaluated 4,401 patients with T2D, Stage 2 or 3 DKD (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of =30 to &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and macroalbuminuria (defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] &gt;300 to =5,000 mg/g) who were receiving standard of care, including a maximum tolerated labeled daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). The primary efficacy outcome for these analyses was the composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplant, or eGFR &lt;15), doubling of serum creatinine, and renal death or cardiovascular (CV) death. Specified secondary outcomes included a composite of heart attack, stroke, or CV death and a composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure.
WHAT IS INVOKANA®?
INVOKANA® is a prescription medicine used:
along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes
to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease
to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) with a certain amount of protein in the urine
INVOKANA® is not for people with type 1 diabetes or with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in blood or urine). It is not known if INVOKANA® is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
INVOKANA® can cause important side effects, including:
Amputations. INVOKANA® may increase your risk of lower-limb amputations. Amputations mainly involve removal of the toe or part of the foot; however, amputations involving the leg, below and above the knee, have also occurred. Some people had more than one amputation, some on both sides of the body. You may be at a higher risk of lower-limb amputation if you: have a history of amputation, have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, have had blocked or narrowed blood vessels (usually in leg), have damage to the nerves (neuropathy) in the leg, or have had diabetic foot ulcers or sores. Call your doctor right away if you have new pain or tenderness, any sores, ulcers, or infections in your leg or foot. Your doctor may decide to stop your INVOKANA® for a while if you have any of these signs or symptoms. Talk to your doctor about proper foot care
Dehydration. INVOKANA® can cause some people to become dehydrated (the loss of too much body water), which may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, lightheaded, or weak, especially when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). You may be at higher risk of dehydration if you have low blood pressure, take medicines to lower your blood pressure (including diuretics [water pills]), are on a low sodium (salt) diet, have kidney problems, or are 65 years of age or older
Vaginal yeast infection. Women who take INVOKANA® may get vaginal yeast infections. Symptoms include: vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), or vaginal itching
Yeast infection of the penis (balanitis or balanoposthitis). Men who take INVOKANA® may get a yeast infection of the skin around the penis. Symptoms include: redness, itching, or swelling of the penis; rash of the penis; foul-smelling discharge from the penis; or pain in the skin around penis
Talk to your doctor about what to do if you get symptoms of a yeast infection of the vagina or penis.
Do not take INVOKANA® if you:
are allergic to canagliflozin or any of the ingredients in INVOKANA®. Symptoms of allergic reaction may include: rash; raised red patches on your skin (hives); or swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing
have severe kidney problems and are taking INVOKANA® to lower your blood sugar
are on kidney dialysis
Before you take INVOKANA®, tell your doctor if you have a history of amputation; heart disease or are at risk for heart disease; blocked or narrowed blood vessels (usually in leg); damage to the nerves (neuropathy) of your leg; diabetic foot ulcers or sores; kidney problems; liver problems; history of urinary tract infections or problems with urination; are on a low sodium (salt) diet; are going to have surgery; are eating less due to illness, surgery, or change in diet; pancreas problems; drink alcohol very often (or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term); ever had an allergic reaction to INVOKANA®; or have other medical conditions.
Tell your doctor if you are or plan to become pregnant, are breastfeeding, or plan to breastfeed. INVOKANA® may harm your unborn baby. If you become pregnant while taking INVOKANA®, tell your doctor right away. INVOKANA® may pass into your breast milk and may harm your baby. Do not breastfeed while taking INVOKANA®.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Especially tell your doctor if you take diuretics (water pills), rifampin (used to treat or prevent tuberculosis), phenytoin or phenobarbital (used to control seizures), ritonavir (Norvir®, Kaletra® – used to treat HIV infection), or digoxin (Lanoxin®– used to treat heart problems).
Possible Side Effects of INVOKANA®
INVOKANA® may cause serious side effects, including:
Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine). Ketoacidosis has happened in people who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, during treatment with INVOKANA®. Ketoacidosis is a serious condition, which may need to be treated in a hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. Ketoacidosis can happen with INVOKANA® even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL. Stop taking INVOKANA® and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, stomach-area pain, tiredness, or trouble breathing
Kidney problems. Sudden kidney injury has happened to people taking INVOKANA®. Talk to your doctor right away if you: 1) reduce the amount of food or liquid you drink, if you are sick, or cannot eat or 2) you start to lose liquids from your body from vomiting, diarrhea, or being in the sun too long
Serious Urinary Tract Infections: may lead to hospitalization and have happened in people taking INVOKANA®. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as: burning feeling while urinating, need to urinate often or right away, pain in the lower part of your stomach (pelvis), or blood in the urine. Some people may also have high fever, back pain, nausea, or vomiting
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). If you take INVOKANA® with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin, your risk of getting low blood sugar is higher. The dose of your sulfonylurea medicine or insulin may need to be lowered while you take INVOKANA®. Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar may include: headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, confusion, irritability, hunger, fast heartbeat, sweating, shaking, or feeling jittery
A rare but serious bacterial infection that destroys the tissue under the skin (necrotizing fasciitis) in the area between and around the anus and genitals (perineum). Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum has happened in women and men who take INVOKANA®. Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum may lead to hospitalization, may require multiple surgeries, and may lead to death. Seek medical attention immediately if you have fever or you are feeling very weak, tired, or uncomfortable (malaise) and you develop any of the following symptoms in the area between and around your anus and genitals: pain or tenderness, swelling, or redness of the skin (erythema)
Serious allergic reaction. If you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, stop taking INVOKANA® and call your doctor right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room
Broken Bones (fractures): Bone fractures have been seen in patients taking INVOKANA®. Talk to your doctor about factors that may increase your risk of bone fracture
The most common side effects of INVOKANA® include: vaginal yeast infections and yeast infections of the penis; changes in urination, including urgent need to urinate more often, in larger amounts, or at night.
Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC at 1-800-526-7736.

<h3>Roche presents positive Phase III results for Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in people with previously untreated advanced bladder cancer</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>IMvigor130 is the first positive Phase III study of a cancer immunotherapy combination in people with previously untreated advanced bladder cancer</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Tecentriq combination reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival) compared with chemotherapy alone</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Data will be presented today at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today presented positive results from the Phase III IMvigor130 study evaluating Tecentriq<sup>®</sup> (atezolizumab) plus platinum-based chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for the first-line (initial) treatment of people with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) eligible and ineligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. In the study, Tecentriq plus chemotherapy showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone (median PFS=8.2 versus 6.3 months; hazard ratio (HR)=0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.96; p=0.007). Encouraging overall survival (OS) results were observed for Tecentriq plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in the intention-to-treat population (ITT), however these data did not reach statistical significance at this interim analysis (median OS=16.0 versus 13.4 months; HR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.69-1.00). Safety in the Tecentriq plus chemotherapy arm appeared consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified with the combination.
“We are pleased with these positive results from the IMvigor130 study, which show Tecentriq plus chemotherapy may provide a meaningful benefit for people newly diagnosed with advanced bladder cancer,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “There remains a high unmet need for people with advanced bladder cancer, where chemotherapy alone is the current standard of care. These results reinforce the role of immunotherapy in treating this aggressive disease.”
Additional data from the Tecentriq monotherapy arm were also presented in the ITT population and people with different levels of PD-L1 expression. Encouraging OS results were observed with Tecentriq monotherapy in people with high PD-L1 expression (IC2/3), however, these data were not formally tested per the hierarchical design of the trial. Follow up will continue until the next analysis.
These data will be presented today at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 Congress Presidential Symposium at 17:53–18:05 CEST (Abstract LBA14) and were featured in the official ESMO press programme.
Tecentriq was the first cancer immunotherapy approved in advanced bladder cancer. Currently, there are four ongoing Phase III studies evaluating Tecentriq alone and in combination with other medicines in early and advanced bladder cancer. Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies, across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.
<h3>About the IMvigor130 study</h3>
IMvigor130 is a multicentre, partially blinded, randomised Phase III study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy or alone versus chemotherapy alone for people with mUC who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. It enrolled 1,213 people who received:
<ul>
 	<li>Tecentriq plus platinum-based chemotherapy (gemcitabine with either cisplatin or carboplatin), or</li>
 	<li>Tecentriq, or</li>
 	<li>Platinum-based chemotherapy (gemcitabine with either cisplatin or carboplatin) plus placebo (control arm).</li>
</ul>
In the Tecentriq combination arm, the co-primary endpoints are OS and PFS, as assessed by investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). The secondary endpoints are objective response rate and duration of response, as assessed by investigator using RECIST v1.1, and independent review facility assessed PFS.
A summary of the key study results is included below:
<figure><img src=""https://www.roche.com/dam/jcr:467ac3ac-7745-49cb-aa63-8ec99f923609/en/med-cor-30-09-2019-table.2019-09-30-14-09-42.jpg"" alt="""" /></figure>
Safety for the Tecentriq plus chemotherapy combination appeared consistent with the known safety profile of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified with the combination. There appeared to be no worsening of tolerability with the addition of Tecentriq to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. All cause Grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 85% of people receiving Tecentriq plus chemotherapy, compared with 86% of people receiving chemotherapy alone. Treatment-related Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 83% of people receiving Tecentriq plus chemotherapy, compared with 81% of people receiving chemotherapy alone. Any Grade AEs leading to any treatment discontinuation of Tecentriq or placebo were observed in 11% and 7% of people in the combination arm compared with the chemotherapy arm respectively.
<h3>About bladder cancer</h3>
In 2018, there were over half a million new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed globally, with around 200,000 deaths from the disease.<sup>1</sup> Urothelial carcinoma, which develops in the cells of the bladder lining, is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for about 90% of all cases.<sup>2</sup> In total, 30% of cases are considered advanced based on muscle-invasive or metastatic disease.<sup>3</sup> There remains a high unmet need for people facing previously untreated advanced bladder cancer. Despite improvements in tolerability, there have been no efficacy improvements for more than 30 years with chemotherapy as standard of care, and patients continue to experience poor outcomes.<sup>4,5</sup>
<h3>About Tecentriq</h3>
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.
Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

In an email to The Center for Biosimilars<sup>®</sup>, a Pfizer representative said that, after having agreed to the terms of a settlement with Genentech and Roche that provides the biosimilar developer with global licenses for its product, Pfizer plans to launch its biosimilar bevacizumab, Zirabev, in the US market on December 31, 2019.
Earlier this month, attorneys for both Genentech and Pfizer <a href=""https://www.bigmoleculewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Genentech-v-Pfizer-bevacizumab-Joint-Stipulation-of-Dismissal.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">entered</a> a joint stipulation of dismissal of their patent litigation in the case. The stipulation states that the parties are voluntarily dismissing all claims and counterclaims of an April 2019 complaint without prejudice.
In the original <a href=""https://www.bigmoleculewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Genentech-v-Pfizer-Complaint-bevacizumab.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">complaint</a>, Genentech alleged that Pfizer had not produced all necessary information concerning the biosimilar to Genentech, and also claimed that the biosimilar would infringe 23 of its patents.
These developments clear the way for Pfizer to commercialize the biosimilar, which was <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/news/fda-approves-pfizers-bevacizumab-biosimilar-zirabev"">approved</a> in June of this year by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, recurrent or metastatic nonsquamous non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), recurrent glioblastoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer.
The biosimilar, referencing Avastin, also earned the European Commission’s approval in February 2019 after having received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in December 2018.
Zirabev will join 1 other biosimilar bevacizumab in the US market; in July of 2019, Amgen launched its bevacizumab biosimilar, Mvasi, on the same day as it launched a biosimilar trastuzumab, Kanjinti. In Amgen’s case, no settlement was reached, and legal disputes over Mvasi are ongoing.
Last month, a panel of judges for the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href=""https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/news/court-of-appeals-for-the-federal-circuit-declines-to-halt-sales-of-biosimilar-bevacizumab"">denied</a> Genentech’s motion for an injunction that would have blocked Amgen from selling its biosimilar bevacizumab, Mvasi, pending the outcome of an appeal. The appeal relates to the court’s decision that Amgen did not need to provide Genentech with new notice of commercial marketing after filing supplements to its Biologics License Application.

<span class=""xn-location"">STOCKHOLM</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 30, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <b>Moberg Pharma AB (OMX: MOB) has signed an exclusive license agreement with Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd for development, registration and commercialization of MOB-015 in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>. Under the agreement, Moberg Pharma is eligible to receive milestones of up to <span class=""xn-money"">USD 50 million</span> contingent on development and commercial success, as well as supply fees including royalties.</b>
Moberg Pharma has entered into a license agreement granting Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd exclusive Japanese rights to MOB-015, a new topical treatment of onychomycosis based on Moberg's patented proprietary formulation of terbinafine. Taisho will fund and conduct the development and registration activities in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, and will be marketing, distributing and selling MOB-015 in <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> upon completion of registration.
""<i>We are excited to partner with Taisho for the large and growing Japanese onychomycosis market, contributing to our vision of making MOB-015 the leading nail fungus treatment worldwide,"" </i>says <span class=""xn-person"">Anna Ljung</span>, CEO of Moberg Pharma.
<i>""This is the third major agreement for MOB-015 and further validates the significant market potential for our lead asset and the focused commercialization preparations by our team,"" </i>says <span class=""xn-person"">Peter Wolpert</span>, Executive Chairman of Moberg Pharma.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Moberg Pharma provides supply for the product and provides Taisho with know-how and documentation from its international development program. Moberg Pharma is eligible to receive up to approximately <span class=""xn-money"">USD 50 million</span> in milestone payments, including <span class=""xn-money"">USD 5 million</span> paid at signing. The majority of the milestone payments are contingent on sales targets, with the balance contingent on development and regulatory milestones.  Moberg Pharma will also receive supply fees including royalties.
According to Moberg Pharma's market intelligence, the Japanese market for branded prescription drugs for onychomycosis amounted to <span class=""xn-money"">$290 million</span> in 2018, growing at more than 8 percent.
<b>About MOB-015 and Onychomycosis </b><br class=""dnr"" />Approximately 10% of the general population suffer from onychomycosis and a majority of those afflicted go untreated. The global market opportunity is significant with more than hundred million patients worldwide and a clear demand for better products. Moberg Pharma estimates the annual worldwide peak sales potential for MOB-015 to be in the range of <span class=""xn-money"">USD 250</span>-500 million.
MOB-015 is an internally developed topical formulation of terbinafine based on Moberg Pharma's experience from previously having developed and commercialized a leading OTC product for onychomycosis. Oral terbinafine is currently the gold standard for treating onychomycosis but associated with safety issues, including drug interactions and liver damage. For many years, developing a topical terbinafine treatment without the safety issues of oral terbinafine has been highly desirable, but unsuccessful due to insufficient delivery of the active substance through the nail.
In a previous phase 2 study, MOB-015 demonstrated delivery of high microgram levels of terbinafine into the nail and through the nail plate into the nail bed. Mycological cure of 54% and significant clear nail growth was observed in patients who completed the phase 2 study. The results are remarkable, particularly when taking into account the severity of the nails included in the study – on average approximately 60% of the nail plate was affected by the infection. Plasma levels of terbinafine with MOB-015 were substantially lower than after oral administration, reducing the risk of liver toxicities observed with oral terbinafine.
MOB-015 is currently being evaluated over 52 weeks in two randomized, multicenter, controlled Phase 3 studies, including in total more than 800 patients in <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>. The primary endpoint in both studies is the proportion of patients achieving complete cure of their target nail. Topline results from the North American study are expected in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2019</span>, followed by results in <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> expected in the second quarter of 2020.

<strong>Biocon Ltd </strong>and<strong> </strong><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2473498-1&amp;h=3529529949&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mylan.com%2F&amp;a=Mylan+N.V."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Mylan N.V.</strong></a> today announced the launch of Semglee<sup>®</sup> (insulin glargine solution for injection 100 IU/mL in a 3mL pre-filled pen), the first insulin glargine biosimilar in Australia available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).
Insulin glargine is a long-acting basal insulin analogue, given once daily to help control the blood sugar levels of those with diabetes. It is indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged six years and above and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults. Diabetes is recognised as the world’s fastest growing chronic condition and is the biggest challenge confronting Australia’s health system. Almost two million Australians have diabetes, with 280 Australian developing diabetes every day – one person every five minutes. The total annual cost impact of diabetes in Australia is estimated at $14.6 billion.<sup>1</sup>
More affordable treatment options for healthcare providers and their patients, such as biosimilars, generate savings that help manage the growing costs of Australia’s health care system, particularly the PBS.
The Government recognises the importance of driving biosimilar uptake to create a competitive and sustainable biosimilars market. In 2015, the Government committed to the Biosimilar Awareness Initiative and in 2018 increased its commitment by supporting the Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association through a $5 million grant to undertake activities that further promote the appropriate prescribing, dispensing and use of biosimilar medicines.
<strong>Dr Christiane Hamacher, CEO, Biocon Biologics said,</strong><em>
“We are extremely excited to enable affordable access to Semglee, a high quality biosimilar Insulin Glargine, co-developed and manufactured by Biocon Biologics, to people with diabetes in Australia. We are committed to use our science, scale and expertise to shift the access paradigm for patients in need of insulins across the globe. As a leading global insulins player, Biocon has been addressing the needs of patients with diabetes for over 15 years and we are confident that availability of Semglee through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will expand patient access to this therapy in Australia and will reduce the cost burden for PBS.  Today, patients in Europe, India and key emerging markets are already benefiting from our biosimilar Insulin Glargine.”</em>
<strong>Mylan Australia Country Manager, Sylvain Vigneault</strong>commented, ""<em>The launch of Semglee further demonstrates Mylan’s ongoing commitment to increase access to biosimilars for patients. Biosimilars mark a new era in treatment. They enable more patients to be treated, deliver significant savings to the PBS and help provide sustainability to the healthcare system overall.”</em>
<em>“We are delighted that Semglee enables Mylan to strengthen and support its global diabetes and metabolism portfolio of approximately 400 products</em>.”
Biosimilars have been used safely and effectively in Europe, USA, Australia and many other countries. Since 2006, in the EU alone, over 700 million patient days of clinical experience to more than 20 biosimilar medicines have been recorded<sup>2,3,4,5</sup>.
TGA approval of Semglee, co-developed by Biocon and Mylan, was based on robust data that demonstrated that Semglee is highly similar to the reference insulin glargine, with no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy, safety, purity and potency.
Mylan and Biocon's insulin glargine biosimilar is currently approved in more than 40 countries around the world.

<b>Amsterdam, the Netherlands and London, United Kingdom</b> – <a href=""http://www.philips.com/newscenter"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Royal Philips</a> (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, today announced <a href=""https://www.aakss.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Air Ambulance Kent Surrey Sussex</a> (AAKSS) will equip all of its emergency service helicopters with the Philips RDT Tempus ALS [1] and Philips IntelliSpace Corsium web-based software platform. AAKSS, which makes nearly 2,500 life-saving missions a year, many requiring urgent transfer of patients to major trauma centers across London, Brighton and Southampton, will be the first Emergency Service in the UK to use this new life-saving technology.
&nbsp;
The collaboration with Philips RDT and Air Ambulance Kent Surrey Sussex (AAKSS) in the UK marks the first time anywhere in the world that Helicopter Emergency Service (HEMS) teams, which include a doctor and paramedic, can live stream patient medical information – including electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, heart rhythm, pulse and respiration rate and blood pressure - from the scene to the receiving hospital, as well as the on-call air ambulance team. Philips Enhanced Data Service (EDS) minimizes data packets to enhance reliability over low bandwidth preventing data loss during transmission.

IntelliSpace Corsium expands the pre-hospital scope of secure data-sharing and care wider than ever before. The Philips RDT Tempus ALS captures and transmits clinical and on-scene data to be shared and reviewed in a two-way real-time consultation, to enhance decision making for AAKSS and other care givers. The Tempus ALS solution consists of the Tempus Pro portable, vital signs monitor, and the Tempus LS defibrillator. The monitor and defibrillator devices connect wirelessly together to share data and transfer patient vitals, waveforms and images into Philips IntelliSpace Corsium, a web-based software platform. This connectivity will provide the AAKSS with an interactive ECG measurement and two-way communication, enabling rapid clinical and transport decision support and seamless electronic patient care reporting (ePCR) integration.
&nbsp;
""In emergency situations where every second counts, having the ability to livestream a patient’s physiology data from an incident scene - whether in route on the ground or in the air - offers a tremendous opportunity for our team to improve the outcomes for our patients,” said Dr. Richard Lyon, Associate Medical Director, Air Ambulance Kent Surrey Sussex. “This collaboration with Philips RDT allows our teams to give better remote medical advice for our receiving hospitals to better prepare for the patient's arrival. As a charity that continually strives to improve patient care through innovation, we are excited to be working with Philips RDT and see the positive benefit this novel technology will bring.”
&nbsp;
“AAKSS takes an approach of innovation and thought leadership to help enhance patient outcomes through delivering the most effective patient care,” said Arman Voskerchyan, Business Leader of Therapeutic Care at Philips. “It’s exciting to collaborate with a team who visions that data—how it’s used, how it’s transmitted, and how it connects people and relevant information – and predictive analytics, derived from data, is the future of connected care. Connectivity and digital technology continue to drive how we are helping to save lives and improve patient care.”

<b>-Taltz met the primary endpoint of the IXORA-R study, with 41.3 percent of patients taking Taltz achieving complete skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 at Week 12 versus 24.9 percent of patients taking TREMFYA</b> <b>-Taltz also met all major secondary endpoints up to Week 12</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 3, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today presented detailed data at the 5<sup>th</sup> Annual Maui Derm NP+PA Fall meeting from the Phase 4 IXORA-R study, the first head-to-head (H2H) study between an IL-17A inhibitor and an IL-23/p19 inhibitor using the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 100 score as the primary endpoint. Taltz met the primary endpoint of superiority vs. TREMFYA in the proportion of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis achieving complete skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 at Week 12, as well as key secondary endpoints. The study is ongoing through Week 24.
""Healthcare providers and patients value speed of response when evaluating treatment options for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis,"" said lead study investigator Andrew Blauvelt, M.D., M.B.A., dermatologist and president of Oregon Medical Research Center in Portland, OR. ""The results from the IXORA-R study demonstrate that Taltz was effective in helping more patients achieve completely clear skin by Week 12, with a 50 percent improvement in skin plaques seen as early as Week 1.""
The primary endpoint of the study was superiority for Taltz compared to TREMFYA in the proportion of patients achieving complete skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 at Week 12. Key secondary endpoints included superiority over TREMFYA in the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at Week 2, PASI 90 at Weeks 4 and 8, PASI 100 at Weeks 4, 8 and 24, static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) 0 at Week 12 and PASI 50 at Week 1.
Patients treated with Taltz demonstrated statistically significantly higher improvements than those treated with TREMFYA as measured by PASI 100 at Week 12 (41.3 percent versus 24.9 percent, P&lt;0.001). Additionally, all major secondary endpoints up to Week 12 were achieved (P&lt;0.001).
""As new medicines become available for people living with psoriasis, there's an increasing need to directly compare the efficacy and safety of these treatments to help healthcare providers and patients make informed treatment decisions,"" said Rhonda Pacheco, Pharm.D., global brand development leader for immunology at Lilly. ""These results demonstrate that Taltz can provide high levels of skin clearance early in treatment for people with psoriasis.""
A total of 1,027 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were enrolled in the study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Taltz compared to TREMFYA. Participants were randomized to receive Taltz or TREMFYA at the approved dose for a total of 24 weeks, with the primary analysis conducted at 12 weeks.
In IXORA-R, the safety profiles of Taltz and TREMFYA were consistent with those previously reported for both treatments. As the IXORA-R study is ongoing, not all data will be presented at this meeting to prevent unblinding for investigators and participants. Lilly plans to share results on the remaining key secondary endpoint of proportion of patients achieving PASI 100 at 24 weeks in 2020.
<b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR TALTZ
</b>Taltz is approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Taltz is also approved for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TALTZ</b>
<b>CONTRAINDICATIONS
</b>Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.
<b>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
</b><b>Infections
</b>Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.
<b>Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis
</b>Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
<b>Hypersensitivity
</b>Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each =0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.
<b>Inflammatory Bowel Disease
</b>During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz 80 mg Q2W group (Crohn's disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than in the placebo group (0%) during clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis and in the Taltz Q4W group in ankylosing spondylitis trials (Crohn's disease 1.0% [2 patients], ulcerative colitis 0.5% [1 patient]) than in the placebo group (Crohn's disease 0.5% [1 patient], ulcerative colitis 0%). In the ankylosing spondylitis trials, serious events occurred in 1 patient in the Taltz group and 1 patient in the placebo group.
<b>Immunizations
</b>Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.
<b>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</b>Most common adverse reactions (=1%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profiles observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis were consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis in psoriatic arthritis.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>KEYTRUDA is First Anti-PD-1 Therapy Approved as Monotherapy and in Combination with Chemotherapy in First-Line Setting for NSCLC in China</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (tumor proportion score [TPS] =1%) as determined by a NMPA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. This new indication was granted full approval based on the overall survival (OS) findings from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-042 trial, including data from an extension of the global study in Chinese patients. KEYTRUDA is now the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in China as both monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of appropriate patients with NSCLC.
“New treatment options that can help improve survival outcomes are desperately needed in China, as lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in this country,” said Professor Yi-Long Wu, honorary director of the Guangdong Lung Cancer Research Institute, and tenured professor of Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital. “In KEYNOTE-042, KEYTRUDA monotherapy demonstrated a survival benefit, compared with chemotherapy alone, across histologies in patients with either locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% of tumor cells.”
KEYNOTE-042 is an international, randomized, multi-center, open-label, active-controlled trial in patients with stage III NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic NSCLC, and whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (TPS =1%) and who had not received prior systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC. In the extension of the global study in Chinese patients, KEYTRUDA monotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS compared with chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a TPS =50% (HR=0.62 [95% CI, 0.38-1.00]), with a TPS =20% (HR=0.62 [95% CI, 0.41-0.95]) and in the entire study population with a TPS =1% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.45-0.94]). Results from the KEYNOTE-042 China extension study were recently presented for the first time at the IASLC 2019 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and showed consistent results in Chinese patients.
“KEYTRUDA is now the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in China as both a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line setting for appropriate patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “For patients for whom combination therapy is not preferred, KEYTRUDA monotherapy represents an important new treatment option that has demonstrated a significant improvement in survival outcomes.”
“In China, we launched KEYTRUDA one year ago, and already it has had an impact on patient care in the approved indications,” said Joseph Romanelli, president of MSD in China. “Now, with a third indication in China, we look forward to offering an additional effective option in non-small cell lung cancer patients with PD-L1 levels of 1% or greater.”
<b>About Lung Cancer in China
</b>Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death in China and worldwide. Each year, more than 787,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed in China and more than 631,000 deaths result from the disease. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of all cases. There are several subtypes of NSCLC, including adenocarcinoma (accounting for 40% of lung<b></b>cancers), squamous cell carcinoma (25 to 30%) and large cell carcinoma (10 to 15%).
<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg
</strong>KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)
</b><i>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
</i>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib
</i>KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
</b>Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
</b>Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions
</b>KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
</b>Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
</b>In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
<b>Embryofetal Toxicity
</b>Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

<p class=""prntac""><i>New anti-CGRP treatment for the prevention of migraine in adults  </i><i>with at least 4 migraine days per month</i><i><sup>1</sup></i><i><br class=""dnr"" /></i></p>
<span class=""xn-location"">TORONTO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Oct. 2, 2019</span> /CNW/ - Eli Lilly Canada Inc. (<span class=""xn-person"">Lilly Canada</span>) is pleased to announce the availability of Emgality™ (galcanezumab) in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span>. Emgality is indicated for the prevention of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month.<sup>1</sup>
Migraine is a complex neurological disease that has a crippling effect<sup>2</sup> on the lives of nearly three million Canadians,<sup>3</sup> and globally migraine was the second leading cause of disability in 2016.<sup>4</sup><b> </b>Living with migraine results in collateral damage on all aspects of life – its debilitating physical effects impact work, social life, relationships and mental well-being.<sup>5</sup>
""Every day in the clinic I meet people who suffer with debilitating migraines that impact their quality of life. Migraine-specific medications that work to prevent and ultimately reduce migraine days are needed to treat this disease,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Leroux, Headache Neurologist in <span class=""xn-location"">Montreal</span> and President of the Canadian Headache Society. ""Clinical data show that treatment with Emgality may significantly reduce migraine days for these patients. This is good news.""
""Migraine is a complex disease that impacts patients in many different ways. The research on CGRP has led to a new class of migraine preventives for Canadians living with episodic and chronic migraine,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Jillian Reardon</span>, Secretary of Migraine Canada and pharmacist in British Columbia.  ""CGRP antibodies may help those who need relief from the pain and associated symptoms of migraine. Migraine Canada welcomes new treatments, like galcanezumab, that may improve the lives of Canadians with migraine.""
<b>About Emgality</b>
Emgality, specifically designed to prevent migraine, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and inhibits its biological activity.<sup>1</sup> Taken once monthly, the recommended initial (loading) dose of Emgality is 240 mg (administered as two injections), followed by once monthly doses of 120 mg (one injection) delivered via subcutaneous injection.<sup>1</sup>
The auto injector device used to administer Emgality was designed with patients in mind: it is ready to use and comes with a pre-attached hidden needle. Patients don't need to see or handle the needle, making for an easier injection experience.<sup>6</sup>
<b>About the research behind Emgality<sup>1</sup><br class=""dnr"" /></b>The safety and efficacy of Emgality was evaluated in clinical trials that included more than 2,500 patients. Emgality was evaluated as a preventive treatment (a treatment expected to decrease migraine headache frequency) of episodic or chronic migraine in three Phase 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adult patients:
<ul>
 	<li>EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 were randomized, 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that enrolled adult patients with episodic migraine (defined as 4-14 migraine headache days [MHDs] per month).</li>
 	<li>REGAIN was a randomized, 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled adult patients with chronic migraine (defined as at least 15 headache days per month with at least 8 MHDs per month).</li>
</ul>
In all three trials, patients were randomized to receive once-monthly placebo, Emgality 120 mg after an initial loading dose of 240 mg, or Emgality 240 mg. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs over the double-blind treatment period in the intent-to-treat study population.
<b>EVOLVE-1</b><b><sup>7</sup></b><b> (Over Months 1 to 6 - baseline migraine headache days: Emgality 9.2, placebo 9.1)</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Mean change from baseline (days): -4.7 days (N=210) for Emgality 120 mg compared to -2.8 days (N=425) for placebo (p&lt;0.001)</li>
 	<li>Up to 3 in 5 patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in MHDs in any given month on average (% responders): 62% (N=210) for Emgality 120 mg compared to 39% (N=425) for placebo (p&lt;0.001)</li>
 	<li>More than 1 in 3 patients achieved at least a 75% reduction in MHDs in any given month on average (% responders): 39% (N=210) for Emgality 120 mg compared to 19% (N=425) for placebo (p&lt;0.001)</li>
 	<li>Up to 1 in 7 patients achieved a 100% reduction in monthly MHDs (p&lt;0.001) in any given month on average (% responders): 16% (N=210) for Emgality 120 mg compared to 6% (N=425) for placebo (p&lt;0.001)</li>

<ul>
 	<li>Mean change from baseline (days): -4.8 days (N=273) for Emgality 120 mg compared to -2.7 days (N=538) for placebo (p&lt;0.001)</li>

</ul>
In the three integrated pivotal migraine placebo-controlled study periods, injection site pain was the most frequently (=10%) reported adverse event. In most patients, reported injection site pain occurred within site reactions were reported within one day, and most resolved within a few days. Most events were mild to moderate and did not lead to discontinuation of Emgality.<sup>1</sup>

<b>About obesity</b>
Obesity is a complex, chronic disease that is influenced by multiple aspects, including physiological, psychological, genetic, environmental and socioeconomic factors.<sup>1</sup> It is associated with many serious health consequences<sup>2</sup> and decreased life expectancy.<sup>3</sup> Obesity is not a life choice or simply a question about willpower<sup>4</sup> and necessary help and support can be hard to find. There are few healthcare professionals trained in obesity care and patients often see their excess weight as something they should be able to solve on their own.<sup>5,6</sup> Like any other chronic disease, the long-term management of obesity requires a full spectrum of treatment approaches, including lifestyle change and intervention, as well as pharmacotherapy or surgery.<sup>7</sup> The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems.<sup>8,9</sup> In 2016, 13% of adults, or approximately 650 million adults, were living with obesity worldwide.<sup>8</sup>

<p class=""""><em>-Goldfinch Bio to assume all development and commercialization responsibilities for the treatment of rare and metabolic kidney diseases worldwide-</em></p>
<p class=""""></p>
<p class="""">CAMBRIDGE, Mass., October 3, 2019 – Goldfinch Bio, a U.S.-based, clinical stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing precision medicines for the treatment of kidney diseases, today announced it entered into a license agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) for worldwide rights to a preclinical, peripherally-restricted cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) monoclonal antibody. Goldfinch Bio will assume all development and commercialization responsibilities for the treatment of rare and metabolic kidney diseases worldwide. However, the agreement grants Takeda the option, prior to the initiation of pivotal studies, to request Goldfinch Bio negotiate with Takeda for sub-licensing of Japanese rights to Takeda. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Goldfinch Bio plans to file an investigational new drug (IND) application for this CB1 inhibitor, re-named GFB-024, in the second half of 2020.
“In recent years, our understanding of the role of CB1 signaling in exacerbating progressive kidney diseases has grown substantially. In this context, a monoclonal antibody directed toward the CB1 receptor is potentially well-suited to elicit the beneficial pharmacology associated with the peripheral inhibition of the CB1 receptor,” said Anthony Johnson, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Goldfinch Bio. “Goldfinch Bio will deploy its biology platform and Kidney Genome AtlasTM to develop this therapeutic agent in subsets of patients with kidney diseases most likely to preferentially respond to CB1 inhibition. With GFB-887, our TRPC5 inhibitor for FSGS, in Phase 1 clinical development, this peripheral CB1 inhibitor will be the second clinic-ready program in Goldfinch Bio’s pipeline. We look forward to collaborating with Takeda on this program.”
“Goldfinch Bio is ideally suited to advance development of this program,” said Dan Curran, M.D., SVP and Head, Rare Diseases Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “The application of its precision medicine approach, from candidate target validation through to identification of potential treatment-relevant subgroups, is unique in the development of chronic metabolic kidney disease treatments.”
Preclinical data support the inhibition of CB1 signaling as a novel treatment of Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) and obesity-related glomerulopathies (ORG), given the potential metabolic benefits and direct effects on the kidney to prevent fibrosis and preserve kidney function. DN develops in 30 to 40 percent of patients who have diabetes and is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality and end-stage kidney disease in the United States and worldwide. ORG is a rare kidney disorder characterized by significant proteinuria and progressive renal dysfunction. Although both DN and ORG are increasing in prevalence in parallel with the obesity epidemic, well-established disease modifying therapies are lacking. Goldfinch Bio plans to initiate a phase 1 study for GFB-024 in 2H 2020.

<p class=""bwalignc""> <b><i>- Descovy</i></b> <b><i>Demonstrated Non-inferior Efficacy and an Improved Bone and Renal Safety Profile Compared with Truvada</i></b><i><sup>® </sup><b>in People at Risk for Sexually Acquired HIV Infection in a Global Phase 3 Trial -</b></i></p>
 FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 3, 2019-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) indication for Descovy (emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets; F/TAF). Descovy for PrEP™ is indicated to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg who are HIV-negative and at-risk for sexually acquired HIV, excluding individuals at-risk from receptive vaginal sex.
“Descovy for PrEP provides a new HIV prevention option that matches Truvada’s high efficacy with statistically significant improvements in renal and bone safety, which can be an important consideration as people at risk increasingly use PrEP for longer periods of time,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. “This is a reflection of Gilead’s continued commitment to addressing the evolving needs of people living with or at risk for HIV and to driving innovation across the HIV care continuum.”
The FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Descovy under a priority review designation. Descovy has a Boxed Warning in its U.S. product label regarding the risk of post treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B. The Descovy label also includes a Boxed Warning regarding the risk of drug resistance with PrEP use in undiagnosed early HIV-1 infection. The effectiveness of Descovy for PrEP in individuals at risk of HIV-1 from receptive vaginal sex has not been established; please see below for Important Safety Information.
The approval of a PrEP indication for Descovy, taken once daily with or without food in patients weighing at least 35 kg, is based on data from the DISCOVER trial, a multi-year global Phase 3 registrational clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Descovy for PrEP compared with that of Truvada (emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg tablets; F/TDF) for PrEP<sup>®</sup> in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. Enrollment included more than 5,300 adult cisgender men who have sex with men or transgender women (TGW) who have sex with men.
The primary efficacy endpoint of DISCOVER was the incidence of documented HIV infection per 100 person-years after all participants had follow-up of at least 48 weeks and at least half had 96 weeks of follow-up. These data, which were presented in March at the 2019 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), included 5,387 individuals who were randomized 1:1 to receive either Descovy or Truvada. Among the 2,694 participants (4,370 person-years (PY)) who were at risk of HIV-1 infection and received once-daily Descovy, seven HIV-1 infections (HIV-1 incidence 0.16/100 PY) were reported. Among the 2,693 participants (4,386 PY) who were at risk of HIV-1 infection and received Truvada, 15 HIV infections (0.34/100 PY) were reported.
Results from the DISCOVER trial demonstrated that Descovy achieved non-inferiority to Truvada in study participants who were at risk of HIV acquisition. Efficacy was strongly correlated to adherence to daily dosing.
Additionally, statistically significant advantages were observed with respect to all six pre-specified secondary endpoints for both renal and bone laboratory parameters in patients receiving Descovy compared to Truvada.
“Today, because of landmark biomedical and scientific research advances, there are unprecedented opportunities to significantly reduce new HIV infections,” said Edwin DeJesus, MD, FACP, FIDSA, Medical Director, Orlando Immunology Center. “Descovy for PrEP offers healthcare providers and appropriate people at risk for HIV an additional biomedical prevention option with a demonstrated improvement in bone and renal safety parameters as compared to Truvada.”
Descovy does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections or cure HIV infection or AIDS.

<b><span class=""bwuline"">About PrEP</span></b>
PrEP is an HIV prevention strategy in which medicine is taken daily before an HIV-negative person may be exposed to the virus through sex to help reduce the risk of infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), PrEP is highly effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection in at-risk populations.
Prevention methods, including PrEP, and safer sex practices are essential tools in the effort to end the HIV epidemic. PrEP use received an “A” rating from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), signifying that PrEP has a high certainty of substantial preventive benefits for reducing the risk of HIV. In addition, PrEP is recommended by the CDC, the World Health Organization and other national healthcare organizations as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy for individuals at risk for HIV.
<b>IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR DESCOVY FOR PREP </b>
<b>INDICATION</b>
DESCOVY for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is indicated in at-risk adults and adolescents (=35 kg) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex. HIV-1-negative status must be confirmed immediately prior to initiation.
Limitation of Use: DESCOVY FOR PrEP is not indicated in individuals at risk of HIV-1 from receptive vaginal sex because effectiveness in this population has not been evaluated.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION </b>
<b>BOXED WARNING: RISK OF DRUG RESISTANCE WITH USE OF DESCOVY FOR PrEP IN UNDIAGNOSED EARLY HIV-1 INFECTION and POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li> <b>DESCOVY FOR PrEP must be prescribed only to patients confirmed to be HIV negative immediately prior to initiation and at least every 3 months during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) for HIV-1 PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection.

</ul>
<b>Contraindication </b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li>DESCOVY FOR PrEP is contraindicated in patients with unknown or positive HIV status</li>
</ul>
<b>Warnings and precautions </b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li> <b>Comprehensive management to reduce risks:</b>
<ul class=""bwlistcircle"">
 	<li>Use DESCOVY FOR PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection as part of a comprehensive strategy that includes adherence to daily dosing and safer sex practices, including condoms, to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</li>
 	<li> <b>HIV-1 risk factors: </b>Behavioral, biological, or epidemiologic HIV-1 risk factors may include, but are not limited to: condomless sex, past or current STIs, self-identified HIV risk, having sexual partners of unknown HIV-1 viremic status, or sexual activity in a high-prevalence area or network</li>
 	<li> <b>Reduce STI risk:</b> Counsel on the use of STI prevention measures (e.g., consistent and correct condom use, knowledge of partner’s HIV-1 viremic status, regular testing for STIs</li>
 	<li> <b>Reduce potential for drug resistance:</b> Only prescribe DESCOVY FOR PrEP to patients confirmed to be HIV negative immediately prior to initiation, at least every 3 months while taking DESCOVY, and upon an STI diagnosis. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in patients with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only DESCOVY because DESCOVY alone is not a complete regimen for treating HIV-1</li>
 	<li>Some HIV tests may not detect acute HIV infection. Prior to initiating DESCOVY FOR PrEP, ask patients about potential recent exposure events. If recent (&lt;1 month) exposures are reported or suspected, or symptoms of acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash) are present, confirm HIV-negative status with a test approved by the FDA for use in the diagnosis of acute HIV infection</li>
 	<li>If HIV-1 infection is suspected or if symptoms of acute infection are present while taking DESCOVY FOR PrEP, convert the DESCOVY FOR PrEP regimen to a complete HIV treatment regimen until HIV-negative status is confirmed by a test approved by the FDA for use in the diagnosis of acute HIV infection</li>
 	<li> <b>Counsel on adherence: </b>Counsel patients to strictly adhere to daily dosing, as efficacy is strongly correlated with adherence. Some patients, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li> <b>New onset or worsening renal impairment: </b>Cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs. Do not initiate DESCOVY in patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min. Patients with impaired renal function and/or taking nephrotoxic agents (including NSAIDs) are at increased risk of renal-related adverse reactions. Discontinue DESCOVY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Monitor renal function in all patients (see Dosage and Administration section)</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li> <b>Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis:</b> Fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC and TDF. Discontinue use if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity develop, including hepatomegaly and steatosis in the absence of marked transaminase elevations</li>
</ul>
<b>Adverse reactions</b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li> <b>Most common adverse reactions </b>(=2%) in the DESCOVY FOR PrEP clinical trial were diarrhea, nausea, headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain</li>
</ul>
<b>Drug interactions </b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li> <b>Prescribing information: </b>Consult the full Prescribing Information for DESCOVY for more information, warnings, and potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments</li>
 	<li> <b>Metabolism:</b> Drugs that inhibit P-gp can increase the concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a component of DESCOVY. Drugs that induce P-gp can decrease the concentrations of TAF, which may lead to loss of efficacy</li>
 	<li> <b>Drugs affecting renal function: </b>Coadministration of DESCOVY with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC and tenofovir and the risk of adverse reactions</li>
</ul>
<b>Dosage and administration </b>
<ul class=""bwlistdisc"">
 	<li> <b>Dosage: </b>One tablet taken once daily with or without food</li>
 	<li> <b>HIV screening:</b>Test for HIV-1 infection immediately prior to initiating, at least every 3 months during use, and upon diagnosis of an STI (see Warnings and Precautions section)</li>
 	<li> <b>HBV screening:</b>Test for HBV infection prior to or when initiating DESCOVY</li>
 	<li> <b>Renal impairment and monitoring:</b> Not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min. Prior to or when initiating DESCOVY, and during use on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, assess serum phosphorus</li>

<h3><b><i>Fasenra is now the only respiratory biologic that offers the choice of administration
at home or in a doctor’s office with eight-week maintenance dosing
</i></b></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""text parbase section"">
<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the self-administration of <i>Fasenra</i> (benralizumab) in a pre-filled, single-use auto-injector (the <i>Fasenra</i> <i>Pen</i>).
The approval is supported by data from the Phase III GRECO trial and the Phase I AMES trial. The safety and tolerability of <i>Fasenra</i> in these trials were consistent with the established profile of the medicine.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “<i>Fasenra </i>is the only respiratory biologic that can be given every eight weeks after the initial loading-dose period. Today’s news means we can now offer <i>Fasenra</i> in an even more convenient way, giving US healthcare providers and patients the option of administering <i>Fasenra</i> at home or in a doctor’s office, and making treatment more accessible to patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.”
<i>Fasenra</i> self-administration and the <i>Fasenra Pen</i> are also approved in the European Union (EU). <i>Fasenra</i> is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan and other countries.
<b>About GRECO and AMES</b>
GRECO is a Phase III multicentre, open-label, 28-week trial designed to assess patient- or caregiver-reported functionality, performance and reliability of a pre-filled auto-injector device with a fixed 30mg dose of <i>Fasenra</i> administered subcutaneously (SC) every four weeks in clinic and in an at-home setting in 120 adults with severe, uncontrolled asthma.<sup>1</sup>The majority (97%) of at-home administrations by patients or caregivers were successful at week 12 and week 16 and nearly all (96%) of the returned pre-filled auto-injector devices used to administer <i>Fasenra</i> at home were evaluated as being functional at week 12 and week 16.
AMES is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group Phase I trial in healthy people to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure following single 30mg SC administration of <i>Fasenra</i> by using pre-filled syringe or pre-filled auto-injector devices.<sup>2</sup> <i>Fasenra</i> PK exposure was comparable following SC administration via a pre-filled syringe or a pre-filled auto-injector. Eosinophils were rapidly depleted in patients from both device-type groups.
The safety profile in both trials was similar to previous trials, with no new or unexpected safety findings. The most common adverse events observed in each trial were:
•      GRECO: viral upper respiratory tract infection, asthma, upper respiratory tract infection, headache.<sup>1</sup>
•      AMES: nasopharyngitis, headache, oropharyngeal pain.<sup>2</sup>
<b>About the <i>Fasenra</i> <i>Pen</i></b>
The US approval of the <i>Fasenra Pen</i> provides healthcare professionals and patients the option for <i>Fasenra</i> to be administered outside of a clinical setting via auto-injector by a patient or caregiver after their healthcare professional decides it is appropriate. The <i>Fasenra</i> pre-filled syringe is available for administration by a healthcare professional.
The <i>Fasenra</i> <i>Pen</i> enables patients and caregivers to administer the medicine via a simple two-step process. The device includes a viewing window and audible clicks at the start and end of the injection to guide patients with successful administration.
<b>About <i>Fasenra</i></b>
<i>Fasenra</i> is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to the IL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis (programmed cell death).<sup>3,4</sup>
<i>Fasenra</i> is AstraZeneca’s first respiratory biologic, now approved as an add-on maintenance treatment in severe eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan and other countries, with further regulatory reviews ongoing. Where approved for self-administration,<i> Fasenra</i> will be available both as a fixed 30mg SC injection via a pre-filled, single-use syringe or as the <i>Fasenra</i> <i>Pen</i>, both with a thin 29-gauge needle, administered once every four weeks for the first three doses and once every eight weeks thereafter.
<i>Fasenra</i> is also in development for severe nasal polyposis, other eosinophilic diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to <i>Fasenra</i> for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in November 2018, hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) in February 2019 and eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) in August 2019.
<i>Fasenra</i> was developed by AstraZeneca and is in-licensed from BioWa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., Japan.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","WARMINSTER, Pa., Oct. 03, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS), a Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) therapeutic solutions company, today announced its decision to discontinue the clinical development of AB-506, an oral capsid inhibitor. AB-506 was in a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

William H. Collier, President and Chief Executive Officer of Arbutus, stated, “We have observed two cases of acute hepatitis in our Phase 1a 28-day clinical trial in healthy volunteers. Consequently, the clinical trial and further development of AB-506 have been stopped.”
“The two subjects are experiencing resolution of their acute hepatitis. We will continue to follow them and the other study participants, as safety is our highest priority at Arbutus,” said Gaston Picchio, Ph.D. Chief Development Officer of Arbutus. “We intend to present results from the AB-506 Phase 1a/1b clinical trial along with further details regarding the two cases of acute hepatitis at an appropriate scientific meeting later in 2019.”
Michael J. Sofia, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Arbutus, added, “While we are disappointed in these recent clinical findings, we have a number of oral follow-on capsid inhibitor compounds with distinct chemical scaffolds that we believe have the potential to contribute to the inhibition of HBV replication as part of a combination regimen. Our objective is to select one of several lead compounds for IND-enabling studies by December of this year.”
As a result of the decision to discontinue further development of AB-506, Arbutus no longer expects to initiate a combination study of AB-506 and AB-729 in the second half of 2020.
About AB-506

AB-506 is an oral HBV capsid inhibitor. HBV core protein assembles into a capsid structure, which is required for viral replication. The current standard-of-care therapy for HBV, primarily nucleoside analogues that work by stopping the viral polymerase, significantly reduce virus replication, but not completely. Capsid inhibitors inhibit replication by preventing the assembly of functional viral capsids and also by inhibiting the uncoating step of the viral life cycle thus reducing the formation of new covalently closed circular DNA (“cccDNA”), the viral reservoir which resides in the cell nucleus.
About AB-729

AB-729 is a RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic targeted to hepatocytes using Arbutus’ novel covalently conjugated N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology that enables subcutaneous delivery with expected monthly dosing. AB-729 inhibits viral replication and reduces all HBV antigens, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in preclinical models. Reducing HBsAg is thought to be a key prerequisite to enable reawakening of a patient’s immune system to respond to the virus.

Forward-Looking Statements and Information

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws (collectively, “forward-looking statements”). Forward-looking statements in this press release include statements about our ability to deliver a cure for people with chronic HBV; our expectations regarding the timing and clinical development of our product candidates; our intention to present results from the AB-506 Phase 1a/1b clinical trial along with further details regarding the two cases of acute hepatitis at an appropriate scientific meeting; our confidence that capsid inhibition is important to achieve a potential cure for CHB; our belief that our oral follow on capsid inhibitor compounds have the potential to contribute to the inhibition of HBV replication as part of a combination regimen; our objective to select one of several lead capsid inhibitor compounds for IND-enabling studies by December of this year; and our expectation that we will no longer initiate a combination study of AB-506 and AB-729 in the second half of 2020.
With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, Arbutus has made numerous assumptions regarding, among other things: the effectiveness and timeliness of preclinical and clinical trials, and the usefulness of the data; the timeliness of regulatory approvals; the continued demand for Arbutus’ assets; and the stability of economic and market conditions. While Arbutus considers these assumptions to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, market and social uncertainties and contingencies.
Additionally, there are known and unknown risk factors which could cause Arbutus’ actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein. Known risk factors include, among others: delays in the selection of and the advancement of an additional capsid inhibitor compound into lead optimization, anticipated pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be more costly or take longer to complete than anticipated, and may never be initiated or completed, or may not generate results that warrant future development of the tested drug candidate; Arbutus may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals for the clinical development of Arbutus’ products; economic and market conditions may worsen; and market shifts may require a change in strategic focus.
A more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing Arbutus appears in Arbutus’ Annual Report on Form 10-K, Arbutus’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Arbutus’ continuous and periodic disclosure filings, which are available at www.sedar.com and at www.sec.gov.

<span class=""xn-location"">RARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Oct. 3, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for niraparib, an orally-administered poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with BRCA1/2 gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received prior taxane chemotherapy and androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation is granted to expedite the development and regulatory review of an investigational medicine that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition.<sup>1</sup> The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy Designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy.<sup>1</sup>
BRCA1/2 mutations are the most common DNA-repair gene defects (DRD) in patients with mCRPC.<sup>2</sup> Patients with a DRD in BRCA1/2 are at an elevated risk for both prostate cancer occurrence and more aggressive disease.<sup>2</sup>
""Niraparib is a PARP inhibitor that we believe may help address an important unmet need for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have mutations in DNA-repair genes,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Kiran Patel</span>, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Development, Solid Tumors, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""We are pleased with the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation as we continue the clinical development of niraparib, and we look forward to working with the agency in our continued focus and commitment to bring new advancements to patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.""
The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on data from the GALAHAD study, a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of niraparib in the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC and DRD who had received treatment with next-generation androgen-receptor targeting therapies and docetaxel.<sup>3</sup> Data from the Phase 2 <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2593631-1&amp;h=2922155530&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02854436&amp;a=GALAHAD"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">GALAHAD</a> study were recently <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2593631-1&amp;h=2605732835&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Foncologypro.esmo.org%2FMeeting-Resources%2FESMO-2019-Congress%2FPre-specified-interim-analysis-of-GALAHAD-A-phase-2-study-of-niraparib-in-patients-pts-with-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-mCRPC-and-biallelic-DNA-repair-gene-defects-DRD&amp;a=presented"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">presented</a> at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 Annual Congress as a late-breaking abstract.
<b>About Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer<br class=""dnr"" /></b>Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is a form of prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and keeps growing even when the amount of testosterone in the body is reduced to very low levels.<sup>4,5</sup> The most common metastatic sites are bones, followed by distant lymph nodes, liver and thorax.<sup>6</sup> Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men worldwide.<sup>7</sup> More than one million people around the world are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year.<sup>7,8</sup>

</ul>
<strong>Basel, October 5, 2019</strong> – AveXis, a Novartis company, today announced new interim data from the Phase 1/2 STRONG study for intrathecal (IT) administration of AVXS-101, demonstrating older patients (= 2 years and &lt; 5 years) with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 2 achieved a mean increase of 5.9 points from baseline in HFMSE scores, nearly double the clinically meaningful threshold, at a mean duration of follow-up time of 9.3 months. This is up from a mean increase of 4.2 points from baseline in HFMSE scores presented in May 2019 at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. Half of the older patients with SMA Type 2 experienced a clinically meaningful response in motor function gains starting at one month post-treatment, defined as a = 3-point increase from baseline in HFMSE scores. HFMSE is a well-recognized functional scale used clinically and in clinical trials to measure physical abilities and motor function in non-ambulatory and ambulatory individuals with SMA Type 2 and 3.<em>[6]</em> These data were presented at the 24<sup>th</sup> World Muscle Society (WMS) annual congress.
“Given the natural history of this devastating and rare genetic disease, many children will never stand or walk independently without therapeutic intervention. Today’s results – although early – are extremely encouraging for families who hope to see their children with SMA Type 2 experience meaningful improvement in motor function and important milestones, like standing and walking, following a one-time intrathecal administration of AVXS-101,” said Douglas M. Sproule, MD, vice president, SMA Therapeutic Head, AveXis. “These data presented at the congress, along with long-term follow-up data from the STR1VE and SPR1NT studies, support a continually advancing body of evidence on the clinical impact gene therapy treatment may have for those fighting this devastating and rare genetic disease, regardless of type or severity.”
<strong>Phase 1/2 STRONG Data as of</strong> <strong>May 31, 2019</strong>
STRONG is an ongoing, open-label, dose-comparison, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of one-time IT administration of AVXS-101 in patients with SMA Type 2 who have three copies of the <em>SMN2</em> gene, and who are able to sit but cannot stand or walk at the time of study entry. Patients were divided into two groups based on age at time of treatment: patients who are =6 months but &lt; 2 years and patients who are = 2 years but &lt; 5 years. As of the data cut-off, 31 patients are enrolled and have been treated with one of three doses: Dose A (6.0 x 10[1][3] vg), Dose B (1.2 x 10[1][4] vg) and Dose C (2.4 x 10[1][4] vg). Data from Dose C were not presented at WMS. Three of 36 (8.3%) of patients screened were excluded due to elevated titers of anti-AAV9 antibodies.
In patients = 6 months to &lt; 2 years old:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The primary efficacy endpoint is the ability to stand without support for = 3 seconds</li>
 	<li>The secondary efficacy endpoint is the ability to walk independently for = 5 steps, according to the Bayley-III Gross Motor Milestone Scale</li>
 	<li>Since treatment, 18 motor milestones were achieved among the 16 patients who received Dose A or Dose B, including two patients who gained the ability to stand independently, one of whom went on to walk alone</li>
</ul>
In patients = 2 years to &lt; 5 years old:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>The primary efficacy endpoint is change in HFMSE score from baseline</li>
 	<li>The secondary efficacy endpoint is the ability to walk independently for = 5 steps according to the Bayley-III Gross Motor Milestone Scale</li>
 	<li>Patients showed a clinically meaningful improvement in motor function, having a mean 5.9-point increase from baseline in HFMSE scores at their most recent visit, at a mean duration of follow-up time of 9.3 months
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>In a responder analysis, half of patients (6/12) had a = 3-point increase, which was observed starting at one month post-treatment</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Since treatment, four motor milestones have been achieved among 12 patients in the Dose B group, including one patient who gained the ability to walk with assistance</li>
</ul>
All patients in STRONG study experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 13 patients (43%) were reported to have a TEAE considered by the investigator to be related to treatment. Serious TEAEs were reported in 13% (n=4) of patients. A total of seven serious TEAEs were reported in four patients (n=1 each): influenza, pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus infection, elevated ALT, elevated AST, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, and respiratory failure. Elevated ALT and AST (in one patient) were considered probably related to treatment. None of the serious TEAEs resulted in discontinuation from the study and no deaths were reported.
<strong>About AVXS-101 Intrathecal Administration</strong>
Investigational IT administration of AVXS-101 is currently being evaluated in patients with SMA Type 2 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
<strong>About </strong><strong>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)</strong>
SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the <em>SMN1</em> gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons.[3],[4] The incidence of SMA is approximately 1 in 10,000 live births and it is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality.[1],[4] The most severe form of SMA is Type 1, a lethal genetic disorder characterized by rapid motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, resulting in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support by 24 months of age for more than 90% of patients if left untreated.[5] Patients with SMA Type 2 typically have 3-4 copies of SMN2, will never walk without support and often need a wheelchair.1 More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.[2]

<b>CYRAMZA, in combination with erlotinib, significantly delayed disease progression in previously untreated patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have activating EGFR mutations</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that results from the global Phase 3 RELAY trial of CYRAMZA<sup>®</sup> (ramucirumab) in previously untreated patients with metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were published in <i><a title=""Please note: If you click this link, you will leave this Lilly website."" href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2601764-1&amp;h=1394059685&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flanonc%2Farticle%2FPIIS1470-2045(19)30634-5%2Ffulltext&amp;a=The+Lancet+Oncology"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener tooltip noreferrer"">The Lancet Oncology</a></i>.
In the RELAY study, treatment with CYRAMZA in combination with erlotinib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) – the time patients lived without their cancer growing or spreading after starting treatment – compared to erlotinib alone. The CYRAMZA-erlotinib combination achieved a median PFS of 19.4 months, corresponding to a seven-month improvement over erlotinib alone. There were no new safety signals and the safety profile observed in the trial was consistent with what has been previously observed for CYRAMZA in other Phase 3 clinical trials and the established safety profile of erlotinib.
""The findings from RELAY show the utility of targeting the VEGFR and EGFR pathways together in this setting, and validate previous non-clinical and clinical studies which demonstrated interactions between EGFR and VEGFR2 signaling in the setting of EGFR mutations,"" said Kazuhiko Nakagawa, M.D., Department of Medical Oncology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, and global lead principal investigator of the RELAY trial.
Dr. Nakagawa added, ""Although EGFR TKIs have proven effective for the first-line treatment of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, most patients will experience disease progression and prognosis remains poor. These results suggest the combination of CYRAMZA plus erlotinib has the potential to be an important first-line treatment option for people with metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.""
There is no cure for people with metastatic EGFR-mutated lung cancer and disease progression following acquired resistance remains a challenge. Most patients receive several lines of treatment and the therapeutic regimen prescribed for first-line treatment can impact a person's options for later lines of therapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) – including erlotinib, which was used in the trial – are the current standard treatment option for EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
""Despite recent treatment advances in metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC, there is an ongoing unmet need for additional first-line treatment options and new treatment strategies,"" said Edward Garon, M.D., David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, and North America lead investigator of the RELAY trial. ""Therapeutic combinations are one such strategy to provide more options for patients that can potentially delay disease progression and the emergence of acquired resistance.""
On the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS, CYRAMZA plus erlotinib (N=224) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in median PFS by seven months compared to placebo plus erlotinib (N=225) [19.4 months with the CYRAMZA-containing arm compared to 12.4 months with the placebo-containing arm (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46-0.79; P=&lt;0.0001)]. Improvements with CYRAMZA plus erlotinib were also consistently observed across secondary and exploratory endpoints including duration of response, PFS2 and time on targeted therapy. Improvements were also consistently seen across all specified subgroups, including patients with tumors that had exon 19 and 21 mutations. Historically, patients receiving single-agent EGFR-TKIs with exon 21 (L858R) point mutations typically have had lower PFS benefit than those with exon 19 mutations. Overall survival (OS) was immature at the time of analysis. No detriment to OS was observed at this interim assessment, and the trial will continue until it reaches its final number of OS events.
Targetable mutations play a key role in identifying treatment options in NSCLC. The most common mechanism of acquired resistance to first-line treatment with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs is the T790M mutation, with approximately 30 to 60 percent of patients whose disease progresses acquiring the mutation. In RELAY, the rate of T790M mutations following disease progression was similar between treatment groups.
The most common Grade =3 adverse events occurring at a rate of five percent or greater in the CYRAMZA-containing arm were hypertension (N=52 [24%, Grade 3 only]), dermatitis acneiform (an acne-like rash) (N=33 [15%, Grade 3 only)], and diarrhea (N=16 [7%, Grade 3 only]).
""The RELAY data are the strongest clinical evidence to date for targeting both the EGFR and VEGFR pathways to treat this type of cancer. We're excited by these results and the promise they may hold for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with an EGFR mutation,"" said Maura Dickler, M.D., vice president of late phase development, Lilly Oncology. ""The RELAY trial is another example of Lilly's deep commitment to providing new treatment options to people with lung cancer, and the value that CYRAMZA can provide in advanced or metastatic cancers.""
Results from this study are the basis for global regulatory submissions. Lilly has made submissions in the U.S. and the EU, and a submission in Japan is planned by year-end.
RELAY is the second positive Phase 3 study of CYRAMZA in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. In the positive Phase 3 REVEL study, CYRAMZA plus docetaxel was compared to placebo plus docetaxel in people with metastatic NSCLC whose cancer had progressed on or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. The primary endpoint of OS was met, as well as key secondary endpoints of PFS and response rate. The REVEL results supported CYRAMZA's current indication in second-line metastatic NSCLC.

<b>About Lung Cancer and EGFR Mutations
</b>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and most other countries, killing nearly 1.7 million people worldwide each year.<sup>1</sup> In the U.S., lung cancer is responsible for approximately 25 percent of all cancer deaths, more than those from breast, colon and prostate cancers combined.<sup>2</sup> Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is much more common than other types of lung cancer and accounts for about 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.<sup>3</sup> Stage IV NSCLC is a very difficult-to-treat cancer and the prognosis is poor for metastatic NSCLC.<sup>4</sup>
EGFR is a protein that helps cells grow and divide. When the EGFR gene is mutated it can cause the protein to be overactive, resulting in the formation of cancer cells. EGFR mutations may occur in 10 to 35 percent of NSCLC tumors globally.<sup>5</sup> Activating EGFR mutations are found in about 10 to 20 percent of Caucasian patients with lung adenocarcinomas and in up to 40 to 60 percent of Asian patients.<sup>6,7,8</sup> Regardless of ethnicity, these mutations are commonly found in females, non-smokers and those with adenocarcinoma histology.<sup>9</sup><sup>,10</sup> The most common EGFR mutations are activating exon 19 deletion and exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations, which are present in over 90 percent of EGFR-mutated tumors.<sup>7,8</sup>
<b>About CYRAMZA<sup>®</sup> (ramucirumab)
</b>In the U.S., CYRAMZA (ramucirumab) has five FDA approvals to treat four different types of cancers. CYRAMZA is being investigated in a broad global development program that has enrolled more than 15,000 patients across more than 100 trials worldwide. These include several studies investigating CYRAMZA in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for the treatment of multiple tumor types.
CYRAMZA is an antiangiogenic therapy. It is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Receptor 2 antagonist that binds specifically to VEGFR-2, thereby blocking the binding of the receptor ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D) – which may slow tumor growth. CYRAMZA inhibited angiogenesis in an <i>in vivo</i>animal model.
<b>About Angiogenesis and VEGF Protein
</b>Angiogenesis is the process of making new blood vessels. In a person with cancer, angiogenesis creates new blood vessels that give a tumor its own blood supply, allowing it to grow and spread.
Some tumors create proteins called VEGF. These proteins attach to the VEGF receptors of blood vessel cells causing new blood vessels to form around the tumors, enabling growth. Blocking the VEGF protein from binding to the receptors located on the surface of blood vessels helps to inhibit tumor growth by slowing angiogenesis and the blood supply that feeds tumors. Of the three known VEGF receptors, VEGF Receptor 2 is linked most closely to VEGF-induced tumor angiogenesis.
<b>INDICATIONS FOR CYRAMZA
</b><b>Gastric Cancer
</b>CYRAMZA, as a single agent, or in combination with paclitaxel, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy.
<b>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
</b>CYRAMZA, in combination with docetaxel, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving CYRAMZA.
<b>Colorectal Cancer
</b>CYRAMZA, in combination with FOLFIRI (irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil), is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with disease progression on or after prior therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.
<b>Hepatocellular Carcinoma
</b>CYRAMZA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) of =400 ng/mL and have been treated with sorafenib.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR CYRAMZA<sup>®</sup> (ramucirumab)
</b><b>Warnings and Precautions
</b><b>Hemorrhage</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>CYRAMZA increased the risk of hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including Grade =3 hemorrhagic events. Across five clinical studies in 1916 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade hemorrhage occurred between 13-44%. Grade 3-5 hemorrhage incidence ranged from 2-5%.</li>
 	<li>Patients with gastric cancer receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were excluded from enrollment in REGARD and RAINBOW; therefore, the risk of gastric hemorrhage in CYRAMZA-treated patients with gastric tumors receiving NSAIDs is unknown.</li>
 	<li>Patients with NSCLC receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or chronic therapy with NSAIDs or other anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin or with radiographic evidence of major airway or blood vessel invasion or intratumor cavitation were excluded from REVEL; therefore the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage in these groups of patients is unknown.</li>
 	<li>Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience severe (Grade 3 or 4) bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<b>Gastrointestinal Perforations</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>CYRAMZA can increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, a potentially fatal event. Across five clinical studies in 1916 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade and Grade 3-5 gastrointestinal perforations ranged from &lt;1-2%.</li>
 	<li>Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a gastrointestinal perforation.</li>
</ul>
<b>Impaired Wound Healing</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF or VEGFR pathway. CYRAMZA, a VEGFR2 antagonist, has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. CYRAMZA has not been studied in patients with serious or non-healing wounds.</li>
 	<li>Withhold CYRAMZA for 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CYRAMZA for at least 28 days following a major surgical procedure and until the wound is fully healed. Discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who develop wound healing complications that require medical intervention.</li>
</ul>
<b>Arterial Thromboembolic Events</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Serious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs), including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular accident, and cerebral ischemia, occurred across clinical trials. Across five clinical studies in 1916 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade ATE was 2-3%. Grade 3-5 ATE incidence was 1-2%.</li>
 	<li>Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience an ATE.</li>
</ul>
<b>Hypertension</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>An increased incidence of severe hypertension occurred in patients receiving CYRAMZA. Across five clinical studies in 1916 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade hypertension occurred between 11-26%. Grade 3-5 hypertension incidence ranged from 6-15%.</li>
 	<li>Control hypertension prior to initiating treatment with CYRAMZA. Monitor blood pressure every two weeks or more frequently as indicated during treatment. Withhold CYRAMZA for severe hypertension until medically controlled. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for medically significant hypertension that cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy or in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.</li>
</ul>
<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Infusion-related reactions (IRR), including severe and life threatening IRR, occurred in CYRAMZA clinical trials. The majority of IRR across trials occurred during or following a first or second CYRAMZA infusion. Symptoms of IRR included rigors/tremors, back pain/spasms, chest pain and/or tightness, chills, flushing, dyspnea, wheezing, hypoxia, and paresthesia. In severe cases, symptoms included bronchospasm, supraventricular tachycardia, and hypotension. Across five clinical studies in 1916 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA in which premedication was recommended or required, the incidence of all Grade IRR occurred between &lt;1-9%. Grade 3-5 IRR incidence was &lt;1%.</li>
 	<li>Premedicate prior to each CYRAMZA infusion. Monitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRR in a setting with available resuscitation equipment. Reduce the infusion rate by 50% for Grade 1-2 IRR. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for Grade 3-4 IRR.</li>
</ul>
<b>Worsening of Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Clinical deterioration, manifested by new onset or worsening encephalopathy, ascites, or hepatorenal syndrome, was reported in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis who received single agent CYRAMZA. Use CYRAMZA in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis only if the potential benefits of treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of clinical deterioration.</li>
 	<li>Based on safety data from REACH-2, in patients with Child-Pugh A liver cirrhosis, the pooled incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome was higher for patients who received CYRAMZA (6%) compared to patients who received placebo (0%).</li>

<p align=""center""><em>Pfenex earns a $2.5M milestone payment from Alvogen for U.S. approval</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>Comparative human factors study report expected to be submitted to FDA as early as the second half of October 2019</em></p>
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pfenex Inc. (NYSE American: PFNX) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the new drug application (“NDA”) for PF708 submitted under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, with Forteo® (teriparatide injection) as the reference drug. Like Forteo, the FDA-approved PF708 product is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture.
“The FDA’s approval of PF708 marks a major milestone in Pfenex’s history as our first approved commercial product and further validates our Pfenex Expression Technology platform. We look forward to continuing to work with our commercialization partner Alvogen to launch PF708 in the U.S. We believe PF708 has the potential to significantly enhance patient access to an important therapy as a cost-effective alternative to Forteo, which had $1.6 billion in global sales in 2018,” said Eef Schimmelpennink, Chief Executive Officer of Pfenex.
Pfenex is also asking the FDA to designate PF708 as therapeutically equivalent (“A” rated) to Forteo, which would permit PF708 to be automatically substituted for Forteo in many states. To further support an “A” rating, Pfenex is conducting a comparative human factors study between PF708 and Forteo as requested by FDA. Pfenex anticipates submitting the final study report to the FDA as early as the second half of October 2019 and believes that this completes the information package required by the FDA to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of PF708.
“Looking ahead, we are confident in the planning that Alvogen has done thus far in preparation for the commercial launch of PF708 and their established sales and marketing teams are excited to bring PF708 to market. To optimize patient and payer impact, we currently expect our commercial partner Alvogen to launch PF708 upon an FDA decision on the therapeutic equivalence rating,” concluded Mr. Schimmelpennink.

<strong>ABOUT AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L<sub>Rx</sub></strong>
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L<sub>Rx</sub> is an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This antisense medicine is designed to reduce the production of angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) protein in the liver, a key regulator of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose and energy metabolism. AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L<sub>Rx</sub> was developed using Ionis’ advanced <strong>LI</strong>gand <strong>C</strong>onjugated <strong>A</strong>ntisense (LICA) technology platform. The potential therapeutic benefits of ANGPTL3 reduction are supported by the discovery that people with a genetic deficiency in ANGPTL3 have reduced levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides, and a decreased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease<sup>1</sup>. In a Phase 1/2 study, patients treated with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L<sub>Rx </sub>achieved robust, dose-dependent reductions of ANGPTL3, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol with a positive safety and tolerability profile<sup>2</sup>. AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L<sub>Rx</sub> is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in patients with Type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L<sub>Rx</sub> was discovered by Ionis and has been co-developed by Akcea and Ionis.
