<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study design of the P-Ib trial evaluating ATRC-101.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> The Phase 1b trial is an open-label basket study with multiple ongoing and planned expansion cohorts. The trial began with a dose-escalation portion following a 3+3 design and reported data from this portion of the trial in July. Enrollment in the dose escalation was limited to participants with tumor types displaying greater than 50% reactivity to ATRC-101 in preclinical studies. The primary objective was to characterize the safety, with key additional exploratory objectives of determining a maximum tolerated or recommended dose for expansion, measuring initial clinical activity, and characterizing predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in blood and tumors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlights the initial data from the dose-escalation portion of your ongoing P-Ib trial evaluating ATRC-101?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> ATRC-101 exhibited anti-tumor activity in the dose-escalation portion of the study, consistent with the proposed MOA, and was well-tolerated at all doses tested with no DLTs observed. Stable disease was observed in 8 of 20 participants evaluable for tumor assessment, with 4 of those achieving a reduction in the sum of target lesion diameters. Among those evaluable for tumor assessment AND target expression, stable disease was observed in 3 of 6 participants with an H-score (a commonly used metric of membrane staining) greater than or equal to 50, but only in 1 of 9 with an H score less than 50, indicating a relationship between target expression and activity. Preliminary biomarker data, particularly CD8+ T cell expansion in the peripheral blood, supported the proposed MOA. The half-life of ATRC-101 was dose-proportional with a 10.5-day half-life.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Shed some light on the unique mechanism, RoA of ATRC-101?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We believe ATRC-101 acts via a novel MOA that we term Driver Antigen Engagement, whereby systemically dosed ATRC-101 antibody binds to and delivers its ribonucleoprotein (RNP) tumor target to the myeloid cells of the innate immune system resident in the tumor, activating those cells, leading to a remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Those cells then further initiate an adaptive immune response against the tumor. This overall phenomenon of activation of the innate immune system leading to an adaptive immune response directed to perceived “non-self” antigens, is well-known in human biology. The Key is that ATRC-101, by engaging its target in the tumor, then generates cytotoxic CD8+ T cells downstream that destroy tumor in preclinical models. Therefore, we believe drugs that have efficacy in cancer by acting on T cells should work well with ATRC-101.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>(Not sure if the question meant to ask about RoA of ATRC-101, but if so, it is administered via intravenous infusion.)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Explain briefly about RNP tumor antigen? What it does after incorporating into the innate immune system?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> ATRC-101 binds to a novel, tumor-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex found in a majority of patient samples from multiple tumor types, including ovarian, non-small cell lung, colorectal and breast cancer, as well as acral melanoma. RNP complexes are typically intracellular, but the ATRC-101 target antigen is detectable on the surface of tumor cells. Importantly, we have demonstrated that the expression of the target of ATRC-101 can be induced via cellular stress driven by chemotherapy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Did you think ATRC 101 has the potential to change clinicians’ approaches to cancer indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We are encouraged by results from the dose-escalation phase of the trial and believe that ATRC-101 has potential in several tumor types, both as monotherapy and combination with checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy. With both a novel target and MOA, we believe that if supported by appropriately designed and successful clinical trials, ATRC-101 may have the potential to change the approach to the treatment of several solid tumor cancers with high unmet needs.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: When Atreca can expect its additional monotherapy data, pembrolizumab combination &amp; chemotherapy combination data?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We expect to report additional monotherapy data in the first half of 2022, pembrolizumab combination data in mid-2022, and chemotherapy combination data in late-2022.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Can you share the details of the preliminary biomarker evaluation which supports the mechanism of ATRC 101?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> Most notably, we observed CD8+ T cell expansion in peripheral blood associated with target expression, consistent with the proposed MOA. Given the early nature of the dataset, we also presented a case study from an ovarian cancer patient enrolled in the trial showing a marked influx of CD8+ T cells pre- and post-dosing biopsies, mirroring what was observed in animal models. The case study participant also showed spikes in the cytokines IFN-g and G-CSF, respectively, on day 2 after dosing, once again similar to what was observed in the mouse model.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What would be the targeted indications for ATRC-101? Share your strategy to advance the product in other stages of the clinical trial.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> In the monotherapy cohorts, we have limited enrollment to tumor types that expressed target in over 50% of tumor samples evaluated preclinically, including ovarian, non-small cell lung, colorectal and breast cancer, as well as acral melanoma. The pembrolizumab combination will enroll patients with HNSCC, esophageal SCC, HCC, urothelial cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Key to our clinical strategy is the development of a diagnostic to select patients based on target expression. We evaluated unselected patients for target expression in the dose-escalation portion of the trial and continue to do so in the ongoing cohorts, but the FDA requires additional data to validate a potential diagnostic assay before permitting its use for patient selection in clinical trials. Our ongoing cohorts continue to enroll patients on an unselected basis to collect additional data on efficacy, biomarkers, and to help us refine the target expression cutoff point for future trials. As the data matures, we plan to refine our strategy regarding specific indications, but at this point, it is too early to comment.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you open to collaboration to expand the potential of therapies in other indications?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We are currently developing ATRC-101 independently. Elsewhere, we are actively utilizing partnerships with the potential to build our oncology pipeline. We currently have an ongoing collaboration with Xencor to develop bispecific T cell engager antibodies, and we are working with undisclosed partners to access their technologies to develop ADCs with both toxins and immunostimulatory agents for cancer treatment.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: What is the main concern of this new medical drug management program? What are your beliefs regarding this program?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>April Kunze:</strong> <em>There are many new products coming to market to treat novel conditions and many additional products being approved, creating opportunities for preferred product strategies on the medical benefit.&nbsp; The rise in drug spending in medical creates an opportunity to more closely evaluate drug coverage and assure appropriate use and encourage low-cost therapies.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Kelly Pokuta: </em></strong><em>Prime is in a unique position to work with our Blues Plans to truly integrate data and drug coverage across benefits and manage total drug spend. Total drug management is how we’re truly going to get a handle on rising drug prices. Yet today, managing&nbsp;both&nbsp;pharmacy and medical drug spend is a challenge for most in the industry due to a lack of integration.&nbsp;Prime receives both pharmacy and medical drug claims data making this strategy possible for our clients to achieve. This new offering by Prime Therapeutics is the first program that aligns market-leading health plans to leverage market share and drive savings.&nbsp; This puts Prime in the unique position to deliver fully transparent total drug management solutions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>As drug prices are a major concern for many Americans, how the MedDrive will help Blue Plan clients?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>April Kunze: </em></strong><em>Rising drug costs are a big part of today’s health care crisis. According to data from the IQVIA Institute as noted in this&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2019/03/08/biologic-medicines-the-biggest-driver-of-rising-drug-prices/?sh=45843e9218b0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Forbes article</em></a><em>&nbsp;(2018), biologic drugs have accounted for nearly all (93%) of the net drug spending growth since 2014. The more plans come together around the </em>interchangeability of biosimilars and prefer the lower cost options instead of high-cost reference brand biologics, the<em> more they can obtain market-leading savings. These savings can help hold down premium costs for their members. &nbsp;Aligning our Blues also helps create a cohesive message for members and providers across the health plans&nbsp;and alignment provides more value in general.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>How this program is different and what motivates you to work on medical drug management strategies?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>April Kunze: </strong>Again, this new offering is the first program that aligns market-leading health plans to leverage market share and drive savings, which, puts Prime in the unique position to deliver fully transparent total drug management solutions. It’s also different in that it’ll also be bringing key parts of the health care industry together – such as providers, specialty pharmacies, and manufacturers –&nbsp;to help ensure biosimilars are accepted and used as equally safe and effective treatments so people can benefit from the most appropriate drug at the lowest net cost drug.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Prime’s vast experience in evaluating drugs clinically and evaluating appropriate use for both clinical &amp; financial reasons, we are well-positioned<em> with our Blues to provide consultative services to help them better manage their medical drug spend. In addition, aligning strategies across our Blues helps to strengthen their position in managing to low net cost products.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Prime is also evaluating additional programs and services that will roll up under MedDrive and more information will be available at a future time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba:</strong> <strong>Highlight the key features of MedDrive? Discuss the importance of this program for patients as wells as HCPs.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta: &nbsp;</strong><em>MedDrive&nbsp;combines Prime’s medical drug management solutions all in one product to help our health plan clients manage costly medicines and align to help realize these savings. Prime is harnessing the collective strength of Blue Plan alignment on preferred drug lists to drive to the lowest cost drug options, including preferring biosimilars when it helps members and plans get the right drug at the lowest possible cost. MedDrive also includes other market-leading cost-saving strategies supported by analytics and reporting, such as medical policies&nbsp;and clinical tools, consultative services to navigate the growing specialty landscape, provider and member education and support, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>April Kunze: </strong><em>MedDrive is important to patients and health care providers in that&nbsp;clinically appropriate drugs are selected for preferred coverage, ensuring that the member’s health is not compromised. Our positions are reviewed by our National P&amp;T Committee, comprised of clinicians practicing throughout the nation and across many specialties.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Prime recognizes the importance of the provider to deliver high-quality</em> care and the need for cost-efficient options to manage a patient’s out-of-pocket<em> expense.&nbsp; Providing quality solutions that improve affordability is a key focus of MedDrive.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What are the different phases of MedDrive program?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta: </strong><em>The first phase (described above) is underway, but timing varies by program and client. Some clients can implement as early as 7/1/21 or anytime thereafter. Additionally, state-specific requirements on notification of changes may impact implementation timing.&nbsp; We expect the first phase to take approximately through 2021.&nbsp; We are in the planning process for the second and subsequent phases at this time, but we will add more tools to the MedDrive toolkit as the program expands.&nbsp;Prime will continue to build the MedDrive offering s and more information will become available in the near future.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: How does biosimilars adoption leads to savings while offering patients safe and effective treatments?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Kelly Pokuta: &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Implementing MedDrive is a multi-year strategy for our clients and the biosimilars as a cost savings driver is key. We expect that medical drug management strategies, such as maximizing medical savings and preferring biosimilars, can lead to hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in medical drug savings for health plans over 5 years. &nbsp;In fact, Prime has been achieving success with biosimilars already&nbsp;as we tested these strategies with a few clients in advance of launching MedDrive.&nbsp; In the oncology class, one client shifted the use of biosimilars from single digits (0%-25%) to 80-90% and saved several hundreds of millions of dollars and overall PMPM savings. If all clients adopted this strategy savings would be considerable.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Let us know about the key points of the report given by IQVIA on biosimilars?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Kelly Pokuta: &nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We can’t speak for them, however, here is a link to IQVIA’s 2020 report so you can review:&nbsp;</em><a href=""https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/biosimilars-in-the-united-states-2020-2024"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/biosimilars-in-the-united-states-2020-2024</em></a><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What we found most interesting was the statement “Though savings from biosimilars had been slow to build, recently-launched biosimilars have achieved significant uptake within their first year, and the availability and use of biosimilar medicines are on track to reduce drug costs by $100 billion over the next five years.” Additionally, this key point was of interest: “The three most recent biosimilar launches are set to reach nearly 60% shares of volume by the end of their second year on the market — significantly higher and faster than prior biosimilars.”&nbsp;&nbsp;This reflects the growing trend of utilizing biosimilars across many different disease states. More and more groups are releasing statements supporting biosimilar use which is also helpful in supporting this trend.</em></p>

The result is that those brand name biologics also keep their prices down.” “It is clear, especially with the results of this report, that biosimilar competition lowers drug prices,” said Meaghan Rose Smith, Executive Director of the Biosimilars Forum, in a press release. “As the next generation of generics, biosimilars have the potential to significantly save patients and taxpayers money, and increase access to life-saving treatment options.”&nbsp;</em></p>

<h4><strong>Response by Mark Warren, MD, Director of Endocrine Clinical Trials and Laboratory Services, Physicians East</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Describe the characteristics of Lyumjev.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark: </strong><em>Lyumjev is a novel formulation of insulin lispro that helps manage blood glucose and, as rapid-acting insulin, works to control high blood glucose levels after meals in adults with diabetes similar to how natural insulin works after meals in people without diabetes. Controlling blood sugar after meals is difficult and frustrating for people with diabetes. Lyumjev shows clinically significant improvements in post-meal blood sugar control.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the clinical study supporting the approval of Lyumjev for use in insulin pumps.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark: </strong><em>The updated label is based on the FDA’s review of data from PRONTO-PUMP-2, a phase 3, randomized, prospective, double-blind, active-controlled treat-to-target study in which Lyumjev demonstrated non-inferior A1C reduction from baseline to week 16 compared to Humalog (insulin lispro injection) 100 units/mL when used in insulin pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: As Lyumjev is a novel formulation of insulin lispro, how does it differ from Humalog?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark: </strong><em>In Phase 1 studies, Lyumjev had a faster onset of action than Humalog. In the Phase 3 trials, PRONTO-T1D, PRONTO-T2D, and PRONTO-PUMP-2, Lyumjev provided noninferior A1C reductions compared to Humalog in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Lyumjev demonstrated a superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both one hour and two hours after a test meal compared to Humalog. Lyumjev also provided superior postprandial glucose-lowering at one and two hours after a test meal, which was significant compared to Humalog. Better control of post-meal blood sugars is an important part of diabetes management. Now we have insulin that is rapid enough to do so.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you want to give any suggestions to our viewers/diabetic patients regarding the precaution and management of diabetes?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark: </strong><em>The management of diabetes, particularly maintaining blood glucose levels in the target range, is a constant balancing act and daily challenge for people with diabetes. People with diabetes who experience high blood glucose levels after meals or struggle to keep their blood glucose in the target range after meals may benefit from incorporating rapid-acting insulin-like Lyumjev into their treatment plans. My patients using Lyumjev&nbsp;are seeing better post-meal blood sugar control.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Highlight the benefits of insulin pumps for diabetic patients.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark: </strong><em>Insulin pumps are an important delivery option for people with diabetes, many of whom struggle with high postmeal blood glucose levels. The approval of Lyumjev for use with pumps is exciting news for people with diabetes who use insulin pumps and are considering transitioning to an insulin-like Lyumjev. With Lyumjev we now have insulin that can better address the hyperglycemia after eating.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Describe the key features of IPM.ai and how ML and AI simplify patient recruitment for clinical trials?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>IPM.ai utilizes machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover patients with rare and specialty diseases who are often undiagnosed, or misdiagnosed, which results in an arduous diagnostic and treatment journey that can be a tremendous burden on them and their caregivers. Our fundamental data assets are designed to maximize patient, healthcare provider (HCP), and clinical trial site visibility. To streamline clinical study recruitment, IPM.ai harnesses a de-identified real-world data (RWD) universe of 300 million patients spanning a decade, as well as affiliation data, and then applies carefully engineered look-alike models based on an ideal patient definition to extract those with the highest propensity to be afflicted with the condition and be medically eligible for an appropriate clinical trial.</em></p>

<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ipm-large-3-1024x259.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-64625""/><figcaption><strong>Source: IPM.ai</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>These anonymized patients are then associated with their treating physicians, who are then engaged by pharma companies or their contract research organization (CRO) to help intercept the disease, discuss treatment options with the patient and encourage clinical study participation.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What made you decide to develop this product for life sciences companies?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>Rare disease rates have increased, and approximately 10% of the U.S. population is living with some form of rare disease. The interest in developing and commercializing therapeutics for rare and specialty indications has mirrored this trajectory, and these therapies have become much more precision-based. Unfortunately, 90% of clinical trials for rare diseases fail – simply because they can’t meet recruitment goals.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>On average, 81% of patients screened for enrollment are deemed ineligible. Additionally, clinical trials for rare and specialty conditions are more time-consuming; a typical cycle for Phase 2-3 trials of drugs for rare diseases is 68% longer than similar trials for conventional drugs. On top of this, clinical trials for rare diseases are much more expensive – conducting a Phase 3 study for a rare or specialty therapy costs $103 million and an average of $2 million per day when a trial is delayed or halted due to a lack of patients.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Taking these myriad factors into consideration, we observed a critical need to connect patients with rare and specialty diseases with trials in a seamless and patient-focused manner earlier in the lifecycle. Put simply, the typical playbook for conventional diseases does not work for rare and uncommon conditions, which are typically genetic and more often affect pediatric and young adult patients. Also, patients with rare diseases have a low awareness of clinical studies, are not located near trial sites, and are very often unaware of their current disease state.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":64626,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-large""><img src=""https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Website-Size-4.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-64626""/><figcaption><strong>Source: IPM.ai</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To capture these patients earlier, we applied our success and process in patient finding&nbsp;for commercial therapies&nbsp;into clinical trials to reduce the burden of searching for low-incidence patient populations. By intervening earlier in the lifecycle, we allow sponsors to take a truly patient-centric approach to trials. IPM.ai optimizes site and primary investigator (PI) selection as well as referral strategy by identifying the care team surrounding patients of interest and focusing on centers of excellence and potential site locations in proximity, essentially building trials around hard-to-reach patients populations. Through activation nodes, such as field-level alerts, email and advertising campaigns, we lead medical science liaisons (MSLs) to treat physicians who have patients with rare diseases under their care. These patients can then be enrolled in trials, improving their health outcomes while at the same time helping life sciences companies advance drugs through the clinical development and regulatory process and bring them to market.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: List out the rare diseases in which the companies are utilizing this technique for the recruitment of patients.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>IPM.ai’s ML/AI technology presents unlimited opportunities to source patients afflicted with&nbsp;any&nbsp;rare or specialty condition, including those without an ICD-10 code. Recently, IPM.ai was successful in finding patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis&nbsp;(hATTR),&nbsp;X-linked myotubular myopathy&nbsp;(XLMTM), refractory mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia&nbsp;(wAIHA), X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), and&nbsp;warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Is there any other technique that exists in the market? If yes, how IPM.ai is better than other available techniques in the market.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>The market standard for clinical trial recruitment is based on estimates and projection instead of precision. More sophisticated companies often source patients by consulting fixed patient registries and portals or enlisting the support of patient advocacy groups. More recently, they have begun to use genetic databases to obtain confirmed diagnostic information. The number of patients gleaned from these imperfect techniques is then multiplied to account for the total US population. However, this approach generates just an idea of an average count instead of an exact figure, creating more gaps in knowledge around a disease state than understanding.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Another typical approach that companies use is to devote resources to market research with the goal of attracting patients to a trial through programmatic advertising or social media tactics. However, this approach is ineffective because it is too generalized to activate such targeted patients, who are unlikely to be aware of their own disease state. Furthermore, the companies that pursue this approach&nbsp;are not well versed in the area of rare or specialty diseases, which is a niche area.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>IPM.ai, on the other hand, is backed by a team of highly experienced life sciences experts, healthcare professionals, and data scientists. We have the skills and expertise needed to return results – rather than nonvaluable ""black box"" insights or general top-down consulting.&nbsp;Moreover, to counter this antiquated approach, we have developed the industry’s first HIPAA-certified system of actionable insights that aligns our patient-finding solution earlier in the product lifecycle. We utilize deep learning to connect the dots between symptomology and health history to bring a current diagnosis to the fore, and we rely on natural language processing to fill in the gaps left by incomplete health coding. We engineer our models to provide results that lead to insights on business decisions and objectives, such as the total number of patients needed to achieve script lift and return on investment (ROI).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By defining an ideal rare disease patient population using RWD and deploying AI to uncover look-alike medically eligible patients, we are able to map the patient treatment journey, giving HCPs and the industry a better understanding of a disease. We then engage HCPs on a one-to-one level to aid in clinical trial recruitment while finalizing the protocol and selecting optimal sites and principal investigators. Our proprietary technology uncovers the patient’s entire healthcare ecosystem, including the role of referral networks, and reveals how HCPs behave based on prescribing data rather than on how they self-report. Relevant health events are refreshed weekly and shared with MSLs via customer relationship management (CRM), which allows the most updated engagement.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Do you have any plans for more advancement of this technique?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>We plan to advance our offering by heightening our understanding of the patient and are exploring the behavioral aspects that motivate patients to enroll in clinical trials. While our technology has elucidated the patient and diagnostic journey, we’re interested in the full picture of who a patient is, including their risk aversion, their likelihood of entering a clinical trial, and their drivers. We want to be able to better recognize this behavior to realize patients more comprehensively.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Why should biotech and pharma companies prefer&nbsp;</strong><a href=""http://ipm.ai/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>IPM.ai</strong></a><strong>. How can the companies connect with you?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>IPM.ai is not a data company trying to squeeze intelligence into our offering. Rather, we create a smart data pool that gives us the outputs we need. Instead of getting bogged down by unnecessary data, we focus on finding clear solutions to defined problems.&nbsp;Our proprietary data curation, analytical model building,</em> and signals detection methods are grounded in the nuances of the rare disease, specialty,<em> and precision medicine markets, making us experts in this field.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By uncovering and engaging patients most likely to be a fit for specific trials and least likely to withdraw, we advance and improve recruitment efforts and optimize site and investigator selection, thus allowing a trial to occur that would have failed otherwise.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>

<p><strong>Tuba: Share the list of your existing partners who are using IPM.ai technology.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>Our clients include, but are not limited to, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Kyowa Kirin, Audentes Therapeutics, Biogen, Insmed, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, and X4 Pharmaceuticals.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: What do you think using ML in health data will bring change in the clinical trial space?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>Revolutionizing clinical trials comes down to more than ML/AI – it’s the data scientists tasked with performing the engineering that has</em> the potential to improve the field. We believe trials are more effective when we assess the market ahead of time, understand patient profiles,<em> and design trials around the patient.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuba: Are you planning to use the data you collect to build some kind of predictive algorithm to do disease prediction or any other features?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ron:</strong> <em>We’re built on precision.&nbsp;By extracting invaluable signals from an extensive data landscape that includes a patient health history and consumer behavior, we achieve accurate diagnostic predictions. This represents an unprecedented opportunity to intercept patient journeys, estimate disease prevalence and improve patient outcomes. With an eye toward exploring the behavioral aspects of how patients engage with clinical trials, we’re excited to lead the industry with an even more refined approach to health data.</em></p>
