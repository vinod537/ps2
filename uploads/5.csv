<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","– Transaction further sharpens Takeda’s focus on five key business areas
– Consumer Health Care Business to continue serving consumers in Japan and Asia under new owner

Osaka, Japan, August 24, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest Takeda Consumer Healthcare Company Limited (“TCHC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda focused on the consumer health care market primarily in Japan, to Oscar A-Co KK, a company controlled by funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Blackstone”) for a total value of JPY 242.0 billion*. Blackstone is one of the world leading investment firms and has extensive investment experience in the health care sector. The transaction is expected to close by March 31, 2021, subject to customary legal and regulatory closing conditions.

The portfolio to be divested to Blackstone includes a variety of over-the-counter (“OTC”) medicines and health products that generated total revenues of over JPY 60 billion in fiscal year 2019. TCHC’s strong regional brands include Alinamin, its top selling product and Japan’s first vitamin B1 preparation, and Benza, a cold remedy. Blackstone intends to develop the business together with current TCHC management and continue to employ its employees.

Christophe Weber, Takeda President and Chief Executive Officer said, “Today’s transaction will provide TCHC with the ownership, resources and strategic focus to continue to thrive and meet the needs of customers, while further sharpening Takeda’s strategic focus and commitment to financial discipline and transforming science into life-changing medicines. TCHC played an important role in Takeda’s long history, but with our growth strategy now focused on five key business areas – Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience – and an increasingly competitive consumer health care market in Japan, the ownership transition will benefit both TCHC and Takeda. We are confident that under Blackstone, TCHC will be well-positioned to continue growing and developing its product offerings in the years to come to address the evolving needs of consumers.”

Takeda, which started TCHC as a separate business in April 2017 to further develop the consumer health care business in Japan, is now focused on highly innovative medicines across its five key business areas and working to address significant unmet patient needs in these fields. Under Blackstone’s ownership, TCHC will benefit from increased strategic focus, resources and agility to support the growth and development of its important brands and to rapidly respond to evolving market conditions and diverse customer needs.

The sale of TCHC supports Takeda’s divestiture program which is focused on optimization of its portfolio to align with its global long-term growth strategy and provide uninterrupted access and supply of critical products to patients. So far in 2020, Takeda has also agreed to divest three different non-core asset portfolios in the Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America regions. In June, Takeda agreed to divest a portfolio of non-core assets sold exclusively in the Asia Pacific region to Celltrion for up to $278 million USD; in April, Takeda announced the sale of non-core products in Europe to Orifarm Group for up to approximately $670 million USD, including the sale of two manufacturing sites in Denmark and Poland; and in March, Takeda announced the sale of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera Pharma for $825 million USD, as well as completed the previously announced sales of non-core assets spanning the Russia-CIS region to STADA and in countries spanning the Near East, Middle East and Africa region to Acino.

Transaction Details of Sale of Shareholding in TCHC to Blackstone

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) today decided to transfer all shares of Takeda Consumer Healthcare Company Limited (“TCHC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda, to Oscar A-Co KK (“SPC”), a company controlled by funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Blackstone”), and entered into a share purchase agreement with SPC, as specified below. Following the transfer of shares, TCHC will be excluded from the scope of consolidation of Takeda.

 

Rationale for the share transfer
TCHC has contributed to the health of people through their products. In particular, TCHC’s product Alinamin has established a strong brand based on the trust of customers and has played an important role in Takeda’s history. In order to further develop the consumer health care business mainly in Japan, Takeda had spun off the business into TCHC, who started their business in April 2017. However, the competition in the consumer health care market has increased in recent years, and the needs of customers continues to become more diverse. Under such circumstances, TCHC is required to further strengthen the strategy and increase the responsiveness to the market by building a much more agile business model.

Takeda is currently focusing on five key business areas and also strengthening its commitment to transforming science into life-changing medicines now more than ever. In these situations, carefully considering all options of TCHC’s growth strategies to maximize their capability and expertise, which will lead to further development of their product brands, Takeda has executed a share transfer agreement with SPC. Takeda believes that the swift and flexible decision-making as an independent corporate group under the active and strategic investment capabilities of Blackstone enables TCHC to promptly respond to the market needs, to grow their product brands and to continuously develop themselves. Blackstone intends to develop the business together with current TCHC management and continue to employ its employees.

Future outlook
Takeda anticipates a pre-tax gain of approximately 140.0 billion JPY on the sale of shares of the subsidiary, to be recognized when the transfer of shares is executed and completed. Takeda anticipates Reported Net Profit attributable to owners of the Company to increase by approximately 105.0 billion JPY. Since a gain on the sale of shares of a subsidiary is unusual, non-recurring and unrelated to ongoing operations, there will be no impact on Core Operating Profit or Core Net Profit. With respect to cash flow, Takeda anticipates an approximately 200.0 billion JPY cash (after tax). Takeda will continue to assess the impact and the timing, taking into account progress of its operations and changes in the business environment, if any, and update the FY2020 forecast at the appropriate timing.

Other
The sale of TCHC supports Takeda’s divestiture program which is focused on optimization of its portfolio to align with its global long-term growth strategy and provide uninterrupted access and supply of critical products to patients

– 90 healthy volunteers in two age cohorts (18-55 and 65-85 years) to be enrolled in two clinical sites in Italy

– The Phase 1 trial is being conducted by the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases under the sponsorship of ReiThera

– The Phase 1 trial and the manufacture of clinical material needed for the study is funded by the Italian Ministry of Scientific Research and the Lazio Region (Rome)

– International Phase 2/3 trial in countries with high rates of coronavirus infection planned to start late 2020, pending initial Phase 1 outcome

 

ROME, Aug. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — ReiThera Srl, a biotech company dedicated to the technology development, GMP manufacturing and clinical translation of genetic vaccines and medicinal products for advanced therapies, today announces that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase 1 study of the Company’s vaccine candidate (GRAd-COV2) against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The Phase 1 study is being conducted in Italy at the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) in Rome and at the GB Rossi University Hospital in Verona.

ReiThera’s vaccine candidate GRAd-COV2 encodes the full-length spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The vaccine technology is based on a novel, proprietary replication-defective gorilla adenoviral (GRAd) vector, which both induced a strong humoral and cellular immune response in preclinical studies and demonstrated a good safety profile. GRAd-COV2 is expected to induce strong immune responses based on low pre-existing immunity to the vector in humans.

Vaccines based on similar simian adenoviral vectors, such as Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors (ChAd), have been evaluated in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in other infectious diseases and proved to be safe and immunogenic with a single-dose vaccine.

The Phase 1 clinical trial is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of GRAd-COV2 in 90 healthy volunteers divided equally into two age cohorts: 18-55 years and 65-85 years. Each cohort will be divided into three study arms of 15 volunteers which will be administered one of three escalating doses of GRAd-COV2. Participants will be monitored over a 24-week period.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GRAd-COV2, and to select a vaccine dose for further investigation in a Phase 2/3 trial. The secondary objective is to evaluate the vaccine’s ability to induce immune responses (antibodies and T cells) against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in volunteers. Interim safety and immunogenicity analysis are expected by mid Q4 2020 which will guide dose selection for Phase 2/3 studies.

A larger international Phase 2/3 trial in countries where SARS-CoV-2 is still very active is planned to commence by the end of 2020, pending positive interim safety and immunogenicity results of the Phase 1 trial.

The Phase 1 trial of GRAd-COV2 is being funded by the Italian Ministry of Scientific Research and the Lazio Region. The study is being run jointly by ReiThera and Lazzaro Spallanzani INMI using initial vaccine material manufactured at ReiThera’s cGMP facility in Rome.

In parallel, ReiThera is working with LEUKOCARE in Germany to develop a thermostable GRAd-COV2 vaccine formulation and with Univercells in Belgium to develop a bespoke manufacturing process to enable rapid, large-scale production of the vaccine.

“This study is the first important step in the clinical development of our novel GRAd-COV2 vaccine against COVID-19,” said ReiThera’s Chief Technology Officer, Stefano Colloca. “We are proud to undertake this trial in Italy where the impact of COVID-19 has been felt particularly hard. The cutting-edge science behind our approach is backed by many years of pioneering research on adenoviral vector technologies with pre-clinical and clinical data generated with a single-dose vaccine in other serious infectious diseases demonstrating potent humoral and cellular immune responses. This feature makes our technology platform suitable for an outbreak situation such as COVID-19 and has clear advantages in terms of manufacturing and compliance.”

“The launch of this Phase 1 trial demonstrates ReiThera’s expertise and what can be done when stakeholders come together towards a common goal,” said ReiThera’s Chief Executive Officer, Antonella Folgori. “We are grateful to Lazzaro Spallanzani INMI for their ongoing collaboration and to the Italian Ministry of Scientific Research and the Lazio Region for funding the trial and initial manufacturing of the GRAd-COV2 vaccine candidate. We look forward to providing important updates about the safety and immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate over the coming months, and potentially advancing into international Phase 2/3 trial later in the year.”

About GRAd-COV2

GRAd-COV2, the candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 recently developed by ReiThera, is based on a novel and proprietary replication-defective simian (gorilla) adenoviral vector (called GRAd) encoding the full-length coronavirus spike protein (GRAd-COV2). The spike protein enables the coronavirus to enter human cells.

Simian adenoviral (SAd) vectors have been extensively used as delivery agents for genetic vaccine candidates against multiple infectious diseases, including Ebola and RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), in different populations, with more than 5,000 individuals including elderly and infants enrolled in early and late stage clinical trials to date. Preclinical and clinical evidence have demonstrated that ReiThera’s vaccine technology is safe and induces robust cellular and humoral immune responses.

ReiThera’s novel GRAd vector belongs to species C adenovirus that are considered the most potent vaccine carriers and has low seroprevalence in humans. This means that GRAd vaccine immunogenicity is not hampered by pre-existing anti-human adenovirus antibodies.

About ReiThera Srl

ReiThera Srl is a biotech company dedicated to the technology development, GMP manufacturing and clinical translation of genetic vaccines and medicinal products for advanced therapies. The company’s management and scientific teams have developed a highly innovative technological platform based on simian adeno-vectored vaccines against several infectious diseases, such as RSV and Ebola.

ReiThera is led by an experienced management team that has worked together for many years in previous successful enterprises, including Okairos (acquired by GSK), and has a long-standing expertise in scalable processes for viral vector manufacturing, supported by a cGMP facility inclusive of filling suite and quality control laboratories. ReiThera is also part of a pan-European consortium focused on the development and large-scale manufacture of an adeno-viral vector vaccine against COVID-19.

ReiThera has its headquarters, R&D laboratories and GMP facilities in Rome, Italy.

NEW YORK &amp; MONTREAL--(BUSINESS WIRE)--<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com%2F&amp;esheet=52271311&amp;newsitemid=20200824005159&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bristol+Myers+Squibb&amp;index=1&amp;md5=021072f151c8dfea5fd314ac23f111f5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Bristol Myers Squibb</a> (NYSE: BMY) and Forbius, a privately held, clinical-stage protein engineering company that designs and develops biotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer and fibrotic diseases, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Bristol Myers Squibb will acquire Forbius. Forbius has developed a portfolio of highly selective and potent inhibitors of TGF-beta 1 &amp; 3, which are key mediators of immunosuppression and fibrosis. The transaction includes an upfront payment and future success-based milestone payments. Prior to closing, Forbius’ non-TGF-beta assets will be transferred to a newly formed private company, which will be retained by Forbius’ existing shareholders.

The companies anticipate completing the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Under this transaction, Bristol Myers Squibb would acquire Forbius’s TGF-beta program, including the program’s lead investigational asset, AVID200. TGF-beta is a key cytokine that regulates various cell processes, including regulation of the immune system. Selective inhibition of TGF-beta 1 &amp; 3 may enhance anti-tumor efficacy by acting synergistically with immunotherapy. Bristol Myers Squibb intends to initially focus research and development efforts of AVID200 in oncology and may consider advancing the asset in other disease areas, such as fibrosis.

“With this acquisition, we extend our leading position in oncology by including new pathways that complement our expansive oncology pipeline with the potential to serve more patients with cancer, including those who may not respond to immunotherapy,” said <a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bms.com%2Fabout-us%2Fleadership%2Fleadership-team.html&amp;esheet=52271311&amp;newsitemid=20200824005159&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Rupert+Vessey%2C+M.A.%2C+B.M.%2C+B.Ch.%2C+F.R.C.P.%2C+D.Phil.&amp;index=2&amp;md5=e2ab2f6dae67601e91f03122be269296"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Rupert Vessey, M.A., B.M., B.Ch., F.R.C.P., D.Phil.</a>, Executive Vice President &amp; President, Research &amp; Early Development, Bristol Myers Squibb. “As a science driven company, this transaction shows our continued commitment to source innovation internally and externally to develop new treatments for patients with significant unmet medical needs.”

“Our portfolio of highly selective TGF-beta inhibitors has shown potential across a broad range of therapeutic areas,” said Ilia A. Tikhomirov, President and CEO of Forbius. “We are proud that Bristol Myers Squibb recognizes this potential given their global leadership in oncology and unique position to translate innovative science into meaningful treatments for patients with cancer across the globe.”

<b>About selective inhibition of TGF-beta</b>

TGF-beta isoforms 1 &amp; 3 are believed to be central mediators of tumor microenvironment (TME). Selective inhibition of TGF-beta 1 &amp; 3 is proposed to enhance anti-tumor efficacy by acting synergistically with immunotherapy and has broad potential as an anti-fibrotic therapy across several indications with high unmet need.

<b>About AVID200</b>

AVID200 is a highly potent and isoform-selective TGF-beta inhibitor. AVID200 neutralizes TGF-beta 1 and -beta 3 with picomolar potency. These isoforms are known to be drivers of fibrosis and tumor immune resistance. In contrast, TGF-beta 2 is a positive regulator of hematopoiesis and normal cardiac function, and blockade of TGF-beta 2 is therefore undesirable. The ability of AVID200 to selectively target TGF-beta 1 and -beta 3 positions it to be an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic in fibrotic diseases and immuno-oncology.

<b>Berlin, August 24, 2020</b> – Bayer and Informed Data Systems Inc. (One Drop), a US-based digital health company, today announced that they have entered into an agreement to jointly develop digital health products for multiple therapeutic areas. The aim of the collaboration is to provide integrated services empowering patients to manage certain conditions. In addition, Bayer increases its equity stake and is lead investor in the company’s Series C financing.

“Building new digital business models is a key element of our business strategy with the ambition to actively shape the future of healthcare,” said Jeanne Kehren, PhD, Head of Digital &amp; Commercial Innovation and Member of the Pharmaceuticals Executive Committee of Bayer AG. “We are convinced that a data-driven approach will empower patients to drive better outcomes for themselves and will bring back the person, not the disease, as the point of focus. The new collaboration with One Drop allows Bayer to further accelerate its evolution towards a digital health business and paves the way for new integrated care patient service offerings.”

In 2019, Bayer invested USD 20 million in a Series B financing in One Drop and entered into a licensing agreement for Bayer to independently develop and commercialize digital health products based on the One Drop technology platform. Moving forward, the partners will shift their collaboration to jointly evolve One Drop’s existing platform to allow for a faster and modular development of solutions to manage conditions, for example, in the area of oncology, cardiovascular diseases and women’s health.

“To deliver better health outcomes and cost savings at a population level, we must focus on individuals,” said Jeff Dachis, CEO and founder of Informed Data Systems (One Drop). “One Drop delivers a personalized health transformation program that dynamically tunes to your needs and behaviors each day, empowering each individual to achieve the best possible health outcomes.”

Integrated care solutions will enable patients to manage independently multiple chronic and complex conditions and support health interventions. They provide the potential to optimize individual care plans, to help implement remote care including monitoring, personalized interventions and healthcare professional follow-ups and thereby help sustain patient self-care.

Under the terms of the agreement, both partners will jointly enhance the existing platform utilizing One Drop’s know-how and capabilities of the One Drop platform and jointly develop digital health products in certain therapeutic areas. Bayer will contribute its medical and data science capabilities and deep disease understanding for various conditions. One Drop will receive development fees and success based commercial milestone payments. In return, Bayer will receive royalties on sales generated by One Drop. In the future, Bayer may also support the commercialization of the jointly developed digital products.

The Pharmaceuticals Business Development &amp; Licensing team of Bayer facilitated this collaboration with the support of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions.

“While the COMBI-i trial did not reach its primary endpoint, the study’s findings give us valuable insights into the role the investigational immunotherapy spartalizumab may play in future cancer therapy combinations and underscore the previously established importance of Tafinlar + Mekinist for these patients,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “Novartis remains committed to melanoma patients through ongoing research, and we continue to deliver the approved combination therapy Tafinlar + Mekinist to patients around the world. We extend our gratitude to the patients and investigators who participated in the COMBI-i study. Their partnership has expanded our understanding of spartalizumab and its potential role in future cancer treatments.”

Novartis and the COMBI-i study investigators will continue to review the data to learn more from the results, which are expected to be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting. Novartis remains committed to exploring new uses for immunotherapy in cancer treatment, including the ongoing development of spartalizumab, across a range of tumor types.

<strong>About the COMBI-i Study</strong><sup>3</sup>
COMBI-i was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study comparing the combination of anti-PD1 spartalizumab with Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib) versus the combination of placebo with Tafinlar and Mekinist. The study was conducted among previously untreated patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. The COMBI-i study was conducted in three parts. Results reported today are from part 3 of the trial.

<strong>About Spartalizumab (PDR001)</strong>
Spartalizumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody directed against the human programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor<em>.</em> Its development program continues investigating the immunotherapy across a range of tumor types.

<strong>About Tafinlar + Mekinist Combination
</strong>Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to treat people with a type of skin cancer called melanoma:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>That has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and</li>
 	<li>That has a certain type of abnormal “<em>BRAF</em>” (V600E or V600K mutation-positive) gene</li>
</ul>
Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medicines that can be used in combination to help prevent melanoma that has a certain type of abnormal “<em>BRAF</em>” gene from coming back after the cancer has been removed by surgery.

Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic NSCLC), and that has a certain type of abnormal “<em>BRAF</em> V600E” gene.

Tafinlar and Mekinist are prescription medications that can be used in combination to treat a type of thyroid cancer called anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC):
<ul type=""circle"">
 	<li>That has spread to other parts of the body and you have no satisfactory treatment options, and</li>
 	<li>That has a certain type of abnormal “<em>BRAF</em>” gene</li>
</ul>
Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, should not be used to treat people with wild-type <em>BRAF</em> melanoma. Mekinist should not be used to treat people who already have received a <em>BRAF</em> inhibitor for treatment of their melanoma and it did not work or is no longer working.

Your health care provider will perform a test to make sure that Tafinlar and Mekinist , in combination, are right for you.

It is not known if Tafinlar and Mekinist are safe and effective in children.

Tafinlar and Mekinist, in combination, may cause serious side effects such as the risk of new cancers, including both skin cancer and nonskin cancer. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider immediately for any skin changes, including a new wart, skin sore, or bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in the size or color of a mole.

When Tafinlar is used in combination with Mekinist, it can cause serious bleeding problems, especially in the brain or stomach, that can lead to death. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider and get medical help right away if they have any signs of bleeding, including headaches, dizziness, or feel weak, cough up blood or blood clots, vomit blood or their vomit looks like “coffee grounds,” or red or black stools that look like tar.

Mekinist, alone or in combination with Tafinlar, can cause inflammation of the intestines or tears in the stomach or intestines that can lead to death. Patients should report to their health care provider immediately if they have any of the following symptoms: bleeding, diarrhea (loose stools) or more bowel movements than usual, stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness, fever, or nausea.

Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause blood clots in the arms or legs, which can travel to the lungs and can lead to death. Patients should be advised to get medical help right away if they have the following symptoms: chest pain, sudden shortness of breath or trouble breathing, pain in their legs with or without swelling, swelling in their arms or legs, or a cool or pale arm or leg.

The combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist can cause heart problems, including heart failure. A patient’s heart function should be checked before and during treatment. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they have any of the following signs and symptoms of a heart problem: feeling like their heart is pounding or racing, shortness of breath, swelling of their ankles and feet, or feeling lightheaded.

Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause severe eye problems that can lead to blindness. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they get: blurred vision, loss of vision, or other vision changes, seeing color dots, halo (seeing blurred outline around objects), eye pain, swelling, or redness.

Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause lung or breathing problems. Patients should be advised to tell their health care provider if they have new or worsening symptoms of lung or breathing problems, including shortness of breath or cough.

Fever is common during treatment with Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist, but may also be serious. In some cases, chills or shaking chills, too much fluid loss (dehydration), low blood pressure, dizziness, or kidney problems may happen with the fever. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider right away if they get a fever.

Rash and other skin reactions are common side effects of Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist. In some cases, these rashes and other skin reactions can be severe or serious, may need to be treated in a hospital, or lead to death. Patients should be advised to call their health care provider if they get any of the following symptoms: blisters or peeling of skin, mouth sores, blisters on the lips or around the mouth or eyes, high fever or flu-like symptoms, and/or enlarged lymph nodes.

Some people may develop high blood sugar or worsening diabetes during treatment with Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist. For patients who are diabetic, their health care provider should check their blood sugar levels closely during treatment. Their diabetes medicine may need to be changed. Patients should be advised to tell their health care provider if they have increased thirst, urinate more often than normal, or produce an increased amount of urine.

Tafinlar may cause healthy red blood cells to break down too early in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This may lead to a type of anemia called hemolytic anemia, where the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Patients should be advised to tell their health care provider if they have yellow skin (jaundice), weakness or dizziness, or shortness of breath.

Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, can cause new or worsening high blood pressure (hypertension). A patient’s blood pressure should be checked during treatment.

SAN DIEGO, Aug. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bionano Genomics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BNGO) today announced that it has acquired Lineagen Inc., a Salt Lake City, Utah based genetic diagnostic company, further supporting our market leadership in digital cytogenetics and comprehensive genetic diagnostics for pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders. Bionano aims to revolutionize clinical genome testing and genomics research by making comprehensive structural variation analysis a routine process that is accurate, streamlined, efficient and cost effective. Bionano’s Saphyr genome imaging platform has been shown to outperform the current gold standard methods for clinical cytogenetic testing, karyotyping, chromosomal microarray (CMA) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). Lineagen specializes in pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay, and has developed proprietary technology and commercialized multiple LDTs. With the acquisition of Lineagen, Bionano adds CLIA-certified diagnostic testing services along with expertise in commercializing cytogenetic assays, genetic counseling, third party payor contracts and reimbursement.

“Lineagen has been a pioneer in clinical testing for structural variations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay and other constitutional genetic diseases. These are indications where the information provided by Lineagen's menu of assays can significantly improve management and they are core areas of strategic and clinical interest to Bionano. This acquisition adds that business and accelerates our efforts to bring Saphyr to clinical testing within a CLIA environment by adding essential skills and relationships with physicians and payors in place at Lineagen,” said Erik Holmlin, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Bionano Genomics. “We believe the incredible talent and clinical experience at Lineagen, working together with Alka Chaubey, recently appointed as our first Chief Medical Officer, will help drive the development and launch of a menu of genomic assays based on Saphyr’s simple, straightforward workflow. By doing so, we provide a roadmap for others to follow, setting Saphyr on track to consolidate and enhance existing cytogenetic workflows around the world. I want to thank Michael Paul, the founder and CEO of Lineagen, and his board, investors and employees for believing in the power of this combination. Our work is just beginning.”

Michael Paul, PhD, Chief Strategy Officer of Bionano and former CEO of Lineagen added, “Bionano Genomics is a natural fit for Lineagen. Beginning with the commercial introduction of our FirstStepDx Plus assay over nine years ago, which is based on structural variation detection, Lineagen demonstrated that we could innovate in the established field of cytogenetics by combining proprietary content, interpretation software, and genomics databases with state-of-the-art genome analysis technology. Bionano’s Saphyr system for comprehensive structural variation analysis allows the combined companies to expand and accelerate this innovation process and develop, validate and introduce novel tests that outperform those based on traditional sequencing or cytogenetic technologies. Together with Erik and the Bionano team, we are eager and committed to continue our mission of serving individuals with ASD and other disorders of childhood development, their families, and providers with advanced genetic diagnostic solutions. It is time to get to work.”

Bionano paid approximately $9.6 million in consideration for Lineagen, consisting of 6,167,510 shares of Bionano’s common stock, approximately $1.7 million in cash and assumption of approximately $2.9 million in liabilities. Concurrent with the closing of the merger, Bionano also paid approximately $1.1 million to satisfy outstanding principal and accrued interest amounts due pursuant to a Paycheck Protection Program loan issued to Lineagen under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Lineagen was advised by EVOLUTION Life Science Partners in connection with the merger.

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>KEYTRUDA Now Approved for Patients With PD-L1-Positive Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Who Have Progressed After Chemotherapy and for a Six-Week Dosing Schedule Across All Adult Indications</b></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Six-Week Dosing Schedule for KEYTRUDA Now Approved in Japan, US and Europe</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, has received two new approvals from the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). KEYTRUDA monotherapy is now approved for the treatment of patients whose tumors are PD-L1-positive, and have radically unresectable, advanced or recurrent esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have progressed after chemotherapy. Additionally, KEYTRUDA was approved for use at an additional recommended dosage of 400 mg every six weeks (Q6W) administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes across all adult indications, including KEYTRUDA monotherapy and combination therapy. This new dosage option will be available in addition to the current dose of 200 mg every three weeks (Q3W). With these approvals, KEYTRUDA has 13 indications across seven tumor types plus MSI-H tumors in Japan.

“We remain committed to improving outcomes for as many patients with cancer as possible, including those with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which is a leading cause of cancer-related death in Japan,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “With today’s approvals, specific patients with esophageal cancer can receive a much-needed new treatment option, and adult patients receiving KEYTRUDA will now have the option of a dosing schedule that reduces how often they are at the clinic for treatment.”

The approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with ESCC is based on results from the global Phase 3 KEYNOTE-181 trial, in which an improvement in overall survival (OS) was observed for KEYTRUDA monotherapy compared with chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan) in patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS =10) (HR=0.64 [95% CI, 0.46-0.90]). The median OS was 10.3 months (95% CI, 7.0-13.5) for KEYTRUDA compared with 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.8-8.6) for chemotherapy.

The approval of KEYTRUDA for a Q6W dosing regimen is based on pharmacokinetic modeling and exposure-response analyses. The pharmacokinetic modeling data was supported by an interim analysis of pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data from KEYNOTE-555 from a cohort of patients (Cohort B) treated with KEYTRUDA 400 mg Q6W.

“In Japan, more than 90% of esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Patients with advanced disease face a poor prognosis and are in critical need of new treatment options,” said Jannie Oosthuizen, president, MSD Japan. “These approvals reinforce our commitment to innovative research that will continue to help more patients with cancer in Japan.”

<strong>About Esophageal Cancer in Japan</strong>

Esophageal cancer, a type of cancer that is particularly difficult to treat, begins in the inner layer (mucosa) of the esophagus and grows outward. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. In Japan, more than 90% of all esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Globally, esophageal cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer, and it is estimated there were more than 572,000 new esophageal cancer cases and nearly 509,000 deaths resulting from the disease in 2018.

<strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg</strong>

KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

<b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA</b>

<b>Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Colitis</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<i>Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib</i>

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

<b>Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

<b>Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

<b>Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</b>

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

<b>Infusion-Related Reactions</b>

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

<b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</b>

Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

<b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</b>

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

<b>Embryofetal Toxicity</b>

Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

The first participants have been dosed in a Phase I trial of AZD7442, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

The trial, called NCT04507256, will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD7442.<sup>1</sup> The trial will include up to 48 healthy participants in the UK aged 18 to 55 years and is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), part of the US Department of Defense, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&amp;D, said: “This trial is an important milestone in the development of our monoclonal antibody combination to prevent or treat COVID-19. This combination of antibodies, coupled to our proprietary half-life extension technology, has the potential to improve both the effectiveness and durability of use in addition to reducing the likelihood of viral resistance.”

Should AZD7442 prove to be tolerated and have a favourable safety profile in the trial, AstraZeneca will progress it into larger late-stage Phase II and Phase III trials to evaluate its efficacy as a potential preventative and treatment approach against COVID-19.

Synthesised in the laboratory, mAbs aim to mimic natural antibodies. The treatment has the potential to be given as a preventative option for people exposed to the virus, and to treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected by the virus.

<b>AZD7442</b>

AZD7442 is a combination of two mAbs derived from convalescent patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. <a name=""_Hlk49182578""></a>Discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center and licensed to AstraZeneca in June 2020, the mAbs were optimised by AstraZeneca with half-life extension and reduced Fc receptor binding. The half-life extended mAbs should afford at least six months of protection from COVID-19.<sup>2-5</sup> In a recent <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2548-6""><i>Nature</i></a> publication, the mAbs were shown preclinically to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to host cells and protect against infection in cell and animal models of disease.<sup>6</sup>

<b>NCT04507256</b>

NCT04507256 is a Phase I, first time in human, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and dose escalation study that aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD7442 in healthy participants.<sup>1</sup> Data readout is anticipated in the second half of 2020.

<p align=""center""><em>AbbVie to pay Morphic license fee of $20 million, with future potential milestones and royalties</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>AbbVie to lead further development and commercialization</em></p>
<p align=""justify"">WALTHAM, Mass., Aug. 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Morphic Therapeutic (NASDAQ: MORF), a biopharmaceutical company developing a new generation of oral integrin therapies for the treatment of serious chronic diseases, and AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that AbbVie has exercised a license option under the companies’ research and development collaboration agreement to develop Morphic’s a<sub>v</sub>ß<sub>6</sub> integrin inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and additional indications. The a<sub>v</sub>ß<sub>6 </sub>integrin activates transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß), a key driver of tissue fibrosis. The license covers a<sub>v</sub>ß<sub>6</sub> integrin specific inhibitors discovered from Morphic’s proprietary MInT Platform, including the compounds MORF-720 and MORF-627, which are supported by an extensive preclinical data package demonstrating potential as treatments for IPF as well as other fibrotic diseases. Pursuant to the agreement between Morphic and AbbVie, Morphic will receive a license fee of $20 million, with potential future development milestone payments and royalties from the sales of any commercialized candidates.</p>
<p align=""justify"">“The preclinical data strongly support Morphic’s selective small molecule inhibitors of a<sub>v</sub>ß<sub>6 </sub>for development in fibrotic disease. AbbVie has been an excellent partner through the preclinical development of this program and we believe that their decision to assume leadership for the next stages of development is a strong vote of confidence in our collaboration, as well as Morphic’s MInT platform to generate orally available integrin inhibitors,” said Praveen Tipirneni, MD, president and chief executive officer of Morphic Therapeutic.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About the Morphic-AbbVie Agreement</strong>
Under the terms of the original agreement, AbbVie paid Morphic an upfront payment of $100 million for exclusive license options on product candidates directed at multiple targets. For each target, Morphic will conduct R&amp;D activities through the completion of IND-enabling studies, at which point AbbVie may pay a license fee to exercise its exclusive license option and assume responsibility for global development and commercialization. Morphic is also eligible for additional, undisclosed clinical and commercial milestone payments and tiered royalties on worldwide net sales for each compound. Morphic retains cost-sharing rights in the development of liver fibrosis indications, and may opt into paying a percentage of AbbVie’s development costs in exchange for enhanced royalties.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Fibrosis and TGF-</strong><strong>ß</strong>
Fibrosis occurs when chronic inflammation or persistent injury leads to the development of excessive connective tissue, which can lead to organ damage and impaired function. Fibrotic diseases can affect nearly all tissues and organ systems and, due to limited treatment options, can cause serious illness and death.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-ß is a key regulator of fibrosis, but attempts to globally suppress its activity have suffered from a narrow therapeutic index (dose-limiting toxicity). Several integrins, such as a<sub>v</sub>ß<sub>6</sub>, play a dominant role in local activation of TGF-ß in diseased tissues. Inhibition of these integrins is therefore a compelling strategy for treating chronic fibrotic diseases with significant advantage over global TGF-ß inhibitors.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>About Morphic Therapeutic</strong>

<p class=""bwalignc""><i>- First-in-class, non-opioid, mechanism interrupts pain pathways</i></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><i>- Phase 2 initiation planned for the first half of 2021</i></p>
SAN DIEGO &amp; FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 25, 2020-- ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAD) today announced the acquisition of CerSci Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company with worldwide rights to a portfolio of novel compounds for neurological conditions, including non-opioid therapies for acute and chronic pain. The lead development program is a unique Reactive Species Decomposition Accelerant (RSDAx), a first-in-class mechanism focused on interrupting pathways that sensitize neurons to pain. The portfolio contains additional preclinical stage molecules, including brain penetrant molecules, with potential for symptomatic and disease modifying treatment utility in neurodegenerative diseases.

This acquisition strengthens ACADIA’s clinical pipeline to include non-opioid pain therapies that have potential non-addictive properties and reduced side effects typically seen with current opioid treatments. The lead molecule, ACP-044, has shown promising efficacy and safety results in animal models evaluating incisional, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain, as well as favorable tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties in Phase 1 trials. The novel RSDAx mechanism of action is thought to interfere with multiple pain pathways treating pain simultaneously. ACADIA plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical study in the first half of 2021.

“There is an urgent need for new approaches to treat pain without causing addiction,” said Steve Davis, ACADIA’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are excited by the potential clinical utility of this program across multiple pain modalities due to its novel non-opioid mechanism of action. By acquiring CerSci, ACADIA is further strengthening our development pipeline for long-term growth in central nervous system disorders.”

“For too long, the options for patients with acute and chronic pain have been very limited,” said Lucas Rodriguez, CEO and co-founder of CerSci. “I am highly confident that ACADIA, with its proven development and commercialization capabilities, can advance CerSci’s program and ultimately deliver a new generation of medicines to treat acute post-operative as well as chronic pain conditions.”

Under the terms of the agreement, ACADIA acquired all of the outstanding shares of CerSci for $52.5 million, primarily in ACADIA stock. The transaction closed on August 24, 2020. CerSci shareholders may also receive up to $887 million in development, commercialization, and sales milestones in addition to tiered royalties in the mid-single digits based on annual net sales.

BofA Securities is serving as financial advisor and Paul Hastings, LLP is serving as legal advisor to ACADIA. Evercore is serving as financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP is serving as legal advisor to CerSci. CerSci’s major investors include JDH Investment Management, LLC, Hiawatha Education Foundation, Lennox Capital Partners, LP and West Summit Investments, LP.

NEW YORK &amp; OSAKA, Japan--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.takeda.com%2Finvestors%2F&amp;esheet=52272356&amp;newsitemid=20200825005303&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=TSE%3A4502%2FNYSE%3ATAK&amp;index=1&amp;md5=a5a31842ab88630e4a6b672c24a66505"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</a>) (“Takeda”) and Ovid Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: OVID) (“Ovid”), a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines that transform the lives of people with rare neurological diseases, today announced positive topline results from the randomized Phase 2 ELEKTRA study of soticlestat in children with Dravet syndrome (DS) or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Soticlestat is a potent, highly selective, oral, first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H). It is being investigated by Ovid and Takeda for the treatment of rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), a group of highly refractory epilepsy syndromes including DS and LGS.

<a id=""tweet-pull-quote"" href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200825005303/en/Phase-2-ELEKTRA-Study-Soticlestat-TAK-935OV935-Meets#"">Tweet this</a></blockquote>
The ELEKTRA study achieved its primary endpoint with high statistical significance, demonstrating a 27.8% median reduction from baseline in convulsive seizure (DS) and drop seizure (LGS) frequency compared to a 3.1% median increase in patients taking placebo during the 12-week maintenance period (median placebo-adjusted reduction=30.5%; p=0.0007, based on the efficacy analysis set of 120 patients with seizure data in the maintenance period). In addition, DS and LGS patients treated with soticlestat demonstrated a 29.8% median reduction in convulsive seizure (DS) and drop seizure (LGS) frequency compared to 0.0% change in median seizure frequency in patients taking placebo during the full 20-week treatment period (titration plus maintenance) of the ELEKTRA study (placebo-adjusted reduction=25.1%; p=0.0024).

In the ELEKTRA DS cohort (n=51), patients treated with soticlestat demonstrated a 33.8% median reduction in convulsive seizure frequency compared to a 7.0% median increase in patients taking placebo during the full 20-week treatment period of the study (median placebo-adjusted reduction in seizure frequency is 46.0%; p=0.0007). Based on these data, the companies plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss initiation of a Phase 3 registrational program for soticlestat in patients with DS.

In the ELEKTRA LGS cohort (n=88), patients treated with soticlestat demonstrated a 20.6% median reduction in drop seizure frequency compared to a 6.0.% median reduction in patients taking placebo during the full 20-week treatment period of the study (median placebo-adjusted reduction in seizure frequency is 14.8%; p=0.1279). Additional analyses are being conducted to better understand the potential next steps for the development of soticlestat in this highly heterogenous patient population.

Soticlestat was generally well-tolerated in the ELEKTRA study and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with those of previous studies, with no new safety signals identified. All patients who completed the ELEKTRA study elected to enroll into the ENDYMION open-label extension study and findings from ENDYMION are also reported today.

“We are extremely encouraged by these results, which show a clear statistically significant reduction of seizures in Dravet syndrome patients treated with soticlestat, as well as a trend for seizure reduction in Lennox-Gastaut patients,” said Amit Rakhit, M.D., MBA, President and Chief Medical Officer of Ovid. “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Takeda to initiate a Phase 3 registrational program for soticlestat in patients with DS, while continuing to analyze the data from patients with LGS in the ELEKTRA and ENDYMION studies to define potential next steps. We also expect to report data from the open-label Phase 2 ARCADE study with soticlestat in patients with CDKL5 deficiency disorder and Dup15q syndrome, two other types of highly-refractory DEEs, later this quarter.”

“It is exciting to see these positive results and to advance soticlestat into late stage clinical development -- initially for the potential treatment of children with Dravet syndrome who need more options to manage treatment-resistant seizures,” said Sarah Sheikh, M.D., M.Sc., MRCP, Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. “Soticlestat and its novel mechanism of action were discovered at Takeda and we are enthusiastic about continuing to advance the science and clinical programs as one aligned team, in strong partnership with Ovid Therapeutics.”

“Children with developmental epileptic encephalopathies like DS and LGS need more options to manage their treatment-resistant seizures,” said Dr. Cecil Hahn, M.D., MPH, a Child Neurologist at The Hospital for Sick Children and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Toronto. “The results of the ELEKTRA study are very promising, particularly for children with DS and represent a clinically significant reduction in seizure burden. Moreover, soticlestat was well-tolerated in this study.""

<b>Phase 2 ELEKTRA Study Design and Patient Baseline Demographics</b>

ELEKTRA was an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate treatment with soticlestat in pediatric patients, aged 2 to 17 years, with highly refractory epileptic seizures associated with DS (convulsive seizures) or LGS (drop seizures). The study consisted of a four- to six-week screening period to establish baseline seizure frequency, followed by a 20-week double-blind treatment period, including an 8-week dose optimization period and a 12-week maintenance period. During the 8-week dose optimization period, patients were titrated from 100mg twice daily (BID), to 200mg BID to 300mg BID (mg/kg dosing for &lt;60 kg) of orally administered soticlestat.

A total of 141 patients were enrolled in ELEKTRA and 126 completed the study. A modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis of 139 patients was performed to evaluate the efficacy endpoints, which includes any patient who enrolled in the study and received at least one dose of study drug. Patients in the study were allowed to be on one to four concomitant anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), with the majority of patients concomitantly treated with at least three AEDs. The most common AEDs taken by the patients were valproate, clobazam, levetiracetam and topiramate.

<b>Phase 2 ELEKTRA Topline Efficacy Results</b>

The study achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating a 27.8% median reduction from baseline in convulsive seizure (DS) and drop seizure (LGS) frequency compared to a 3.1% median increase in patients on placebo during the 12-week maintenance period (median placebo-adjusted reduction=30.5%; p=0.0007, based on the efficacy analysis set of 120 patients with seizure data in the maintenance period). During the full 20-week treatment period of the mITT DS patient population, the median percent change from baseline was a 33.8% decrease in seizure frequency compared to a 7.0% increase in seizure frequency for patients receiving placebo (median placebo-adjusted reduction=46.0%; p=0.0007). During the full treatment period of the mITT LGS patient population, the median percent change from baseline was a 20.6% decrease in seizure frequency compared to a 6.0% decrease in patients receiving placebo (median placebo-adjusted reduction=14.8%; p=0.1279).

<b>Phase 2 ELEKTRA Topline Safety Results</b>

Soticlestat was well tolerated in this study. These findings were consistent with previous studies and no new safety signals were identified. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was similar in both the treatment and placebo groups with 57 (80.3%) of soticlestat patients experiencing at least one treatment emergent adverse event compared to 52 (74.3%) placebo patients. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events reported in soticlestat-treated patients with =5% difference from placebo were lethargy and constipation. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in both soticlestat and placebo groups, with 11 (15.5%) in soticlestat experiencing at least one treatment emergent serious adverse event compared to 13 (18.6%) in placebo. There were no deaths reported.

<b>ENDYMION Open-Label Extension Study Update</b>

All patients who completed the ELEKTRA trial elected to roll over into the ENDYMION open-label extension study. The primary objective of ENDYMION is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of soticlestat over four years of treatment in patients with rare epilepsies and, secondarily, to evaluate the effect of soticlestat on seizure frequency over time.

Data from the ELEKTRA patients who have rolled over into the ENDYMION study are supportive of results in the core study. The data indicate maintenance of effect over 6 months in those patients originally randomized to soticlestat, and similarly reduced seizure frequency as compared to baseline in those patients previously assigned to the placebo arm. No new safety signals were identified in ENDYMION.

<b>About Soticlestat (TAK-935/OV935)</b>

Soticlestat is a potent, highly selective, first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), with the potential to reduce seizure susceptibility and improve seizure control. CH24H is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it converts cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC) to adjust the homeostatic balance of brain cholesterol. 24HC is a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor and modulates glutamatergic signaling associated with epilepsy. Glutamate is one of the main neurotransmitters in the brain and has been shown to play a role in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. Recent literature indicates that CH24H is involved in over-activation of the glutamatergic pathway through modulation of the NMDA channel and that increased expression of CH24H can disrupt the reuptake of glutamate by astrocytes, resulting in epileptogenesis and neurotoxicity. Inhibition of CH24H by soticlestat reduces the neuronal levels of 24HC and may improve excitatory/inhibitory balance of NMDA channel activity.

Takeda and Ovid are sharing in the development and commercialization costs of soticlestat on a 50/50 basis and, if successful, the companies will share in the profits on a 50/50 basis. Takeda will be responsible for commercialization in Japan and has the option to be responsible for commercialization in other countries in Asia and other selected countries. Ovid will be responsible for clinical development activities and commercialization of soticlestat in the United States, Europe, Canada and Israel. Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda received equity in Ovid and may be eligible to receive certain milestone payments based on the advancement of soticlestat.

<b>About Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome</b>

Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are types of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), a heterogeneous group of rare epilepsy syndromes. Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome typically become apparent during infancy or early childhood and are highly refractory to many antiseizure medications.

Dravet syndrome is most commonly caused by a genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene and affects approximately 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 21,000 people in the United States. Dravet syndrome is characterized by prolonged focal seizures that can evolve to convulsive tonic-clonic seizures. Children with Dravet syndrome experience developmental disabilities as seizures increase. Other common symptoms include changes in appetite, difficulty balancing and a crouched gait when walking.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 11,000 people in the United States. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a heterogeneous condition and characterized by several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic (drop), tonic and atypical absence seizures. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, but in some cases no cause can be identified.

<strong>Basel, August 26, 2020</strong> — Novartis announced today that, at primary analysis, the Phase III ASCEMBL study met its primary endpoint of statistically significant superiority in major molecular response (MMR) rate at 24 weeks for asciminib (ABL001) vs. bosutinib<sup>1</sup>. The study evaluates asciminib – a novel investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP) – in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs)<sup>1</sup>. Patients with failure or intolerance to the most recently administered TKI therapy were included in the trial<sup>1</sup>.

“Our ability to treat patients with TKIs changed CML care forever. However, the risk of disease progression is a reality for many patients – especially those who experience resistance to sequential TKI therapy or those who cannot adhere to treatment due to the daily impact of intolerable side effects<sup>16</sup>,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We are incredibly grateful to the patients and investigators around the world who participated in this study. These results with asciminib are a testament to our commitment to further transform CML care – this time through STAMP inhibition, by exploiting a natural regulatory mechanism of the ABL kinase.”

Data from the ASCEMBL trial will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting, and results will be shared with regulatory authorities. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for asciminib.

Findings from earlier studies of asciminib were presented during past annual meetings of the European Hematology Association, and some details can be found <a title=""here"" href=""https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-continues-innovate-cml-long-term-treatment-free-remission-results-following-tasigna-use-and-promising-combination-data-investigational-compound"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">here</a><sup>13,14</sup>.

<strong>About asciminib (ABL001)</strong>
Asciminib (ABL001) is an investigational treatment specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket (STAMP). As a STAMP inhibitor, asciminib may help address tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistance and intolerance in later treatment lines of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)<sup>8-14</sup>, and it is being studied in several clinical trials in hopes of helping patients across multiple treatment lines of CML<sup>7,10,11,13-15,17</sup>.

<strong>About ASCEMBL</strong>

<p class=""MittleresRaster1-Akzent21""><strong>Germantown, Maryland, and Hilden, Germany, August 24, 2020 –</strong> QIAGEN N.V. (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced the U.S. launch of the new Access Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total test, an easy-to-use digital test done on a portable device that provides results in about 10 minutes to detect antibodies in people exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the case of COVID-19.</p>
The launch of this antibody test, which was developed in partnership with the Australian digital diagnostics company Ellume, comes after the submission by QIAGEN of this unique antibody test to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). First shipments are planned for late August 2020. A CE-IVD marking for Europe and other markets is planned in the coming weeks.

The new serological test has been shown to have sensitivity of 100% (CI 88.43–100.00%) and specificity of 100% (CI 95.20–100.00%).

“Increased testing is the only way to gain visibility on the magnitude of the pandemic, which will ultimately lead to helping control it,” said Dr. Davide Manissero, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of QIAGEN. “As a trusted partner in the fight against COVID-19, QIAGEN has now added the Access Anti-SARS-CoV-2 to our portfolio as a smart solution for antibody testing that provides results with confidence. This is a rugged and portable platform that requires no hardware, can process a wide range of tests and provides fast results. We look forward to working with Ellume to discover and develop additional tests for this platform.”

The test is performed on the eHub, a small portable digital device that provides reliable results in 10 minutes. Each eHub can handle up to eight patient samples simultaneously and can perform up to 32 total tests per hour. The nanoparticle fluorescent detection technology uses serum or plasma from patient samples. The same platform is being used for QuantiFERON-TB Access, a new solution in development for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection in low-resource regions with a high TB disease burden.

Currently available rapid lateral flow antibody tests fall short when it comes to the automated and convenient read-out of results. Manual and visual result reporting, and potential pitfalls in read-out timing can lead of uncertain testing results. The Access Anti-SARS-CoV-2 eHub and digital eStick approach mitigates those risks, providing reliable results no matter when the results are read and also providing true walk-away capability to free up laboratory personnel.

Serological testing for antibodies is central to identifying people who have been recently infected by the virus or have been infected in the recent past, especially those who did not show any symptoms and therefore might not know of an infection. Understanding more about COVID-19 immunity in a population could help societies return faster to normal daily routines by helping to inform and guide public health measures, such as contact tracing and individual measures under clinical guidance. Antibody testing could also become fundamental in supporting vaccine development as well as guiding, planning, and assessing future SARS-CoV-2 immunization programs.

Access Anti-SARS-CoV-2 will complement QIAGEN’s array of COVID-19 testing solutions with a cost-effective way to detect immune responses in people who have been exposed to the virus.

QIAGEN employees around the world are fully mobilized to address the urgent demand for testing solutions needed in the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. QIAGEN’s initiatives focus on building the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions for COVID-19 testing. These include production of viral RNA extraction for use on QIAGEN’s QIAcube, QIAsymphony and EZ1 platforms as well as third-party instruments; building up a range of PCR tests on the QIAstat-Dx and NeuMoDx systems that enable COVID-19 detection while analyzing samples at the same time for other respiratory infections; QIAGEN is also providing universal next-generation sequencing (NGS) solutions for research use with any sequencer, in particular gene panels integrated with bioinformatics for analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. QIAGEN is also scaling up production capacity for reagents sold to other companies for use in their own COVID-19 tests.

<span class=""p-body-copy-02""><b>Amsterdam, the Netherlands</b> – <a href=""http://www.philips.com/newscenter"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Royal Philips</a> (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, and B. Braun, a global market leader [1] in regional anesthesia and pain management, today announced 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Onvision, a breakthrough ultrasound guidance solution for real-time needle tip tracking. Available exclusively on the latest version of the B. Braun and Philips <a href=""http://www.bbraun.com/xperius"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Xperius</a>ultrasound system together with the dedicated Stimuplex Onvision needle, Onvision gives anesthesiologists the confidence to accurately position the needle tip inside the body for Peripheral Nerve Blocks (PNBs). </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02""> </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">Accurate needle placement is critical to the success of regional anesthesia procedures such as PNBs. While real-time ultrasound imaging has proved to be a valuable tool for needle guidance, failure to optimally visualize the needle tip remains a challenge, with 10-15% of all PNBs ineffective after a single-injection technique [2]. In real-time, Onvision accurately indicates where the needle tip is inside the body, both in and out of the ultrasound viewing plane [3]. It helps the user align the needle with the probe in a user-friendly interface that can lead to a reduction in procedural time [4]. </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02""> </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">“When I first started to use Onvision, I didn’t think that we would increase the number of out-of-plane procedures, but I was happily surprised we did,” said Paul Kessler M.D. Ph.D., Vice Chairman, Clinic of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital Frankfurt (Germany). “Onvision gives you the extra assurance to perform deep and difficult blocks both in- and out-of-plane.”</span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">FDA clearance for Onvision represents the latest advance in a multi-year strategic alliance between Philips and B. Braun to innovate in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, a rapidly growing alternative to general anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is an essential part of pain therapy and offers clear advantages when compared to general anesthesia such as pain elimination during and after surgery [5], improved functional outcomes [6], and faster mobilization [7].</span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">“The increased confidence and predictability offered by the Xperius Ultrasound System and Onvision Needle Tip Tracking is empowering more anesthesiologists to embrace regional anesthesia as a viable and effective alternative to general anesthesia,” said Tobin Taylor-Bhatia, Head of Innovation for Image Guided Therapy at Philips. “By innovating together with B. Braun we’ve created a solution to one of the biggest challenges in regional anesthesia – accurate positioning of the needle tip in the body.”</span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02""> </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">“Onvision is the groundbreaking technology that allows anesthesiologists the predictability [4] and confidence [4] they need while positioning the needle during a procedure,” said Dr. Angela Karpf, M.D., Corporate Vice President of Medical Affairs at B. Braun. “B. Braun continues to add products to our regional anesthesia therapy portfolio that help achieve faster postsurgical recoveries, optimize procedural workflow and enhance user experience.”</span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02""> </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">Together, B. Braun’s Stimuplex Onvision needles and Philips’ Onvision needle tip tracking technology indicate the position of the needle tip in relation to the ultrasound viewing plane to an accuracy of 3mm [3]. A sensitive micro-sensor placed on the needle, combined with advanced signal processing and visualization techniques on the Xperius system, indicate the real-time location of the needle tip in relation to the 2D ultrasound viewing plane. The solution provides greater flexibility in needle trajectory [8] and can reduce procedure times [4].</span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02""> </span>

<span class=""p-body-copy-02"">In addition to FDA clearance, the Onvision solution is CE marked. It is available for sale across the EU and in Chile and is expected to be available in the United States in Q4 2020.
