11246,ï»¿Retrotope's RT001 Receives EMA's Orphan Drug Designation for Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD),"EMA Grants Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for Retrotope’s RT001 in the Treatment of Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD), a PLA2G6 associated neurodegeneration (PLAN)","The EMA’s ODD is based on P-II/III study assessing RT001 in patients with INAD, a neurodegeneration associated with PLA2G6
 EMA’s ODD is granted to the drug offering treatments for rare, devastating, fatal, and untreated diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people or >200,000 persons
 Retrotope’s RT001 is an oral deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acid (D-PUFA) working against PUFA to prevent cell death","Retrotope received notification from the Committee for Orphan
Medical Products of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that its request for orphan medicinal
product designation for the treatment of INAD with RT001, a chemically-fortified polyunsaturated fatty
acid drug, has been granted by the European Commission. Retrotope is currently enrolling a Phase 2/3
trial in the US for INAD, an ultra-rare, severe childhood neurodegeneration due to an inborn error in
PLA2G6.
Robert Molinari, Ph.D. CEO of Retrotope commented: “We want to sincerely thank the European
Commission for granting us orphan status in such a devastating, fatal, and untreated disease. We are
also grateful to the researchers, patients and clinicians whose work contributed to the results
supporting our orphan status, and hope our currently-enrolling late stage clinical trial in this ultra-rare
condition can recapitulate the favorable results we’ve seen in two Expanded Access patients.”
Peter Milner, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Retrotope, added, “Patients from all over the world are
enrolled in our open-label, US trial in INAD. We look forward to be able to treat patients as quickly as
possible world-wide if our current US pivotal trial achieves positive results. While not the subject of our
current trials, the INAD genotype includes classical INAD, non-infantile onset or Atypical Neuroaxonal
Dystrophy (ANAD), and PLA2G6 deficiency induced young-onset Parkinson’s disease (YOPD).
About INAD
INAD is an ultra-rare, devastating life-shortening neuro-degenerative disorder that affects only a few
hundred patients worldwide. Infants with INAD appear to develop normally until approximately 14 to
18 months of age, when they begin to experience progressive mental and psychomotor development
declines. Life threatening complications typically develop by the end of the first decade, and there is no
approved treatment. RT001 is a chemically stabilized fatty acid drug that confers resistance to lipid
peroxidation in mitochondrial and cellular membranes, a pathology found to be a causative element of
cell death in disease models.
About RT001
RT001 is a patented, first-in-class, orally available D-PUFA, a deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acid, that
incorporates into mitochondrial and cellular membranes and stabilizes them. Retrotope and others
have discovered that lipid peroxidation, the free-radical damage of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) in
mitochondrial and cellular membranes, may be the primary source of cell death in several degenerative
diseases, including Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA) and INAD. The presence of D-PUFAs (RT001) can help protect
(“fireproof”) against this attack and potentially restore cellular health.
About Retrotope
Retrotope, a privately held, clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, is creating a new category of drugs
to treat degenerative diseases. Composed of proprietary compounds that are chemically stabilized
forms of essential nutrients, these compounds are being studied as disease-modifying therapies for
many intractable diseases, such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, INAD, ALS, Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), Late
2
Onset Tay Sachs (LOTS), mitochondrial myopathies, and retinopathies. RT001, Retrotope’s first lead
candidate, is being tested in controlled trials in INAD and Friedreich’s ataxia. For more information

The transaction is expected to close in Q2’19 with the joining of 360 employees to Smith & Nephew
 The focus of an acquisition is to expand Smith & Nephew’s regenerative drugs portfolio and to enhance its wound management business with the usage of Osiris’ lead candidates Grafix & Stravix
 Osiris’ Grafix & Stravix is a cryopreserved placental membrane & tissue used to heal wounds with exposed bone and tendon and to support tissue repair respectively","Smith & Nephew plc (LSE:SN, NYSE:SNN), the global medical technology business, announces that it has agreed to acquire Osiris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: OSIR), a fast growing company delivering regenerative medicine products, including skin, bone graft and articular cartilage substitutes, for $19.00 per share in cash, representing a total equity value of approximately $660 million.
Namal Nawana, Chief Executive Officer, Smith & Nephew, said:
“Greater presence in the fast growing regenerative medicine market enhances our portfolio and will help immediately accelerate our wound management business as well as provide longer term innovations in additional channels and indications. We sought out a fast growing portfolio with strong clinical evidence addressing critical needs in the marketplace.”
Osiris delivered revenue of $102 million for the nine-months ended 30 September 2018, an 18.7% increase over the comparable period in 2017. Revenue was $36.5 million for the three-month period ended 30 September 2018, a 22.4% increase year on year. Osiris is expected to publish its Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 results on 15 March 2019.
Osiris’ principal products, Grafix® and Stravix®, accounted for more than 70% of revenue in the first nine months of 2018, and drove the majority of growth. We expect these two products to continue to deliver strong double-digit growth into the medium term. Grafix and Stravix participate in the US skin substitute market, which is currently worth $900 million per annum and growing at 7% annually1.
Skin substitute Grafix is a cryopreserved placental membrane intended for application directly to acute and chronic wounds, including wounds with exposed bone and tendon. Grafix is supported by robust evidence including two randomised controlled trials, six non-randomised trials and more than 20 peer-reviewed publications in the last 5 years. In October 2018, Osiris launched Grafix PL PRIME, a lyopreserved product that can be stored at room temperature, improving usability for healthcare professionals.
Stravix is a cryopreserved placental tissue used as a surgical cover or wrap to support soft tissue repair in a wide range of surgical procedures.
Simon Fraser, President, Advanced Wound Management at Smith & Nephew, said: “Grafix offers a compelling new option for managing hard to heal wounds and Stravix expands our tissue repair portfolio. We will drive synergies across products from common call points and increased access to our wider customer base.”
Osiris also offers BIO4® bone matrix for bone repair and Cartiform®, an allograft for articular cartilage repair, products currently exclusively distributed by third parties.
Peter Friedli, Chairman and co-founder of Osiris, said: “I am immensely proud of the business we have built from our research into advanced regenerative technologies. Smith & Nephew is the best new owner to take these products forward, widening access to more customers and restoring quality of life for more patients.”
Osiris’ 360 employees are expected to join Smith & Nephew on completion.

Transaction details
Under the terms of the transaction, Smith & Nephew will commence a two-step tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Osiris common stock for $19.00 per share in cash.
The purchase price represents a 37% premium over the 90-day volume weighted average price of Osiris’ shares prior to this announcement.
Peter Friedli has entered into a Tender & Support Agreement with Smith & Nephew whereby he will commit to tender approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of Osiris in favour of the transaction.
The companies expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, including relevant antitrust clearances and the tender of a majority of outstanding shares of Osiris common stock on a fully diluted basis.
The acquisition will be financed from Smith & Nephew’s existing cash and debt facilities. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Smith & Nephew’s adjusted earnings per share from 2020. The acquisition is expected to generate a return on invested capital that exceeds Smith & Nephew’s cost of capital in the third year after closing.

11259,ï»¿Roche's Hemlibra Receives EU's Approval for Severe Haemophilia A without Factor VIII Inhibitors,European Commission approves Roche’s Hemlibra for people with severe haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors,"The approval is based on P-III HAVEN 3 & HAVEN 4 study assessing Hemlibra in 152 & 48 patients haemophilia A without & with/without factor VIII inhibitors aged > 12yrs.
 HAVEN 3 (NCT02847637) study results: met its 1EPs & 2EPS; @1wk. & 2wks. reduction in treated bleeds (96% & 97%); zero treated bleeds (55.6% & 60%); reduction in joint bleed (95% & 95%); reduction in all bleed (95% & 94%). HAVEN 4 study results: zero treated bleed (56%)
 Hemlibra (emicizumab, SC, qw, q2w, q4w) IXa & X factor directed Ab, co-developed by Chugai, Roche and Genentech and is approved in 60 countries including the US in Nov’17, EU in Feb’18 and Japan in Mar’18 for reduction in bleeding episode","First medicine to significantly reduce treated bleeds compared to prior factor VIII prophylaxis, in a prospective intra-patient comparison
Only prophylactic medicine that can be given subcutaneously and with multiple dosing options
The efficacy and safety of Hemlibra has been demonstrated in one of the largest pivotal clinical trial programmes in haemophilia A
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has approved Hemlibra® (emicizumab) for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in people with severe haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency, FVIII <1%) without factor VIII inhibitors. Hemlibra can be used in all age groups, and can also now be used at multiple dosing options (once weekly, every two weeks, or every four weeks) for all indicated people with haemophilia A, including those with factor VIII inhibitors.
This approval is based on results from the pivotal HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4 studies. In the HAVEN 3 study in people with haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors, Hemlibra prophylaxis led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in treated bleeds compared to no prophylaxis, and compared to prior treatment with factor VIII prophylaxis in a prospective intra-patient comparison. In the HAVEN 4 study in people with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors, Hemlibra showed a clinically meaningful control of bleeding when dosed every four weeks.
“We are delighted that now people with severe haemophilia A without inhibitors in the EU will also have the opportunity to benefit from Hemlibra, which has been shown to significantly reduce bleeds compared to no prophylaxis and compared to prior factor VIII prophylaxis,” said Dr Elena Santagostino, Director of the Hemophilia Unit at the Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Hemophilia and Thrombosis Centre of the Cà Granda Foundation, Maggiore Hospital Policlinico of Milan, Italy. “We are hopeful that the three different dosing options will allow people with haemophilia A and their physicians to choose the option that’s right for them, based on their lifestyle and preferences.”
“Today’s approval is a landmark moment as Hemlibra is the first new class of treatment for people with severe haemophilia A without inhibitors in nearly 20 years,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Moreover, Hemlibra can effectively control bleeds while offering subcutaneous dosing once weekly, every two weeks or every four weeks. We will continue to work with EU member states, to bring this important treatment to those in need as quickly as possible.”
In the phase III HAVEN 3 study, adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older with haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors who received Hemlibra prophylaxis once weekly (n=36) or every two weeks (n=35) experienced a 96% (rate ratio [RR]=0.04; p<0.0001) and 97% (RR= 0.03; p<0.0001) reduction in treated bleeds, respectively, compared to those who received no prophylaxis (n=18). Hemlibra is the first medicine to significantly reduce treated bleeds compared to prior factor VIII prophylaxis, the standard of care for people with haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors, as demonstrated by a statistically significant reduction of 68% (RR=0.32; p<0.0001) in treated bleeds in an intra-patient comparison (n=48) of people who previously received factor VIII prophylaxis in a prospective non-interventional study and switched to Hemlibra prophylaxis.
In the single-arm phase III HAVEN 4 study, Hemlibra prophylaxis every four weeks led to clinically meaningful control of bleeding in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors (n=5) and without factor VIII inhibitors (n=36).
In pooled data from the phase III HAVEN programme (n=373), the most common adverse reactions occurring in 10% or more of people treated with Hemlibra were injection site reactions (20%), joint pain (arthralgia; 15%) and headache (14%).
On 4 October 2018, Hemlibra was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children, ages newborn and older, with haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors, following Priority Review. Hemlibra was also previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. Priority Review designation is granted to medicines that the FDA has determined to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines intended to treat a serious condition with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. Submissions to other regulatory authorities around the world are ongoing.
Hemlibra has been approved for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in over 60 countries worldwide, including the US in November 2017, EU member states in February 2018 and Japan in March 2018. It has been studied in one of the largest pivotal clinical trial programmes in people with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors, including four phase III studies (HAVEN 1, HAVEN 2, HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4).

About HAVEN 3 (NCT02847637)
HAVEN 3 is a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of Hemlibra prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis (episodic/on-demand factor VIII treatment) in people with haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. The study included 152 patients with haemophilia A (12 years of age or older) who were previously treated with factor VIII therapy either on-demand or as prophylaxis. Patients previously treated with on-demand factor VIII were randomised in a 2:2:1 fashion to receive subcutaneous Hemlibra prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for four weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/wk for at least 24 weeks (Arm A), subcutaneous Hemlibra prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for four weeks, followed by 3 mg/kg/2wks (Arm B) for at least 24 weeks or no prophylaxis (Arm C) for at least 24 weeks.
Patients previously treated with factor VIII prophylaxis received subcutaneous Hemlibra prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for four weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/wk until the end of study (Arm D). Episodic treatment of breakthrough bleeds with factor VIII therapy was allowed per protocol.
HAVEN 3 met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. Data from the study showed:

Hemlibra prophylaxis every week or every two weeks resulted in a 96% (RR=0.04; p<0.0001,) and 97% (RR= 0.03; p<0.0001) reduction in treated bleeds, respectively, compared to no prophylaxis.
55.6% (95% CI: 38.1, 72.1) of people treated with Hemlibra every week and 60% (95% CI: 42.1, 76.1) of people treated with Hemlibra every two weeks experienced zero treated bleeds, compared to 0% (95% CI: 0.0; 18.5) of people treated with no prophylaxis.
Hemlibra prophylaxis every week or every two weeks resulted in a 95% (RR=0.05; p<0.0001) and 95% (RR=0.05; p<0.0001) reduction in treated target joint bleeds, respectively, compared to no prophylaxis.
Hemlibra prophylaxis every week or every two weeks resulted in a 95% (RR=0.05; p<0.0001) and 94% (RR=0.06; p<0.0001) reduction in all bleeds, respectively, compared to no prophylaxis.
Hemlibra prophylaxis every week demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 68% (RR=0.32; p<0.0001) in treated bleeds compared to prior factor VIII prophylaxis based on an intra-patient comparison of people who were previously enrolled in a prospective non-interventional study.
In pooled data from the phase III HAVEN programme (n=373), the most common adverse reactions occurring in 10% or more of people treated with Hemlibra were injection site reactions (20%), joint pain (arthralgia; 15%) and headache (14%).
About HAVEN 4 (NCT03020160)
HAVEN 4 is a single-arm, multicentre, open-label, phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of subcutaneous administration of Hemlibra dosed every four weeks. The study included 48 patients (12 years of age or older) with haemophilia A with or without factor VIII inhibitors who were previously treated with either factor VIII or bypassing agents, on-demand or as prophylaxis. The study was conducted in two parts: a PK run-in and an expansion cohort. All patients in the PK run-in (n=7) were previously treated on-demand and received subcutaneous Hemlibra at 6 mg/kg to fully characterise the PK profile after a single dose during four weeks, followed by 6 mg/kg every four weeks for at least 24 weeks. Patients in the expansion cohort (n=41), patients with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors (n=5) and without factor VIII inhibitors (n=36), received subcutaneous Hemlibra prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for four weeks, followed by 6 mg/kg every four weeks for at least 24 weeks. Episodic treatment of breakthrough bleeds with factor VIII therapy or bypassing agents, depending on a patient’s factor VIII inhibitor status, was allowed per study protocol.
In the HAVEN 4 study, 56.1% (95% CI: 39.7; 71.5) of people with or without factor VIII inhibitors treated with Hemlibra prophylaxis every four weeks experienced zero treated bleeds.
About Hemlibra® (emicizumab)
Hemlibra is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody. It is designed to bring together factor IXa and factor X, proteins required to activate the natural coagulation cascade and restore the blood clotting process for people with haemophilia A.

About haemophilia A
Haemophilia A is an inherited, serious disorder in which a person’s blood does not clot properly, leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding. Haemophilia A affects around 320,000 people worldwide,[1],[2]approximately 50-60% of whom have a severe form of the disorder.[3] People with haemophilia A either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. In a healthy person, when a bleed occurs, factor VIII brings together the clotting factors IXa and X, which is a critical step in the formation of a blood clot to help stop bleeding. Depending on the severity of their disorder, people with haemophilia A can bleed frequently, especially into their joints or muscles.[1] These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility, and long-term joint damage.[4] A serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor VIII replacement therapies.[5] Inhibitors are antibodies developed by the body’s immune system that bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor VIII,[6] making it difficult, if not impossible to obtain a level of factor VIII sufficient to control bleeding.

11276,ï»¿Hoth Therapeutics Signs a License Agreement with UMB and Isoprene Pharmaceuticals,"Hoth Therapeutics Enters into Commercial Licensing Agreement with University of Maryland, Baltimore and Isoprene Pharmaceuticals Inc.","Hoth Therapeutics to get exclusive rights to evaluate UMB’s retinamides (RAMBAs) with an option to license the product to develop & commercialize therapies in the fields of dermatology and oncology 
 The focus of the agreement is to develop UMB’s novel retinamide Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs) therapies for cancer and dermatological diseases
 UMB’s RAMBAs are anticancer agents works against ATRA in cells providing therapeutic benefits to dermatological diseases including acne, eczema, psoriasis, cold sores, wounds, burns, sunburn, ichthyosis, skin cancer, and Kaposi’s Sarcoma","Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: HOTH), a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unique targeted therapeutics for patients suffering from indications such as atopic dermatitis–also known as eczema–as well as dermatological and chronic wound disorders, today announced that Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. (Hoth) has entered into a Commercial Evaluation Sublicense and Option Agreement with the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and Isoprene Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The agreement grants Hoth complete evaluation and option rights in the Dermatology Evaluation Field to develop and commercialize therapeutic compounds for the treatment of dermatological conditions in humans. The licensing agreement stems from results reported by UMB relating to the effect Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs) offer in treating cancer and dermatology related issues. To view the published results of the research, please click here.
Mr. Robb Knie, Chief Executive Officer of Hoth, commented, “We are excited about the opportunity to evaluate these novel retinamides (Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents or RAMBAs) for the treatment of dermatological diseases. The initial work done by the University of Maryland, Baltimore and Isoprene Pharmaceuticals has shown promising therapeutic results, and we look forward to working with these respected institutions as we continue to progress through the trial phase.”
“The partnership between UMB, Isoprene Pharmaceuticals, and Hoth Therapeutics is an example of how early-stage technology investment by UM Ventures, Baltimore can enhance the commercial viability of important new medical innovations emerging from academic research,” said Rana Quraishi, PhD, Director of new ventures at UMB.
“The collaboration between Hoth Therapeutics, University of Maryland, Baltimore, and Isoprene Pharmaceuticals is critical for the development of UMB’s unique novel retinamide small molecules as potential new therapeutics for a variety of dermatological diseases,” said Vincent C.O. Njar, PhD, lead scientific inventor and professor in the University of Maryland School of Medicine.
University of Maryland, Baltimore Findings
Researchers at UMB discovered novel retinamide RAMBAs and validated their therapeutic utility in animal models of breast and prostate cancer. RAMBAs inhibit the cellular enzyme that metabolizes all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which actively directs cells to mature in a controlled manner to ensure normal growth. In addition to enhancing the beneficial effects of ATRA, the mechanism of action for these RAMBAs has been shown to involve degradation of Mnk 1/2 and suppression of the oncogenic eIF4E pathway. For potential use in treating dermatological conditions, UMB researchers obtained promising early results demonstrating that lead retinamide RAMBAs have equal or superior effects over approved retinoids (ATRA and 13-CRA) to inhibit proliferation of normal human adult keratinocytes and sebocytes, and antikeratinizing effects in reconstructed human epidermis. Initial toxicity profiles for a panel of RAMBAs [Njar et al., 2006] also showed good indications for safe therapeutic use.
These novel RAMBAs block the normal metabolism of endogenous ATRA in cells, increasing the beneficial effects of ATRA. They provide a unique approach to achieve the therapeutic benefit of retinoid therapy while potentially circumventing the adverse events associated with it, a very important property for application to dermatology therapy. ATRA deficiencies are associated with dermatological diseases (acne and psoriasis), and retinoid derivatives have been one of the mainstay therapies for acne. Liarozole is in clinical use for the treatment of psoriasis and ichthyosis. Dermatological retinoid deficiencies are characterized by hyperkeratinization and desquamation and include diseases such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, cold sores, wounds, burns, sunburn, ichthyosis, skin cancer, and Kaposi’s Sarcoma, all of which are plausible targets for retinamide RAMBA therapy.
Advantages
Lead compounds show potent in vivo anti-cancer activity
Lead compounds show promise in vitro for treating dermatology conditions
Good oral bioavailability and safety profile
Stage of Development
Oncology: Lead retinamide RAMBA compounds demonstrate potent tumor inhibition in mouse xenograft models of human triple-negative breast cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer [see Refs 2014 – 2015].
Dermatology: Lead retinamide RAMBAs demonstrate antikeratinization and sebosuppressive effects in vitro and in reconstructed human epidermis, with equal or superior effects to currently marketed retinoids, 13-CRA and ATRA [unpublished data].

About Isoprene Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Isoprene Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a cancer therapeutic company developing novel small molecules for the treatment of cancer. It is a UMB New Ventures Initiative start-up founded by the lead scientific inventor, Vincent C.O. Njar, PhD, professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology in the University of Maryland School of Medicine Department of Pharmacology and head of the Medicinal Chemistry Section, Center for Biomolecular Therapeutics (CBT), Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research (IBBR), and the UMB New Ventures Initiative Management Team (see listing of members below).
Isoprene’s lead molecules degrade the mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinases (Mnk 1/2). Mnk 1/2 regulate the cancer-promoting activities of eIF4E via phosphorylation of serine 209 on eIF4E. However, Mnk-mediated phosphorylation of eIF4E is not required for normal eIF4E function. Therefore, preventing phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnks represents an ideal therapeutic target. Isoprene’s approach is to disrupt Mnk-induced eIF4E phosphorylation by degrading Mnks.

11279,ï»¿Merck's Keytruda + Chemotherapy Receive EU's Approval for Metastatic Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),European Commission Approves Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in Combination with Chemotherapy for First-Line Treatment of Adults with Metastatic Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"The approval is based on P-III KEYNOTE-407 study assessing Keytruda + carboplatin/nab paclitaxel vs carboplatin/nab paclitaxel monothx. in ratio (1:1) in patients with msqNSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression 
 The P-III KEYNOTE-407 results: ORR (58% vs 38%); mDOR (7.7mos. vs 4.8mos.); improves PFS with reduction in death (44%), improvement in OS (36%)
 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) 200mg IV is a mAb, used as an anti-D-L1 therapy that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands i.e PD-L1 & PD- L2, further activating T lymphocytes and has received FDA’s approval for the same indication on October 30, 2018","Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the European Commission has approved KEYTRUDA, the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This approval is based on data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial, which demonstrated that KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival (OS) in adults with metastatic squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status, reducing the risk of death by 36 percent compared to chemotherapy alone (HR=0.64 [95% CI, 0.49-0.85]; p=0.0008).
“In KEYNOTE-407, first-line treatment with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in overall survival for patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression,” said Dr. Luis Paz-Ares, chair of the medical oncology department, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, Madrid, Spain. “Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Europe, so this approval marks an important milestone for the patients and families facing this difficult-to-treat type of lung cancer.”
The approval allows marketing of the KEYTRUDA combination in all 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, at the approved dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is also approved in Europe for the:
First-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in adults whose tumors have no EGFR or ALK positive mutations (KEYNOTE-189);
First-line treatment of metastatic squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC as monotherapy in adults whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥50%) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumor mutations (KEYNOTE-024); and
Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen (KEYNOTE-010).
“KEYTRUDA provides a foundation for the treatment of lung cancer in Europe, and this approval expands our first-line combination indications to include adults with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “This is a meaningful treatment advance as an anti-PD-1 combination therapy is now approved in Europe for this type of non-small cell lung cancer. With this approval, more patients with non-small cell lung cancer may have the opportunity to benefit from combination therapy with KEYTRUDA.”
Data Supporting the European Approval
The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-407, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel compared with carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel alone. The dual primary endpoints are OS and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). The study enrolled 559 patients who were randomized (1:1) to receive one of the following treatments via intravenous infusion:

KEYTRUDA 200 mg and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles or nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles, followed by KEYTRUDA 200 mg every three weeks. KEYTRUDA was administered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1.
Placebo and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles or nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles, followed by placebo every 3 weeks.
In KEYNOTE-407, KEYTRUDA in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel significantly improved OS, reducing the risk of death by 36 percent compared to chemotherapy alone (HR=0.64 [95% CI, 0.49-0.85]; p<0.0008). The KEYTRUDA combination also demonstrated improved PFS, with a reduction in the risk of progression or death of 44 percent compared to chemotherapy alone (HR=0.56 [95% CI, 0.45-0.70]; p<0.0001). Among patients who received the KEYTRUDA combination, the ORR was 58 percent (95% CI, 52-64) compared to 38 percent (95% CI, 33-44) for patients who received chemotherapy alone (p<0.0001). The median DOR was 7.7 months (range, 1.1+ to 14.7+ months) for patients who received the KEYTRUDA combination compared to 4.8 months (range, 1.3+ to 15.8+ months) for patients who received chemotherapy alone.
The safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy has been evaluated in 791 patients with NSCLC receiving 200 mg, 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg KEYTRUDA every three weeks, in clinical studies. In this patient population, the most frequent adverse reactions were nausea (49%), anemia (48%), fatigue (38%), constipation (34%), diarrhea (31%), neutropenia (29%), and decreased appetite (28%). Incidences of Grade 3-5 adverse reactions were 67 percent for the KEYTRUDA combination and 66 percent for chemotherapy alone.
About Lung Cancer in Europe (NSCLC)
Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death in Europe and worldwide. In 2018, there were nearly 388,000 deaths from lung cancer in Europe. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85 percent of all cases. There are several subtypes of NSCLC, including adenocarcinoma (accounting for 40% of lung cancers), squamous cell carcinoma (25 to 30%) and large cell carcinoma (10 to 15%).
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 900 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

11297,ï»¿Bayer Reports Results of Nifurtimox in P-III CHICO Study for Chagas Disease in Pediatric Patients,Phase III clinical trial with Bayer’s nifurtimox demonstrates the safety and efficacy of new formulation to treat children with Chagas disease,"TheP-III CHICO study involves assessing of Nifurtimox (120mg/30mg) vs PBO in 330 pediatric patients with acute or chronic Chagas disease across 25 sites including Argentina, Bolivia, and Colombia
 The P-III CHICO study results: met its 1EPs; superior serological response @60days treatment; safe profile at body weight-adjusted dosing
 Nifurtimox (120mg, 30mg) is a nitro heterocyclic compound available as dispersible tablets used for easy division and improvement in weight adjusted dosing in newborns, infants, and children","Largest clinical treatment study to date in pediatric patients with Chagas disease / Easily dividable and dispersible nifurtimox tablet for improved weight-adjusted dosing of newborns, infants, and children
Berlin / Barcelona, – Bayer today presented the results of the CHICO (CHagas disease In Children treated with nifurtimOx) phase III clinical study of nifurtimox in pediatric patients with Chagas disease at the “XV. Taller sobre la enfermedad de Chagas” conference in Barcelona.
CHICO was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, historically controlled phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of nifurtimox in 330 pediatric patients with acute or chronic Chagas disease conducted at 25 investigational sites in Argentina, Bolivia, and Colombia between 2016 and 2018.
The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating the superiority of the 60-day nifurtimox treatment compared with historical placebo control in serological response at one year after end of treatment. In the overall study population, the serological response to a shorter nifurtimox treatment duration of 30 days was lower when compared to the 60-day treatment. Treatment with nifurtimox at body weight-adjusted dosing showed a good safety profile.
“An adequate dispersable formulation of nifurtimox is a big step forward toward achieving the goal of treating all infected children,” said Dr Jaime Altcheh, Head of the Department of Parasitology and Chagas disease at the Ricardo Gutierrez Children’s Hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Coordinating Investigator of the phase III CHICO trial. “Early treatment after infection is very important to prevent manifestation of the disease in adulthood.”
The targets for controlling Chagas disease are eliminating transmission, controlling the vector, treating girls and women at childbearing age (to avoid transplacental transmission), and testing blood prior to transfusion. In addition, the aim is to make healthcare access available for the infected population at all stages of the disease.
The treatment of Chagas disease is based on only two nitroheterocyclic compounds, nifurtimox and benznidazole. To date, nifurtimox has only been available as a 120 mg tablet, which is difficult to administer, especially to younger children. Bayer has now developed a 30 mg tablet. Both tablets are now fast dispersible formulations, which can be easily divided. They can also be rapidly dissolved in water to form a slurry, which can be given to those with difficulties in swallowing tablets. The new formulations were successfully used in CHICO and will improve dosing accuracy, safety, and adherence to treatment in children of all age groups.
“Children are the most vulnerable patient group suffering from Chagas disease. With the successful completion of the CHICO study, an important milestone of our long-standing commitment to improve the treatment of Chagas has been achieved,” said Dr Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG´s Pharmaceutical Division and Head of Research and Development.
The majority of infections are asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases only show minor, flu-like symptoms which appear directly after infection. About two months later, Chagas disease enters a chronic stage that progresses for years, leading to severe organ damage and finally to sudden cardiac death. Education, early diagnosis, and treatment are essential in the fight against Chagas disease.
Today fewer than 1% of people infected with Chagas disease are treated due to low disease awareness and limited access to treatment. Bayer is committed to improving access to nifurtimox by new applications for registrations and making the new formulations available in countries with a high disease burden.
About Chagas disease
Chagas disease is named after Carlos Ribeiro Justiniano Chagas, a Brazilian physician and researcher who discovered the disease in 1909. Chagas is an infectious disease caused by single-cell parasites (trypanosoma) which are transmitted to humans via the feces of kissing bugs or triatomines. Chagas disease can also be transmitted by infected blood transfusions, organ transplantation, or during pregnancy or birth from the infected mother to her unborn child.
Infected patients are mainly present in the endemic countries of Latin America. However, transmission of Chagas disease in non-endemic countries – that is, transmission in countries outside Latin America with exceptional or no vectorial transmission – has emerged since the beginning of the year 2000, linked to local and transnational population movements and notably migration.
One third of people affected develop chronic heart diseases. Others suffer from an abnormal enlargement of the digestive organs or even neurological or mixed alterations. Many die as a result of sudden cardiac arrest or heart failure.
The disease has already been recognized as a global problem: the world’s population movements (i.e. mainly migration) have carried the parasite abroad, mainly to North America and Europe. There it can be transmitted either congenitally, to the offspring of infected mothers, or horizontally via blood or organ donations. In Spain, the European country with the highest prevalence of Chagas disease, the estimated number of patients is 48,000 to 96,000 cases.
Bayer and Chagas disease
Although one quarter of the Latin American population is at risk of contracting the disease, Chagas is still called a “forgotten disease”, but even more it is a “silent disease” as it had remained “hidden” for years or even decades due to lack of specific symptoms.
For a long time there were no means of treating Chagas disease effectively. It was only in the 1960s that large-scale studies with nifurtimox proved its efficacy. The compound, discovered by Bayer in Wuppertal, Germany, was first introduced under the brand name Lampit® in Argentina in 1970, and shortly afterwards in other South American countries.
The recommended treatment with Lampit® currently takes between about 60 to 90 days and should not exceed 120 days using the 120 mg tablet formulation. Lampit® is on the WHO’s lists of “Essential Medicines” for both adults and children.
In 2002 the World Health Organization (WHO) and Bayer combined their strengths in the fight against Chagas disease. Since then, Bayer has been providing WHO with Lampit® free of charge, combined with financial resources for logistics and distribution. More recently Bayer has also contributed toward disease awareness programs, education and training as well as surveillance activities.
As the originator of nifurtimox and as a signatory of the ”London Declaration on NTDs” of 2012, Bayer takes responsibility for making the drug available for as long as it takes to eliminate Chagas disease.
The fight against Chagas disease poses a special challenge, as it has turned from an endemic disease in Latin America to a global public health threat. The control of the disease by screening programs, access to treatment and vector control are important measures on the path of eliminating the disease by 2030.
A prerequisite to achieve this goal is that all stakeholders in an aligned approach step up their efforts and contributions. This was concluded by all partners at the first Chagas Stakeholder Meetings with PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) and WHO in 2018.
Bayer is a dedicated partner in this network. The decision to joining the Global Chagas Coalition in 2018 was a clear endorsement of the company’s special emphasis to fight Chagas disease.

11303,Roche's MabThera (rituximab) Receives EU's Approval for Rare Autoimmune Disease Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV),European Commission approves Roche’s MabThera (rituximab) for a rare autoimmune disease,"The EU approval is based on P-III Ritux 3 study assessing MabThera + oral Corticosteroids (CS) vs CS as monothx.in patients with 1L moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV) in France
 The P-III Ritux 3 study results: met its 1EPs; achieved complete remission @24mos.; remission @2mos. (89.5% vs 27.8%); published in The Lancet in Mar’17
 MabThera (Rituxan in the US) is a novel mAb target cancer cells with CD20 marker on their surface in patients with severe active RA in combination with methotrexate and is approved in the US in Jun’18 for PV","MabThera is the first biologic treatment approved for moderate to severe cases of the rare autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV), and the first major advancement in the treatment of the disease in more than 60 years
PV is a rare and potentially life-threatening blistering condition which can cause severe pain and disfigurement
MabThera is now approved in Europe to treat four autoimmune diseases
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the European Commission has approved MabThera® (rituximab) for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a rare condition characterised by progressive painful blistering of the skin and/or mucous membranes.[1] Extensive blistering can lead to serious, life-threatening fluid loss, infection and/or death.[2]
MabThera is the first biologic therapy approved by the European Commission for PV and the first major advancement in the treatment of the disease in more than 60 years. Following approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2018 and today’s decision, MabThera is now approved to treat four autoimmune diseases in the US and Europe.
“We’re pleased to bring the first biologic medicine to the more than 50,000 people in Europe suffering from pemphigus vulgaris,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “This MabThera approval provides a much needed new treatment that has been shown to provide higher remission rates than corticosteroids alone, which can cause debilitating side effects.”
The European approval is based on data from the phase III Ritux 3 trial, a Roche-supported randomised controlled study, conducted in France, which evaluated MabThera plus a tapering regimen of oral corticosteroids (CS) compared to a standard dose of CS alone, as a first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed moderate to severe pemphigus. The primary endpoint of the study was complete remission at month 24 without the use of CS for two or more months. The study demonstrated that 89.5% of people with PV treated with MabThera, in combination with short-term oral CS treatment, achieved complete remission without the use of CS for two or more months, compared to 27.8% of people with PV receiving CS alone, the current standard of care.[3] The results of the Ritux 3 trial were published in The Lancet in March 2017.[4]
The Roche-sponsored phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind PEMPHIX study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of MabThera compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an immunosuppressant, in patients with moderate to severe PV, is ongoing.[5]
Recently, an international panel of experts, the International Bullous Disease Group, published new recommendations on the diagnosis and management of pemphigus in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, and recommended the use of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, such as MabThera combined with a tapering regimen of oral CS, as a first-line therapy option for moderate to severe pemphigus.[6]

About pemphigus vulgaris
Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune, blistering disease, occurring within the epidermis, affecting the skin and mucous membranes.[1] It is the most common type of a group of autoimmune disorders collectively called pemphigus.[2] It is estimated that around three in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with this disease globally.[7]

About the Ritux 3 trial
Ritux 3 is a Roche-supported phase III, prospective, multicentre, parallel-group, open-label randomised trial (NCT00784589), conducted in France by the French Study Group on Autoimmune Bullous Diseases. It was designed to evaluate MabThera plus a tapering regimen of oral corticosteroid (CS) treatment compared to a standard dose of CS monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed moderate to severe pemphigus.[4] The primary endpoint of the study was complete remission at month 24 without the use of corticosteroids for two or more months.

About the PEMPHIX study
A phase III, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, parallel-arm multicentre study (PEMPHIX, NCT02383589), designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MabThera compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an immunosuppressant, in patients with moderate to severe active pemphigus vulgaris requiring 60-120 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent).[5]

About MabThera/Rituxan
MabThera (Rituxan in the US) in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies. MabThera/Rituxan, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s, GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). People with serious infections should not receive MabThera/Rituxan. It is not known if MabThera/Rituxan is safe or effective in children.

11308,ï»¿Abbott's MitraClip Device Receives FDA's Expanded Indication Approval for Secondary Mitral Regurgitation (MR),Abbott Receives FDA Approval for Expanded Indication for Mitraclip Device,"The approval is based on COAPT study assessing MitraClip + medical therapy vs medical therapy as monothx. in 614 patients with moderate to severe secondary MR across 78sites including the US & Canada
 The COAPT study resulted in meting its 1EPs & 10 2EPs with the reduction in hospitalization & mortality 47% & 38% respectively
 Abbott’s MitraClip is a novel transcatheter clip-based mitral valve intervention therapy & has received FDA’s approval in 2013 for reducing mitral regurgitation","Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a new, expanded indication to its leading MitraClip™ device used to repair a leaky mitral valve without open-heart surgery. Supported by the results of the landmark COAPT™ Trial, MitraClip is the first transcatheter mitral valve intervention therapy approved to treat select heart failure patients with clinically significant secondary, or functional, mitral regurgitation (MR).
The MitraClip transcatheter clip-based therapy, available in the U.S. since 2013 and now on a third generation of product innovations, has been used to treat more than 80,000 patients worldwide over the last 10 years. The new, expanded indication addresses the secondary form of MR and significantly increases the amount of people with MR able to be treated with MitraClip. Based on this approval, Abbott will begin discussions with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and physician specialty societies to request a revision to the national coverage determination (NCD) that would expand Medicare coverage to include secondary MR patients.
“Since severe secondary MR is extremely difficult to manage and associated with a poor prognosis, people have historically had few options,” said Neil Moat, M.D., chief medical officer of Abbott’s structural heart business. “The expanded indication of MitraClip opens new doors for these ailing patients and can improve their quality of life and chance of survival despite their complex condition.”
Approximately four million Americans suffer from MR, specifically one in 10 adults age 75 and older.i,ii,iii,iv It’s estimated two to three times as many patients may benefit from MitraClip treatment for secondary MR as a result of underlying heart failure than those treated for the primary (or degenerative) form of the disease associated with the structure of the valve.v People with heart failure may develop secondary MR when the left chamber of the heart becomes enlarged, preventing the mitral leaflets from closing normally and allowing blood to flow backwards through the heart.vi 
Significant secondary MR can lead to reduced quality of life, recurrent hospitalizations and decreased survival.vii,viii Medication alone is the current standard of care for most heart failure patients with secondary MR, but this approach only helps manage the symptoms and does not address the underlying cause. MitraClip is now an effective treatment option for these ailing patients.
The MitraClip device repairs MR without open-heart surgery and is delivered to the heart through a small incision in the leg. The device clips portions of the leaflets, or flaps, of the mitral valve together to reduce the backflow of blood, restoring the heart’s ability to pump oxygenated blood more efficiently. MitraClip provides almost immediate symptom relief and patients are released from the hospital on average after two days.
“Over the past decade, we have made significant and consistent investments to lead the development of novel treatments for mitral valve disease,” said Michael Dale, vice president of Abbott’s structural heart business. “The expanded indication for MitraClip is a direct result of the dedication of our employees as well as our remarkable clinical investigators.”
Abbott is the global leader in developing transcatheter mitral valve technologies as alternatives to open-heart surgery. Building upon its success with the MitraClip device and many years of mitral valve experience and clinical evidence, Abbott is leading the way in novel, transcatheter devices by investing in the development of new mitral valve replacement options with its Tendyne and Cephea valve technologies.
About the COAPT Trial
The COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation) Trial investigated MitraClip for treating secondary MR, and the data add to more than 10 years of evidence on the use of MitraClip for treating both primary and secondary MR. While the secondary MR indication has just been received in the U.S., the device has treated patients outside of the U.S. with both forms of the disease. COAPT met both primary and all 10 secondary endpoints as presented during the TCT cardiology meeting in Sept. 2018, showing a 47 percent relative reduction in hospitalizations and a 38 percent relative reduction in mortality.
The meaningful results showed that MitraClip was superior to medical therapy in reducing hospitalization and death for patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation. In the COAPT Trial, 614 symptomatic heart failure patients with moderate-to-severe or severe secondary MR were randomized to receive treatment with MitraClip plus guideline-directed medical therapy or guideline-directed medical therapy alone at 78 sites in the U.S. and Canada. The primary efficacy endpoint was all heart failure hospitalizations through two years, and the primary safety endpoint was freedom from device-related complications at one year compared to a performance goal of 88 percent.

 The focus of the agreement is to get benefit from AbCellera’s Ab discovery technology and development of vaccines with the improvement in QoL
 AbCellera’s single-cell screening technology is a combination of live-cell assays to develop therapies for targets such as membrane proteins, GPCRs and ion channels in multiple therapy areas. In 2017, AbCellera collaborated with Gates Foundation to discover mAb against 10 biomarkers associated with tuberculosis","AbCellera today announced a two-year agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help accelerate global health research. The funding, totaling $4.8 M, will support a series of scientific collaborations between AbCellera and Gates Foundation-funded scientists working on the prevention and treatment of high-priority infectious diseases. The target diseases – including HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis – infect hundreds of millions of people annually and disproportionately impact developing countries. Research projects will benefit from AbCellera’s industry-leading capabilities in human antibody discovery and immune repertoire profiling to accelerate the development of vaccines and antibody-based treatments for use in global health.
“At its best, the biotech industry is driven by a passion for science and a genuine desire to improve the human condition. We are grateful for the opportunity to join forces with some of the world’s most accomplished researchers in the fight against infectious diseases, an area that is so often overlooked due to a lack of funding and economic incentives,” said Carl Hansen, CEO of AbCellera. “We believe AbCellera’s human antibody discovery capabilities will have a catalytic role in the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and antibody therapies for improved global health.”
This is the second collaboration between the two organizations. In 2017, AbCellera worked with the Gates Foundation on the discovery of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies against 10 biomarkers associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis. The resulting antibodies were instrumental in the successful development of high-sensitivity diagnostic tests.
The collaborations funded under the present agreement will benefit from AbCellera’s new technology capabilities for deep profiling of antibody responses. In August 2018, AbCellera announced the acquisition of Lineage Biosciences, a spinout company that pioneered the use of next-generation sequencing technology (Rep-Seq) to capture the full diversity of antibodies generated by natural immune responses. Rep-Seq complements the unique functional information obtained from AbCellera’s single-cell discovery platform, increasing the diversity of antibodies identified and enabling a more rational vaccine design.
“We’re thrilled to be working with the Gates Foundation again in such a critical area of global health,” said Kevin Heyries, Ph.D., Head of Business Development at AbCellera. “Because our platform can screen millions of single B cells per day, allowing us to identify rare and highly-potent antibodies from patient samples, the resulting fully-human antibodies can be used for the prevention of deadly diseases for which vaccine development has proven difficult. It’s a fresh approach to tackling humankind’s oldest infectious adversaries.”

11325,BMS Reports Positive Results of Eliquis (apixaban) in P-IV AUGUSTUS Study for NVAF/ACS/PCI,AUGUSTUS Demonstrates Favorable Safety Results of Eliquis Versus Vitamin K Antagonists in Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome and/or Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,"The P-IV AUGUSTUS study involves assessing of Eliquis (apixaban) vs vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) & aspirin vs PBO in 4,614 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS) & undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with P2Y12 inhibitor with or without aspirin
 The P-IV AUGUSTUS study results: low mortality rate (23.5% vs 27.4% & 26.2% vs 24.7%); ischemic events (6.7% vs 7.1% & 6.5% vs 7.3%); CRNM bleeding (10.5% vs 14.7% & 16.1% vs. 9.0%)
 Eliquis (apixaban,5mg/2.5mg, q2d) is an oral anticoagulant targeting factor Xa inhibitor to prevent thromboembolic event and has received FDA’s approval on December 28, 2012 & August 21, 2014 for atrial fibrillation & recurring DVT and PE respectively","AUGUSTUS is the largest trial in this high-risk patient population requiring both anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies
PRINCETON, N.J. & NEW YORK–The Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance today announced results from the Phase 4 AUGUSTUS trial evaluating Eliquis ® (apixaban) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Results show that in patients receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor with or without aspirin (antiplatelet therapies), the proportion of patients with major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding at six months was significantly lower for those treated with Eliquis compared to those treated with a VKA (10.5% vs. 14.7%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-0.81; p-superiority<0.001). These data are featured as a late-breaking oral presentation at the American College of Cardiology’s (ACC) 68th Annual Scientific Session 2019 in New Orleans, LA (Abstract 405-08) and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
AUGUSTUS, which evaluated 4,614 patients, is an open-label, prospective, randomized clinical trial designed to assess two independent hypotheses:

Whether or not Eliquis 5mg* twice daily is non-inferior or superior to VKAs for the outcome of major or CRNM bleeding, as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), in patients with NVAF and recent ACS and/or undergoing PCI with planned concomitant antiplatelet therapy (a P2Y12 inhibitor with or without low-dose aspirin).
Whether or not single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor is superior to dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor and low-dose aspirin for the outcome of ISTH major or CRNM bleeding in patients with NVAF and recent ACS and/or undergoing PCI and planned concomitant anticoagulant therapy (either Eliquis 5mg* twice daily or VKA).
*2.5mg twice daily if patients met two or more of the following dose-reduction criteria: age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg or creatinine ≥ 1.5mg/dL (133 micromol/L).
Independent of the Eliquis versus VKA comparison, results also showed that in patients receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor and an anticoagulant, the proportion of patients with major or CRNM bleeding at six months was significantly higher for those receiving aspirin compared to those receiving placebo (16.1% vs. 9.0%, respectively; HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.59-2.24; p<0.001).
Please note that Eliquis increases the risk of bleeding compared with placebo and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Please see below for Important Safety Information, including information from the APPRAISE-2 clinical trial that was terminated early due to higher rates of bleeding for apixaban compared to placebo in post-ACS patients without an indication for oral anticoagulant.1
“Due to concern for major bleeding, there have been ongoing questions about treating non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention,” said Renato D. Lopes, M.D., M.H.S, Ph.D., Director, Clinical Events Classification, Duke Clinical Research Institute and Principal Investigator of AUGUSTUS. “Results from this study provide additional information for physicians treating these high-risk patients.”
The investigators also analyzed the pre-defined secondary composite outcomes of death or hospitalization and death or ischemic events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, definite or probable stent thrombosis or urgent revascularization). At six months, patients receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor with or without aspirin who were treated with Eliquis had lower rates of death or hospitalization (23.5% vs. 27.4%, respectively; HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74-0.93; p=0.002) and similar rates of death or ischemic events (6.7% vs. 7.1%, respectively; HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.75-1.16; p=NS) compared to those assigned to VKA. Patients receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor and an anticoagulant who were treated with aspirin had similar rates of death or hospitalization (26.2% vs. 24.7%, respectively; HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.96-1.21; p=NS) and similar rates of death or ischemic events (6.5% vs. 7.3%, respectively; HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.71-1.11) compared to those assigned to placebo.
“The AUGUSTUS trial evaluated antithrombotic regimens for the often difficult-to-treat non-valvular atrial fibrillation patient population that presents with acute coronary syndrome and/or receives percutaneous coronary intervention,” said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine, Pfizer. “These findings add to evidence from previous studies that demonstrate the safety profile of Eliquis versus a vitamin K antagonist in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.”
Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in the world, affecting an estimated 33 million people in 2010.2 It is estimated that approximately 20-to-30 percent of people with atrial fibrillation also have concomitant coronary artery disease,3,4 which may result in ACS or require PCI. Additionally, five-to-ten percent of patients who undergo PCI have atrial fibrillation.5,6,7,8 While oral anticoagulants and dual antiplatelet therapy help reduce the risk of stroke and recurrent ischemic events, respectively, the combination leads to an increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, additional research has been needed to help inform antithrombotic regimens available for these high-risk patients.
“Advancing care for patients at risk for stroke due to non-valvular atrial fibrillation is a key focus of the BMS-Pfizer Alliance,” said Christoph Koenen, M.D., Head of Cardiovascular Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “The AUGUSTUS trial represents our ongoing commitment to understanding anticoagulation among higher-risk patients.”
About AUGUSTUS
AUGUSTUS is an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial with a two-by-two factorial design to compare Eliquis (apixaban) with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and aspirin with placebo in 4,614 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and are receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least six months. The treatment regimen comparing Eliquis with VKA was open-label; however, the regimen comparing aspirin with aspirin placebo was double blind. Patients were evaluated for eligibility during their ACS and/or PCI hospitalization. 37.3 percent of patients included in the study had ACS undergoing PCI, 23.9 percent of patients had medically-managed ACS and 38.8 percent of patients underwent elective PCI. The primary outcome is the composite of major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH).9 A key secondary outcome is the composite of death or first hospitalization. Other secondary outcomes include the composite of death or ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, definite or probable stent thrombosis or urgent revascularization). AUGUSTUS was designed to be a safety study and did not include a primary efficacy endpoint.
About Atrial Fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) refers to cases in which the AF occurs in the absence of rheumatic mitral valve disease, a prosthetic heart valve, or mitral valve repair. It was estimated that in 2014, 6.4 million people in the U.S. and in 2010, over six million individuals in Europe, had AF. The lifetime risk of AF is estimated to be approximately 25 percent for individuals 40 years of age or older. One of the most serious medical concerns for individuals with AF is the increased risk of stroke, which is five times higher in people with AF than those without AF. Additionally, AF-related strokes tend to be more severe than other strokes with an associated 30-day mortality rate of 24 percent and a 50 percent likelihood of death within one year.
About Acute Coronary Syndrome
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a term used to describe situations in which the blood supplied to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, and includes myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a heart attack, and unstable angina (sudden, severe chest pain that typically occurs when a person is at rest). ACS affects an estimated 1.4 million people in the U.S. and an estimated 1.38 million people in Europe. ACS is a subcategory of coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common type of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular diseases are the number-one cause of death worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, CAD alone resulted in 7.4 million deaths during 2012.
About Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure used to open blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. Angioplasty also is used as an emergency procedure during a heart attack. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 500,000 PCIs performed annually in the U.S. alone.
About Eliquis
Eliquis (apixaban) is an oral selective Factor Xa inhibitor. By inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis decreases thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is approved for multiple indications in the U.S. based on efficacy and safety data from multiple Phase 3 clinical trials. Eliquis is a prescription medicine indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF); for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery; for the treatment of DVT and PE; and to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, following initial therapy.

ELIQUIS Important Safety Information

WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

(A)

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant.

(B)

Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

•

use of indwelling epidural catheters

•

concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants

•

a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures

•

a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery

•

optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures

•

is not known

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary.

Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Active pathological bleeding
Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (e.g., anaphylactic reactions)
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant.
Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding.
Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding, including aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.
Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage.
The anticoagulant effect of apixaban can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. Please visit www.andexxa.com for more information on availability of a reversal agent.
Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture: Patients treated with ELIQUIS undergoing spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture may develop an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.
Monitor patients frequently and if neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Physicians should consider the potential benefit versus the risk of neuraxial intervention in ELIQUIS patients.
Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in these patients.
Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy: Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS were related to bleeding.
TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.
DRUG INTERACTIONS

Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. For patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose of ELIQUIS by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Clarithromycin
Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggest that no dose adjustment is necessary with concomitant administration with ELIQUIS.

Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban.
Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo.
PREGNANCY CATEGORY B

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and fetus.

11336,Alcon to Acquire PowerVision for $285M,"Alcon Announces Acquisition of PowerVision, Inc.","Alcon acquires PowerVision, in all stock transaction paying $285M to PowerVision with additional payment based on regulatory & commercial milestones expected to initiate in 2023
 The focus of the acquisition is to expand Alcon’s ophthalmic portfolio by using PowerVision’sadvanced technology intraocular lenses (AT-IOLS) to deliver therapies cataract surgery patients desiring spectacle independence
 PowerVision’s AT-IOLS is used to develop fluid-based accommodating intraocular lenses that utilize eye’s natural accommodating response in presbyopia providing near & intermediate vision","Acquisition demonstrates Alcon’s commitment to driving growth and innovation in advanced technology intraocular lenses (AT-IOLS) to meet the needs of cataract surgery patients who desire spectacle independence
US-based PowerVision, Inc. was formed to develop fluid-based accommodating intraocular lenses for cataract surgery patients 
Fluid-based intraocular lens utilizes the eye’s natural accommodative response to provide near and intermediate vision, in addition to distance vision commonly provided by basic IOLs
Fort Worth, Texas, – Alcon, the global leader in eye care and a division of Novartis, announced today that it has acquired PowerVision, Inc., a privately-held, US-based medical device development company focused on creating fluid-based intraocular lens implants.
The acquisition furthers Alcon’s commitment to bring this innovative, accommodating lens to cataract patients throughout the world.
Commercial availability of PowerVision’s IOL technology will be determined following significant additional development and clinical trials of the intraocular lens.
“As the industry leader in cataract surgery, we’re eager to accelerate development of this potentially breakthrough accommodating lens technology,” said Michael Onuscheck, President of Global Business and Innovation. “By treating cataracts and restoring natural, continuous range of vision, this intraocular lens may be the preferred IOL for cataract surgery patients who desire spectacle independence.”
PowerVision’s unique lens design utilizes the eye’s natural accommodating response to transport fluid in the intraocular lens which is implanted in the eye’s capsular bag. While most presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses use a multifocal design that distributes light between different focal points, PowerVision’s groundbreaking fluid-based design creates a continuously variable monofocal lens, utilizing the natural contraction of the eye’s muscles. This technology allows the patient to actively focus on objects, just as the natural crystalline lens does in a youthful eye, providing patients with a natural, continuous range of vision.
“We’re thrilled to officially join Alcon and its pioneering history of launching new innovation in the field of ophthalmology,” said Barry Cheskin, President and CEO and Co-Founder of PowerVision. “We look forward to bringing this innovative IOL technology to eye care providers and customers in the years ahead.”
While basic, monofocal IOLs are most commonly used for cataract surgery, AT-IOLs, including those that correct presbyopia, are improving patient outcomes and fulfilling desire among patients for spectacle independence. Alcon leads the industry in global IOL share and estimates double-digit growth in AT-IOLs, largely driven by new innovations.
Under the terms of the agreement, Alcon paid USD 285 million to PowerVision at closing with additional payments based on specified regulatory and commercial milestones starting in 2023. Alcon is maintaining its 2023 financial outlook provided at the Capital Markets Days in the fourth quarter of 2018.
About Cataracts
A cataract is a clouding of the natural lens of the eye that affects vision. As a cataract develops, the eye’s lens gradually becomes hard and cloudy which scatters light rays and allows less light to pass through, which makes it more difficult to see. The vast majority of cataracts happen as a result of normal aging but radiation exposure, taking steroids, diabetes, and eye trauma can accelerate the development of cataracts. Additionally, cataracts can be hereditary and congenital and can present shortly after birth.1 Cataracts are the most common age-related eye condition and the leading cause of preventable blindness in adults 55 and older in the US.2 Twenty million people age 40 and older have cataracts in the US alone.3 Cataracts are treated by surgically removing the eye’s cloudy natural lens and replacing it with an intraocular lens (IOL). More than 98 percent of cataract surgeries are considered successful and patients can usually return to their normal routines within 24 hours.4
About Presbyopia 
Presbyopia is an eye condition that occurs as part of natural aging. It involves the gradual loss of the eye’s ability to actively focus on close objects, such as smart phones, computers, books and menus.5 The first signs of presbyopia are eyestrain, difficulty seeing up close in dim light and problems focusing on small objects and/or fine print. Once a person is in their 40s, it is likely they will experience presbyopia and will require vision correction such as reading glasses or multifocal contact lenses.

11341,ï»¿Novartis Reports Results of Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) in PIONEER-HF 4-Week Extension Study for Systolic Heart Failure,Novartis late-breaking data further support initiation of Entresto in hospital and as a first-choice systolic heart failure therapy in stabilized patients,"The PIONEER-HF 4-week extension study involves assessing Entresto vs Enalapril in ~832 patients with systolic heart failure treated with Entresto for the first 8 wks.& the last 4wks and with enalapril and then switched to Entresto for the last 4wks.
 The PIONEER-HF 4-week extension study results: change in NT-proBNP (-18.5% vs -35.8%); symptomatic hypotension (2.9% vs 3.9%); hyperkalemia (2.4% vs 4.1%); Worsening renal function (8.6% vs 9.6%); no angioedema events; @12 wks. relative risk reduction 33%
 Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan, bid, 50/100/200 mg) is a heart failure therapy used to reduce the strain on failing heart by improving neurohormonal systems and inhibiting the effect of overactive RAAS","Outcomes from PIONEER-HF 4-week open-label extension reinforce initial 8-week findings, showing Entresto® (sacubitril/valsartan) continued to deliver reductions in NT-proBNP, an established biomarker for heart failure severity and prognosis(1)

– In-hospital initiation of Entresto, compared to enalapril, resulted in reduction in an exploratory serious clinical outcomes endpoint from week 8 to week 12(1)

– Safety and tolerability at 12 weeks were comparable for patients who began Entresto in the hospital and those who switched from enalapril at 8 weeks(1)

– Findings further substantiate benefits of Entresto and suggest that initiating Entresto in patients stabilized after an acute decompensation event may avoid subsequent serious clinical composite events(1)

 
EAST HANOVER, N.J.,- Novartis announced today new results from a 4-week extension of the landmark PIONEER-HF trial, presented as a late-breaker at the American College of Cardiology’s 68th Annual Scientific Session. Data from the 8-week double-blind PIONEER-HF trial, first presented in November 2018 at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, showed the benefits of in-hospital initiation in appropriate stabilized patients of Entresto tablets on a systolic heart failure (HF) biomarker, safety and clinical outcome.2
All patients received open-label Entresto during the 4-week extension period, and data showed reductions in both groups in the HF biomarker N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with use of Entresto, which was safe and well tolerated.1 Patients in the control group who were treated during the initial 8-week double-blind period with a HF therapy, enalapril, showed a substantial reduction in NT-proBNP when switched to Entresto for the open-label period.1 Further, patients who started on Entresto in the hospital had a greater overall reduction in NT-proBNP after 12 weeks, compared with patients started on enalapril in the hospital and switched to Entresto at the 8-week mark.1
In addition, the greater improvement in a pre-specified, exploratory post-discharge outcome at 8 weeks with Entresto was maintained throughout 12 weeks, suggesting that initiating Entresto after stabilization following an acute systolic HF admission may result in a reduction in a composite of serious clinical events.1,2
The serious clinical composite occurred in a lower percentage of patients who initiated Entresto in the hospital compared with those who initiated enalapril in the hospital and switched to Entresto after 8 weeks post-discharge.1 The composite, which was explored as part of a pre-specified exploratory analysis, consisted of death, re-hospitalization for HF (hospital stay >24 hours), requirement for a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) insertion, or listing for a cardiac transplantation.1
“The evidence generated through the Entresto clinical trial program, which includes PIONEER-HF, TRANSITION-HF and PARADIGM-HF, contributes to the reimagining of heart failure treatment,” said Marcia Kayath, MD, Head, U.S. Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “Data from this 4-week extension of PIONEER-HF clearly support Entresto as a first-choice treatment upon systolic heart failure diagnosis or worsening of symptoms and underscore the importance of initiating Entresto in the hospital.”
Patients with systolic HF who need to be admitted to the hospital due to decompensation of their disease are at high short-term risk of death or being re-admitted to the hospital.3,4 PIONEER-HF showed that Entresto can be initiated in the hospital in these patients safely, once they have been stabilized, with a tolerability profile comparable to enalapril.2 The safety profile in PIONEER-HF was similar to that seen in the pivotal PARADIGM-HF trial.2,5 Rates of symptomatic hypotension (low blood pressure), hyperkalemia (elevated levels of potassium) or worsening renal (kidney) function were similar among treatment groups and there was a numerically lower incidence of angioedema in patients treated with Entresto.2 There were no new safety signals identified during the 4-week extension of PIONEER-HF.1
“This extension of the landmark PIONEER-HF study further demonstrates that starting appropriate patients on Entresto in the hospital is safe and provides important clinical benefit compared to starting patients on enalapril. We now know that initiating Entresto in the hospital, instead of waiting to switch post-discharge, can improve outcomes and can keep more of an especially vulnerable patient population out of the hospital longer,” said Eugene Braunwald, MD, Founding Chairman, TIMI Study Group, Brigham & Women’s Hospital; Distinguished Hershey Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School; and Chariman, PIONEER-HF.
Entresto is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death or HF hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.6
About the PIONEER-HF 4-Week Extension Study
Of 881 systolic heart failure patients enrolled in PIONEER-HF, 832 (94%) continued into the 4-week open-label study after the 8-week initial study period, with 415 (50%) switched from enalapril to Entresto and 417 (50%) continued on Entresto at the time of the open-label extension.1 All patients had been admitted for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and started on study drug following stabilization, while still hospitalized.1 The objectives were to describe changes in NT-proBNP by randomized treatment arm and to collect further safety and exploratory clinical data in both groups.1
Change in NT-proBNP from week 8 to week 12 was -18.5%, (95% CI: -11.8, -24.7) in patients who had been on Entresto during the original 8-week study period and remained on Entresto for the 4-week extension and -35.8% (95% CI: -30.6, -40.7) in patients who had been given enalapril during the original 8-week study period and then switched to Entresto for 4 weeks.1 In the 8-week double-blind period, as previously reported, from baseline to weeks 4 and 8, the time-averaged ratio of change was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.81; p<0.001) in the group treated with Entresto compared to the group treated with enalapril.2
Safety and tolerability analyses found during weeks 8-12:

Similar levels of symptomatic hypotension in both arms: 2.9% for patients who were on Entresto for the first 8 weeks and continued on Entresto for the last 4 weeks compared to 3.9% for patients randomized to enalapril and then switched to Entresto for the last 4 weeks (RR 0.75; 95% CI:0.36, 1.56).1
Hyperkalemia was comparable between the two groups: 2.4% for patients who were on Entresto for the first 8 weeks and continued on Entresto for the last 4 weeks compared to 4.1% for patients randomized to enalapril and then switched to Entresto for the last 4 weeks (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.27, 1.26)1
Worsening renal function was comparable between the two groups: 8.6% for patients who were on Entresto for the first 8 weeks and continued on Entresto for the last 4 weeks compared to 9.6% for patients randomized to enalapril and then switched to Entresto for the last 4 weeks (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.37).1
There were no additional angioedema events in either arm.1
56.8% of patients in the study were receiving the highest approved dose of Entresto and 75.2% were receiving at least the middle dose recommended in the package insert by 12 weeks.1
Over the 12-week study, in total, there was a 33% relative risk reduction (95% CI: 0.48, 0.94) in the serious clinical composite event endpoint in the patients treated and maintained with Entresto compared to those patients started on enalapril and then switched to Entresto for the 4-week open-label phase.1 The absolute risk reduction was 5.64%.1 During the initial 8-week period, the serious clinical composite endpoint reduction was known to have been driven by a reduction in HF hospitalization and death.2
About the PIONEER-HF Trial
PIONEER-HF is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of in-hospital initiation of Entresto compared with enalapril in appropriate, stable HFrEF patients who had been admitted for acute decompensation.2,7
The study enrolled patients 18 years of age and older with ejection fraction (EF) ≤40% and an elevated amino terminal-pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) ≥1600 pg/mL or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥400 pg/mL, irrespective of both duration of diagnosis or treatment with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).2,7
A total of 881 patients, with an average age of 61 years, were randomly assigned to in-hospital initiation of Entresto or enalapril twice daily, following stabilization.2,7 Patients were eligible for screening no earlier than 24 hours and up to 10 days from initial presentation while still hospitalized.2,7 All patients were treated with the objective to optimize therapy to the maximum tolerated dose based on an SBP-based algorithm.2,7 Patients were predominantly male (approximately 72%), and half of patients had a BMI>30 kg/m2.2,7 Notably, more than one-third of patients (36%) were African American.2,7 Approximately 34% of patients were newly diagnosed, having no prior history of heart failure, and slightly more than 50% of patients were not receiving ACEi/ARB therapy at the time of admission.2,7
The primary endpoint was the time-averaged proportional change in NT-proBNP from baseline through weeks 4 and 8.2,7 Patients treated with Entresto achieved a 47% reduction from baseline in time-averaged NT-proBNP, compared to a 25% reduction with enalapril, translating into a statistically significant 29% greater reduction with Entresto over the ACE inhibitor (95% CI: 0.63, 0.81; P<0.0001).2 Reductions in NT-proBNP were observed in Entresto patients as early as 1 week after treatment initiation.2 Rates of serious adverse events occurring with a frequency of ≥0.5% were similar between the Entresto and enalapril groups.2
Safety and tolerability analyses found during the double-blind period:

Similar levels of symptomatic hypotension in both arms (enalapril 12.7%, Entresto 15.0%; RR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.64). Low BP-related AEs were similar between the groups.2
Hyperkalemia was comparable between the two groups (enalapril 9.3% vs. Entresto 11.6% RR: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.84).2
Kidney-related AEs between the groups were similar (enalapril n= 75, Entresto n=75, RR: 1.00; CI: 0.75, 1.34).2
There were 6 (1.4%) adjudicated cases of angioedema in the enalapril arm (all in African Americans) versus 1 (0.2%) with Entresto (in a Caucasian patient) (RR: 0.17; CI: 0.02, 1.38).2
Nearly 60% of patients were able to be up-titrated to the highest approved dose of Entresto within 6 weeks.2
In a pre-specified exploratory analysis, the composite endpoint of death, re-hospitalization for HF, requirement for a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) insertion, or listing for cardiac transplant occurred in 41 (9.3%) patients in the Entresto group and 74 (16.8%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.37–0.79) during the double-blind period.2 The benefit was driven by reductions in death and re-hospitalization among patients treated with Entresto.2
About Heart Failure and Hospitalization
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic and progressive condition, which impacts 6.2 million Americans and is the leading cause of hospitalization among Americans over the age of 65.8,9 Rates of heart failure in America are increasing, despite significant medical advances.10 It is expected that by 2030 more than 8 million people will have this condition.10 About half of people with HF have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), also known as systolic HF.11,12 Reduced ejection fraction means the heart does not contract with enough force, so less blood is pumped out.13 HF presents a major and growing health-economic burden that currently exceeds $30 billion in the United States, which accounts for both direct and indirect costs.10
HF accounts for ~900,000 hospitalizations annually in the U.S., approximately 2 hospitalizations every minute.8 Eighty-three percent of HF patients are hospitalized due to an acute HF episode at least once, and nearly half (43%) are hospitalized at least four times.11 Outlook for patients in first 30 days following hospitalization is poor, with one in four re-admitted during this vulnerable period and up to 10% likely to die.3,4 On average, a HF patient remains in hospital for five to 10 days.14
Novartis has established the largest global clinical program in the HF disease area across the pharma industry to date. Known as FortiHFy, it is comprised of more than 40 active or planned clinical studies designed to generate an array of additional data on symptom reduction, efficacy, quality of life benefits and real-world evidence with Entresto, as well as to extend understanding of heart failure.
About Entresto
Entresto is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of CV death and HF hospitalization in people with certain types of long-lasting (chronic) heart failure.6 Entresto is usually used with other heart failure therapies, in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or other angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy.6 Entresto is a twice-a-day prescription medicine that reduces the strain on the failing heart.6,15 It does this by enhancing the beneficial neurohormonal systems (natriuretic peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).6,15 Most other heart failure medicines only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS. Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan.6 Entresto film-coated tablets are available in three dosage strengths: 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan).6These doses are referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg in the clinical trial literature including The New England Journal of Medicine publication of the results of PARADIGM-HF.5 The target maintenance dose of Entresto is 97/103 mg twice daily.6
About NT-proBNP
NT-proBNP is a biomarker commonly used to assess the severity and determine the prognosis of heart failure.16 Levels of NT-proBNP increase when heart muscle cells are subjected to stress (such as stretching) that occurs in people with heart failure.16 Studies suggest that HF patients with elevated NT-proBNP are at an increased risk of CV death or HF hospitalization and that reducing levels of NT-proBNP in people with heart failure is associated with a lower risk of these negative clinical outcomes.16 Entresto was also shown to reduce plasma NT-proBNP compared with enalapril in the PIONEER-HF and PARADIGM-HF trials.1,5
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Entresto can harm or cause death to an unborn baby. Patients should talk to their doctor about other ways to treat heart failure if they plan to become pregnant. If a patient gets pregnant while taking Entresto, she should tell her doctor right away.
Patients are not to take Entresto if they are allergic to sacubitril or valsartan or any of the ingredients in Entresto; have had an allergic reaction including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or trouble breathing while taking a type of medicine called an ACE inhibitor or ARB; or take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto for at least 36 hours before or after they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients should talk with their doctor or pharmacist before taking Entresto if they are not sure if they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto if they have diabetes and take a medicine that contains aliskiren.
Before they take Entresto, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they have kidney or liver problems; or a history of hereditary angioedema; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant; are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should either take Entresto or breastfeed. They should not do both.
Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. They should especially tell their doctor if they take potassium supplements or a salt substitute; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); lithium; or other medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems such as an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or aliskiren.
Entresto may cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat (angioedema) that may cause trouble breathing and death. Patients are to get emergency medical help right away if they have symptoms of angioedema or trouble breathing. Patients are not to take Entresto again if they have had angioedema while taking Entresto. People who are black or who have had angioedema may have a higher risk of having angioedema if they take Entresto. Entresto may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). Patients are to call their doctor if they become dizzy or lightheaded, or they develop extreme fatigue. Entresto may cause kidney problems or an increased amount of potassium in the blood.
The most common side effects were low blood pressure, high potassium, cough, dizziness, and kidney problems.

11352,AstraZeneca Reports Positive Results of Farxiga in P-III DECLARE-TIMI 58 Study for Type-2 Diabetes (T2D),"DECLARE-TIMI 58: SGLT2i Reduces HF Hospitalization, CV Death in T2D and HF","The P-III DECLARE-TIMI 58 study involves assessing of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) vs PBO in 17,000 patients with T2D at risk of CV events (MI) across 33 countries in adults
 The P-III DECLARE-TIMI 58 study resulted in reduction of hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) or CV death and 16% reduction in MACE, presented at ACC’s 68th Annual Scientific Session in the US
 Farxiga (dapagliflozin, PO, qd) is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used to improve glycemic control and is evaluated in P-IIb/III. On February 03,2014 AstraZeneca acquired BMS share of global diabetes alliance including Farxiga","The SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin reduced heart failure hospitalization (HFH) and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and HF across a wide spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The greatest benefit was found in those with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The findings were presented on March 18 at ACC.19 in New Orleans, LA, and simultaneously published in Circulation.

In this international study with more than 17,000 patients with T2D, as well as either established cardiovascular disease or a high risk for cardiovascular disease, randomization was to either dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Median follow-up was four years.

At baseline, 30 percent of participants (5,202) had their LVEF documented. Of these, 13 percent (671 patients) had HFrEF.

Eri T. Kato, MD, PhD, et al., reported that dapagliflozin decreased HFH across all patients, regardless of ejection fraction or whether or not they had HF at baseline. In patients with HFrEF, there was a significant 38 percent reduction in death or HFH with dapagliflozin vs. placebo. In patients without HFrEF, the reduction in the primary endpoint was 12 percent with dapagliflozin vs. placebo.

Additionally, in patients with HFrEF there as a 45 percent reduction in cardiovascular death and 41 percent reduction in all-cause mortality with dapagliflozin vs. placebo. This reduction was not seen in patients without HFrEF.

“The clinical implication of this finding is that ejection fraction is a strong tool to identify those who are at highest risk and may derive particular benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors,” said Kato.

The authors are conducing additional research on the DECLARE-TIMI 58 data to assess dapagliflozin’s effects on metabolic, renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Other ongoing trials are investigating the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in HF patients.

 The focus of the agreement is to utilize BioMerieux’s expertise in diagnostics & advancing Baxter’s critical care portfolio including nutrition, renal, hospital and surgical products
 Additionally, On April 24, 2018 BioMerieux has acquired Astute Medical to develop biomarkers, IGFBP-7, and TIMP-2 for the early risk assessment of acute kidney injuries","Deerfield, Ill. and Marcy l’Étoile, France –

Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX), a global leader in acute care, and bioMérieux, a world leader in the field of in vitro diagnostics, announced an agreement to develop future biomarkers with the goal to rapidly identify and inform treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). The announcement was made at the International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (ISICEM) this week.
“We’re committed to improving outcomes for critically ill patients across the continuum of care, which includes identifying opportunities to diagnose AKI earlier so a patient can receive the best therapy,” said Reaz Rasul, general manager of Baxter’s Acute Therapies business. “By working with the team at bioMérieux, we’ll be able to combine their expertise in diagnostics with our experience in bringing the latest medical advancements to the ICU.”
“As a leader in pioneering diagnostic solutions, we’re looking forward to collaborating with Baxter to address the important challenges in critical care medicine such as AKI. In order to accomplish this, the team at the recently-acquired Astute Medical is committed to the development of additional high medical value biomarkers for improved patient care,” said Mark Miller, Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer at bioMérieux.
AKI is a sudden decrease in kidney function over a period of hours to days, often the result of illness, trauma or infection. The sudden loss of kidney function leads to the accumulation of toxins and fluid in the blood that, if left untreated, may lead to death. The most severe stage of AKI requires renal replacement therapy (“dialysis”) to replace the function of the kidneys. AKI is an increasingly common complication of acute illnesses in intensive care units and hospitals and early diagnosis is critical.1,2,3
Additional details about the agreement were not disclosed.

 The P-III TONES study results: @12wks. improvement in PGIc scale (68-74% receiving 75mg & 78-90% receiving 150mg); improvement in wakefulness (assessed in the maintenance of wakefulness test)
 Sunosi (75mg & 150mg for narcolepsy) (37.5 mg, 75 mg &150 mg for OSA) is a NDRI inhibitor, developed and commercialized by Jazz (Ex. Asia) and has received FDA’s ODD for narcolepsy in the US","Sunosi is the first and only dual-acting dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved by the FDA to improve wakefulness in adults living with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea

DUBLIN, March 20, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Sunosi™ (solriamfetol) to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Once-daily Sunosi is approved with doses of 75 mg and 150 mg for patients with narcolepsy and doses of 37.5 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg for patients with OSA. Sunosi is the first dual-acting dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI) approved to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in adults living with narcolepsy or OSA.
Sunosi is expected to be commercially available in the U.S. following the final scheduling decision by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which is typically within 90 days of FDA approval.

“Excessive daytime sleepiness can negatively impact the daily lives of people living with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea at work, at home or in daily activities. With this approval, a new, daytime medicine that can provide sustained wakefulness throughout the day will be available for patients,” said Bruce Cozadd, chairman and chief executive officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. “The FDA approval of Sunosi also represents an important milestone for Jazz as we continue to offer new treatment options that address unmet needs for people living with chronic, and often debilitating, sleep disorders.”
At Week 12, 150 mg of Sunosi for narcolepsy patients and all doses for OSA patients demonstrated improvements in wakefulness compared to placebo as assessed in test sessions 1 (approximately one hour post-dose) through 5 (approximately nine hours post-dose) of the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT).
The FDA’s approval of Sunosi is based on data from the Treatment of Obstructive sleep apnea and Narcolepsy Excessive Sleepiness (TONES) Phase 3 clinical program, which included four randomized placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the superiority of Sunosi relative to placebo. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and higher than placebo) reported in both the narcolepsy and OSA study populations were headache, nausea, decreased appetite, and anxiety. Sunosi was evaluated in more than 900 adults with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea and was shown to maintain its effect relative to placebo after six months of use.
“We’re excited about this new therapeutic option for patients, and we are pleased with the information included in the Sunosilabel as we believe it will give physicians the information needed to appropriately manage the vast majority of obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy patients with excessive daytime sleepiness,” said Daniel Swisher, president and chief operating officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
In 12 week clinical studies, approximately 68-74% of people taking Sunosi at the 75 mg dose and 78-90% of people taking Sunosiat the 150 mg dose reported improvement in their overall clinical condition, as assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) scale.
Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, the effects of Sunosi are thought to be mediated through its activity as a DNRI.
“Sunosi is an effective treatment option with a novel mechanism of action as a dual-acting dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor,” said Richard K. Bogan, MD, FCCP, FAASM, Associate Clinical Professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine and Chief Medical Officer at SleepMed in Columbia, SC. “Excessive daytime sleepiness is the most common symptom for people with narcolepsy and a major complaint of people with obstructive sleep apnea. In some people with obstructive sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness may persist despite using CPAP.”
Sunosi is not indicated to treat the underlying airway obstruction in OSA. Ensure that the underlying airway obstruction is treated (e.g., with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) for at least one month prior to initiating Sunosi for excessive daytime sleepiness in OSA. Modalities to treat the underlying airway obstruction should be continued during treatment with Sunosi. Sunosi is not a substitute for these modalities.
More information about Sunosi, including Full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide, is available here.

About Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness
Obstructive sleep apnea, commonly referred to as sleep apnea, is a highly prevalent disease (as high as 14% in men and 5% in women) in which excessive daytime sleepiness is a major presenting complaint in many cases.1-4 Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, with its most common form being Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), has been shown to be an effective therapy for sleep apnea that frequently results in improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness in many patients; however, not all patients tolerate CPAP therapy and among those who tolerate CPAP, usage is highly variable. Excessive daytime sleepiness may persist in people with sleep apnea despite using CPAP.
About Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.5 It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the United States, with symptoms typically appearing in childhood. It is estimated that more than 50% of patients with narcolepsy have not been diagnosed.6 Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis.7 Excessive daytime sleepiness is the primary symptom of narcolepsy and is present in all people with the disorder.8 Excessive daytime sleepiness is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in unplanned lapses into sleep or drowsiness.6,8,9 There are five primary symptoms of narcolepsy, including excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, sleep paralysis and sleep disruption. While all patients with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness, they may not experience all five symptoms.

Merck to Return GDF15 Receptor Agonist Program to NGM

KENILWORTH, N.J., and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NGM) today announced that Merck has exercised its option to extend the research phase of the companies’ broad, strategic collaboration for an additional two-year period from March 2020 to March 2022. The collaboration, originally announced in February 2015, is focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel biologic therapeutics across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Under the terms of the original agreement, Merck had the option to extend the initial five-year research and early development phase of the collaboration for an additional two-year period and retains one additional two-year extension option that is exercisable in 2021.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190320005089/en/

“We are pleased that Merck has extended its collaboration with NGM, ensuring that the important work we are doing together to discover and develop novel medicines across a range of therapeutic areas and high unmet needs will continue,” said Dr. David Woodhouse, chief executive officer of NGM. “The deep resources and scientific autonomy provided by this collaboration have enabled NGM to amplify the output of our powerful discovery engine and maximize our ambitious research and development goals. Together, we have progressed several potential first-in-class drug candidates into clinical development, including NGM313, now known as MK-3655, and we look forward to sustaining this productivity on behalf of patients.”
“Merck and NGM scientists have established a strong collaboration based on our mutual commitment to scientific excellence and the pursuit of novel meaningful therapeutics for the treatment of disease,” said Dr. Joe Miletich, senior vice president, preclinical and early development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to continuing this productive collaboration.”
During the two-year extension period, Merck will continue to fund NGM’s research and development efforts at similar levels to the original collaboration terms and, in lieu of the $20 million extension fee payable to NGM, Merck will make additional payments totaling up to $20 million in support of NGM’s research and development activities during the two-year extension period in 2021 and 2022.
As part of the collaboration, the companies previously announced in January 2019 that Merck exercised its option to license NGM313, an investigational monoclonal antibody agonist of the β-Klotho/FGFR1c receptor complex for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) discovered by NGM. Merck’s one-time option to license NGM313 (now renamed MK-3655) was triggered by NGM’s completion of a proof-of-concept clinical study of NGM313. Merck intends to advance MK-3655 into a Phase 2b study to evaluate the effect of MK-3655 on liver histology and glucose control in NASH patients with or without diabetes.
NGM’s fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) program, including its lead clinical asset NGM282, currently in Phase 2 studies for the treatment of NASH, is excluded from the agreement and remains wholly owned by NGM.
Merck and NGM also announced today that Merck will terminate its license to NGM’s growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) receptor agonist program, which is being developed for the treatment of obesity, effective May 31, 2019. As part of the original collaboration agreement, Merck received an exclusive worldwide license to NGM’s GDF15 analogs, including NGM386 and NGM395, protein variants of GDF15 with potential for once-daily and once-weekly or less frequent dosing, respectively. In 2018, Merck completed dosing of a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial evaluating NGM386 in otherwise healthy overweight/obese subjects. Preliminary data from this study indicate that while NGM386 was generally well tolerated, treatment with the drug for 28 days did not result in body weight loss relative to placebo.
Upon license termination, Merck will grant to NGM an exclusive license under Merck’s intellectual property related to the GDF15 receptor agonist program for further development and commercialization of products, subject to the payment of a low single digit royalty on any future product sales back to Merck. Merck’s decision to terminate the GDF15 program, a right stipulated in the agreement, does not impact the remainder of the collaboration arrangement.
“We continue to believe that the biology of GDF15 and its cognate receptor, GFRAL, can play an important role in human disease with potential effects on lipolysis and energy expenditure in metabolic disease states. Upon transition of the programs back to NGM, we will conduct an analysis of the clinical data and make a decision about whether to pursue further development of NGM386 and/or NGM395,” said Dr. Woodhouse.

11382,Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) Receive FDA's Approval for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC),FDA approves Roche’s Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy for the initial treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer,"The approval is based on P-III IMpower133 study results assessing Tecentriq + CT vs CT as monothx. in 403 patients in ratio (1:1) with (ES-SCLC)
 The P-III IMpower133 study results: mOS (12.3 vs 10.3 mos.); PFS (5.2 vs 4.3 mos.); safe & effective results with improvement in survival rates
 Tecentriq is a mAb targeting PD-L1 protein while blocking its interaction with PD-1 and B7.1 receptor and is evaluated in nine P-III trial for lungs & has received FDA & EU’s approval combining Avastin(bevacizumab)+ paclitaxel + carboplatin & Avastin for metastatic nonsqNSCLC respectively","Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) is the first and only cancer immunotherapy approved for the initial treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC)
First new initial treatment option approved by FDA for people with ES-SCLC in more than 20 years
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (chemotherapy), for the initial (first-line) treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). This approval is based on results from the Phase III IMpower133 study, which showed that Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy helped people live significantly longer compared to chemotherapy alone (median overall survival [OS]=12.3 vs. 10.3 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.70, 95% CI: 0.54–0.91; p=0.0069) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.[1] The Tecentriq-based combination also significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival, PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone (PFS=5.2 versus 4.3 months; HR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.96; p=0.017). Safety for the Tecentriq and chemotherapy combination appeared consistent with the known safety profile of Tecentriq.
“Tecentriq is the first cancer immunotherapy approved for the initial treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, which is especially difficult to treat,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Until now, there have been limited treatment advances for this disease, and we are excited to bring a potential new standard of care to patients that has been shown to improve survival compared to chemotherapy.
Results from the Phase III IMpower133 study were simultaneously presented at the 2018 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
In the US, Tecentriq is approved in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab), paclitaxel and carboplatin (chemotherapy), for the initial (first-line) treatment of adults with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations. In Europe, the Tecentriq and Avastin combination is approved for the initial treatment of people with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, including people with EGFR mutant or ALK genomic tumour aberrations after failure of appropriate targeted therapies. Tecentriq is also approved by the FDA to treat adults with metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations should have disease progression on FDA approved therapy for NSCLC harbouring these aberrations prior to receiving Tecentriq.

About the IMpower133 study
IMpower133 is a Phase III, multicentre, double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) vs. chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) alone in chemotherapy-naïve adults with ES-SCLC.
The study enrolled 403 people who were randomised equally (1:1) to receive:

Tecentriq in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Arm A), or
Placebo in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Arm B, control arm)
During the treatment-induction phase, people received treatment on 21-day cycles for four cycles, followed by maintenance with Tecentriq or placebo until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment could be continued until persistent radiographic PD or symptomatic deterioration was observed.
The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 and OS in the ITT population.
A summary of the ITT data from the IMpower133 study that support this approval is included below.[1]

Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy helped people live significantly longer compared to chemotherapy alone (OS=12.3 vs. 10.3 months; HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.54-0.91; p=0.0069) in the ITT population.
The Tecentriq-based combination also significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death compared to chemotherapy alone (PFS=5.2 vs. 4.3 months; HR=0.77; 95% CI: 0.62-0.96; p=0.017).
Safety for the Tecentriq and chemotherapy combination appeared consistent with the known safety profile of Tecentriq. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of people receiving Tecentriq plus chemotherapy compared to 35% of people receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in people receiving Tecentriq plus chemotherapy were feeling tired or weak (fatigue/asthenia; 39%), nausea (38%), hair loss (alopecia; 37%), decreased appetite (27%) and constipation (26%) and vomiting (20%).
About SCLC
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally.[2] Each year 1.76 million people die as a result of the disease; this translates into more than 4,800 deaths worldwide every day.[2] Lung cancer can be broadly divided into two major types: NSCLC and SCLC, with SCLC accounting for approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases.[3]

About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1 expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T cells. Tecentriq has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with cancer immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. Currently, Roche has nine Phase III lung cancer studies evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other medicines.
In the United States Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is approved for treatment of PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer; and in combination with Avastin and chemotherapy for the initial treatment of people with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. In the Europe Union, the non-squamous NSCLC indication includes people with EGFR mutant or ALK genomic tumour aberrations after failure of appropriate targeted therapies. Tecentriq is also approved in the European Union, United States and more than 85 countries for people with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and for certain types of untreated or previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy, or who have had disease progression during or following platinum-containing therapy.

 The termination is due to its inability to meet 1EPs resulted in the loss of ~$18B to Biogen. Biogen also terminates P-II EVOLVE study of Aducanumab and the long-term extension of PRIME leads to falling in Biogen’s stock price up to 28%
 Aducanumab (BIIB037) is a mAb evaluated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. On Oct,2017 Biogen & Eisai collaborated for the development & commercialization of aducanumab globally","Independent data monitoring committee advises aducanumab unlikely to meet primary endpoints, leading to decision to discontinue the trials
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai, Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) today announced the decision to discontinue the global Phase 3 trials, ENGAGE and EMERGE, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease and mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia. The decision to stop the trials is based on results of a futility analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee, which indicated the trials were unlikely to meet their primary endpoint upon completion. The recommendation to stop the studies was not based on safety concerns.
“This disappointing news confirms the complexity of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the need to further advance knowledge in neuroscience. We are incredibly grateful to all the Alzheimer’s disease patients, their families and the investigators who participated in the trials and contributed greatly to this research,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “Biogen’s history has been based on pioneering innovation, learning from successes and setbacks. Driven by our steadfast commitment to patients and our strong business foundation, we will continue advancing our pipeline of potential therapies in Alzheimer’s disease and innovative medicines for patients suffering from diseases of high unmet need.”
Detailed data from the ENGAGE and EMERGE studies will be presented at future medical meetings to inform ongoing research. ENGAGE and EMERGE are global Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared with placebo in slowing cognitive and functional impairment as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of monthly doses of aducanumab as compared to placebo on clinical progression as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog 13), and AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL-MCI).
As part of this decision, the EVOLVE Phase 2 safety study and the long-term extension of the PRIME Phase1b study of aducanumab will also be discontinued. Initiation of the aducanumab Phase 3 secondary prevention trial will be assessed while the data from ENGAGE and EMERGE are further evaluated.
About Aducanumab
Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational compound being studied for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease. Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative development and license agreement. Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) derived from a de-identified library of B cells collected from healthy elderly subjects with no signs of cognitive impairment or cognitively impaired elderly subjects with unusually slow cognitive decline using Neurimmune’s technology platform called Reverse Translational Medicine (RTM). Since October 2017, Biogen and Eisai have collaborated on the development and commercialization of aducanumab globally. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for the development of aducanumab, a process allowing priority reviews by the FDA for drugs deemed as having potential to treat serious conditions and tackle key unmet medical needs.

Merck to Return GDF15 Receptor Agonist Program to NGM

KENILWORTH, N.J., and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NGM) today announced that Merck has exercised its option to extend the research phase of the companies’ broad, strategic collaboration for an additional two-year period from March 2020 to March 2022. The collaboration, originally announced in February 2015, is focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel biologic therapeutics across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Under the terms of the original agreement, Merck had the option to extend the initial five-year research and early development phase of the collaboration for an additional two-year period and retains one additional two-year extension option that is exercisable in 2021.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190320005089/en/

“We are pleased that Merck has extended its collaboration with NGM, ensuring that the important work we are doing together to discover and develop novel medicines across a range of therapeutic areas and high unmet needs will continue,” said Dr. David Woodhouse, chief executive officer of NGM. “The deep resources and scientific autonomy provided by this collaboration have enabled NGM to amplify the output of our powerful discovery engine and maximize our ambitious research and development goals. Together, we have progressed several potential first-in-class drug candidates into clinical development, including NGM313, now known as MK-3655, and we look forward to sustaining this productivity on behalf of patients.”
“Merck and NGM scientists have established a strong collaboration based on our mutual commitment to scientific excellence and the pursuit of novel meaningful therapeutics for the treatment of disease,” said Dr. Joe Miletich, senior vice president, preclinical and early development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to continuing this productive collaboration.”
During the two-year extension period, Merck will continue to fund NGM’s research and development efforts at similar levels to the original collaboration terms and, in lieu of the $20 million extension fee payable to NGM, Merck will make additional payments totaling up to $20 million in support of NGM’s research and development activities during the two-year extension period in 2021 and 2022.
As part of the collaboration, the companies previously announced in January 2019 that Merck exercised its option to license NGM313, an investigational monoclonal antibody agonist of the β-Klotho/FGFR1c receptor complex for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) discovered by NGM. Merck’s one-time option to license NGM313 (now renamed MK-3655) was triggered by NGM’s completion of a proof-of-concept clinical study of NGM313. Merck intends to advance MK-3655 into a Phase 2b study to evaluate the effect of MK-3655 on liver histology and glucose control in NASH patients with or without diabetes.
NGM’s fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) program, including its lead clinical asset NGM282, currently in Phase 2 studies for the treatment of NASH, is excluded from the agreement and remains wholly owned by NGM.
Merck and NGM also announced today that Merck will terminate its license to NGM’s growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) receptor agonist program, which is being developed for the treatment of obesity, effective May 31, 2019. As part of the original collaboration agreement, Merck received an exclusive worldwide license to NGM’s GDF15 analogs, including NGM386 and NGM395, protein variants of GDF15 with potential for once-daily and once-weekly or less frequent dosing, respectively. In 2018, Merck completed dosing of a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial evaluating NGM386 in otherwise healthy overweight/obese subjects. Preliminary data from this study indicate that while NGM386 was generally well tolerated, treatment with the drug for 28 days did not result in body weight loss relative to placebo.
Upon license termination, Merck will grant to NGM an exclusive license under Merck’s intellectual property related to the GDF15 receptor agonist program for further development and commercialization of products, subject to the payment of a low single digit royalty on any future product sales back to Merck. Merck’s decision to terminate the GDF15 program, a right stipulated in the agreement, does not impact the remainder of the collaboration arrangement.
“We continue to believe that the biology of GDF15 and its cognate receptor, GFRAL, can play an important role in human disease with potential effects on lipolysis and energy expenditure in metabolic disease states. Upon transition of the programs back to NGM, we will conduct an analysis of the clinical data and make a decision about whether to pursue further development of NGM386 and/or NGM395,” said Dr. Woodhouse.

Alcon has secured debt financing of USD 3.5 billion
Basel, – Novartis today confirmed that certain important conditions precedent for the 100% spin-off of the Alcon eye care business have been met, including receipt of certain necessary authorizations and rulings. Completion of the transaction, by way of a distribution of a dividend in kind to Novartis shareholders and ADR (American Depositary Receipt) holders, is expected to be on April 9, 2019. In the distribution, each Novartis shareholder will receive 1 Alcon share for every 5 Novartis shares/ADRs they hold on April 8, 2019, close of business.
Approval has been given, subject to customary conditions, by the SIX Exchange Regulation for the listing of the shares of Alcon Inc. on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) pursuant to the International Reporting Standard. Authorization has also been received for the listing of shares in Alcon Inc. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
Alcon will seek effectiveness of the Alcon Inc. Form 20-F registration statement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Alcon Inc. 20-F registration statement is available at www.sec.gov and can also be accessed at the following link after its publication with the SEC: https://www.novartis.com/sites/www.novartis.com/files/alcon-20f-filing-2019.pdf.
Shares in Alcon Inc. are expected to be listed and traded from April 9, 2019 on the SIX and the NYSE under the ticker symbol “ALC”. Alcon will also be included in both the Swiss Market Index (SMI®) and Swiss Performance Index (SPI®) from the first day of trading, as recently announced by the SIX.
Alcon has secured debt financing of USD 3.5 billion through a group of banks. The Alcon credit rating will be investment grade following the spin-off. Moody’s Investor Service and S&P Global Ratings have rated Alcon at Baa2 and BBB, respectively, with a stable outlook.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS AG are advising Novartis on the transaction.
Important information about the Alcon spin-off 
Shares of Novartis will continue to trade on the SIX under the symbol “NOVN”. Any holders of Novartis shares who sell them prior to the close of trading on April 8, 2019 will also be forfeiting their right to receive Alcon shares in the distribution. Novartis ADRs will continue to trade “regular-way” on NYSE under the symbol “NVS”. Any holders of Novartis ADRs who sell them “regular-way” prior to the close of trading on April 8, 2019 will also be forfeiting their right to receive Alcon shares in the distribution.
Between the ADR record date of April 1, 2019 and through April 10, 2019, Novartis ADR holders cannot convert their Novartis ADRs into Novartis ordinary shares and vice versa.
As opposed to a typical US domestic spin-off, and in order to align trading between the Swiss and US markets, there will be no “ex-distribution” trading of Novartis ADRs, nor “when-issued” trading of Alcon shares, prior to the spin-off. Shareholders will not have the ability to trade Novartis ADRs ex-dividend on the NYSE during the period between the day before the ADR record date and the spin-off completion date and will not have the ability to trade Alcon on a “when-issued basis” on either the SIX or the NYSE prior to the spin-off. Beginning on April 9, 2019, shareholders will be able to trade Alcon shares in the regular-way market on both the SIX and NYSE under the symbol “ALC”.

11422,AbbVie Reports FDA's Hold on All Clinical Trials Evaluating Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax) for Multiple Myeloma,AbbVie Provides Update on VENCLEXTA®/VENCLYXTO® (venetoclax) Multiple Myeloma Program,"The partial clinical hold follows P-III BELLINI trial (M14-031)study results assessing Venetoclax + bortezomib + dexamethasone vs PBO + bortezomib + dexamethasone in patients with 1L+ r/r multiple myeloma due to a higher proportion of deaths in the experimental arm rather than PBO arm
 The P-III BELLINI study results: observed death (21.1% vs 11.3%); grade 3-5 toxicity (86.5% vs. 87.5%); SAEs (48.2% vs. 50.0%); incidence of infection (79.8% vs 77.1%); incidence of pneumonia (20.7% vs 15.6%)
 Venclexta/Venclyxto is a novel inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein, jointly developed & commercialized by Roche & Abbvie in the US and has received approval in 50 countries for chronic lymphocytic leukemia","NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., March 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed a partial clinical hold on all clinical trials evaluating venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®/VENCLYXTO®) for the investigational treatment of multiple myeloma. The partial clinical hold follows a review of data from the ongoing Phase 3 BELLINI trial (M14-031), a study in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, in which a higher proportion of deaths was observed in the venetoclax arm compared to the control arm of the trial. As a result of this action, no new patients should be enrolled in any studies of venetoclax for multiple myeloma until a further analysis of the data is completed. Patients who are currently enrolled in studies and receiving benefit from the therapy may continue with treatment, after consultation with their physician.
This action does not impact any of the approved indications for venetoclax, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and is limited to investigational clinical trials in multiple myeloma. AbbVie remains confident in the benefit/risk profile of venetoclax in those approved indications.
“We are committed to patient safety and are thoroughly analyzing the results observed in the BELLINI trial. We will continue working with the FDA and worldwide regulatory agencies to determine appropriate next steps for the multiple myeloma program,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “We will continue to further the research and development of venetoclax and other therapies with the potential to transform the standards of care in blood cancers.”
AbbVie has informed clinical trial investigators involved in the studies evaluating venetoclax for the treatment of multiple myeloma of the results and will work with them to proceed as appropriate and in the best interest of each patient who may be receiving benefit from venetoclax and who elects to continue receiving treatment. Additional analyses are ongoing, and data will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and/or presented at a future medical meeting.
Venetoclax is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.
About BELLINI
BELLINI is a multicenter, randomized, double blind study of bortezomib and dexamethasone in combination with either venetoclax or placebo in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy and are sensitive or naïve to proteasome inhibitors.1 The BELLINI study met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (22.4 months vs. 11.5 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.90) and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall response rate (82% vs. 68%) and very good partial response or better (59% vs. 36%) in the venetoclax arm compared to the control arm.
Patients should talk to their doctor immediately if they are receiving venetoclax for the treatment of multiple myeloma. For medical-related questions, please call: 1-800-633-9110.
The details of the FDA review of the Phase 3 BELLINI study included the following safety updates:
In a pre-planned analysis of the primary endpoint and ranked secondary endpoints, in the venetoclax arm 41 out of 194 (21.1%) deaths were observed, among which, 13 (6.7%) were treatment emergent (HR 2.03, 95% CI [1.042 – 3.945]). Of the 13 treatment-emergent deaths in the venetoclax arm, 8 were attributed by the investigator to an event of infection, and more than half were in the setting of refractory or progressive disease.
In the placebo arm 11 out of 97 (11.3%) deaths were observed, among which, 1 (1.0%) was treatment emergent (occurred less than 30 days after last dose of study drug).
The incidence of severe, grade 3-5 toxicity (86.5% vs. 87.5%, investigational vs. control arm) and serious adverse events (48.2% vs. 50.0%) was similar between the two arms. The incidence of infections (Infections and Infestation System Organ Class) was 79.8% in the investigational arm and 77.1% in the control arm. The incidence of pneumonia was 20.7% in the investigational arm and 15.6% in the placebo arm.
Serious adverse events of infection were reported in 28.0% of patients in the investigational arm and 27.1% in the control arm. Serious adverse events of pneumonia were reported in 14.0% of patients in the investigational arm and 12.5% of patients in the placebo arm. Frequent causes of death not related to disease progression identified in the venetoclax arm were: sepsis, pneumonia, and cardiac arrest.
Patients deriving benefit in all ongoing trials evaluating venetoclax in multiple myeloma can continue treatment, in agreement between the individual patient and physician.
About VENCLEXTA®/VENCLYXTO® (venetoclax) 
VENCLEXTA®/VENCLYXTO® (venetoclax) is a first-in-class medicine that selectively binds and inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers, BCL-2 prevents cancer cells from undergoing their natural death or self-destruction process, called apoptosis. VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO targets the BCL-2 protein and works to help restore the process of apoptosis.2
VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Together, the companies are committed to BCL-2 research and to studying venetoclax in clinical trials across several blood and other cancers.
VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO is approved in more than 50 countries, including the U.S. Venetoclax is not approved by any regulatory authority, in any country for the treatment of multiple myeloma. AbbVie, in collaboration with Roche, is currently working with regulatory agencies around the world to bring this medicine to additional eligible patients in need.
Uses and Important VENCLEXTA® (venetoclax) U.S. Safety Information2
Use
VENCLEXTA is a prescription medicine used:

to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior treatment.
in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine to treat adults with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who:
are 75 years of age or older, or
have other medical conditions that prevent the use of standard chemotherapy.
It is not known if VENCLEXTA is safe and effective in children.
Important Safety Information
What is the most important information I should know about VENCLEXTA?
VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will do tests to check your risk of getting TLS before you start taking VENCLEXTA. You will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of TLS. You may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into your vein. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check for TLS when you first start treatment and during treatment with VENCLEXTA.
It is important to keep your appointments for blood tests. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of TLS during treatment with VENCLEXTA, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizures, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness, or muscle or joint pain.
Drink plenty of water when taking VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of getting TLS. 
Drink 6 to 8 glasses (about 56 ounces total) of water each day, starting 2 days before your first dose, on the day of your first dose of VENCLEXTA, and each time your dose is increased.
Your healthcare provider may delay, decrease your dose, or stop treatment with VENCLEXTA if you have side effects.
Who should not take VENCLEXTA? 
Certain medicines must not be taken when you first start taking VENCLEXTA and while your dose is being slowly increased because of the risk of increased TLS. 

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. VENCLEXTA and other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects.
Do not start new medicines during treatment with VENCLEXTA without first talking with your healthcare provider.
Before taking VENCLEXTA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have kidney problems.
have problems with your body salts or electrolytes, such as potassium, phosphorus, or calcium.
have a history of high uric acid levels in your blood or gout.
are scheduled to receive a vaccine. You should not receive a “live vaccine” before, during, or after treatment with VENCLEXTA, until your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. If you are not sure about the type of immunization or vaccine, ask your healthcare provider. These vaccines may not be safe or may not work as well during treatment with VENCLEXTA.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. VENCLEXTA may harm your unborn baby. If you are able to become pregnant, your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with VENCLEXTA, and you should use effective birth control during treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of VENCLEXTA. If you become pregnant or think you are pregnant, tell your healthcare provider right away.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if VENCLEXTA passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with VENCLEXTA.
What should I avoid while taking VENCLEXTA?
You should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit, Seville oranges (often used in marmalades), or starfruit while you are taking VENCLEXTA. These products may increase the amount of VENCLEXTA in your blood.
What are the possible side effects of VENCLEXTA?
VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:

Low white blood cell counts (neutropenia). Low white blood cell counts are common with VENCLEXTA, but can also be severe. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your blood counts during treatment with VENCLEXTA. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have a fever or any signs of an infection during treatment with VENCLEXTA.
The most common side effects of VENCLEXTA when used in combination with rituximab in people with CLL include low white blood cell counts, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, tiredness, and nausea.
The most common side effects of VENCLEXTA when used alone in people with CLL/SLL include low white blood cell counts; diarrhea; nausea; upper respiratory tract infection; low red blood cell counts; tiredness; low platelet counts; muscle and joint pain; swelling of your arms, legs, hands, and feet; and cough.
The most common side effects of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine in people with AML include low white blood cell counts; nausea; diarrhea; low platelet counts; constipation; fever with low white blood cell counts; low red blood cell counts, infection in blood; rash; dizziness; low blood pressure; fever; swelling of your arms, legs, hands, and feet; vomiting; tiredness; shortness of breath; bleeding; infection in lung; stomach (abdominal) pain; pain in muscles or back; cough; and sore throat.
VENCLEXTA may cause fertility problems in males. This may affect your ability to father a child. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have concerns about fertility.
These are not all the possible side effects of VENCLEXTA. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit http://www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

Important VENCLYXTO® (venetoclax) EU Safety Information3
VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) Indication 
Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia(CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy.
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL:

in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or
in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemo immunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is contraindicated. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase due to increased risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Concomitant use of preparations containing St. John’s wort as VENCLYXTO efficacy may be reduced.
Special Warnings & Precautions for Use
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal events, has occurred in patients with previously treated CLL with high tumor burden when treated with VENCLYXTO. VENCLYXTO poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week dose-titration phase. Changes in electrolytes consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLYXTO and at each dose increase. Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis, monitoring, and management for TLS.
Neutropenia (grade 3 or 4) has been reported and complete blood counts should be monitored throughout the treatment period. Serious infections including events of sepsis with fatal outcome have been reported. Supportive measures including antimicrobials for any signs of infection should be considered.
Live vaccines should not be administered during treatment or thereafter until B-cell recovery.
Drug Interactions
CYP3A inhibitors may increase VENCLYXTO plasma concentrations. At initiation and dose-titration phase: Strong CYP3A inhibitors are contraindicated due to increased risk for TLS and moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be used, physicians should refer to the SmPC for dose adjustment recommendations. At steady daily dose: If moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors must be used, physicians should refer to the SmPC for dose adjustment recommendations.
Avoid concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors at initiation and during the dose titration phase.
CYP3A4 inducers may decrease VENCLYXTO plasma concentrations. Avoid coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. These agents may decrease venetoclax plasma concentrations.
Co-administration of bile acid sequestrants with VENCLYXTO is not recommended as this may reduce the absorption of VENCLYXTO.
Adverse Reactions
The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (>=20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax in the combination study with rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhea, and upper respiratory tract infection. In the monotherapy studies, the most common adverse reactions were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, diarrhea, nausea, anemia, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection.
The most frequently occurring serious adverse reactions (>=2%) in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with rituximab or as monotherapy were pneumonia, febrile neutropenia and TLS.
Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients receiving venetoclax plus rituximab and 9% receiving venetoclax monotherapy. Dosage adjustments due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients receiving venetoclax plus rituximab and 2% receiving venetoclax monotherapy. Dose interruptions occurred in 71% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and rituximab.
Specific Populations
Patients with reduced renal function (CrCl <80 mL/min) may require more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring to reduce the risk of TLS. Safety in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) or on dialysis has not been established, and a recommended dose for these patients has not been determined. VENCLYXTO should be administered to patients with severe renal impairment only if the benefit outweighs the risk and patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity due to increased risk of TLS.
VENCLYXTO may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise nursing women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment.
This is not a complete summary of all safety information. See VENCLYXTO full summary of product characteristics (SmPC) at www.ema.europa.eu. Globally, prescribing information varies; refer to the individual country product label for complete information.

11434,ï»¿Sage Therapeutics' Zulresso (brexanolone) Receives FDA's Approval for Postpartum Depression (PPD),"Sage Therapeutics Announces FDA Approval of ZULRESSO (brexanolone) Injection, the First and Only Treatment Specifically Indicated for Postpartum Depression","The approval is based on three clinical studies assessing Zulresso (brexanolone) vs PBO in women with moderate to severe PPD + ≤6 mos. postpartum at screening aged 18 to 45yrs.
 The three clinical study results: met 1EPs; reduction in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score; reduction in depressive symptoms within a day; maintained effect through the 30-day follow-up
 Zulresso (brexanolone, IV) is an allosteric modulator of GABAA receptor and has received FDA’s PR, BT designation & EMA’s PRIME designation for PPD","Approval based on results from three pivotal trials showing treatment with ZULRESSO provided significant and rapid reduction of depressive symptoms within days

Postpartum depression is the most common medical complication of childbirth, estimated to affect approximately 400,000 women annually in the U.S.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SAGE), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system (CNS) disorders, announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ZULRESSOTM (brexanolone) injection for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD). ZULRESSO is the first and only medicine specifically approved to treat PPD, the most common medical complication of childbirth. ZULRESSO is expected to be available in late June following scheduling by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which is expected to occur within 90 days.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190319005938/en/

“Today’s approval of ZULRESSO represents a game-changing approach to treating PPD,” said Samantha Meltzer Brody, M.D., M.P.H., Ray M Hayworth Distinguished Professorship of Mood and Anxiety Disorders and director of the Perinatal Psychiatry Program, UNC Center for Women’s Mood Disorders and primary investigator of the ZULRESSO clinical trials. “The potential to rapidly reduce symptoms in this critical disorder is an exciting milestone in women’s mental health. PPD is recognized to have a significant and long-term impact on women and their families, but with ZULRESSO we may finally have the opportunity to change that.”
PPD can affect women during pregnancy or after childbirth. It is estimated PPD affects approximately one in nine women who have given birth in the U.S. Symptoms may include sadness, anxiety, irritability, withdrawing from friends or family, having trouble bonding with her baby and thinking about harming herself or more rarely, her baby. Without proper screening, up to half of PPD cases may go undiagnosed.
ZULRESSO was evaluated by the FDA under Priority Review, which is reserved for investigational therapies that, if approved, may offer significant improvements in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious condition. In 2016, ZULRESSO was also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status, underscoring the significant unmet need in women with PPD.
“We are proud to be a part of this important moment in mental health, creating the opportunity for an unprecedented change in the way postpartum depression is thought about and treated moving forward,” said Jeff Jonas, M.D., chief executive officer of Sage. “We are grateful for the patients, researchers, healthcare providers, advocates, caregivers and Sage employees who helped secure the approval of the first medicine specifically for postpartum depression. Not only do we believe ZULRESSO will address an important need for women’s mental health, the impact of PPD is multi-generational, and we look forward to bringing ZULRESSO to patients in urgent need of a new treatment option. We believe ZULRESSO will be a catalyst in starting a new dialogue emphasizing the importance of women’s mental health, and the importance of diagnosing and treating PPD.”
The FDA approval of ZULRESSO is based on findings from three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ZULRESSO in women with moderate and severe PPD, aged between 18 and 45 years who were ≤6 months postpartum at screening and who had onset of symptoms no earlier than the third trimester and no later than the first four weeks following delivery.
In all trials at all doses, ZULRESSO achieved the primary endpoint, a significant mean reduction from baseline in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) total score, a common measure of depression severity, at 60 hours compared to placebo. A reduction of depressive symptoms was also seen as early as 24 hours, and ZULRESSO maintained effect through the 30-day follow-up. The most common adverse events in the studies were sleepiness, dry mouth, loss of consciousness and flushing.
About Postpartum Depression
Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common medical complication of childbirth. PPD is a distinct and readily identified major depressive disorder that can occur during pregnancy or after giving birth. Expert opinions vary as to the timing of the onset of PPD, ranging from onset during pregnancy up to 4-weeks postpartum and onset during pregnancy up to 12-months postpartum. PPD may have devastating consequences for a woman and for her family, which may include significant functional impairment, depressed mood and/or loss of interest in her newborn, and associated symptoms of depression such as loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, motor challenges, lack of concentration, loss of energy and poor self-esteem. Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death following childbirth. PPD affects approximately one in nine women who have given birth in the U.S. and 400,000 women annually. More than half of these cases may go undiagnosed without proper screening.
About ZULRESSO™ (brexanolone) injection
ZULRESSO, the first medicine specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of postpartum depression, is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Allosteric modulation of neurotransmitter receptor activity results in varying degrees of desired activity rather than complete activation or inhibition of the receptor. ZULRESSO is approved by the FDA for the treatment of PPD in adults, pending DEA scheduling. ZULRESSO has been granted PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

11440,Evotec and GARDP Collaborates to Develop Novel Antibiotics for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)ï»¿,Evotec and GARDP announce new partnership to discover novel antibiotics,"Evotec and GARDP enter into an agreement to develop novel therapies for growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
 The focus of the collaboration is to combine GARDP’s clinical expertise with Evotec’s drug discovery platform to develop antibiotics for AMR and establish antibiotic discovery, development platform with portfolio of antibiotic assets
 Evotec’s anti-infective platform enabling discovery and development of vaccines to treat, prevent serious life-threatening infections arising from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including MDR organism with a collection of strains producing in-vitro and in-vivo therapies","COLLABORATION EXPLORES OPPORTUNITIES TO SET UP ANTIBIOTIC DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM AND ESTABLISH A JOINT PIPELINE OF NOVEL ANTIBIOTIC ASSETS
DISCOVERY EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (“WHO”) PRIORITY PATHOGENS 
 
Evotec AG (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: EVT, MDAX/TecDAX, ISIN: DE0005664809) and The Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (“GARDP”) are today announcing the formation of a new strategic public-private partnership to tackle the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (“AMR”). By joining forces, Evotec and GARDP will leverage their capabilities and networks to address drug-resistant bacterial infections. This includes bringing together GARDP’s clinical expertise and sustainable access commitment with Evotec’s leading drug discovery platform, expertise in medicinal chemistry and pharmacology, as well as its world-leading collection of bacterial pathogens.
With few antibiotics in development, AMR is a major and rapidly growing global health challenge that is making previously easy to treat infections harder to treat. Approximately 700,000 people worldwide die of drug-resistant infections every year and this number is expected to increase significantly in the future.1 Serious bacterial infections, and in particular Gram-negative bacterial infections, have been identified by the WHO as a global public health priority.2
This strategic partnership focuses on accelerating the development of first-in-class antibiotic treatments for hard-to-treat bacterial infections by establishing a platform that spans the length of the drug development value chain as well as developing a joint pipeline. Of critical importance is also to ensure that novel antibiotics are sensibly priced and made available globally to all patients who need them.
“Partnerships are central to GARDP’s model. Working with Evotec will undoubtedly strengthen GARDP’s efforts to develop new antibiotics, while addressing the need for their sustainable access. Evotec’s expertise complements GARDP’s approach, which allows both partners to develop a drug from early exploratory to pre-clinical and clinical studies all the way to patients,” said Dr Seamus O’Brien, Research and Development Director at GARDP. “Developing treatments to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections is key to achieve universal health coverage.”
Dr Cord Dohrmann, Chief Scientific Officer of Evotec, commented: “The development of resistance to antimicrobials is likely to accelerate and the need for new antibiotics is beyond urgent. Unfortunately, the number of companies engaged in antimicrobial drug discovery is continuously decreasing due to scientific and commercial challenges. Evotec and GARDP are committed to explore new models to leverage cutting-edge discovery platforms to highly innovative and promising projects that have the potential to yield novel classes of antibiotics directed against high priority pathogens. GARDP perfectly complements Evotec in vision and strategy and we are extremely proud to have them as a strategic partner.”

11487,"AbbVie's Skyrizi (risankizumab) Receives Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) Approval to Treat Plaque Psoriasis, Generalized Pustular Psoriasis, Erythrodermic Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis in Adults","AbbVie Announces First Regulatory Approval of SKYRIZI (risankizumab) for the Treatment of Plaque Psoriasis, Generalized Pustular Psoriasis and Erythrodermic Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis in Japan","The approval is based on P-II & P-III sustaIMM, ultIMMa-1 and IMMspire study results assessing Skyrizi in Japanese patients with plaque psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis & active psoriatic arthritis
 The study resulted in safe and effective results and has capabilities to improve the signs of these chronic immune-mediated diseases
 Skyrizi (risankizumab) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb inhibiting IL-23 and has received a positive opinion from the EMA’s CHMP for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients in Feb, 2019 and currently under review with the US FDA","This marks the first regulatory approval globally for SKYRIZI (risankizumab) -SKYRIZI is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody designed to selectively inhibit IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit[1]
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved SKYRIZI (risankizumab), an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have an inadequate response to conventional therapies. This approval marks the first country approval in the world for SKYRIZI.
“With this first global approval of SKYRIZI, we are excited to bring a new treatment option to people living with psoriatic disease in Japan,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “SKYRIZI has the potential to improve the signs and symptoms of these chronic, immune-mediated diseases. We look forward to continuing to work with regulatory authorities to make this treatment available to more patients worldwide.”
Psoriasis is a chronic, non-communicable inflammatory condition characterized by inflamed, scaly patches that typically causes people to experience itchiness, burning and stinging.2,3Psoriasis is linked to several associated conditions, and in Japan, as many as 15 percent of individuals with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis, a chronic, inflammatory disease that leads to irreversible joint deformations and disability.4 Worldwide, as many as 30 percent of people living with psoriasis may develop psoriatic arthritis.3
“Advances in our understanding of psoriatic disease have brought us to an era where clear skin is a realistic treatment goal,” said Mamitaro Ohtsuki, M.D., Ph.D., Chairman and Professor, Department of Dermatology, Jichi Medical University. “SKYRIZI has the potential to help psoriasis patients achieve high rates of skin clearance bringing them closer to reaching long-term treatment goals with every 12-week dosing.”
The approval is based on efficacy and safety data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, sustaIMM, ultIMMa-1 and IMMspire, evaluating SKYRIZI in Japanese patients with plaque psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis, as well as a global Phase 2 study in patients with active psoriatic arthritis.
SKYRIZI is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization of SKYRIZI globally.
The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for SKYRIZI for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy in February 2019. SKYRIZI is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a regulatory decision is anticipated in the first half of 2019.
About SKYRIZI (risankizumab) in Japan
SKYRIZI is approved for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic arthritis, generalized pustular psoriasis, or erythrodermic psoriasis in adult patients who responded inadequately to conventional therapies.
Important Safety Information
Warnings
SKYRIZI is associated with increased risks of infections and may activate tuberculosis in patients with a history of tuberculosis. There have also been reports of malignant tumors, although it is unclear whether they are causally related to SKYRIZI. Before starting treatment with SKYRIZI, fully consider the use of phototherapies or other existing systemic therapies (except biologics).
Contraindications
SKYRIZI is contraindicated in patients with serious infection, active tuberculosis, or with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of SKYRIZI.
Precautions for Use
SKYRIZI is associated with increased risk of infections. Thus, patients undergoing treatment with SKYRIZI should be observed carefully, with attention paid to any onset or worsening of infections. Additional attention should be paid to the occurrence of side effects, including infections, in the elderly.
Before administering SKYRIZI, confirm whether a patient has a tuberculous infection by detailed medical interview about tuberculosis and performing a chest X-ray exam, an interferon-γ release assay or a tuberculin test, or a chest CT scan, as appropriate, among other tests.
A risk of developing infection associated with live vaccines cannot be ruled out. Thus, no live vaccines are to be given to patients undergoing treatment with SKYRIZI.
The safety and efficacy of the concomitant use of SKYRIZI and other biologic have not been established and, therefore, should be avoided. Also, if another biologic is switched to SKYRIZI, the patient should be carefully monitored for signs of infection.
Occurrence of skin malignancy and malignancies other than skin are reported from clinical studies.
Adverse Reactions
Clinically significant adverse reactions were serious infection (sepsis, osteomyelitis, pyelonephritis and meningitis bacterial) (0.7%) and serious hypersensitivity (0.1%) such as anaphylaxis. Adverse reactions ≥1% were upper respiratory tract infection, tinea infection, headache and injection site reaction.

Earlier this month, the Company also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
Ozanimod is an investigational compound that is not approved for any use in any country.
About SUNBEAM™
SUNBEAM is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ozanimod (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI respectively) against weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex®) for at least a 12-month treatment period. The study included 1,346 people living with RMS across 152 sites in 20 countries.
The primary endpoint of the trial was annualized relapse rates (ARR) during the treatment period. The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months, number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 12 and percent change from baseline in whole brain volume at month 12. Cortical grey and thalamic volume changes were also prospectively assessed versus active comparator.
An analysis of the time to onset of 3-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.
About RADIANCE™
RADIANCE Part B is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ozanimod (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI respectively) against weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex®) over a 24-month treatment period. The study included 1,320 people living with RMS across 150 sites in 21 countries.
The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR over 24 months. The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 24 months, number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 24 and percent change from baseline in whole brain volume at month 24. Cortical grey and thalamic volume changes were also prospectively assessed versus active comparator.
An analysis of the time to onset of 3-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.
About Ozanimod
Ozanimod is an oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, which binds with high affinity selectively to S1P subtypes 1 (S1P1) and 5 (S1P5). Ozanimod causes lymphocyte retention in lymphoid tissues. The mechanism by which ozanimod exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown, but may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.
Ozanimod is in development for immune-inflammatory indications including RMS, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves. The myelin damage disrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Ultimately, the nerves themselves may deteriorate — a process that’s currently irreversible. Signs and symptoms vary widely, depending on the amount of damage and the nerves affected. Some people living with MS may lose the ability to walk independently, while others experience long periods of remission during which they develop no new symptoms. MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. and approximately 2.5 million people worldwide.
RMS is characterized by clearly defined attacks of worsening neurologic function. These attacks — often called relapses, flare-ups or exacerbations — are followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remissions), during which symptoms improve partially or completely with no apparent progression of disease. RMS is the most common disease course at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 85 percent of patients are initially diagnosed with RMS, compared with 10-15 percent with progressive forms of the disease.

11520,Novartis' Mayzent (siponimod) Receives FDA's Approval for Patients with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS)ï»¿,"Novartis receives FDA approval for Mayzent (siponimod), the first oral drug to treat secondary progressive MS with active disease","The approval is based on P-III EXPAND study results assessing Mayzent vs PBO in 1,651 patients with SPMS from 31 countries aged 48yrs.
 P-III study results: reduction in risk of three-month & six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) 21% & 26%, 33% reduction with relapse activity in the two years, 55% reduction in annualized relapse rate (ARR), limited increase of T2 lesion volume by ~80, 89% free from gadolinium-enhancing lesions
 Mayzent (siponimod) is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator binds to S1P1 and S1P5 receptors and is approved for relapsing forms of MS, including SPMS with active disease, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)","Mayzent (siponimod) is the first and only treatment specifically approved for patients with active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) in over 15 years[1]
Up to 80% of patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) will develop SPMS[2]; Mayzent addresses a critical unmet need for RRMS patients in transition and those with active SPMS who have transitioned 
Approval is based on the Phase III EXPAND trial, the largest controlled clinical study of SPMS patients, showing Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of disease progression, including impact on physical disability and cognitive decline[3] 
Mayzent is approved across the MS spectrum for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), RRMS and active SPMS, with most patients not requiring a first dose observation
Basel, Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Mayzent® (siponimod) for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, including secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)*. SPMS is a debilitating form of multiple sclerosis (MS) characterized by progressive and irreversible neurological disability[4]. Mayzent is expected to be available in the US in approximately one week**. Patients will not require a first dose observation (FDO, cardiac monitoring upon initiation) unless they have certain pre-existing cardiac conditions.
“One of the most important aims of MS treatment is delaying disability progression and preserving cognition,” said Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “With Mayzent, SPMS patients with active disease will have access to the first effective oral therapy directed towards disease progression, even when MS transitions to a stage where deterioration is less dependent on the usual relapse activity. Mayzent is a testament to the Novartis mission to reimagine medicine. We are delighted that our ongoing commitment to stop MS has led to a much awaited treatment for these patients in need.”
Most patients transition from RRMS to SPMS over time[2]. Therefore, starting therapy early is critical for patients to help slow the rate of disability progression. Disability progression most frequently includes – but is not limited to – an impact on ambulation, which could lead to patients needing a walking aid or a wheelchair, bladder dysfunction and cognitive decline[5].
“We are grateful that there is a new treatment option for adults with active secondary progressive MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, US National MS Society. “We are hopeful this approval will stimulate a conversation between patients and healthcare professionals about disability progression after relapsing remitting MS and its early management.”
The approval of Mayzent is based on groundbreaking data from the Phase III EXPAND study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, comparing the efficacy and safety of Mayzent versus placebo in people living with SPMS. Patients enrolled in EXPAND were representative of a typical SPMS population: at study initiation, patients had a mean age of 48 years, had been living with MS for approximately 16 years and more than 50% had a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6.0 and relied on a walking aid[3]. Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of three-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) (primary endpoint; 21% reduction versus placebo, p=0.013; 33% reduction versus placebo in patients with relapse activity in the two years prior to screening, p=0.0100)[3]. Additionally, Mayzent meaningfully delayed the risk of six-month CDP (26% versus placebo, p=0.0058) and reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 55%[3]. Furthermore, EXPAND showed significant favorable outcomes in other relevant measures of MS disease activity, including cognition, MRI disease activity and brain volume loss (brain shrinkage)[3].
Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were headache, hypertension, and transaminase increase.
“With the approval of Mayzent, we now have a much-needed therapeutic option to address SPMS with active disease,” said EXPAND Steering Committee member Bruce Cree, MD, PhD, MAS, Clinical Research Director and George A. Zimmermann Endowed Professor in Multiple Sclerosis, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine. “Importantly, healthcare professionals now have even more reason to help patients identify changing symptoms and uncover early signs of progression.”
Novartis is committed to bringing Mayzent to patients worldwide, and additional regulatory filings are currently underway with other health authorities outside the US. Regulatory action for Mayzent in the European Union is anticipated in late 2019, with additional regulatory action anticipated in Switzerland, Japan, Australia and Canada this year.
*Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is defined as a first episode of neurologic symptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation or demyelination in the central nervous system[6].
**Time of availability may vary as healthcare providers integrate Mayzent into their practices.
About the EXPAND Study 
EXPAND is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study, comparing the efficacy and safety of Mayzent versus placebo in people with SPMS with varying levels of disability, EDSS scores of 3·0-6·5[3]. It is the largest randomized, controlled study in SPMS to date, including 1,651 people with a diagnosis of SPMS from 31 countries[3]. Mayzent demonstrated a safety profile that was overall consistent with the known effects of S1P receptor modulation. It reduced the risk of three-month CDP by a statistically significant 21% (p=0.013; primary endpoint)[3]. CDP was defined as a 1-point increase in EDSS, if the baseline score was 3·0 – 5·0, or a 0·5-point increase, if the baseline score was 5·5 – 6·5[3]. Key secondary endpoints data included: no significant difference in the T25FW, and had a limited increase of T2 lesion volume by approximately 80% as compared to placebo. Additional secondary endpoints included a relative reduction in the ARR by 55%, and compared to placebo, more patients were free from gadolinium-enhancing lesions (89%) and from new or enlarging T2 lesions (57%)[3].
About Mayzent® (siponimod)
Mayzent is a next generation, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Mayzent selectively binds to S1P1 and S1P5 receptors. In relation to the S1P1 receptor, it prevents the lymphocytes from egressing the lymph nodes and as a consequence, from entering the CNS of patients with MS. This leads to the anti-inflammatory effects of Mayzent[3]. Mayzent also enters the CNS and directly binds to the S1P5 and S1P1 sub-receptors on specific cells in the CNS (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes)[7] to promote re-myelination and prevent inflammation.
About Multiple Sclerosis
MS is a chronic disorder of the CNS that affects around 2.3 million people worldwide[2]. There are three main forms of MS: RRMS (the most common form of the condition at diagnosis), SPMS and primary progressive MS (PPMS)[8]. MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss[9].
SPMS follows an initial form of RRMS, which accounts for approximately 85% of all MS diagnoses, and is characterized by gradual worsening of neurological function over time[3]. This leads to a progressive accumulation of neurological disability. There remains a high unmet need for safe and effective treatments to help delay disability progression in SPMS with active disease (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity)[4].
Novartis in Neuroscience
Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological conditions where there is a high unmet need. We are committed to supporting patients and physicians in multiple disease areas, including MS, migraine, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and have a promising pipeline in MS, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy and specialty neurology.

11596,ï»¿AstraZeneca's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) Receives MHLW's Approval for Type-1 Diabetes (T1D) in Japan,Forxiga approved in Japan for type-1 diabetes,"The approval is based on P-III DEPICT & D1695C00001 study results assessing Forxiga (5/10 mg) vs PBO in patients with T1D inadequately controlled by insulin for 28 to 52 wks.
 The study resulted in meeting its 1EPs & 2EPs as reductions in average blood glucose levels HbA1c, weight and total daily insulin dose for 24 wks.
 Forxiga (dapagliflozinm, qd, PO) is a novel inhibitor of human sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) approved by European Commission on Mar 20, 2019 and is currently under review by the US FDA as an adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with expected results in H2’19","The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved Forxiga (dapagliflozin) as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin for adults with type-1 diabetes (T1D).
Elisabeth Björk, Senior Vice President, Head of late Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism, R&D BioPharmaceuticals, said: “This approval of Forxiga in Japan means that people with type-1 diabetes whose glucose levels are not adequately controlled with insulin alone now have a new oral treatment option available to them. Forxiga will help address a significant unmet need in this patient population, and this approval in type-1 diabetes builds on the well-established clinical profile of Forxiga.”
The approval is based on data from the Phase III DEPICT clinical programme and a dedicated trial in Japanese patients (D1695C00001). Results showed that Forxiga, when given as an oral treatment in addition to adjustable insulin in patients with inadequately-controlled T1D, demonstrated significant and clinically-meaningful reductions from baseline in average blood glucose levels HbA1c (primary endpoint), weight and total daily insulin dose (secondary endpoints) at 24 weeks1,2,3, at both 5mg and 10mg doses.
The safety profile of Forxiga in these T1D trials was consistent with its well-established profile in type-2 diabetes (T2D), with the exception of a higher number of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events in Forxiga-treated patients versus placebo. DKA is a known complication for adults with T1D that affects those with T1D more frequently than with T2D. Forxiga is already indicated as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapy in adults with T2D to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise.
Forxiga was approved by the European Commission on 20 March as an adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with T1D, and the medicine is under regulatory review in the US for the same indication, with a decision expected in the second half of 2019.
About type-1 diabetes
T1D is a chronic disease in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Approximately five percent of people living with diabetes have type-1. The condition is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells in the pancreas which make insulin.4 Different factors, including genetics and some viruses, may contribute to type-1 diabetes.5
About the DEPICT clinical programme
The DEPICT (Dapagliflozin Evaluation in Patients with Inadequately Controlled Type 1 Diabetes) clinical trial programme consists of two trials: DEPICT-1 and DEPICT-2 which are 24-week, randomised, double-blinded, parallel-controlled trials designed to assess the effects of Forxiga 5mg or 10mg on glycaemic control in patients with T1D inadequately controlled by insulin. All patients were evaluated at week 24 and after a 28-week extension (52 weeks in total).
About Forxiga
Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral once-daily selective inhibitor of human sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) indicated as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction, as an adjunct to diet and exercise in adults with T2D. Forxiga has a robust clinical trial programme of more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in over 35,000 patients, as well as more than 1.8 million patient-years’ experience. Outside T2D, Forxiga is also approved in T1D in the EU.

FOSTER CITY, Calif.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) announced today that Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved Biktarvy® (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF), a once-daily single tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy® (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg; FTC/TAF) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone, and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. Biktarvy is the first HIV product that Gilead will launch and commercialize in Japan directly through its local subsidiary, Gilead Sciences K.K.
In the United States, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B. See below for U.S. Important Safety Information as well as the Biktarvy Indication.
The approval of Biktarvy is supported by data from four Phase 3 studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. The trials are comprised of a diverse population of 2,415 participants on Biktarvy or an active comparator, including a wide range of adult age groups and races/ethnicities. Biktarvy met its primary objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies. Through 48 weeks, no participants in any of the four studies developed treatment-emergent virologic resistance while taking Biktarvy, no patients discontinued Biktarvy due to renal adverse events and there were no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy or Fanconi syndrome. The most common adverse reactions in patients taking Biktarvy were diarrhea, nausea and headache.
“Gilead is pleased that Biktarvy, our latest HIV treatment innovation, will be made available to people living with HIV in Japan,” said John McHutchison, AO, MD, Chief Scientific Officer, and Head of Research and Development, Gilead Sciences. “In multiple clinical trials, Biktarvy has demonstrated high efficacy and a high barrier to resistance. With convenient dosing and few pre-screening or ongoing monitoring requirements, it has the potential to simplify treatment initiation, and follow-up over time.”
“Gilead’s operations in Japan have expanded significantly over the years and we are pleased to now be able to bring our longstanding experience and commitment as a global leader in HIV treatment to the Japanese HIV community,” said Luc Hermans, M.D., President and Representative Director, Gilead Sciences, K.K. “Biktarvy adds an important new treatment option to our portfolio of medicines for people living with HIV in Japan.”
Biktarvy does not cure HIV infection or AIDS.
IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR BIKTARVY
BOXED WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of Biktarvy. Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue Biktarvy. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.
Contraindications

Coadministration: Do not use Biktarvy with dofetilide or rifampin.
Warnings and precautions

Drug interactions: See Contraindications and Drug Interactions sections. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during Biktarvy therapy and monitor for adverse reactions.
Immune reconstitution syndrome, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, has been reported.
New onset or worsening renal impairment: Cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs. In clinical trials of Biktarvy, there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT). Do not initiate Biktarvy in patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min. Patients with impaired renal function and/or taking nephrotoxic agents (including NSAIDs) are at increased risk of renal-related adverse reactions. Discontinue Biktarvy in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.
Renal monitoring: Prior to or when initiating Biktarvy and during therapy, assess serum creatinine, CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients as clinically appropriate. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC and TDF. Discontinue Biktarvy if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity develop, including hepatomegaly and steatosis in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.
Adverse reactions

Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%; all grades) in clinical studies through week 96 were diarrhea (6%), nausea (6%), and headache (5%).
Drug interactions

Prescribing information: Consult the full prescribing information for Biktarvy for more information on Contraindications, Warnings, and potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments.
Enzymes/transporters: Drugs that induce P-gp or induce both CYP3A and UGT1A1 can substantially decrease the concentration of components of Biktarvy. Drugs that inhibit P-gp, BCRP, or inhibit both CYP3A and UGT1A1 may significantly increase the concentrations of components of Biktarvy. Biktarvy can increase the concentration of drugs that are substrates of OCT2 or MATE1.
Drugs affecting renal function: Coadministration of Biktarvy with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC and tenofovir and the risk of adverse reactions.
Pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancy: There is insufficient human data on the use of Biktarvy during pregnancy. An Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has been established. Available data from the APR for FTC shows no difference in the rates of birth defects compared with a US reference population.
Lactation: Women infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed, due to the potential for HIV-1 transmission.
Dosage and administration

Dosage: 1 tablet taken once daily with or without food.
Renal impairment: Not recommended in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min.
Hepatic impairment: Not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Prior to or when initiating: Test patients for HBV infection.
Prior to or when initiating, and during treatment: As clinically appropriate, assess serum creatinine, CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, assess serum phosphorus.
U.S. INDICATION
Biktarvy is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) on a stable ARV regimen for ≥3 months with no history of treatment failure and no known resistance to any component of Biktarvy.

11611,ï»¿Jazz Pharmaceuticals Reports Results of JZP-258 in P-III Study for Narcolepsy Patients with Cataplexy and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness,Jazz Pharmaceuticals Announces Positive Top-line Results from Phase 3 Study of JZP-258 in Adult Narcolepsy Patients with Cataplexy and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness,"The P-III study involves assessing JZP-258 vs PBO in 201 patients with narcolepsy + cataplexy prior treated with Xyrem, naive to Xyrem, or with/without anti-cataplectic treatments
 The P-III study results: met its 1EPs & 2EPs; reduction in no. of cataplexy attacks in a week and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score
 JZP-258 is an oxybate therapy targeting GABAB receptor with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92% less sodium than Xyrem (sodium oxybate) and is evaluated for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy & idiopathic hypersomnia. Jazz also plans to file NDA for JZP-258 based on above results","JZP-258 achieves primary and key secondary endpoints demonstrating highly statistically significant differences in weekly number of cataplexy attacks and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores compared to placebo
DUBLIN, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced positive top-line results from the global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of JZP-258 for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult patients with narcolepsy. JZP-258 is a novel oxybate product candidate with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92% less sodium than Xyrem®(sodium oxybate).
The Phase 3 study demonstrated highly statistically significant differences in the primary endpoint that measured the change in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks and the key secondary endpoint of change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score with JZP-258 compared to placebo. In this study, patients were randomized to either continue JZP-258 or to receive placebo. Patients randomized to JZP-258 showed clinically meaningful maintenance of efficacy for both cataplexy and EDS, while a statistically significant worsening for both cataplexy and ESS endpoints was observed in the placebo group compared with JZP-258.
The safety profile of JZP-258 is consistent with sodium oxybate. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients who received JZP-258 were headache, nausea, dizziness, cataplexy, nasopharyngitis, decreased appetite, influenza, diarrhea and vomiting. Two patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered by the investigator to be treatment related.
Jazz will submit the Phase 3 study data for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. Data from the completed Phase 3 study and interim data from the ongoing 24-week open-label, safety study will be included in the planned submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“Jazz is committed to developing new treatment options that serve unmet needs for patients living with sleep disorders, including JZP-258, a novel oxybate product candidate with 92% less sodium than sodium oxybate,” said Jed Black, M.D., senior vice president, Sleep and CNS Medicine at Jazz Pharmaceuticals and adjunct professor, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. “We are deeply grateful to the patients and investigators who participated in this study, and we will meet with the FDA to discuss the Phase 3 results in narcolepsy and our NDA submission plans, with the goal of making JZP-258 available to narcolepsy patients.”
“Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating disease and is associated with an increased risk of comorbidities,” said Michael Thorpy, M.D., director, Sleep-Wake Disorders Center, Montefiore Health System in Bronx, New York. “An extensive body of evidence has established that excessive consumption of sodium is linked with an increased risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease and other adverse outcomes. Patients with narcolepsy may require lifelong medication, and there is a need for a new, low-sodium oxybate formulation.”
About the Phase 3 Study
The Phase 3 study of JZP-258 was a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of JZP-258 in the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. The primary endpoint was the change in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks and the key secondary endpoint was the change in the ESS score from JZP-258 and placebo over the randomized-withdrawal period. The study enrolled 201 patients and randomized 134 patients, comprising a heterogeneous patient population which included those previously treated with Xyrem, naïve to Xyrem, and with or without other anti-cataplectic treatments. A randomized-withdrawal study design aims to measure efficacy – specifically, maintenance of effect – for patients who remain on active treatment and worsening for patients who switch to placebo.
The study design included a titration period of up to 12 weeks, a JZP-258 stable-dose period of two weeks, followed by a 1:1 randomization to either JZP-258 or placebo for 2 weeks. After the completion of the double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period, patients had the opportunity to receive JZP-258 in an optional 24 week open-label safety extension period. More information about the study design is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT03030599).
About JZP-258
JZP-258 is an investigational product being evaluated in adult patients for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, as well as for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia. JZP-258 is a novel oxybate product candidate with a unique composition of cations resulting in 92% less sodium than Xyrem® (sodium oxybate). The mechanism of action of JZP-258 is not fully understood, but it is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of JZP-258 on sleep/wake symptoms are mediated through modulation of GABAB during sleep.
About Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.1 It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the United States, with symptoms typically appearing in childhood. It is estimated that more than 50% of patients with narcolepsy have not been diagnosed.2 Studies have shown it may take 10 years or more for people with narcolepsy to receive a diagnosis.3 Excessive daytime sleepiness is the primary symptom of narcolepsy and is present in all people with the disorder.4 There are five primary symptoms of narcolepsy, including excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hallucinations, sleep paralysis and sleep disruption.5 While all patients with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness, they may not experience all five symptoms.6,7 Excessive daytime sleepiness is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in unplanned lapses into sleep or drowsiness.2,4,8
About Cataplexy
Cataplexy, the most specific symptom of narcolepsy, is the sudden, generally brief (<2 minutes) loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness. It is usually triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, surprise, or anger.6,7,9 Although many emotions can potentially lead to cataplexy, those associated with mirth are usually the most potent.6 Cataplexy occurs in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy.10 Presentation differs widely among patients, ranging from sporadic partial attacks triggered by laughter to frequent complete collapse brought about by a variety of emotions.6,7 Complete collapse is generally less common.7 More commonly, episodes of cataplexy involve only certain muscle groups, such as arms and legs (e.g., knees buckling), the head and neck (e.g., head dropping), or the face and jaw (e.g., sagging, slurred speech, eyelid drooping).6,7,9,10

The European Commission (EC) has approved Forxiga (dapagliflozin) for use in type-1 diabetes (T1D) as an adjunct to insulin in patients with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy. This is the first approval of Forxiga for the treatment of patients with T1D.
Elisabeth Björk, Senior Vice President, Head of late Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism, R&D BioPharmaceuticals, said: “Forxiga is the first oral medicine approved in Europe as an adjunct to insulin for people living with type-1 diabetes whose glucose levels are not adequately controlled with insulin alone. We look forward to bringing Forxiga to a patient population that has not had any approved oral medicines available before.”
The approval is based on data from the Phase III DEPICT clinical programme for Forxiga in T1D. The short-term (24 week) and long-term (52 week) data from DEPICT-1, along with the short-term data from DEPICT-2, showed that Forxiga 5mg daily, when given as an oral adjunct to adjustable insulin in patients with inadequately-controlled T1D, demonstrated significant and clinically-meaningful reductions from baseline in average blood glucose levels HbA1c (primary endpoint), weight and total daily insulin dose (secondary endpoints) at 24 and 52 weeks.1,2,3
The safety profile of Forxiga in these T1D trials was consistent with its well-established profile in type-2 diabetes (T2D), with the exception of a higher number of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events in Forxiga-treated patients. DKA is a known complication for adults with T1D that affects those with T1D more frequently than with T2D. Forxiga is already indicated as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapy in adults with T2D to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction, as an adjunct to diet and exercise.
Forxiga is currently under regulatory review in Japan and the US for use as an adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with T1D, with a decision expected in the first and second half of 2019, respectively.
About type-1 diabetes
T1D is a chronic disease in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Approximately five percent of people living with diabetes have type-1. The condition is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells in the pancreas which make insulin.4 Different factors, including genetics and some viruses, may contribute to type-1 diabetes.5
About the DEPICT clinical programme
The DEPICT (Dapagliflozin Evaluation in Patients with Inadequately Controlled Type 1 Diabetes) clinical trial programme consists of two clinical trials: DEPICT-1 (NCT02268214) and DEPICT-2 (NCT02460978). DEPICT-1 and DEPICT-2 are 24-week, randomised, double-blinded, parallel-controlled trials designed to assess the effects of Forxiga 5mg or 10mg on glycaemic control in patients with T1D inadequately controlled by insulin. All patients were evaluated at week 24 and after a 28-week extension (52 weeks in total). Forxiga 10mg has not been approved for the treatment of T1D.
About Forxiga
Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class, oral once-daily selective inhibitor of human sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) indicated as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy to improve glycaemic control, with the additional benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction, as an adjunct to diet and exercise in adults with T2D. Forxiga has a robust clinical trial programme of more than 35 completed and ongoing Phase IIb/III trials in over 35,000 patients, as well as more than 1.8 million patient-years’ experience.

 The study resulted in meeting 1EP with 82% patients reached threshold ≥ 6×106 CD34 cells/kg in 2 apheresis sessions, 64% reached threshold ≥ 6×106 CD34 cells/kg in single apheresis, successful engraftment with BL-8040 mobilized HSCs was observed
 BL-8040 is a cancer therapy leading to mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood targeted for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. BioLineRx in-licensed BL-8040 from Biokine Therapeutics and was developed with the name BKT-140","Results presented as oral presentation at 45th Annual Meeting of European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation
Tel Aviv- BioLineRx Ltd. (NASDAQ/TASE:BLRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology, announced today that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) mobilized by BL-8040 in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were successfully engrafted in all 11 patients participating in the Part 1, lead-in period of the GENESIS trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial comparing BL-8040 and G-CSF to G-CSF alone, in mobilization of HSCs for autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma patients. These data follow previously announced successful mobilization data which led the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to recommend proceeding to the randomized placebo-controlled Part 2 of the study.
“Autologous HSC transplantation in multiple myeloma has been shown to improve overall survival compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, the effectiveness of the treatment relies, in part, upon the ability to collect an adequate amount of HSCs, typically obtained from peripheral blood,” explained Dr. John F. DiPersio, Chief, Division of Oncology at the Washington University School of Medicine, and lead investigator of the study. “Current practice involves mobilizing HSCs from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood, after which the cells are collected by apheresis. Results so far show that mobilizing HSCs with a single BL-8040 dose combined with G-CSF is highly effective compared to using G-CSF alone, which typically requires up to 8 injections and multiple apheresis days. Furthermore, engraftment of the cells in all evaluable patients was successful. This is a very encouraging result which, if corroborated in the placebo-controlled part of the trial, will be of great value to patients as well as to the medical community.”
The results, detailed in an abstract titled GENESIS – A Phase III Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial, Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of BL-8040 and G-CSF in Mobilization of HSCs for Autologous Transplantation in Multiple Myeloma were presented in an oral presentation at the 45th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT 2019), today, March 27, 2019, in Frankfurt, Germany.
Results of the first 11 patients show that 9/11 patients (82%) reached the primary endpoint threshold of ≥ 6×106 CD34 cells/kg with only one dose of BL-8040 and in up to 2 apheresis sessions. Furthermore, 7/11 patients (64%) reached the threshold of ≥ 6×106 CD34 cells/kg in a single apheresis session only. In addition, all 11 patients reached the desired threshold in 4 or less apheresis days, and for all patients with available data (9/11), successful engraftment with BL-8040 mobilized HSCs was observed, with time to engraftment and graft durability comparable to standard of care mobilization regimens.
About the GENESIS Study
The GENESIS study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BL-8040 in combination with G-CSF, compared to placebo and G-CSF, for the mobilization of CD34 HSCs for autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma patients. The placebo-controlled part is designed to include 177 patients in more than 25 centers. Treatment will include 5 days of G-CSF, with a single dose of BL-8040 or placebo on day 4, and with the option to expand treatment to up to 8 days of G-CSF and up to 2 doses of BL-8040. Apheresis for collection of CD34 cells will be performed on day 5. An additional 3 apheresis sessions may be conducted if needed in order to reach the goal of ≥ 6×106 mobilized CD34 cells/kg.
The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of a single dose of BL-8040 in combination with G-CSF, over placebo and G-CSF, in the mobilization of ≥ 6×106 CD34 cells/kg in up to 2 apheresis sessions, in preparation for autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma patients. Secondary objectives include time to engraftment of neutrophils and platelets, durability of the engraftment, as well as safety and other efficacy parameters.
About BL-8040
BL-8040 is a short synthetic peptide for stem cell mobilization and for treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. It functions as a high-affinity best-in-class antagonist for CXCR4, a chemokine receptor that is directly involved in the retention of stems cells in the bone marrow, as well as tumor progression, angiogenesis, metastasis and cell survival. CXCR4 is over-expressed in more than 70% of human cancers and its expression often correlates with disease severity.
HSCs express CXCR4 and are retained in the protective bone marrow niche via binding to CXCL12 (also known as SDF-1). Blocking of the CXCR4-SDF1 interaction by BL-8040 leads to the mobilization of HSCs into the peripheral blood. In a number of clinical and pre-clinical studies, BL-8040 has shown robust mobilization of HSCs.
In a number of clinical and pre-clinical studies, BL-8040 has shown robust mobilization of cancer cells and immune-cells, sensitization of cancer cells to chemo- and bio-based anti-cancer therapies, and direct anti-cancer effect by inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis). BL-8040 was licensed by BioLineRx from Biokine Therapeutics and was previously developed under the name BKT-140.

 The irregular rhythm notification function was assessed in the Apple Heart study enrolled with 400,000 candidates and demonstrated 0.5% irregular pulse notifications, identified heart rate irregularities with confirmed AFib 
 Watch Series 4 with OS 5.2 possess health app with irregular rhythm notification enables customers to produce ECG on demand & check user’s heart rhythm using the optical heart sensor, available in 19 EU countries and has received FDA’s De Novo clearance in the US","The ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4, a direct-to-consumer product that enables customers to take an electrocardiogram right from their wrist, is available in Hong Kong and 19 European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In addition to receiving De Novo clearance in the US from the FDA, the ECG app1 and irregular rhythm notification2 are now CE marked and cleared in the European Economic Area.
Part of the free watchOS 5.2 software update, the ECG app can capture heart rhythm on demand in a moment when users experience symptoms such as a rapid or skipped heart beat and help provide clinically important data to physicians. The irregular rhythm notification feature on Apple Watch occasionally checks heart rhythm in the background and sends a notification if an irregular heart rhythm that appears to be atrial fibrillation (AFib) is identified.
The ECG app and irregular rhythm notification feature can alert users to signs of AFib. Left untreated, AFib is one of the leading conditions that can result in stroke, the second most common cause of death around the world.
“We’ve seen the ECG app and irregular rhythm notifications on Apple Watch have meaningful impact on our customers across the United States,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “We are excited to bring these features to customers in Europe and Hong Kong, giving them access to empowering information about their heart health.”
ECG App
New electrodes built into the back crystal and Digital Crown on Apple Watch Series 4 work together with the ECG app to enable customers to take an ECG similar to a single-lead electrocardiogram. Taking an ECG recording is as simple as launching the ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 and touching the Digital Crown, which completes the circuit and allows electrical signals across the user’s heart to be measured. After 30 seconds, the ECG app can classify the user’s heart rhythm as AFib or sinus rhythm.
All recordings, their associated classifications and any noted symptoms are stored securely in the Health app on iPhone, from which users can share a PDF of the results with physicians.
A clinical trial of around 600 participants found the ECG app on Apple Watch demonstrated 98.3 percent sensitivity in classifying AFib and 99.6 percent specificity in classifying sinus rhythm in classifiable recordings when compared to a gold standard 12-lead ECG administered by a cardiologist. 87.8 percent of recordings in the study could be classified by the ECG app.
Irregular Rhythm Notification
Available on Apple Watch Series 1 or later, the irregular rhythm notification feature will occasionally check the user’s heart rhythm in the background for signs of an irregular heart rhythm using the optical heart sensor. If an irregular rhythm is detected on five rhythm checks over a minimum of 65 minutes, Apple Watch alerts the user with a notification.
The irregular rhythm notification feature was recently studied in the Apple Heart Study. With over 400,000 participants, the Apple Heart Study was the largest screening study on atrial fibrillation ever conducted, and one of the largest cardiovascular trials to date.
Released March 16, 2019, Stanford Medicine’s results from the Apple Heart Study found “only 0.5 percent of participants received irregular pulse notifications, an important finding given concerns about potential over-notification.” The study further found evidence to support wearable technology has the ability to safely identify heart rate irregularities, which subsequent testing confirmed to be atrial fibrillation.
To enable these new heart features, customers will open the Health app on iPhone where they will be presented with details about who can use these features, what the features can and cannot do, what results users may get, how to interpret those results and clear instructions for what to do if users are feeling symptoms that require immediate medical attention.
watchOS 5.2 will be available today.

Important Information for Contact Lens Wearers: ACUVUE Brand Contact Lenses are only available by prescription for vision correction as a daily wear lens with two-week recommended replacement. An eye care professional will determine whether contact lenses are right for you. Although rare, serious eye problems can develop while wearing contact lenses. To help avoid these problems, follow the wear and replacement schedule and lens care instructions provided by your eye doctor. Do not wear contact lenses if you have an eye infection, or experience eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, redness or other eye problems. If one of these conditions occurs, remove the lens and contact your eye doctor immediately. For more information on proper wear, care and safety, talk to your eye care professional and ask for a Patient Instruction Guide, call 1-800-843-2020 or visit Acuvue.com.
†Helps protect against transmission of harmful UV radiation to the cornea and into the eye.
‡WARNING: UV-absorbing contact lenses are NOT substitutes for protective UV-absorbing eyewear such as UV-absorbing goggles or sunglasses because they do not completely cover the eye and surrounding area. You should continue to use UV-absorbing eyewear as directed. NOTE: Long-term exposure to UV radiation is one of the risk factors associated with cataracts. Exposure is based on a number of factors such as environmental conditions (altitude, geography, cloud cover) and personal factors (extent and nature of outdoor activities). UV-blocking contact lenses help provide protection against harmful UV radiation. However, clinical studies have not been done to demonstrate that wearing UV-blocking contact lenses reduces the risk of developing cataracts or other eye disorders. Consult your eye care practitioner for more information.

— Filgotinib Safety Profile Consistent With Previously Reported Results —

FOSTER CITY, Calif. and MECHELEN, Belgium- regulated information– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) and Galapagos NV (Euronext & NASDAQ: GLPG) today announced Week 24 results of FINCH 3, an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled Phase 3 study of filgotinib, an investigational, oral, selective JAK1 inhibitor, in adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. FINCH 3 evaluated filgotinib in combination with methotrexate and as monotherapy in MTX-naïve patients. The study achieved its primary endpoint in the proportion of patients achieving anAmerican College of Rheumatology 20 percent response (ACR20) at Week 24. The proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint of ACR20 response at Week 24 was significantly higher for filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX and filgotinib 100 mg plus MTX compared with MTX alone.
The proportion of patients achieving ACR50, ACR70, and clinical remission (DAS28(CRP) < 2.6) at Week 24 was also significantly higher for patients receiving once-daily filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg plus MTX compared with patients receiving MTX alone. Additionally, those who received filgotinib experienced greater reduction in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) compared with those receiving MTX alone at Week 24. Filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy inhibited the progression of structural damage at Week 24 compared with MTX alone as assessed by modified total Sharp score (mTSS).
Top-line FINCH 3 efficacy† data are summarized in the table below:

The safety profile of filgotinib in FINCH 3 is consistent with prior studies up to Week 24. Serious adverse events occurred in 4.1 percent, 2.4 percent, 4.8 percent, and 2.9 percent of patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX, filgotinib 100 mg plus MTX, filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy and MTX alone, respectively. There was one venous thrombotic event (in the MTX group), five cases of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (two in the filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX group, one in the filgotinib 200 mg group and two in the MTX group) and one malignancy (in the MTX group). There was one death, reported in the filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX group. Serious infections occurred in 1.0 percent, 1.0 percent, 1.4 percent and 1.0 percent of the patients in the filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX, filgotinib 100 mg plus MTX, filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy and MTX groups, respectively. The proportion of patients reporting herpes zoster was 0.5 percent in each of the treatment groups.
“The FINCH 3 data clearly demonstrate improved efficacy when filgotinib is compared with the use of MTX alone in rheumatoid arthritis patients with earlier stages of disease,” said John McHutchison, AO, MD, Chief Scientific Officer, Head of Research and Development, Gilead Sciences. “These data add to the body of evidence from our broader FINCH clinical study program, reinforcing the potential for filgotinib to address important therapeutic needs in people with rheumatoid arthritis.”
“Additional effective and tolerable treatment options are still needed for people newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis or in the early stages of the disease. This complements the FINCH 1 and FINCH 2 data, underlining the potential of filgotinib as a treatment option across a wide range of patient populations suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer, Galapagos.
Detailed findings from FINCH 3 will be submitted for presentation at a future scientific conference. Filgotinib is an investigational agent and not approved anywhere globally. Its efficacy and safety have not been established.
About FINCH 3
FINCH 3 is an ongoing 52-week randomized, double-blind and active-controlled study examining filgotinib alone and in combination with MTX, enrolling 1,252 adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who are naïve to MTX. Patients were randomized (2:1:1:2) to receive filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX (n=417), filgotinib 100 mg plus MTX (n=207), filgotinib 200 mg alone (n=210) or MTX (n=418). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve an ACR20 response at Week 24.

AstraZeneca to get WW co-development and co-commercialization rights for Daiichi’s trastuzumab deruxtecan (Ex- Japan) with equal cost & profit sharing
 The focus of the collaboration is to develop trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2+ breast and gastric cancer with the expansion of AstraZeneca’s Oncology portfolio
 Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201) is ADC designed to deliver CT to cancer cells and has received FDA’s BT designation & MHLW’s Sakigake designation for HER2+ advanced or m-breast cancer & HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction respectively with its expected FDA filling in Q2’19","This announcement contains inside information
The securities proposed to be offered pursuant to the equity placing referred to herein will not be and have not been registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
 

Companies to accelerate and expand development of trastuzumab deruxtecan across breast and other cancers, with the potential to redefine standard of care
Funding via an equity placement of approximately $3.5bn
Guidance for 2019 Core Earnings Per Share remains unchanged; growing accretion from 2020 to a significant contribution in 2023
AstraZeneca has entered into a global development and commercialisation collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo) for trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201), a proprietary antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and potential new targeted medicine for cancer treatment.
The collaboration is aligned with AstraZeneca’s science-led strategy in Oncology, which is based on four key scientific platforms: tumour drivers & resistance, DNA damage response, Immuno-Oncology and ADCs.
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is currently in development for the treatment of multiple HER2-expressing cancers, including breast and gastric cancer, and in patients with HER2-low expression. In 2017, trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab and have disease progression after trastuzumab emtansine.
A first regulatory submission is scheduled for the second half of 2019 for patients in the advanced or refractory breast cancer setting. Additional development for the treatment of breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric and colorectal cancers is ongoing.
The companies will jointly develop and commercialise trastuzumab deruxtecan worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo will be solely responsible for manufacturing and supply.
Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, said: “We believe that trastuzumab deruxtecan could become a transformative new medicine for the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. In addition, it has the potential to redefine breast cancer treatment as the first therapy for HER2-low expressing tumours. It also has the potential to treat other HER2-mutated or HER2-overexpressing cancers, including lung and colorectal cancers. We are proud to be working with Daiichi Sankyo, a long-term collaborator of AstraZeneca in other disease areas.”
George Nakayama, Representative Director, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Daiichi Sankyo, said: “Trastuzumab deruxtecan is the flagship asset in our oncology pipeline created by our relentless pursuit of science and technology, the most important strengths of our company. Through the strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca, a company with a wealth of global experience and expertise in oncology, we will combine our respective skill sets to maximise the value of trastuzumab deruxtecan and accelerate the establishment of our global oncology business. By aiming to provide new treatment options across a wide range of cancers as soon as possible, we will maximise our contribution to patients with cancer and their families around the world.”
Using Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd proprietary ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan has been designed to deliver chemotherapy selectively to cancer cells and reduce systemic exposure, in contrast to conventional chemotherapy delivery. Data from the ongoing first-time-in-human trial shows strong activity in a number of tumour types. In particular, the strength of the overall response rate and durability of response in patients previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer formed the basis for the Breakthrough Therapy Designation.1
Financial considerations
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo an upfront payment of $1.35bn, half of which is due upon execution, with the remainder payable 12 months later.
Contingent payments of up to $5.55bn include $3.8bn for potential successful achievement of future regulatory and other milestones, as well as $1.75bn for sales-related milestones.
Overall, the transaction will be accounted for as an intangible asset acquisition, recognised initially at the present value of non-contingent consideration, with future milestones capitalised into the intangible asset as they are recognised. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo will share equally development and commercialisation costs as well as profits from trastuzumab deruxtecan worldwide, except for Japan.
Daiichi Sankyo will record sales in the US, certain countries in Europe and certain other markets where Daiichi Sankyo has affiliates. Further to the financial reporting announcement below, profits shared with AstraZeneca will be accounted for as Collaboration Revenue by AstraZeneca (see further below, ‘Financial reporting presentation’).
AstraZeneca is expected to record Product Sales in all other markets worldwide for which profits shared with Daiichi Sankyo will be accounted for as cost of goods sold.
The transaction is expected to be neutral to core earnings in 2019, with growing Core EPS accretion from 2020 and making a significant contribution in 2023. There are no closing conditions to the transaction. The collaboration agreement will become effective on 29 March 2019. The transaction and funding arrangements do not impact the Company’s financial guidance for 2019 as published on 14 February 2019.
The upfront payment and near-term milestones under the transaction will be funded from the proceeds of a new equity placement of approximately $3.5bn, of which more than half will be used to fund this transaction and the ongoing collaboration. A separate announcement will be issued by the Company today on the equity placement.
For the purposes of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rule LR 10.4.1 R (Notification of class 2 transactions), the value of gross assets acquired with the transaction is estimated to be $1.5bn and, in view of the development phase of the medicine, a pre-tax loss of $38m was attributable to trastuzumab deruxtecan during the year to 31 March 2018.
About Trastuzumab deruxtecan
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201; [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in US only) is the lead potential new medicine in the ADC franchise of the Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic agents to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells.
A broad and comprehensive development programme with trastuzumab deruxtecan is underway in North America, Europe and Asia, including five pivotal trials in HER2-expressing breast and gastric cancers. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is also in Phase II development for HER2-expressing advanced colorectal cancer and metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC, and Phase I development in combination with nivolumab for HER2-expressing metastatic breast and bladder cancers.
Trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in 2017 by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab and have disease progression after trastuzumab emtansine. Fast Track Designation was also granted in the US for the treatment of HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer in patients who have progressed after prior treatment with HER2-targeted medicines, including trastuzumab emtansine. Trastuzumab deruxtecan has received Sakigake designation for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a potential new medicine that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Financial reporting presentation
As a result of this announcement, AstraZeneca also updates the presentation of Total Revenue within its Statement of Comprehensive Income. This is effective from 1 January 2019 and will be reflected in the Company’s Q1 2019 financial results that are intended for publication on 26 April 2019.
In 2015, the Company announced a change to the presentation of Total Revenue within its Statement of Comprehensive Income to include Externalisation Revenue. Today’s announcement recognises the growing importance of collaborations to AstraZeneca and will result in income arising from those collaborations being recognised within Total Revenues. The associated costs of collaborations will be recognised in the appropriate expense lines in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Historically, Externalisation Revenue only included income arising from transactions involving AstraZeneca’s medicines. Such income included upfronts, milestones receipts and royalties, as well as other income from collaborations. The updated category of Collaboration Revenue will also include income of a similar nature arising from transactions where AstraZeneca has acquired an interest in a medicine and entered into an active collaboration with the seller.
No prior year restatement of financial results will be required as a result of this change. The change in accounting presentation does not impact the Company’s revenue guidance for 2019.

 RADICAVA (edaravone, IV) is a neuroprotective agent indicated for the treatment of ALS and has received approval in the US, Japan and South Korea in May’17, Jun’15 & Dec’15 respectively for ALS","Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc. (MTPA) today
announced a collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Neurological Clinical
Research Institute (NCRI) to conduct a study designed to identify and measure specific biomarkers
in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
“We are honored to be working with the team at MGH on our first clinical trial in the U.S.,” said
Stephen Apple, M.D., Senior Medical Director, Medical Affairs, MTPA. “This biomarker trial has
sparked exponential interest in the ALS community, and with the help of MGH, we hope to further
our understanding of the potential role these measures may have in evaluating a treatment
response.”
The ALS biomarker study, which will be sponsored by MTPA and led by MGH, has been designed
to have 200 patients complete six cycles (24 weeks) of treatment, and will be conducted at up to 40
sites across the country. Findings may assist with identifying specific biomarkers as quantifiable,
biological, non-clinical measures for the treatment effect of edaravone in people with ALS. The first
biomarker study patient is anticipated to be enrolled late spring of 2019, with early interim analyses
planned for later in the year.
“ALS is a complex disorder with diverse pathophysiology, and we do not currently have validated
biomarkers for diagnosing or following ALS progression,” said study Primary Investigator James
Berry, M.D., M.P.H., MGH NCRI, Boston. “This study will broaden our understanding of numerous
biomarkers that may be associated with ALS, including those for oxidative stress, inflammation,
muscle and neuronal injury and death. It will increase our understanding of ALS and of the biological
effects of edaravone in people with ALS undergoing therapy.”
The biomarker study is a 24-week, prospective, observational, longitudinal, multicenter study. All
participants will be newly prescribed commercial RADICAVA® (edaravone)and, once enrolled in this
study, biomarker and clinical assessments will be obtained prior to initiating RADICAVA, as well as
at start of treatment and at pre-specified time points throughout the study. Patient biomarker data
and disease progression assessments will be compared to samples stored at biorepositories and
progression models, respectively.
2
The study will evaluate the following biomarkers:
 Oxidative stress – 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 8-Isoprostanes, 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT),
8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), urate
 Inflammation – matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
 Neuronal injury and death – neurofilament (Nf) heavy and light chain proteins, urinary
neurotrophin receptor p75
 Muscle injury – creatinine

11851,ï»¿Bluebird Bio's Zynteglo Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Conditional Marketing for Patients with Transfusion-Dependent Î²-Thalassemia (TDT) without Î²0/Î²0 Genotype,bluebird bio Receives Positive Opinion from CHMP for ZYNTEGLO™ (autologous CD34+ cells encoding βA-T87Q-globin gene) Gene Therapy for Patients 12 Years and Older with Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia (TDT) Who Do Not Have β0/β0 Genotype,"The positive opinion is based on P-I/II HGB-205 & Northstar (HGB-204) and P-III Northstar-2 (HGB-207) & Northstar-3 (HGB-212) studies assessing Zynteglo in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) who do not have β0/β0 genotype aged 12 yrs. and older
 Collective data from studies: 80% achieved transfusion independence with median duration of 38 mos.; @6mos. median (min – max) total hemoglobin for patients was 11.9 g/dL
 Zynteglo (autologous CD34+ cells encoding βA-T87Q-globin gene) is a gene therapy, formerly known as LentiGlobin targeted for TDT and reviewed under EMA’s PRIME and Adaptive Pathways programs with its expected European Commission approval in Q2’19","First gene therapy recommended for approval in the EU for TDT

Treatment with ZYNTEGLO has been shown to help eliminate the need for chronic blood transfusions in patients with TDT

ZYNTEGLO is bluebird bio’s first gene therapy submitted for regulatory approval

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.-(Nasdaq:BLUE) announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization for ZYNTEGLO™ (autologous CD34+ cells encoding β A-T87Q-globin gene), a gene therapy for patients 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) who do not have a β0/β0 genotype, for whom hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate but a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related HSC donor is not available. If approved, ZYNTEGLO, formerly referred to as LentiGlobin™ for TDT, will be the first gene therapy to treat TDT.
The CHMP’s positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to grant marketing authorization for ZYNTEGLO in the European Union (EU). A CHMP positive opinion is one of the final steps before the EC decides on whether to authorize a new medicine. A final decision by the EC for ZYNTEGLO is anticipated in the second quarter of 2019.
TDT is a severe genetic disease caused by mutations in the β-globin gene that result in reduced or absent hemoglobin. In order to survive, people with TDT maintain hemoglobin levels through lifelong chronic blood transfusions. These transfusions carry the risk of progressive multi-organ damage due to unavoidable iron overload.
“The goal of treatment with ZYNTEGLO is to enable patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia to produce hemoglobin at sufficient levels to allow lifelong independence from blood transfusions,” said David Davidson, M.D., chief medical officer, bluebird bio. “The positive CHMP opinion for ZYNTEGLO is a crucial step toward providing what would be the first one-time gene therapy for people living with TDT. We share this achievement with the TDT community, patients and clinical investigators whose dedication made it possible. We look forward to the upcoming decision from the European Commission.”
“For many of my patients, living with TDT means a lifetime of chronic blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy and supportive treatments to manage anemia and other serious complications of this disease,” said Professor Franco Locatelli, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy and Director, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Celland Gene Therapy, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù, Rome, Italy. “The burden placed on these patients and their families is significant. It extends beyond immediate health implications to their daily lives, which are affected by the symptoms, hospitalizations and necessary chronic care required for TDT.”
“The present management of TDT, including regular blood transfusions every two to four weeks and daily iron chelation therapy has many psychological and social consequences, including marginalization and isolation. And in many patients TDT-related morbidities can lead to a shortened life span. Therefore, it is with great anticipation and eagerness that the international patient community has closely followed the dynamic rejuvenation of scientific interest and research of gene therapy in TDT over the last few years,” said Dr. Androulla Eleftheriou,Thalassaemia International Federation Executive Director. “Thus, the potential approval of a gene therapy brings hope that we can dramatically change the course of this disease and the health and quality of lives of patients with TDT.”
ZYNTEGLO adds functional copies of a modified form of the β-globin gene (β A-T87Q-globin gene) into a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood) stem cells (HSCs). This means there is no need for donor HSCs from another person as is required for allogeneic HSC transplantation (allo-HSCT). A patient’s HSCs are collected and removed from the body through a process called apheresis. These HSCs are taken to a lab where a lentiviral vector is used to insert the β A-T87Q-globin gene into the patient’s HSCs. This step is called transduction. Before their modified HSCs are returned, the patient receives chemotherapy to prepare their bone marrow for the modified HSCs, which are returned through an infusion. Once a patient has the β A-T87Q-globin gene they have the potential to produce HbAT87Q, which is gene therapy- derived-hemoglobin, at levels that significantly reduce or eliminate the need for transfusions.
“The EMA’s collaborative approach and innovative programs have been instrumental in improving timely access of new medicines to patients with significant unmet needs, like those who are living with TDT,” said Anne-Virginie Eggimann, senior vice president of regulatory science at bluebird bio.
ZYNTEGLO was reviewed under an accelerated assessment timeline as part of the EMA’s Priority Medicines (PRIME) and Adaptive Pathways programs, which support medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options.
Data Supporting Clinical Profile of ZYNTEGLO
The positive CHMP opinion is supported by efficacy, safety and durability data from the Phase 1/2 HGB-205 study and the completed Phase 1/2 Northstar (HGB-204) study as well as available data from the ongoing Phase 3 Northstar-2 (HGB-207) and Northstar-3 (HGB-212) studies, and the long-term follow-up study LTF-303.
As of September 14, 2018, data from Phase 1/2 Northstar showed that 80 percent (n=8/10) of patients who do not have a β0/β0 genotype achieved transfusion independence, meaning they had not received a transfusion for at least 12 months and maintained hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL. These eight patients had maintained transfusion independence for a median duration of 38 months (21 – 44 months) at the time of data cut off.
In the Phase 3 Northstar-2 and Northstar-3 studies, a refined manufacturing process was used to produce ZYNTEGLO and was intended to further improve the clinical results observed in the Northstar study. As of September 14, 2018, the median (min – max) total hemoglobin for patients six months after ZYNTEGLO infusion in the Northstar-2 study (n=10) was 11.9 (8.4, 13.3) g/dL.
Non-serious adverse events (AEs) observed during clinical trials that were attributed to ZYNTEGLO were hot flush, dyspnoea, abdominal pain, pain in extremities and non-cardiac chest pain. One serious adverse event (SAE) of thrombocytopenia was considered possibly related to ZYNTEGLO.
Additional AEs observed in clinical studies were consistent with the known side effects of HSC and bone marrow ablation with busulfan including SAEs of veno-occlusive disease.
ZYNTEGLO continues to be evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 Northstar-2 and Northstar-3 studies and the long-term follow-up study LTF-303.

IFM Tre to receive $310M upfront & $1.265B milestones from Novartis. The transaction is expected to close in Q2’19
 The focus of the acquisition is to expand Novartis’ immunomodulatory portfolio with the addition of IFM Tre’s one clinical (IFM-2427) and two preclinical programs of NLRP3 inhibitors targeting NLRP3 inflammasome to treat multiple metabolic, fibrotic, autoimmune, and neurological diseases
 IFM-2427 is a clinical stage antagonist targeted for chronic inflammatory disorders, including gout, atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)","— Acquisition of IFM Therapeutics subsidiary gives Novartis full rights to one clinical and two pre-clinical NLRP3 antagonist programs
— NLRP3 inhibition offers novel approach to preventing chronic inflammation that drives serious disease
— IFM to receive $310 million upfront, with up to $1.265 billion in milestones for a total of $1.575 billion
(BOSTON,) –IFM Therapeutics (IFM), a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that modulate novel targets in the innate immune system, announced today that it has reached a definitive agreement with Novartis, under which Novartis will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of IFM Tre, a subsidiary company of IFM. Upon the closing of the agreement, IFM will receive $310 million in upfront payments and will be eligible for up to $1.265 billion in milestone payments, for a total of $1.575 billion in total consideration. IFM Tre launched in July 2018, with a focus on developing a suite of NLRP3 antagonists for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
The acquisition will give Novartis full rights to IFM Tre’s portfolio of NLPR3 antagonists, which consists of one clinical and two pre-clinical programs: IFM-2427, a first-in-class, clinical stage systemic antagonist for an array of chronic inflammatory disorders including atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); a pre-clinical stage gut-directed molecule for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; and a pre-clinical stage central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant molecule.
“IFM Tre’s compounds have demonstrated that they can fine-tune the immune system, offering a potentially potent approach for treating a large variety of diseases associated with inflammation,” said Jay Bradner, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. “We look forward to applying our deep expertise in this field to advancing these medicines through the clinic and to patients who need them.”
NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3) is an intracellular innate immune signaling receptor that allows immune cells to detect the presence of pro-inflammatory foreign or endogenous molecules that signal infection, tissue damage or metabolic derangements. These conditions trigger the assembly of a multi-protein complex called an inflammasome, which then initiates an immune response. While this response can be useful for fending off foreign pathogens, abnormal or chronic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is known to cause negative downstream effects and the onset and progression of numerous diseases. IFM Tre’s programs target the innate immune system by suppressing only the inflammation mediated by the NLRP3 pathway, leaving other immune pathways unsuppressed and free to produce inflammatory responses to confront harmful pathogens.
“Since founding IFM in 2015, our team has worked tirelessly to build a portfolio of next-generation small molecule medicines that exploit the innate immune system as a new therapeutic target,” said Gary D. Glick, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of IFM Therapeutics. “Today’s announcement marks a significant milestone in the development of next-generation therapies for serious inflammatory conditions. Based on substantial pre-clinical and translational data, we believe NLRP3 inhibition represents a novel approach to preventing the overactive inflammation that drives the onset and progression of numerous metabolic, fibrotic, autoimmune and neurological diseases. With Novartis we have identified a partner that shares our conviction in the potential of this approach, and who has deep expertise bringing inflammatory and autoimmune disease therapeutics to market. We look forward to collaborating with Novartis, while continuing to develop programs that target other components of the innate immune system through IFM Due and the broader IFM enterprise.”
The transaction has been approved by the board of directors and stockholders of IFM. IFM and Novartis anticipate the transaction will close during the second quarter of 2019. Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

11940,ï»¿Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) to Acquire ICD Therapeutics for its MacroDel Delivery Technology,Boehringer Ingelheim Enhances Oncology R&D with Novel MacroDel Delivery Technology Via Acquisition of ICD Therapeutics,"Boehringer Ingelheim acquires ICD Therapeutics in all stock transaction, to utilize ICD’s MacroDel biologics-delivery platform to develop oncology therapies for intracellular delivery of macromolecules (peptides and proteins)
 The focus of the acquisition is to enhance Boehringer’s oncology portfolio with the development of therapies for intracellular targets for tumor cell types
 ICD’s MacroDel technology is a novel biologics-delivery platform targeting transporter proteins in the cell membrane to deliver therapies intracellularly. Additionally, BI will collaborate with nanoPET Pharma (former share holder of ICD Therapeutics) to develop therapies with ICD’s platform","New molecular platform to access intracellular targets across a broad range of tumor cell types
Opens up new range of therapeutic opportunities for difficult-to-treat cancers 
Ingelheim, Germany and Berlin, Germany Boehringer Ingelheim today announced that it acquired ICD Therapeutics. The acquisition includes rights to ICD’s innovative MacroDel biologics-delivery platform. Boehringer Ingelheim will employ this platform for the development of novel therapeutics in collaboration with nanoPET Pharma GmbH, a former shareholder of ICD Therapeutics. Further details of the acquisition are not being disclosed.
“Boehringer Ingelheim’s collaboration with nanoPET Pharma has the potential to eliminate the hurdle that many cancer biologics face: getting access to targets inside tumor cells,” said Norbert Kraut, Ph.D., Global Head of Cancer Research, Boehringer Ingelheim. “We will use ICD’s MacroDel technology to develop first-in-class potential drug candidates for intracellular targets across a variety of tumor types, for the benefit of patients who so far have no or only inadequate treatment options.”
Engineered proteins and peptides offer great potential to block protein-protein interactions inside cancer cells, but their large size is generally assumed to prevent intracellular delivery. ICD’s MacroDel technology exploits transporter proteins in the cell membrane to deliver such drug candidates inside tumor cells. This opens up therapeutic targets that would be otherwise inaccessible.
“nanoPET Pharma looks forward to collaborating with Boehringer Ingelheim on the pre-clinical refinement of ICD’s MacroDel to achieve effective intracellular delivery of macromolecules such as peptides and proteins,” said Andreas Briel, Ph.D., Managing Director of nanoPET Pharma GmbH. “We are excited to contribute to Boehringer Ingelheim’s discovery and development of innovative medicines for patients in need.”
More about MacroDel
Tree-like highly branched molecules known as dendrimers form a fundamental component of the MacroDel platform. The size, shape and electrical charge of this structure permit it to grasp large therapeutic biological molecules. After binding with the biologic, the resulting compound selectively interacts with transporter proteins known to be highly expressed on tumor cell wall membranes. These transporters help “carry” the compound through the membrane and into the cell. The medicinal cargo is then in position to disrupt the disease process in a precise manner at a molecular level.
A prior investment from Boehringer Ingelheim’s Venture Fund (BIVF) supported ICD’s development of the MacroDel technology. The BIVF strategically invests in groundbreaking therapeutics-focused biotechnology companies to enable development of their technologies for therapeutic applications that have potential for strategic partnerships with Boehringer Ingelheim or other pharmaceutical partners.

11944,ï»¿Roche Reports Result of Ipatasertib + Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in P-Ib Study for 1L Patients with Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC),Roche’s ipatasertib in combination with Tecentriq and chemotherapy shows promising anti-tumour activity in triple-negative breast cancer in early phase tria,"The P-Ib study involves assessing of Ipatasertib + Tecentriq + CT (paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel) in 26 patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC
 P-Ib study results: ORR 73%; median duration of follow-up 6.1 mos.; Grade ≥3 AEs 54%; all-grade AEs 88%, Presented at AACR 2019
 Ipatasertib is an oral selective AKT inhibitor targeting three isoforms of AKT further blocking the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and was developed in collaboration with Genentech & Array BioPharma","Data from Phase Ib study to be presented at American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2019 annual congress
73% overall response rate (ORR) irrespective of PD-L1 status or PI3KCA/AKT1/PTEN alteration status
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) will today present the initial results from a Phase Ib study evaluating the efficacy and safety for the combination of ipatasertib, Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane® [paclitaxel albumin-bound particles for injectable suspension]) as a first-line treatment option for people with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Combination treatment demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 73% (95% CI 53-88%), irrespective of tumour biomarker status. The median duration of follow-up was 6.1 months (range 3.1–10.6). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 14 people (54%); the most common all-grade adverse events were diarrhea (88%; grade ≥3 19%) and rash (69%; grade ≥3 27%).
“We are enthusiastic about the potential of this combination in triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive type of breast cancer,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “These early results support the contribution of ipatasertib to our combination treatment approach in TNBC and reinforce our vision to develop medicines that may benefit patients with this challenging disease.”
Preliminary efficacy data for the first 26 patients (18 paclitaxel, 8 nab-paclitaxel) show confirmed responses in 19/26 patients, giving a confirmed ORR of 73%. Responses were seen irrespective of PD-L1 status (9/11 [82%] PD-L1+; 6/8 [75%] PD-L1–; 4/7 [57%] PD-L1 unknown) or PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alteration status (5/7 [71%] Dx+, 9/11 [82%] Dx–; 5/8 [63%] Dx unknown).
Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been implicated in resistance to chemotherapies and hormonal therapies in multiple tumour types and loss of PTEN, a negative regulator of AKT, has emerged as a potential mechanism for resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. By inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, ipatasertib may contribute to reversal of T-cell-mediated immunotherapy resistance. These results and the potential benefit that ipatasertib plus the Tecentriq/taxane combination may bring to patients are encouraging and add to the Roche development program in triple-negative breast cancer following the approval of the Tecentriq combination.
Trial enrolment for the Phase 1b study is ongoing. Later this year, Roche will initiate a pivotal multi-center, randomised, double-blind Phase III study investigating the combination of ipatasertib, atezolizumab and paclitaxel as first-line therapy for locally advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

About the study
The Phase Ib study is an open-label, multicentre study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ipatasertib in combination with atezolizumab and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have not previously received chemotherapy in the advanced setting. Two triplets: ipatasertib in combination with atezolizumab and paclitaxel (Paclitaxel arm) and ipatasertib in combination with atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel (nab-Paclitaxel arm) are being evaluated for first-line treatment for advanced TNBC. A second cohort, which is enrolling now, will allow collection of tumour biopsies to assess treatment-related biomarker changes in TNBC patients who have progressed after at least one line of chemotherapy in the advanced setting.

About ipatasertib
Ipatasertib is an oral, highly specific, investigational medicine designed to target and bind to all three isoforms of AKT, which blocks the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and may prevent cancer cell growth and survival.
Ipatasertib is being studied in tumours that are frequently found to have activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, including breast and prostate cancers. Pivotal studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ipatasertib and the opportunity it may provide to address significant unmet needs for patients with these diseases. Ipatasertib has demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in both breast and prostate cancers, with a manageable safety profile.
Ipatasertib was discovered at Genentech in partnership with Array BioPharma Inc.

About Triple-Negative breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with more than 2 million diagnosed worldwide each year.[1] TNBC represents 15% of all breast cancers and is more common in women under the age of 50, compared with other forms of breast cancer.[2;3;4] It is defined by the lack of expression and/or amplification of the targetable receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 amplification.[5] Patients with metastatic TNBC generally experience rapid progression and shorter overall survival (OS) compared to other subtypes of breast cancer.[3]

11956,ï»¿VistaGen Therapeutics Reports Positive Results of PH94B in P-III study for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD),"Positive Pilot Phase 3 Data Position VistaGen's PH94B Neuroactive Nasal Spray for Pivotal Phase 3 Development as a Novel, As-Needed Treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder","The P-III study involves assessing of PH94B vs PBO in 22 patients with Social Anxiety Disorder
 P-III study results: @1wk. decrease in average peak Subjective Units of Distress scores; decrease in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) avoidance scores; no Adverse Events; safety profile was excellent; Presented at Anxiety and Depression Association of America Annual Conference 2019
 PH94B is a neuroactive nasal spray contains pherines involves activation of chemosensory receptors that triggers neural circuits in the brain suppressing fear and anxiety and will be evaluated in P-III development program as an on-demand PRN treatment for SAD","PH94B has potential to be the First FDA-Approved PRN Treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder
New Findings Presented at the 2019 Anxiety and Depression Association of America Annual Conference
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / VistaGen Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VTGN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing new generation medicines for depression, social anxiety disorder and other central nervous system (CNS) diseases and disorders with high unmet need, announced today additional results from a positive pilot Phase 3 study of PH94B, a potential first-in-class neuroactive nasal spray shown to be effective on an as-needed (PRN) basis for treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The new data were presented in a poster session at the 2019 Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) Annual Conference in Chicago.
In the 22-patient, four-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot Phase 3 crossover study, subjects receiving PH94B had a significantly greater decrease in average peak Subjective Units of Distress scores compared to placebo within one week of treatment.1 There was also a significantly greater decrease in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) avoidance scores for subjects who received PH94B first, before crossing over to placebo. Administered at microgram doses and consistent with results from prior Phase 2 studies, PH94B’s safety profile was excellent, with no serious adverse events. VistaGen is currently preparing for pivotal Phase 3 development of PH94B as a novel first-line PRN treatment for SAD, with Dr. Michael Liebowitz, developer of the LSAS, a widely-used primary outcome measure in SAD for both clinical research and for evaluation in clinical practice, acting as Principal Investigator for the study.
“Social anxiety disorder is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions in the U.S., affecting as many as 15 million Americans. In both Phase 2 and pilot Phase 3 clinical studies, PH94B was more effective than placebo in the whole sample on the primary outcome measure. In the Phase 2 trial, which included both a public speaking and a social situation challenge, PH94B significantly improved the primary efficacy endpoint within 10 to 15 minutes of self-administration. These positive results demonstrate PH94B’s potential to change the lives of millions of people suffering from SAD,” said Dr. Liebowitz, Principal Investigator of the pilot Phase 3 study. “I support VistaGen’s plans for a pivotal Phase 3 program launch in 2020. PH94B neuroactive nasal spray has potential to be the first FDA-approved PRN treatment for SAD.”
“Current treatments for SAD fall far short of patient needs,” stated Mark Smith, MD, PhD, VistaGen’s Chief Medical Officer. “With its unique mechanism of action, exceptional safety profile and rapid-onset activity, we are excited about PH94B’s potential to transform the current treatment paradigm for SAD. We look forward to working closely with the FDA and Dr. Liebowitz as we prepare for and execute pivotal Phase 3 development of PH94B for SAD.”
About PH94B Neuroactive Nasal Spray
PH94B neuroactive nasal spray is fundamentally different from all current treatments for SAD. Developed from proprietary compounds called pherines and administered as a nasal spray, PH94B activates nasal chemosensory receptors that trigger neural circuits in the brain that suppress fear and anxiety. Its novel mechanism of pharmacological action, rapid-onset of therapeutic effects and exceptional safety and tolerability profile shown in clinical trials to date make PH94B neuroactive nasal spray an excellent product candidate with potential to become the first FDA-approved PRN treatment for SAD.
In a published double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial, PH94B neuroactive nasal spray was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing public-speaking and social interaction anxiety on laboratory challenges of individuals with SAD.2
About Social Anxiety Disorder
SAD affects as many as 15 million Americans and is the third most common psychiatric condition after depression and substance use. SAD is characterized by a persistent and unreasonable fear of one or more social or performance situations, where the individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show symptoms that will be embarrassing or humiliating, leading to avoidance of the situations when possible and anxiety or distress when they occur. These fears have a significant impact on the person’s employment, social activities and overall quality of life. SAD is commonly treated chronically with antidepressants, which have a slow onset of effect (several weeks) and known side effects that may make them unattractive to individuals affected by SAD.

About Zolgensma®
Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi; AVXS-101) is an investigational gene therapy currently in development as a one-time infusion for SMA Type 1. Zolgensma is designed to address the monogenic root cause of SMA and prevent further muscle degeneration. Zolgensma represents the first in a proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. In December, the FDA accepted the company’s Biologics License Application for use of Zolgensma with SMA Type 1 patients. The drug previously received Breakthrough Therapy designation and has been granted Priority Review by the FDA, with regulatory action anticipated in May 2019. In addition, the drug is anticipated to receive approval in Japan and the European Union later this year.
About SMA
SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in 10,000 live births and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. The most severe form of SMA is Type 1, a lethal genetic disorder characterized by rapid motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, which results in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support by 24 months of age for more than 90 percent of patients.

 The P-III KEYNOTE-189 trial resulted in improvement in OS, reduction in the risk of death by half, improvement in PFS
 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) 100mg is an anti-PD-1 therapy involves blocking of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands i.e PD-L1 & PD- L2 and is evaluated in 900 trial globally in oncology","KEYTRUDA is First Anti-PD-1 Therapy to be Approved in Multiple Tumor Types in China

KENILWORTH, N.J.-–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. This new indication was granted conditional approval based on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) data from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial in patients regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in Chinese patients in a confirmatory trial. With this approval, KEYTRUDA is the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved for more than one tumor type in China, following its initial approval in July 2018 for advanced melanoma, and the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the first-line treatment setting for metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.
Lung cancer is deadly disease and the leading cause of cancer deaths in China, claiming the lives of more than 626,000 people in our country each year,” said Prof. Yi-Long Wu, honorary director of the Guangdong Lung Cancer Research Institute, and tenured director of Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital. “The approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with standard chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer is an important milestone in the treatment of advanced lung cancer in China.”
In KEYNOTE-189, KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS (HR=0.49 [95% CI, 0.38-0.64]; p<0.00001), reducing the risk of death by half compared to chemotherapy alone. The study also showed a significant improvement in PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (HR=0.52 [95% CI, 0.43-0.64]; p<0.00001).
“This approval represents a key advance in a country with a high incidence of lung cancer, and where significant progress for the first-line treatment of this devastating disease has been very limited over a number of years,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “This also means that, based on the results of KEYNOTE-189, KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy has now been approved in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China, among other countries, for the first-line treatment of appropriate patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.”
“We are committed to developing innovative therapies and introducing them as quickly as possible to physicians and patients in China,” said Joseph Romanelli, president of MSD in China. “Patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in China now have a new option for the first-line treatment of their disease, and we will continue to collaborate with the Chinese government, healthcare organizations and our business partners to improve patient access to KEYTRUDA in 2019.”
About Lung Cancer in China
Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death in China and worldwide. Each year, more than 782,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed in China and more than 626,000 deaths result from the disease. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85 percent of all cases. There are several subtypes of NSCLC, including adenocarcinoma (accounting for 40% of lung cancers), squamous cell carcinoma (25 to 30%) and large cell carcinoma (10 to 15%).
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 900 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

In KEYNOTE-158, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 98 patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; the most frequent included anemia (7%), fistula, hemorrhage, and infections [except urinary tract infections] (4.1% each). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue (43%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), diarrhea (23%), pain and abdominal pain (22% each), and decreased appetite (21%).
Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HCC were generally similar to those in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy, with the exception of increased incidences of ascites (8% Grades 3-4) and immune-mediated hepatitis (2.9%). Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred at a higher incidence were elevated AST (20%), ALT (9%), and hyperbilirubinemia (10%).
Among the 50 patients with MCC enrolled in study KEYNOTE-017, adverse reactions occurring in patients with MCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy. Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred at a higher incidence were elevated AST (11%) and hyperglycemia (19%).
Lactation
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 4 months after the final dose.
Pediatric Use
There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a trial, 40 pediatric patients (16 children aged 2 years to younger than 12 years and 24 adolescents aged 12 years to 18 years) with various cancers, including unapproved usages, were administered KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients received KEYTRUDA for a median of 3 doses (range 1–17 doses), with 34 patients (85%) receiving 2 doses or more. The safety profile in these pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults; adverse reactions that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), increased transaminases (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

12045,Novartis' Cosentyx (secukinumab) Receives NMPA's (CFDA) Approval for Patients with Plaque Psoriasis in Adults,Novartis first-in-class Cosentyx approved in China for psoriasis patients,"The approval is based on P-III CAIN457A2318 study results assessing Cosentyx (300/150 mg, q4w) vs PBO in 543 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO. Additionally, P-III study in China assessed Cosentyx (300mg, q4w) in 10 Psoriasis patients
 P-III CAIN457A2318 study results: @12 wks. PASI 75/90 (97.7%, 87.8%/ 80.9%, 66.4%); @16wks. PASI 90 87.0%, well tolerated with both doses; no new safety signals observed: P-III results @12wks. 80% achieved clear or almost clear skin & @16 wks. 87.0% achieved
 Cosentyx (secukinumab) is a novel biologic that inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A) targeted for psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)","China Health Authority NMPA approved Cosentyx® (secukinumab) for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy
Cosentyx is the first biologic approved in China that specifically inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation of psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)[1]-[2] 
A Phase III study in patients in China with psoriasis confirmed a sustained safety profile and rapid onset of relief with Cosentyx as early as week 3. Data showed close to 9/10 patients who received Cosentyx® (300mg on an every 4 week dosing regimen after loading) achieved clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks[3]
Basel, – Novartis, a global leader in immuno-dermatology and rheumatology, announced today that the China Health Authority NMPA approved Cosentyx® (secukinumab), the first-in-class interleukin-17A (IL-17A) inhibitor for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
“Reimagining the management of psoriatic disease to provide patients with the ability to live their life free from the burden of psoriasis is a key focus for us,” said Paul Hudson, CEO Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “With Cosentyx, we are offering a new treatment to doctors and psoriasis patients in China which can act within 3 weeks, has demonstrated sustained safety in more than 200,000 patients worldwide and can deliver what doctors and patients are looking for.”
“We are delighted to bring Cosentyx to doctors and patients in China. The approval of Cosentyx has marked a new era of psoriasis treatment, redefining the treatment goal by making clear or almost clear skin achievable. The introduction of Cosentyx should bring outstanding clinical benefit to many patients with psoriasis in China and improve their quality of life,” said Ingrid Zhang, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals China.
Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human treatment for psoriasis, that specifically inhibits IL-17A. Cosentyx is characterized by sustained safety, fast and long-lasting control, and placebo-like injection site reaction[1],[2],[4],[5]-[8]. A recently published Phase III study in patients in China showed that 80.9% of the patients treated with Cosentyx 300mg on an every 4 week dosing regimen (q4w) after loading achieved clear or almost clear skin during the first 12 weeks of treatment, and close to 9/10 patients after 16 weeks (87.0%)[3].
“The average onset age of psoriasis in China is around 30, and many of the moderate-to-severe patients are in their prime. This population plays an irreplaceable role in their family, workplace and society. Thus, treatment with high efficacy, a good safety profile and long-lasting disease control is what we are looking for to help patients get back to normal life and work,” said Prof. Jianzhong Zhang, former President of Chinese Society of Dermatology, Chinese Medical Association. “Positive China data presented recently makes us hopeful for the clinical use of secukinumab in China. I hope to see Chinese patients benefit from this innovative treatment and be relieved from their illness burden.”
Currently in China there are more than 6 million people living with psoriasis including mild, moderate and severe forms of the disease[9]. Psoriasis is a life-long debilitating disease that significantly impacts patients’ quality of life both physically and emotionally[10]. Real-world data from the US has demonstrated that 2/3 of biologic-eligible patients have PsA or other persistent manifestations of psoriasis in nails, scalp and palmoplantar areas[11]-[15].
Cosentyx is backed by robust clinical evidence including 5-year Phase III extension studies in PsO, PsA and AS[2],[4],[16] and dedicated studies in persistent manifestations of psoriasis, namely in nails, scalp and palmoplantar areas, addressing different parts of the psoriatic disease[17]. Today, more than 200,000 patients worldwide have been treated with Cosentyx since launch[18].
About the CAIN457A2318 trial
The Phase III CAIN457A2318 study is an ongoing 52 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study investigating the efficacy and safety of Cosentyx in 543 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO, including 441 Chinese patients. The co-primary endpoints of the study were to demonstrate the superiority of Cosentyx compared to placebo with respect to PASI 75 response and Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) mod 2011 0/1 (clear or almost clear) response at Week 12. The key secondary endpoint was PASI 90 response at Week 12. Patients were randomized to receive on an every 4 week dosing regimen (q4w) after loading either Cosentyx 300mg, 150 mg or placebo[3].
The data showed 97.7% of patients treated with Cosentyx 300mg achieved PASI 75 and 80.9% PASI 90 by week 12, with 87.0% of patients reaching PASI 90 by week 16. In patients treated with Cosentyx 150mg, 87.8% achieved PASI 75 and 66.4% achieved PASI 90 at week 12. Cosentyx was well tolerated at both doses (150 mg and 300 mg on an q4w dosing regimen after loading). The overall safety profile was consistent with that of previous Phase III clinical trials with no new or unexpected safety signals identified[3].

12066,Allergan and Molecular Partners Report Result of Abicipar pegol in P-III MAPLE Study for Neovascular Macular Degeneration (nAMD)ï»¿,Allergan and Molecular Partners Announce Topline Safety Results from MAPLE study of Abicipar pegol,"The P-III MAPLE study involves assessing of abicipar pegol (2mg, q8w) in 123 patients with Neovascular Macular Degeneration (nAMD) for 28 wks.
 P-III MAPLE study results: 8.9% incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI)lower than P-III studies (CEDAR and SEQUOIA); severe IOI 1.6%; no reported cases of endophthalmitis or retinal vasculitis in this study
 Abicipar is an anti-VEGF therapy DARPin candidate administered q12w targeted for patients with nAMD. Allergan plans to file BLA to the US FDA in H1’19","The MAPLE study used a modified manufacturing process and demonstrated decreased intraocular inflammationPreviously reported positive Phase 3 results demonstrated the potential for abicipar to be the first anti-VEGF therapy to maintain initial vision gains in all patients on a true fixed 12-week dosing intervalAbicipar BLA submission to the FDA planned for first half of 2019
DUBLIN, – Allergan plc, (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company and Molecular Partners (SIX: MOLN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of drugs known as DARPin® therapies, today announced topline safety results from MAPLE, a 28 week open-label study which enrolled 123 age-related Neovascular Macular Degeneration (nAMD) patients and evaluated the safety of abicipar produced via a modified manufacturing process. In this single arm study, treatment naïve or prior anti-VEGF treated patients received three monthly 2mg abicipar injections followed by 2mg injections every 8 weeks for up to a total of five injections through week 28.
 
As a result of the improvements in the manufacturing process, the incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) was 8.9 percent in the MAPLE study, which was lower than the rate observed in prior Phase 3 studies. Most IOI events were assessed as mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of severe IOI was 1.6 percent with one reported case of iritis and one reported case of uveitis. There were no reported cases of endophthalmitis or retinal vasculitis in this study.
“It is encouraging to see the lower incidence and type of IOI observed in this open label 28-week study,” said Raj Maturi, MD, Midwest Eye Institute & Associate Professor Ophthalmology, Indiana University School of Medicine. “In the Phase 3 trials previously reported, abicipar demonstrated potential that could transform the way physicians manage nAMD with anti-VEGF therapy. Abicipar could be the first fixed 12- week anti-VEGF treatment that improves visual outcomes in a real world setting for a large number of AMD patients.”
“The results of this open-label study enabled us to assess improvements to the manufacturing process for abicipar. The safety profile demonstrated in MAPLE gives us confidence to proceed and scale up manufacturing,” said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer, Allergan. “We plan to submit the abicipar BLA and continue to pursue manufacturing process improvements as we develop larger scale studies in additional disease states, such as Diabetic Macular Edema.”
“Clinical trial evidence has shown that fixed-interval dosing of anti-VEGF therapies administered either every month or every 8 weeks results in better visual outcomes compared to real world clinical outcomes. Abicipar could potentially be the first anti-VEGF therapy that is administered every 12 weeks with demonstrated maintenance of visual acuity for a large number of patients with nAMD. A fixed-interval Q12-week therapy would greatly reduce the treatment burden for these patients,” said Peter Kaiser, MD, Chaney Family Endowed Chair in Ophthalmology Research and Professor of Ophthalmology, Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.
“Abicipar is our first DARPin® candidate on track for BLA submission with the aim to become the first fixed 12-week anti VEGF drug in all patients with nAMD,” commented Michael T. Stumpp, COO of Molecular Partners. He added: “The safety data from the MAPLE trial are an important step in the further improvement of the manufacturing process of abicipar.”
Allergan expects to file the abicipar Biologics License Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2019. Additional data from the MAPLE study will be presented at a scientific conference later in 2019.
About ABICIPAR CEDAR and SEQUOIA PHASE 3 TRIALS
Allergan plc and Molecular Partners previously announced results from two positive Phase 3 clinical trials, CEDAR and SEQUOIA for abicipar, a novel DARPin® therapy for the treatment of nAMD, demonstrating that both the 8-week and 12-week fixed-interval treatment regimens met the pre-specified primary endpoint of non-inferiority to ranibizumab. The primary endpoint measured the proportion of treated patients with stable vision at week 52. In both studies abicipar demonstrated similar efficacy after 6 or 8 injections, compared to 13 ranibizumab injections in the first year of this study.
In the CEDAR study, overall treatment-emergent adverse events were similar among the three treatment arms and reported in 73.7 percent, 81.1 percent and 73.2 percent of patients receiving abicipar Q8, abicipar Q12 and ranibizumab Q4, respectively. Incidence of intraocular inflammation events was similar among the two abicipar treatment groups but higher than the ranibizumab group and reported at 15.1 percent and 15.4 percent of patients in the abicipar Q8 and Q12 arms compared to 0 percent in the ranibizumab Q4.
In the SEQUOIA study, overall treatment-emergent adverse events were similar among the three treatment arms and reported in 78.3 percent, 78.0 percent and 74.0 percent of patients receiving abicipar Q8, abicipar Q12 and ranibizumab Q4, respectively. Incidence of intraocular inflammation events was similar among the two abicipar treatment groups but higher than the ranibizumab group and reported at 15.7 percent and 15.3 percent of patients in the abicipar Q8 and Q12 arms compared to 0.6 percent in the ranibizumab Q4 arm.

Dermelix to get WW development & exclusive commercialization rights for EspeRare’s DMX-101 (Ex- Europe)
 In H2’19 Dermelix & EspeRare plans for the onset of clinical study assessing DMX-101 in 15 patients with X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) in the US and Europe
 EspeRare’s DMX-101 is an EDA molecule consisting of IgG1 Fc sequence linked with EDA TNF binds to the receptor EDAR resulting in activation of the NFϰB signaling pathway and has received EMA’s PRIME & FDA’s OD designation for XLHED","EspeRare has entered into a partnership with Dermelix Biotherapeuticsto develop DMX-101, a novel in utero protein replacement therapy for the treatment of X-Linked Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED), a rare pediatric genetic disease.
There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of XLHED and DMX-101 has the potential to become the first ever in uteroadministered drug to correct a genetic disease before birth. During the second half of 2019 and in view of recent discussions with the EU and US regulatory agencies, both partners are set to start enrolling patients into a clinical trial geared towards marketing approval.
With Dermelix, EspeRare is fortunate to have found a partner that shares common values and patient-centered commitments. Both partners have gone as far as signing an Ethical Charter within the license agreement, under which both partners commit to continuously and transparently engage with the patient community during the development and commercialization of the treatment.
To our knowledge this is a legal first!
Under the terms of the agreement, EspeRare remains the sponsor of DMX-101 pivotal development in Europe, while Dermelix will lead activities of DMX-101 outside of Europe. Dermelix will finance the development of the product and will be responsible for its commercialization worldwide. In exchange for exclusive commercial rights, EspeRare is receiving financial returns. Delivering on EspeRare non-profit model, these financial returns are on one hand, shared with past contributors of DMX-101 development and on the other hand, reinvested into scaling EspeRare’s organization and portfolio of therapeutic programs.
Caroline Kant, Founder and CEO of EspeRare, commented: “Patients with rare diseases so often lack the treatment options they need. This partnership with Dermelix represents an amazing opportunity to bring an innovative therapy to patients and to potentially radically change their lives. And beyond XLHED, we are also committed to pave the way for other prenatal treatments to correct genetic diseases before birth.”

About XLHED
XLHED is a severe, chronically debilitating and life-threatening rare disease affecting approximately 4/100,000 live male births every year. XLHED is caused by genetic mutations in the EDA gene, a gene that encodes for an important ectodermal developmental protein, EDA. The absence of functional EDA results in abnormal development of the skin, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair, oral cavity, and respiratory mucosal glands resulting in serious life-threatening clinical manifestations from birth including hyperthermia, craniofacial anomalies and recurrent respiratory infections that impair quality of life in patients and their families.
For further information on XLHED, please visit this Website.

About EspeRare
EspeRare is a Swiss not-for-profit organization that is committed to improve the lives of children with life-threatening rare diseases. EspeRare addresses the unmet medical needs of these children by uncovering the potential of existing treatments. EspeRare’s innovative model combines pharmaceutical know-how with philanthropic, public and private investments to develop and bring to life these discontinued therapies. With its unique patient-centered approach to drug development, EspeRare engages the patient community at each step of the process, with the intent of giving children and their families fair access to these therapies and a new hope for the future.

About DMX-101
DMX-101 is a fully humanized EDA molecule consisting of the human IgG1 Fc sequence linked to the human EDA TNF binding domain. Preclinically, DMX-101 has been shown to bind to the receptor EDAR resulting in activation of the NFϰB signaling pathway, which triggers the transcription of genes involved in the normal development of multiple tissue types. DMX-101 is the first and only treatment specifically targeting XLHED. Administered during the third trimester of pregnancy, it has the potential to become a “single course” treatment, significantly improving symptoms of the disease throughout patients’ lives. This approach has already demonstrated significant potential in a case series of three patients treated in utero with DMX-101 during the third trimester of pregnancy. The treatment normalized sweat gland function and associated thermoregulation, and improvement in dentition and respiratory function were observed. These results were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and featured in Nature Medicine’s 2018 Research Highlights.

12104,ï»¿Channel Medsystems' Cerene Cryotherapy Device Receives FDA's Approval for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding,Channel Medsystems Receives U.S. FDA Approval of the Cerene Cryotherapy Device for the Treatment of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding,"The FDA’s approval is based on CLARITY study assessing Cerene in 242 patients with excessive menstrual bleeding
 The CLARITY study results: @12mos. reduction in menstrual bleeding; m-pain score (0-2/10); no general anesthesia required; reduction in post-operative pain & intrauterine adhesions (81% and 79%); well tolerated without anesthesia
 The Cerene is a cryotherapy device that delivers cryotherapy to freeze the lining of uterus for future reduction in mensural bleeding and is targeted for endometrial cryoablation in premenopausal women","Emeryville, California,Channel Medsystems®, a company dedicated to bringing innovation to the delivery of women’s healthcare, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Cerene® Cryotherapy Device as a new approach to treating heavy menstrual bleeding.
The Cerene Device delivers cryotherapy to freeze the lining of the uterus in order to significantly reduce future menstrual bleeding. The unique design of the Cerene Device and use of extreme cold results in a procedure that does not require general anesthesia and can be performed in the gynecologist’s office. In contrast, heat-based endometrial ablation devices currently on the market are more often performed with general anesthesia in hospitals or surgery centers.
CLARITY, the pivotal study supporting the safety and effectiveness of the Cerene Device and its FDA approval, included treatment of 242 subjects. At 12 months, the observed reduction in menstrual bleeding exceeded treatment goals. “We are extremely pleased by the results of the CLARITY study and the positive feedback we have received about the Cerene Device, both from study investigators and numerous gynecologists surveyed,” said Ric Cote, President and Chief Executive Officer of Channel Medsystems. “The Cerene Device provides gynecologists with the first realistic option for treatment in their office, a setting that is more comfortable for women and significantly less expensive for the healthcare system. The shift away from the operating room that the Cerene Device enables could potentially reduce the cost to treat heavy menstrual bleeding by hundreds of millions of dollars annually.”
CLARITY is the first study to provide comprehensive data on both the patient experience of pain and post-ablation cavity access, two clinical findings that are highly relevant to gynecologists when selecting an endometrial ablation device. Subjects’ median pain score ranged from 0 to 2 (on a 0-10 numeric scale) across eight different peri-procedural time points, with no subjects requiring general anesthesia. Hysteroscopy performed 12 months following the procedure demonstrated an accessible uterine cavity in 98.7% of 223 available subjects. CLARITY investigator Ted Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., Vice Chair of Clinical Affairs and Director of the Division of Gynecology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, noted this was a “critical finding that allows for diagnostic evaluation including sampling of the endometrium rather than forcing hysterectomy because of unevaluable post-ablation bleeding and/or pain.”
In a Channel Medsystems survey of over 450 gynecologists, the vast majority reported that they would recommend endometrial ablation more often if perioperative pain and clinically-significant intrauterine adhesions were reduced (81% and 79%, respectively). Anderson stressed “women who suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding are seeking safe and effective treatments that are well tolerated with minimal inconvenience. Channel Medsystems has developed a treatment that is easy to use, is reproducible in any setting of care, and is very well tolerated without anesthesia. The development of new technology like the Cerene Device could allow gynecologists to provide a safe, effective, affordable, and convenient treatment to the millions of women who seek care for heavy menstrual bleeding annually in the United States.”
The Cerene Device was developed with feedback from leading clinicians and is indicated for endometrial cryoablation in premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding due to benign causes for whom child bearing is complete. Cryoablation is a well-characterized, durable therapy routinely used to ablate malignant and benign human tissues. In the uterus, the use of cryothermic energy has been shown to reduce the likelihood of scarring and intrauterine adhesions that are often associated with the failure of heat-based ablation treatments. The team at Channel Medsystems has integrated the cryothermic energy delivery system into a disposable, self-contained, ergonomic device, eliminating the need for capital equipment.

 The study resulted in median MLWHFQ score @transition and add on patients from 37 to 29 and 30 to 19, median 6MWD 395m and 408m and 428m and 449m, no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to LIQ861, safe and well-tolerated, Presented at 39th International Society for Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT)
 LIQ861 is a inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil developed using Liquidia’s PRINT technology targeted as an alternative to current inhaled treprostinil therapy for the treatment of PAH","Positive Data from INSPIRE Trial Continues to Highlight Safety and Tolerability Along with Improvement in Quality of Life Metrics from LIQ861
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Liquidia Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: LQDA) (“Liquidia”), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of LIQ861, announced today additional detailed safety and exploratory endpoint findings at the two-month timepoint for the Phase 3 INSPIRE trial. Nicholas Hill, MD, Chief Pulmonary, Critical Care & Sleep Division and Professor of Medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine and INSPIRE Principal Investigator, presented the data at the opening plenary session of the 39thInternational Society for Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Meeting and Scientific Sessions in Orlando, Florida. Liquidia is pursuing approval of LIQ861, an inhalation dry powder formulation of treprostinil that is produced using its PRINT® Technology, as an alternative to current inhaled treprostinil therapy for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1).

“The two-month results of the INSPIRE trial are promising for patients with PAH. Inhaled therapy offers the benefit of getting drug directly to the lungs and we are encouraged that the safety, tolerability and quality of life metrics suggest that LIQ861 is an attractive and more convenient therapy versus the currently available inhaled therapies,” said Dr. Hill.

In March 2019, Liquidia reported two-month top-line results of the Phase 3 INSPIRE study, which indicated that the study had met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability of LIQ861 in (PAH) patients. The ISHLT presentation, “INSPIRE: A Phase 3 Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of LIQ861 in PAH,” provides detailed results on the treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile, duration of treatment by group (including those adding LIQ861 to non-prostacyclin oral therapy and those transitioning from Tyvaso®*) along with the performance of LIQ861 against exploratory endpoints such as patient quality of life metrics.

“We are continuing to demonstrate the potential benefits of LIQ861 as we present additional data from the INSPIRE trial,” said Neal Fowler, Chief Executive Officer of Liquidia. “LIQ861 is a convenient inhaled therapy that effectively manages PAH with excellent safety and tolerability. It’s our belief that LIQ861 can help PAH patients more easily manage their disease, and more importantly, the quality of their lives.”

Safety
The INSPIRE trial includes two groups of PAH patients, comprised of 65 prostacyclin-naïve patients that were stable on ≤2 approved oral PAH therapies (add-on) and 44 patients transitioning from Tyvaso® (transition). Most TEAEs occurred in the add-on population and were observed mainly during initial exposure to LIQ861 at the 25mcg dose. Overall, TEAEs observed were consistent with inhaled prostacyclins and considered mild to moderate, including cough, headache and throat irritation. No serious adverse events (SAEs) related to LIQ861 were observed during the two month period.

Duration of Treatment and Patient Quality of Life
Most patients, 101 of 109 (92.7%), remained on LIQ861 at two months duration of treatment, with 59 of 65 (90.8%) add-on patients and 42 of 44 (95.5%) transition patients. Patients continue to receive treatment beyond month 2 with initial dosing in March 2018.

Exploratory endpoints of the INSPIRE trial demonstrated favorable functional and patient outcomes, as indicated by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) and measurement of six-minute walk distance (6MWD). MLHFQ is a patient-oriented measure of the adverse effects of heart failure on a patient’s physical and emotional aspects of life. A five-point change is the minimal difference considered to be clinically important. The median MLWHFQ score at month 2 for all patients improved from 34 to 24, with significant changes observed in both the add-on and transition patient groups, from 37 to 29 and 30 to 19, respectively. Median 6MWD at baseline and 2 months was 395m and 408m in the add-on group and 428m and 449m in the transition group.

About LIQ861
LIQ861 is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed using Liquidia’s PRINT technology to enhance deep-lung delivery using a convenient, palm-sized, disposable dry powder inhaler (“DPI”) for the treatment of PAH. Liquidia believes LIQ861 can overcome the limitations of current inhaled therapies and has the potential to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs.

About INSPIRE Clinical Trial
Liquidia’s pivotal open-label Phase 3 clinical trial, known as INSPIRE, or Investigation of the Safety and Pharmacology of Dry Powder Inhalation of Treprostinil, is designed to evaluate patients who have either been under stable treatment with nebulizer-delivered treprostinil for at least three months and are transitioned to LIQ861 under the protocol or patients who have been on stable treatment with no more than two non-prostacyclin oral PAH therapies for at least three months and have their treatment regimen supplemented with LIQ861 under the protocol. The primary objective of the INSPIRE study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861. For more information, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03399604.

Copenhagen, Genmab A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: GEN) announced today that its collaboration partner, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”) plans to start a new Phase III study of daratumumab in multiple myeloma. The study (MMY3021) will compare subcutaneous daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide versus lenalidomide alone as maintenance treatment in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are minimal residual disease (MRD) positive after frontline autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). The primary end point of the study is MRD conversion rate, from MRD positive to MRD negative status, at twelve months. The study is planned to start in the first half of 2019. In August 2012, Genmab granted Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab.
“We are pleased to see Janssen’s continual commitment to evaluating the use of daratumumab in a wide array of settings and combinations. We are hopeful that the study will provide evidence of daratumumab’s potential to provide a benefit to patients with multiple myeloma beyond current standard of care treatments in the maintenance phase of treatment,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.
About the MMY3021 study
The Phase III study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study that will include up to 214 newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma who are MRD positive after autologous stem cell transplant and who have no prior anti-CD38 exposure. Patients will be randomized to receive either subcutaneous daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide or lenalidomide alone. In the daratumumab treatment arm, patients received 1,800 mg of subcutaneous daratumumab weekly for Cycles 1-2, every two weeks for Cycles 3-6 and every four weeks thereafter. Lenalidomide will be administered at 10 mg orally on days 1-28 with 15 mg given daily if it is well tolerated after three cycles. Both arms will continue until disease progression or for 36 cycles. The primary endpoint of the study is MRD-conversion at 12 months.
About multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excess proliferation of plasma cells.1 Multiple myeloma is the third most common blood cancer in the U.S., after leukemia and lymphoma.2 Approximately 26,000 new patients were expected to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and approximately 13,650 people were expected to die from the disease in the U.S. in 2018.3 Globally, it was estimated that 160,000 people were diagnosed and 106,000 died from the disease in 2018.4 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms at all, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms which can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.5
About DARZALEX®(daratumumab)
DARZALEX® (daratumumab) injection for intravenous infusion is indicated in the United States in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI); and as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent, or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.6 DARZALEX is the first monoclonal antibody (mAb) to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) approval to treat multiple myeloma. DARZALEX is indicated in Europe in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; and as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a PI and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. The option to split the first infusion of DARZALEX over two consecutive days has been approved in both Europe and the U.S. In Japan, DARZALEX is approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. DARZALEX is the first human CD38 monoclonal antibody to reach the market in the United Stated, Europe and Japan. For more information, visit www.DARZALEX.com.
Daratumumab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the CD38 molecule, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. Daratumumab triggers a person’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells, resulting in rapid tumor cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action and through immunomodulatory effects, in addition to direct tumor cell death, via apoptosis (programmed cell death).6,7,8,9,10
Daratumumab is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. under an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab from Genmab. A comprehensive clinical development program for daratumumab is ongoing, including multiple Phase III studies in smoldering, relapsed and frontline multiple myeloma settings and in amyloidosis.

12171,AstraZeneca and the US NIAID Report Results of Fasenra (benralizumab) in P-II Study for Hypereosinophilic Syndromes (HES),Positive results from Fasenra Phase II trial in hypereosinophilic syndrome published in New England Journal of Medicine,"The P-II (NCT02130882) study involves assessing of Fasenra (benralizumab,30mg, q4w) vs PBO in 20 patients with HES who had at least 1,000 eosinophils/µL of blood
 The P-II (NCT02130882) clinical study results: @12wks. reduction in absolute blood eosinophil counts >50% (90% vs 30%); @48wks.maintained reduction in eosinophil counts (74%); patients taper off other HES therapies (64%), Published at New England Journal of Medicine
 Fasenra (benralizumab, SC, q4w) is a mAb targeted IL-5 receptor presented at the surface of eosinophils and has also received approval for eosinophilic asthma in US, EU, Japan with FDA’s ODD for HES. Kyowa Hakko in-licensed Fasenra from AZ","A Phase II trial has demonstrated that Fasenra (benralizumab) can achieve near-complete depletion of eosinophils and improve clinical outcomes in hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). The results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
In the randomised phase of the 20-patient trial, the primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients who reduced their absolute blood eosinophil counts by 50% or more at week 12.1 This was achieved by 90% of patients treated with Fasenra compared with 30% of patients treated with placebo, a statistically significant difference.
In the open-label phase of the trial, 74% of patients maintained a reduction in eosinophil counts and had clinical improvements in their symptoms through week 48.1 Of these patients, 64% were able to taper background HES medications. In patients from whom tissue biopsies were obtained (gastrointestinal tract and skin) there was near-complete depletion of eosinophils following treatment with Fasenra.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President and President BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “We are encouraged by these trial results for Fasenra in hypereosinophilic syndrome and the data are potentially important given the limited treatment options for this debilitating disease.”
HES is a group of rare, potentially fatal disorders characterised by high numbers of eosinophils in blood and tissues which can cause progressive, potentially life-threatening organ damage.2,3 At the start of the Phase II trial, patients had significantly elevated levels of blood eosinophils ranging from 1,000 to 21,580 cells per μl.1
During the 48-week treatment period, the three most frequently reported adverse events attributed to Fasenra included headache, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration and chills.1 The observed increases in LDH occurred after the first dose of Fasenra and resolved within 48 hours. The trial was a collaboration between AstraZeneca and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the US National Institutes of Health.
Fasenra is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe, eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan and other countries. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation for Fasenra for the treatment of HES in February 2019.

NOTES TO EDITORS
About HES
HES is a group of rare disorders characterised by high numbers of eosinophils (≥1,500 cells per μl), a type of white blood cell, in blood and tissues which can cause progressive damage to any organ and, if left untreated, can be fatal.2,3 HES most commonly impacts the skin, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system.3 The symptoms of HES may include cough, fever, fatigue, asthma, difficulty breathing, wheezing, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin rashes, arthritis, muscle aches and joint pain.3
The goal of HES treatment is to deplete eosinophils in the blood and tissues, prevent organ damage and slow disease progression.2 Although some patients with HES have a genetic abnormality involving platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) that renders them responsive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib,4 treatment options for patients without PDGFR mutations are limited, have varying efficacy and are associated with adverse events.1

About the Phase II trial
The trial was conducted by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in collaboration with AstraZeneca as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of benralizumab (30 mg sub-cutaneous, administered every four weeks) in 20 symptomatic patients with a diagnosis of platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA)-negative HES (non-leukemic) and an eosinophil count ≥1,000 cells per μl on stable HES therapy.1 This was followed by an open-label segment during which background HES therapy could be tapered as tolerated.
The primary efficacy endpoint of the randomised phase was the percentage of patients who reduced their absolute blood eosinophil counts by 50% or more at week 12.1 Secondary endpoints included reduction in eosinophil counts at 12 weeks, frequency and severity of adverse events, changes in bone marrow and tissue eosinophilia, and reduction in HES therapy at 48 weeks. Exploratory endpoints included assessment of clinical and laboratory predictors of response.
About Fasenra
Fasenra (benralizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to IL-5 receptor α on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis (programmed cell death).5,6
Fasenra is AstraZeneca’s first respiratory biologic, now approved as an add-on maintenance treatment in severe, eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan and other countries, with further regulatory reviews ongoing. Where approved, Fasenra is available as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection via a prefilled syringe administered once every four weeks for the first three doses, and then once every eight weeks thereafter. Fasenra is also being studied in severe nasal polyposis.
Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca and is in-licensed from BioWa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Japan.
About AstraZeneca in Respiratory Disease
Respiratory is one of AstraZeneca’s main therapy areas, and our medicines reached more than 18 million patients as maintenance therapy in 2018.

12176,ï»¿Oncology Venture Signs an Exclusive Option Agreement to In-License Commercialization Rights for R-Pharm's Ixempra (ixabepilone) in EU,Oncology Venture obtains option to in-license the European rights to the FDA approved ixabepilone,"Oncology to evaluate Ixempra (ixabepilone) in combination with DRP CDx for metastatic breast cancer in EU. Post the results of trial, Oncology has an exclusive option to in-license commercialization rights for Ixempra in EU
 The focus of the in-licensing agreement is to utilize Oncology Ventures’ Drug Response Prediction (DRP) biomarker platform for the enhancement of its oncology portfolio
 Ixempra (ixabepilone) is an anti-cancer (antineoplastic or cytotoxic) drug approved by the US FDA for metastatic breast cancer in 2007. In July,2015 R-Pharma acquired global rights for Ixempra from BMS and is marketed in the US, South America, Switzerland, and Lichtenstein","Hørsholm, Denmark and Cambridge, MA, US, – Oncology Venture A/S (“OV” or the Company) today announced that the company has obtained an exclusive option to in-license the European rights to IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone) from the pharmaceutical company 

R-Pharm U.S., LLC. In July 2015 R-PHARM U.S., LLC acquired global rights to IXEMPRA® from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). The drug is approved in the USA for the treatment of breast cancer. Oncology Venture will evaluate ixabepilone together with its drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostic in order to accomplish a market approval in Europe.
Oncology Venture has, based on prior treatment results and tumor gene data published by BMS in scientific literature, evaluated the ability of its DRP® companion diagnostic to identify which patients will most likely benefit from ixabepilone. The analysis indicates that patients benefitting from Ixabepilone can be identified by using our ixabepilone-specific DRP® companion diagnostic. Oncology Venture is confident that it can succeed in gaining EMA approval to market ixabepilone in Europe for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
According to the agreement, Oncology Venture will evaluate IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone), together with its DRP® companion diagnostic, in European clinical trials in patients with metastatic breast cancer. If the results are convincing Oncology Venture has the option to exclusively in-license the commercial rights for the European Union (EU) market. The broadened pipeline is not expected to increase Oncology Venture’s cost base since the clinical development of ixabepilone will be financed through a special purpose vehicle/joint venture to be offered to interested investors while Oncology Venture will continue to control the program.
Oncology Venture’s strategy is to make use of its proprietary Drug Response Prediction (DRP®) biomarker platform to progress its broad pipeline of late-stage oncology drug candidates. The company in-licenses drug candidates that have previously shown good clinical efficacy and where the DRP® technology is expected to add value for cancer patients as a companion diagnostic to the drug. The DRP® companion diagnostic enables identification of the patient population most likely to benefit from the drug and then only treating those patients. After conducting clinical studies that prove a better efficacy of its drug candidates, Oncology Venture can apply for market approval or out-license the drug candidate at a higher value inflection point.
The cancer drug ixabepilone was originally developed by the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and was approved for treating metastatic breast cancer by the FDA in the US in 2007 but was not approved by The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) for use in Europe. R-Pharm U.S. acquired ixabepilone from BMS in July 2015 and the product is today marketed by R-Pharm in the USA, as well as certain countries in South America, Switzerland, and Lichtenstein.
“This is a great opportunity to apply our value increasing process. Ixabepilone is a top-quality FDA approved product and we believe that our DRP technology can bring the product to an European approval. Ixabepilone has all the features that we seek for and we are looking forward to pinpoint the patients that truly benefit from ixabepilone, with the ultimate goal to bring a new efficacious drug to the European/EU cancer patients,” comments Peter Buhl Jensen, M.D., CEO of Oncology Venture.

12196,ï»¿Abbott Signs a Non-Exclusive License Agreement with Banyan Biomarkers for its Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Blood Biomarkers,Banyan Provides Non-Exclusive License of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Biomarkers to Abbott for Use on its Core Laboratory Instruments,"Abbott to get non-exclusive license rights for Banyan’s TBI biomarkers, including Ubiquitin Carboxy-terminal Hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) kit to utilize it on its laboratory instruments
 The focus of the agreement is to develop TBI assessment blood test for the patient with traumatic brain injury in the US and worldwide
 Banyan BTI is the first blood test used for identification of biomarkers GFAP and UCH-L1 released from the brain and consists of two test kits Banyan GFAP and Banyan UCH-L1 providing ease to physicians to detect TBIs","SAN DIEGO-Banyan announced today that it will provide Abbott, a global healthcare leader, a license for its traumatic brain injury (TBI) blood biomarkers – Ubiquitin Carboxy-terminal Hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) – for use on Abbott’s core laboratory instruments. With this license, Abbott continues its development of a TBI assessment blood test for the point-of-care and its core laboratory instruments. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
“We look forward to working with Abbott to bring this objective diagnostic test to physicians who see patients who are suspected of suffering a traumatic brain injury or a concussion as it is normally called,” said Henry L. Nordhoff, Chairman and CEO of Banyan Biomarkers. “This non-exclusive license to one of the world’s leading diagnostic companies supports our objective to make this test widely available both here in the United States and worldwide.”
TBIs have become a global public health concern. More than 4.8 million people in the U.S. visit the emergency room each year to be evaluated for a suspected TBI, and an estimated 10 million people globally are affected annually by brain injuries.1-2 According to the World Health Organization, TBI could surpass many diseases as the major cause of death and disability by 2020.2 While certain groups of people may be at a higher risk for TBI, the vast majority of brain injuries occur to everyday people during a car accident or fall.
While there’s been a significant focus on the prevention of TBIs, there is a growing need to develop new technologies that would help physicians detect TBIs. Today, detecting concussions is often difficult because the physical damage may not be obvious, and not all brain injuries are visible on CT scans or other tests used as part of today’s standard of care. Failure to detect TBIs could have implications for a patient’s treatment and recovery.
Blood tests are relied on by healthcare providers to detect a variety of conditions due to their objectivity and speed. Developing blood tests that identify biomarkers released from the brain when injured, such as GFAP and UCH-L1, could help healthcare providers have a fuller picture of a patient’s health when they are presenting in the emergency room with a suspected brain injury.
“When a physician sees someone in the emergency room with a suspected brain injury, it is critical that we have objective measurements and tests available,” said Beth McQuiston, M.D., R.D., board-certified neurologist and medical director, Diagnostics, Abbott. “Using novel biomarkers like these will help us develop both point-of-care and core laboratory blood tests for clinicians to assess brain injuries.”
About Banyan Biomarkers
Banyan Biomarkers, Inc. has developed the first blood test, Banyan BTI™, that can be used to objectively aid in the evaluation of patients with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as concussions. Banyan BTI consists of two test kits (Banyan UCH-L1® Kit and Banyan GFAP® Kit) that measure two specific protein biomarkers that rapidly appear in the blood after a brain injury.

 The P-III MONALEESA-7 study results: mPFS (22.1, 27.5 vs 11.0, 13.8 mos.); AEs: neutropenia (60.6% vs. 3.6%); leukopenia (14.3% vs. 1.2%); no new safety signals observed
 Kisqali (ribociclib) is a CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor, approved in the US for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with aromatase inhibitor and has received its first BT designation based on P-III MONALEESA-2 study in Aug’16.","Designation based on Phase III MONALEESA-7 results demonstrating superior efficacy of Kisqali in combination with oral endocrine therapy compared to oral endocrine therapy in pre- or perimenopausal women who received no prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease1
Treatment benefit with Kisqali combination therapy was consistent compared to the overall population regardless of treatment with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor endocrine partners, and across patient subgroups1
Premenopausal breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old underscoring the need for new treatment options2
This is the second Breakthrough Therapy designation granted to Kisqali for initial endocrine-based treatment in HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer
EAST HANOVER, N.J., Novartis today announced Kisqali (ribociclib) received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Breakthrough Therapy designation for initial endocrine-based treatment of pre- or perimenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.
This Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on positive results of the Phase III MONALEESA-7 trial demonstrating Kisqali in combination with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to endocrine therapy alone (median PFS 23.8 (95% CI: 19.2 months-not reached) vs. 13.0 months (95% CI: 11.0-16.4 months); HR=0.553; 95% CI: 0.441-0.694; p<0.0001)1. A total of 672 women ranging from 25-58 years in age were enrolled and randomized in the trial1. All treatment combinations also included goserelin1. Treatment benefit with Kisqali combination therapy was consistent compared to the overall population regardless of treatment with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor endocrine partners, and across predefined patient subgroups1.
“This Breakthrough Therapy designation reflects the significance and promise of the MONALEESA-7 data presented at SABCS last month,” said Samit Hirawat, MD, Head, Novartis Oncology Global Drug Development. “Younger women often have distinct treatment goals and needs, and it is important for oncologists to offer effective and well-studied treatment options for their specific disease. We look forward to working with FDA to make this combination therapy available to premenopausal women living with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer in the US as soon as possible.”
MONALEESA-7 was the first Phase III trial entirely dedicated to evaluating a CDK4/6 inhibitor in premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. The trial evaluated Kisqali in combination with oral endocrine therapies (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) and goserelin compared to oral endocrine therapy and goserelin in this patient population. In subgroup analyses of median PFS by endocrine partner, Kisqali in combination with tamoxifen and goserelin demonstrated 22.1 months median PFS compared to 11.0 months for tamoxifen and goserelin alone; Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and goserelin demonstrated 27.5 months median PFS compared to 13.8 months for an aromatase inhibitor and goserelin alone1.
No new safety signals were observed in the MONALEESA-7 trial; adverse events were generally consistent with those observed in MONALEESA-2, identified early and mostly managed through dose interruptions or reductions1. Combination treatment with Kisqali was well tolerated with a discontinuation rate due to adverse events of 3.6% compared to 3.0% in patients who received endocrine therapy alone1. The most common (≥5%) grade 3/4 adverse events in patients receiving Kisqali combination therapy compared to endocrine therapy alone were neutropenia (60.6% vs. 3.6%) and leukopenia (14.3% vs. 1.2%)1.
Premenopausal breast cancer is a biologically distinct and more aggressive disease than postmenopausal breast cancer, and it is the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old2,3.
According to FDA, Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of potential new medicines that treat serious or life-threatening conditions, if the therapy has demonstrated substantial improvement over an available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program4.
This Breakthrough Therapy designation marks the second for Kisqali. The first Breakthrough Therapy designation for Kisqali was granted in August 2016 based on results of the Phase III MONALEESA-2 trial.
About MONALEESA-7
MONALEESA-7 is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Kisqali in combination with tamoxifen or a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor plus goserelin versus tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor plus goserelin, in premenopausal or perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had not previously received endocrine therapy for advanced disease. More than 670 women ranging from 25-58 years in age were randomized in the MONALEESA-7 trial.
About Kisqali® (ribociclib)
Kisqali is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a class of drugs that help slow the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins, when over-activated, can enable cancer cells to grow and divide too quickly. Targeting CDK4/6 with enhanced precision may play a role in ensuring that cancer cells do not continue to replicate uncontrollably.
Kisqali was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017, as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali is not currently approved for use in premenopausal women.
Kisqali is approved for use in 45 countries around the world, including the United States and European Union member states. Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals.
About Novartis in Advanced Breast Cancer

With one of the most diverse breast cancer pipelines and the largest number of breast cancer compounds in development, Novartis leads the industry in discovery of new therapies and combinations, especially in HR+ advanced breast cancer, the most common form of the disease.
Kisqali® (ribociclib) Important US Safety Information 
Kisqali® (ribociclib) is a prescription medicine used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as the first hormonal-based therapy to treat women who have gone through menopause with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It is not known if Kisqali is safe and effective in children. Kisqali can cause a heart problem known as QT prolongation. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and may lead to death. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a change in their heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if they feel dizzy or faint. Kisqali can cause serious liver problems. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they get any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen), and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking Kisqali and may result in infections that may be severe. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before taking Kisqali, patients should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as Kisqali can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant and who take Kisqali should use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Do not breastfeed during treatment with Kisqali and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of Kisqali. Patients should tell their health care provider about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements since they may interact with Kisqali. Patients should avoid pomegranate or pomegranate juice, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking Kisqali. The most common side effects (incidence ≥20%) of Kisqali when used with letrozole include white blood cell count decreases, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, hair thinning or hair loss, vomiting, constipation, headache, and back pain. The most common grade 3/4 side effects in the Kisqali + letrozole arm (incidence >2%) were low neutrophils, low leukocytes, abnormal liver function tests, low lymphocytes, and vomiting. Abnormalities were observed in hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Novartis-3.jpg,Regulatory,0,0,Advanced|Breakthrough Designation|Breast Cancer|FDA|HR+/HER2-|Kisqali|Novartis|receives,publish,1/3/2018,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/novartis-kisqali-received-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-initial-endocrine-based-treatment-in-premenopausal-women-with-hr-her2-advanced-breast-cancer/,https://pharmashots.com/12227/%ef%bb%bfnovartis-kisqali-aromatase-inhibitor-receives-fdas-breakthrough-designation-for-hr-her2-advanced-breast-cancer/

April 17, 2018 01:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to HEMLIBRA® (emicizumab-kxwh) for people with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to accelerate the development and review of medicines intended to treat a serious condition with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies.
“HEMLIBRA is the first medicine to show superior efficacy compared to factor VIII prophylaxis, the standard of care for people with hemophilia A without inhibitors, in an intra-patient comparison,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We look forward to working with health authorities to make HEMLIBRA available to people without inhibitors as soon as possible, and we are excited to share this news with the community as we join in celebrating World Hemophilia Day.”
This designation is based on data from the Phase III HAVEN 3 study in people 12 years or older with hemophilia A without inhibitors. In the study, HEMLIBRA prophylaxis dosed subcutaneously every week or every two weeks showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in treated bleeds compared to no prophylaxis. In an intra-patient comparison, once-weekly HEMLIBRA prophylaxis was superior to prior factor VIII prophylaxis as demonstrated by a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in treated bleeds. The most common adverse events with HEMLIBRA were injection site reactions, and no new safety signals were observed. No thrombotic microangiopathy or thrombotic events occurred in this study.
HEMLIBRA was granted its first Breakthrough Therapy Designation in September 2015 and was approved by the FDA in November 2017 for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors based on results from the HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 studies.
The HEMLIBRA development program reflects Genentech’s commitment to address clinical unmet needs in the hemophilia A community. Roche and Genentech are proud to support the World Federation of Hemophilia and the global bleeding disorders community as sponsors of World Hemophilia Day.

About HAVEN 3 (NCT02847637)
HAVEN 3 is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis (episodic/on-demand factor VIII treatment) in people with hemophilia A without inhibitors to factor VIII. The study included 152 patients with hemophilia A (12 years of age or older) who were previously treated with factor VIII therapy either on-demand or for prophylaxis. Patients previously treated with on-demand factor VIII were randomized in a 2:2:1 fashion to receive subcutaneous HEMLIBRA prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/wk until the end of study (Arm A), subcutaneous HEMLIBRA prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for 4 weeks, followed by 3 mg/kg/2wks until the end of study (Arm B), or no prophylaxis (Arm C). Patients previously treated with factor VIII prophylaxis received subcutaneous HEMLIBRA prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg/wk for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/wk until the end of study (Arm D). Episodic treatment of breakthrough bleeds with factor VIII therapy was allowed per protocol.
About HEMLIBRA
HEMLIBRA is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody. It is designed to bring together factor IXa and factor X, proteins required to activate the natural coagulation cascade and restore the blood clotting process for hemophilia A patients. HEMLIBRA is a prophylactic (preventative) treatment that can be administered by an injection of a ready-to-use solution under the skin (subcutaneously) once weekly. HEMLIBRA was created by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is being co-developed by Chugai, Roche and Genentech.
HEMLIBRA U.S. Indication
HEMLIBRA is a prescription medicine used for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.
Important Safety Information
HEMLIBRA increases the potential for blood to clot. Discontinue prophylactic use of bypassing agents the day before starting HEMLIBRA prophylaxis. Carefully follow the healthcare provider’s instructions regarding when to use an on-demand bypassing agent, and the dose and schedule one should use. Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy and thrombotic events were reported when on average a cumulative amount of >100 U/kg/24 hours of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) was administered for 24 hours or more to patients receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis.
HEMLIBRA may cause the following serious side effects when used with aPCC (FEIBA®), including:
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). This is a condition involving blood clots and injury to small blood vessels that may cause harm to one’s kidneys, brain, and other organs. Patients should get medical help right away if they have any of the following signs or symptoms during or after treatment with HEMLIBRA:
confusion
weakness
swelling of arms and legs
yellowing of skin and eyes
stomach (abdomen) or back pain
nausea or vomiting
feeling sick
decreased urination
Blood clots (thrombotic events). Blood clots may form in blood vessels in one’s arm, leg, lung or head. Patients should get medical help right away if they have any of these signs or symptoms of blood clots during or after treatment with HEMLIBRA:
swelling in arms or legs
pain or redness in the arms or legs
shortness of breath
chest pain or tightness
fast heart rate
cough up blood
feel faint
headache
numbness in the face
eye pain or swelling
trouble seeing
If aPCC (FEIBA®) is needed, patients should talk to their healthcare provider in case they feel they need more than 100 U/kg of aPCC (FEIBA®) total.
How should patients use HEMLIBRA?
HEMLIBRA may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well blood is clotting and may cause a false reading. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about how this may affect their care.
What are the other possible side effects of HEMLIBRA?
The most common side effects of HEMLIBRA include: redness, tenderness, warmth, or itching at the site of injection; headache; and joint pain.
Before using HEMLIBRA, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions, including if they:

are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if HEMLIBRA may harm their unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant should use birth control (contraception) during treatment with HEMLIBRA.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if HEMLIBRA passes into a female’s breast milk.
These are not all of the possible side effects of HEMLIBRA. Patients should call their doctor for medical advice about side effects.
Side effects may be reported to the FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch. Side effects may also be reported to Genentech at (888) 835-2555.
Please see the HEMLIBRA full Prescribing Information and the Medication Guide, including Serious Side Effects, for more important safety information.
About hemophilia A
Hemophilia A is an inherited, serious disorder in which a person’s blood does not clot properly, leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding. Hemophilia affects around 20,000 people in the United States, with hemophilia A being the most common form and approximately 50-60 percent of people living with a severe form of the disorder.
People with hemophilia A either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. In a healthy person, when a bleed occurs, factor VIII brings together the clotting factors IXa and X, which is a critical step in the formation of a blood clot to help stop bleeding. Depending on the severity of their disorder, people with hemophilia A can bleed frequently, especially into their joints or muscles. These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility and long-term joint damage.
A serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor VIII replacement therapies. Inhibitors are antibodies developed by the body’s immune system that bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor VIII, making it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a level of factor VIII sufficient to control bleeding.
About Genentech in hemophilia
In 1984, Genentech scientists were the first to clone recombinant factor VIII in response to the contaminated hemophilia blood supply crisis of the early 1980s. For more than 20 years, Genentech has been developing medicines to bring innovative treatment options to people with diseases of the blood within oncology, and in hemophilia A. Genentech is committed to improving treatment and care in the hemophilia community by delivering meaningful science and clinical expertise. For more information visit http://www.gene.com/hemophilia.

 Tecentriq (atezolizumab) + Avastin (bevacizumab) is a combination therapy, Tecentriq inhibit VEGF to restores anti-cancer immunity & Avastin shows anti-angiogenic effects enhancing the effect of Tecentriq","Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in combination with Avastin®(bevacizumab) as an initial (first-line) treatment for people with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer. The designation is based on data from a Phase Ib study assessing the safety and clinical activity of the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin.
“Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options and a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Preliminary data from the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin in this disease are promising and we look forward to working with health authorities to make this potential treatment regimen available to people with hepatocellular carcinoma as soon as possible.”
Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and to help ensure people have access to them through FDA approval as soon as possible. This is the 22nd Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Roche’s portfolio of medicines and the 3rd for Tecentriq.
Roche presented data from a Phase Ib study in HCC at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, in June 2018. These data showed that after a median follow-up of 10.3 months, responses (independent review facility (IRF) per RECIST v1.1) were seen in 15 (65 percent) of 23 efficacy-evaluable patients. Responses were seen in all subgroups, including on the basis of the cause of their disease (etiology: Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and non-viral), region (Asia excl. Japan or Japan/US), baseline alpha-fetoprotein levels (high/low) or spread of tumour beyond the liver (yes/no). Assessment by investigators (INV) assessed per RECIST v1.1 demonstrated a response rate of 61 percent (14 out of 23 patients). Median progression free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) have not yet been reached after a median follow-up of 10.3 months; results will be presented at a future medical congress when updated data from an expanded cohort are available. In the safety-evaluable population (n=43), 28 percent of patients (n=12) experienced Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events and no treatment-related Grade 5 adverse events were observed. No new safety signals were identified beyond the established safety profiles for the individual medicines. Roche provided additional data per FDA request and the Breakthrough Therapy Designation has been granted based on the totality of these data.
Earlier this year, Roche initiated IMbrave150 (NCT03434379), an open-label, multicentre, randomised Phase III study investigating the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin versus sorafenib in people with previously-untreated (first-line) locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HCC. This study is currently enrolling. Further information about the trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov.

About the Phase Ib study (NCT02715531)
This Phase Ib, open-label, multicentre study is evaluating the safety and clinical activity of a number of cancer immunotherapy combinations in different solid tumours, including Tecentriq and Avastin in patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic first-line HCC (Arm A). Participants in Arm A receive Tecentriq (1200 mg) and Avastin (15 mg/kg) intravenously (IV) every three weeks until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives of Arm A are to assess the clinical activity, based on objective response rate (ORR) assessment by independent review facility (IRF) per RECIST v1.1 and to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary efficacy endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment (INV), as well as progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP) all by INV and IRF per RECIST v1.1; and overall survival (OS).

About Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death globally1 and HCC is the most common primary malignancy of the liver. Globally, HCC is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh most common cancer among women, with over half a million new cases diagnosed annually1. HCC develops predominantly in those people with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B or C2.

About IMbrave150 (NCT03434379)
IMbrave150 is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, open-label study enrolling approximately 480 people with untreated advanced, unresectable or metastatic HCC 2:1 to receive the combination of Tecentriq and Avastin or sorafenib. Tecentriq will be administered IV, 1200mg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle and Avastin will be administered IV, 15mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Sorafenib will be administered by mouth, 400mg twice per day, on days 1-21 of each 21-day cycle. Participants will receive the combination or the control arm treatment until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. Co-primary endpoints are OS and investigator-assessed ORR. Secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed PFS, TTP, DOR and IRF-assessed ORR, PFS, TTP and DOR.

About the Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) and Avastin® (bevacizumab) combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of Tecentriq and Avastin in combination. The Tecentriq and Avastin regimen may enhance the potential of the immune system to combat a broad range of cancers. Avastin, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance Tecentriq’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression, promoting T-cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T-cell responses against tumour antigens.

About Tecentriq® (atezolizumab)
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1 expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T cells. Tecentriq has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with cancer immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers.
Tecentriq is already approved in the European Union, United States and more than 70 countries for people with previously treated metastatic NSCLC and for certain types of untreated or previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC).

About Avastin® (bevacizumab)
Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumour to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumour blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumour blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumour’s ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasize).

12242,Proteostasis' PTI-428 Receives FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Cystic Fibrosis (CF),Proteostasis Therapeutics Announces FDA Grants Breakthrough Therapy Designation for PTI-428 in Cystic Fibrosis,"The FDA’s BT designation is based on P-II study results assessing PTI-428 (50 mg, qd) vs PBO in 24 CF with F508del mutation on background treatment with Orkambi for 28 days
 The P-II study results: improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) 5.2%; increase in nasal mucosal CFTR protein
 Proteostasis’ PTI-428 is a part of triple combination therapy including PTI-808 (potentiator) & PTI-801 (corrector) involved in increasing the level of CFTR protein to treat CF patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene","Designation granted for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF patients based on the results from a recent Phase 2, randomized, placebo controlled study
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTI), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of groundbreaking therapies to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) and other diseases caused by dysfunctional protein processing, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for PTI-428, the Company’s cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) amplifier.

FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug aimed at treating a serious or life-threatening disease where there is a significant unmet need and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may offer substantial improvement over existing therapies. Less than half of the drugs submitted for Breakthrough Therapy under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act have been granted the designation since the inception of the program. In the CFTR modulator category, Breakthrough Therapy Designation was granted to Kalydeco® and Orkambi®.
FDA granted the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF in homozygous patients for the F508del mutation who are receiving Orkambi® as background therapy. The designation was based on the results from a recent Phase 2, randomized, placebo controlled study of PTI-428, in 24 CF subjects on background treatment with Orkambi® and who were treated with either 50 mg PTI-428 once daily or placebo for 28 consecutive days. The study results showed that treatment with PTI-428 led to mean absolute improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) of 5.2 percentage points from baseline through Day 28 compared to placebo (p<0.05). Additionally, consistent with the CFTR amplifier mechanism of action, a positive increase in nasal mucosal CFTR protein was observed in PTI-428 treated subjects and the magnitude of change compared to baseline was consistent with the changes in CFTR protein levels observed in the in vitro human bronchial cell model, whereas the placebo subjects had no significant increase in CFTR protein during the treatment period.
“We believe the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for PTI-428 reflects the strength of the recent Phase 2 study results for our amplifier, a novel and proprietary class of CFTR modulators,” said Meenu Chhabra, president and chief executive officer of Proteostasis. “PTI-428 can potentially be added to current and future standards of care, offering the potential for improvement in pulmonary function for patients with cystic fibrosis. We look forward to working closely with the FDA as we advance our clinical programs for PTI-428, including as part of our proprietary triple combination with PTI-801 and PTI-808, our third generation corrector and potentiator, respectively.”
About PTI-428
PTI-428 is an investigational CFTR amplifier in development for the treatment of CF in patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene as an add-on therapy to approved CFTR modulators or as part of PTI’s proprietary triple combination regimen that includes PTI-808, a potentiator, and PTI-801, a corrector. PTI-428 works early during CFTR biogenesis to increase levels of newly synthesized CFTR protein, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits in combination with CFTR correctors and potentiators.

12248,Novartis' Promacta Receives FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA),Novartis drug Promacta receives FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for first-line use in severe aplastic anemia (SAA),"The US FDA grants BT designation to Promacta (eltrombopag) + standard immunosuppressive therapy (SIT) for patients with 1L severe aplastic anemia (SAA)
 The BT designation is based on research conducted at NIH results demonstrated complete response @6mos. (52%) & ORR (85%)
 Promacta (eltrombopag) is a TPO receptor agonist and has received FDA’s & EU’s approval for thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients >1yr with insufficient response to corticosteroids and immunoglobulins","Data supporting designation showed over half of treatment-naïve SAA patients achieved complete response with Promacta when given with standard immunosuppressive therapy, with overall response rate of 85%[1]
Promacta is the only TPO receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of patients with SAA, currently in the refractory setting
Regulatory filings of the first-line indication in US and EU expected in 2018
Basel, – Novartis today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Promacta® (eltrombopag) for use in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) as a first-line therapy. Promacta, which is marketed as Revolade®in most countries outside the US, is already approved as a second-line therapy in the refractory setting in SAA. Promacta is also approved for adults and children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), for patients who are refractory to other treatments.
SAA is a rare blood disorder in which a patient’s bone marrow fails to produce enough red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets[2]. As a result, people living with this serious disease may experience debilitating symptoms and complications, such as fatigue, trouble breathing, recurring infections and abnormal bruising or bleeding that can limit their daily activities[2]. Up to one-third of patients do not respond to current therapies or relapse, causing symptoms to return[3].
“Promacta is a promising medicine that, if approved for first-line use in severe aplastic anemia, may redefine the standard of care for patients with this rare and serious bone marrow condition,” said Samit Hirawat, MD, Head, Novartis Oncology Global Drug Development. “We will continue to work closely with the FDA to make Promacta available to patients with SAA who are new to treatment as soon as possible.”
Novartis’ analysis of research conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) showed that over half (52%) of patients with treatment-naïve SAA achieved complete response at six months when treated with Promacta at the initiation of and concurrently with standard immunosuppressive treatment. The overall response rate was 85%.
According to FDA guidelines, treatments that receive Breakthrough Therapy designation are those that treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints based on preliminary clinical evidence.
About Promacta® (eltrombopag)
Eltrombopag, marketed as Promacta® in the United States and Revolade® in countries outside the US, is approved in more than 100 countries worldwide for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to other treatments, approved in over 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who are refractory to other treatments, and also approved in more than 50 countries for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow them to initiate and maintain interferon-based therapy. Eltrombopag is approved in the US and in the European Union for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients 1 year and older with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids and immunoglobulins.
Important Safety Information for Promacta® (eltrombopag)
Promacta can cause serious side effects, including liver problems, abnormal liver function tests, high platelet counts and higher risk for blood clots, and new or worsened cataracts (a clouding of the lens in the eye).
Promacta is not for treatment of people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). If you have MDS and receive Promacta, your MDS condition may worsen and become AML. If MDS worsens to become AML, you may die sooner from AML.
For patients who have chronic hepatitis C virus and take Promacta with interferon and ribavirin treatment, Promacta may increase the risk of liver problems. Patients should tell a healthcare provider right away if they have any of these signs and symptoms of liver problems including yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), unusual darkening of the urine, unusual tiredness, right upper stomach area pain, confusion, swelling of the stomach area (abdomen).
A healthcare provider will order blood tests to check the liver before starting Promacta and during Promacta treatment. In some cases, treatment with Promacta may need to be stopped due to changes in liver function tests.
The risk of getting a blood clot is increased if the platelet count is too high during treatment with Promacta. The risk of getting a blood clot may also be increased during treatment with Promacta if platelet counts are normal or low. Some forms of blood clots, such as clots that travel to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes can cause severe problems or death. A healthcare provider will check blood platelet counts, and change the dose of Promacta or stop Promacta, if platelet counts get too high. Patients should tell a healthcare provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of a blood clot in the leg, such as swelling, pain, or tenderness in the leg.
People with chronic liver disease may be at risk for a type of blood clot in the stomach area. Patients should tell a healthcare provider right away if they have stomach area pain that may be a symptom of this type of blood clot.
New or worsened cataracts have happened in people taking Promacta. A healthcare provider will check the patient’s eyes before and during treatment with Promacta. Patients should tell a healthcare provider about any changes in eyesight while taking Promacta.
Patients should tell a healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Promacta may affect the way certain medicines work. Certain medicines may keep Promacta from working correctly. Patients should take Promacta at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after taking products such as antacids used to treat stomach ulcers or heartburn and multivitamins or products that contain iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, selenium, and zinc, which may be found in mineral supplements. Patients should ask a healthcare provider if they are not sure if the medicine is one that is listed above.
Patients should avoid situations and medications that may increase the risk of bleeding while taking Promacta.
The most common side effects of Promacta when used to treat chronic ITP in adults are: nausea; diarrhea; upper respiratory tract infection (symptoms may include runny nose, stuffy nose, and sneezing); vomiting; muscle aches; urinary tract infection (symptoms may include frequent or urgent need to urinate, low fever in some people, pain or burning with urination); pain or swelling (inflammation) in the throat or mouth (oropharyngeal pain and pharyngitis); abnormal liver function tests; back pain; flu-like symptoms (influenza), including fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, and body aches; skin tingling, itching, or burning; and rash.
The most common side effects of Promacta in children 1 year and older when used to treat chronic ITP are: upper respiratory tract infections (symptoms may include runny nose, stuffy nose, and sneezing); pain or swelling (inflammation) in the nose and throat (nasopharyngitis); cough; diarrhea; pyrexia; runny, stuffy nose (rhinitis); stomach (abdominal) pain; pain or swelling (inflammation) in the throat or mouth; toothache; abnormal liver function tests; rash; runny nose (rhinorrhea).
The most common side effects when Promacta is used in combination with other medicines to treat chronic HCV are: low red blood cell count (anemia); fever; tiredness; headache; nausea; diarrhea; decreased appetite; flu-like symptoms (influenza), including fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, and body aches; feeling weak; trouble sleeping; cough; itching; chills; muscle aches; hair loss; and swelling in the ankles, feet, and legs.
The most common side effects of Promacta when used to treat severe aplastic anemia are: nausea, feeling tired, cough, diarrhea, headache, pain in arms, legs, hands or feet, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, pain in nose or throat, abdominal pain, bruising, muscle spasms, abnormal liver function tests, joint pain, and runny nose.

 The P-III ECHELON-2 study results: met it’s 1EPs & 2EPs; improvement in PFS, superior OS; CRR and ORR were statistically significant in favor of the Adcetris + CHP arm; safe & effective
 Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin, IV) is an ADC with anti-CD30 mAb, co-developed by Seattle Genetics and Takeda and has received FDA’s approval for 5 indications including r/r CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT, r/r sALCL, CD30+ CTCL","-Designation Based on Positive Phase 3 ECHELON-2 Trial Evaluating ADCETRIS in Frontline CD30-Expressing Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas; Data to be Presented at Upcoming American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December-

BOTHELL, Wash.– Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) for previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma or other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified, in combination with CHP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone). The positive topline results of the phase 3 ECHELON-2 clinical trial were announced in October 2018, followed by the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA in November 2018. Additional data will be presented at the upcoming American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, December 1-4, 2018 in San Diego, Calif. ADCETRIS is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed to CD30, which is expressed on the surface of several types of PTCL. ADCETRIS is currently not approved for the frontline treatment of PTCL.
The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of promising drug candidates for serious or life-threatening conditions. It is based upon clinical evidence of substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
“Data from the ECHELON-2 phase 3 trial of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy showed superior progression-free survival and overall survival versus the standard of care chemotherapy regimen, CHOP, in the treatment of frontline CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas,” said Clay Siegall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Seattle Genetics. “This is the third Breakthrough Therapy Designation for ADCETRIS and supports our goal to make this therapy available to patients with newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphomas as soon as possible. We look forward to presenting the data from our phase 3 ECHELON-2 trial at the upcoming ASH Annual Meeting.”
This Breakthrough Therapy Designation was based on data from the phase 3 ECHELON-2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP versus the control arm, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), in previously untreated CD30-expressing PTCL. The ECHELON-2 study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of ADCETRIS in combination with CHP versus CHOP as assessed by an Independent Review Facility (IRF; hazard ratio=0.71; p-value=0.0110). The ADCETRIS plus CHP arm also demonstrated superior overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, compared to CHOP (hazard ratio=0.66; p-value=0.0244). All other key secondary endpoints, including PFS in patients with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), complete remission rate and objective response rate were statistically significant in favor of the ADCETRIS plus CHP arm. The safety profile of ADCETRIS plus CHP in the ECHELON-2 trial was comparable to CHOP and consistent with the established safety profile of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy.
ECHELON-2 Phase 3 Clinical Trial Design
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial is investigating ADCETRIS plus CHP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone) versus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) as frontline therapy in patients with CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphoma, also known as mature T-cell lymphoma. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) per Independent Review Facility assessment, with events defined as progression, death, or receipt of chemotherapy for residual or progressive disease. Secondary endpoints include PFS in patients with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), complete remission rate, overall survival and objective response rate, in addition to safety. The multi-center trial was conducted at sites across North America, Europe and Asia and was designed to enroll 450 patients, approximately 75 percent of whom were to be diagnosed with sALCL. The ECHELON-2 trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the trial also received European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific advice.

About T-Cell Lymphomas
Lymphoma is a general term for a group of cancers that originate in the lymphatic system. There are two major categories of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are more than 60 subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphomas which are broadly divided into two major groups: B-cell lymphomas, which develop from abnormal B-lymphocytes, and T-cell lymphomas, which develop from abnormal T-lymphocytes. There are many different forms of T-cell lymphomas, some of which are extremely rare. T-cell lymphomas can be aggressive (fast-growing) or indolent (slow-growing). PTCL accounts for approximately 10 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases in the U.S. and Europe and may be as high as 24 percent in parts of Asia.
About ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin)
ADCETRIS is being evaluated broadly in more than 70 clinical trials in CD30-expressing lymphomas. These include the recently completed phase 3 ECHELON-2 trial in frontline peripheral T-cell lymphomas (also known as mature T-cell lymphoma), the completed phase 3 ECHELON-1 trial in previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma, the completed phase 3 ALCANZA trial in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and the ongoing CHECKMATE 812 trial of ADCETRIS in combination with Opdivo (nivolumab) for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.
ADCETRIS is an ADC comprising an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody attached by a protease-cleavable linker to a microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), utilizing Seattle Genetics’ proprietary technology. The ADC employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing tumor cells.
ADCETRIS injection for intravenous infusion has received FDA approval for five indications in adult patients with: (1) previously untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), in combination with chemotherapy, (2) cHL at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation, (3) cHL after failure of auto-HSCT or failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates, (4) sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen, and (5) primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) who have received prior systemic therapy.
Health Canada granted ADCETRIS approval with conditions for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL in 2013, and non-conditional approval for post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) consolidation treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma patients at increased risk of relapse or progression.
ADCETRIS received conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission in October 2012. The approved indications in Europe are: (1) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT, or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option, (2) the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL, (3) for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT, and (4) for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least one prior systemic therapy.
ADCETRIS has received marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in 72 countries for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL. See select important safety information, including Boxed Warning, below.
Seattle Genetics and Takeda are jointly developing ADCETRIS. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Seattle Geneticshas U.S. and Canadian commercialization rights and Takeda has rights to commercialize ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. Seattle Genetics and Takeda are funding joint development costs for ADCETRIS on a 50:50 basis, except in Japan where Takeda is solely responsible for development costs.

ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) Important Safety Information
BOXED WARNING: PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY (PML):
JC virus infection resulting in PML and death can occur in ADCETRIS-treated patients.
Contraindication
ADCETRIS concomitant with bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity (e.g., interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation).
Warnings and Precautions

Peripheral neuropathy (PN): ADCETRIS causes PN that is predominantly sensory. Cases of motor PN have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced PN is cumulative. Monitor for symptoms such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Institute dose modifications accordingly.
Anaphylaxis and infusion reactions: Infusion-related reactions (IRR), including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients during infusion. If an IRR occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapy. Premedicate patients with a prior IRR before subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid.
Hematologic toxicities: Fatal and serious cases of febrile neutropenia have been reported with ADCETRIS. Prolonged (≥1 week) severe neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia can occur with ADCETRIS. Administer G-CSF primary prophylaxis starting with Cycle 1 for previously untreated patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for Stage III or IV classical HL. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each ADCETRIS dose. Consider more frequent monitoring for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for fever. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or G-CSF prophylaxis with subsequent doses.
Serious infections and opportunistic infections: Infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. Closely monitor patients during treatment for bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.
Tumor lysis syndrome: Closely monitor patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden.
Increased toxicity in the presence of severe renal impairment: The frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment.
Increased toxicity in the presence of moderate or severe hepatic impairment: The frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Avoid use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and serious cases have occurred in ADCETRIS-treated patients. Cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin, and occurred after the first ADCETRIS dose or rechallenge. Preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may increase the risk. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. Patients with new, worsening, or recurrent hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.
PML: Fatal cases of JC virus infection resulting in PML and death have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. First onset of symptoms occurred at various times from initiation of ADCETRIS therapy, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial exposure. Other possible contributory factors other than ADCETRIS include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression. Consider PML diagnosis in patients with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities. Hold ADCETRIS if PML is suspected and discontinue ADCETRIS if PML is confirmed.
Pulmonary toxicity: Fatal and serious events of noninfectious pulmonary toxicity including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms, including cough and dyspnea. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, hold ADCETRIS dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.
Serious dermatologic reactions: Fatal and serious cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with ADCETRIS. If SJS or TEN occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy.
Gastrointestinal (GI) complications: Fatal and serious cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported. Other fatal and serious GI complications include perforation, hemorrhage, erosion, ulcer, intestinal obstruction, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, and ileus. Lymphoma with preexisting GI involvement may increase the risk of perforation. In the event of new or worsening GI symptoms, perform a prompt diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately.
Embryo-fetal toxicity: Based on the mechanism of action and animal studies, ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus, and to avoid pregnancy during ADCETRIS treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of ADCETRIS.
Most Common (≥20%) Adverse Reactions: Neutropenia, anemia,peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and pyrexia.
Drug Interactions
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, or P-gp inhibitors, has the potential to affect the exposure to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).
Use in Specific Populations
Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment: MMAE exposure and adverse reactions are increased. Avoid use.
Advise males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during ADCETRIS treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of ADCETRIS.
Advise patients to report pregnancy immediately and avoid breastfeeding while receiving ADCETRIS.

 FDA’s BT designation is granted to the drugs showing substantial improvement over currently available therapy in serious or life-threatening conditions on at least one clinically significant endpoint with benefits of Priority Review and accelerated approval
 Psilocybin is a serotonin 2 receptor agonist, being evaluated in a clinical study for treatment-resistant depression in EU and North America","COMPASS Pathways, a life sciences company dedicated to accelerating patient access to evidence-based innovation in mental health, has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression.
The FDA designates a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy if preliminary clinical evidence shows that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. Breakthrough Therapies are supported by the FDA throughout the clinical development programme to ensure as efficient a process as possible.
Breakthrough Therapy designation is a significant milestone for psilocybin therapy and psilocybin research, and a testament to the work done over many years by research teams in the US, the UK and Switzerland. The Heffter Research Institute was the first to fund research in this field, and supported early studies at Johns Hopkins University, New York University, and Harbor-UCLA. In the UK, the Medical Research Council backed the proof-of-concept study of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression at Imperial College London in 2015. COMPASS Pathways is now running the first large-scale psilocybin therapy clinical trial for treatment-resistant depression, which will take place in Europe and North America over the next year or so.
George Goldsmith, Executive Chairman, COMPASS Pathways, said, “This is great news for patients. We are excited to be taking this work forward with our clinical trial on psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression. The FDA will be working closely with us to expedite the development process and increase the chances of getting this treatment to people suffering with depression as quickly as possible.”
Treatment-resistant depression is a huge unmet need, affecting 100 million people around the world who do not respond to existing treatments. Depression is one of the fastest growing health problems we face today, and the leading cause of ill-health and disability worldwide. The Breakthrough Therapy designation for psilocybin therapy highlights the importance of supporting early research that can be translated to clinically meaningful outcomes.
Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, Head of the Psychedelic Research Group, Imperial College London, said, “In our 2015 study, we provided psilocybin to 19 patients in a clinical setting, coupled with psychological support, and found promising signals of efficacy and safety as treatment for treatment-resistant depression. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a strong endorsement for the potential of psilocybin therapy. We look forward to learning more as further clinical studies are carried out, by our team at Imperial College as well as in COMPASS’s multi-centre trial.”
Dr David Nichols, Chairman of the Board, Heffter Research Institute, said, “Since its inception in 1993, Heffter has been helping to design, review, and fund the early phase clinical studies on psilocybin at research institutions in the US and Europe. We are delighted that psilocybin is being recognised as a Breakthrough Therapy and look forward to continuing our work with researchers and partners around the world so that we can alleviate the suffering caused by mental illness.”

– Sage has received two Breakthrough Therapy designations for separate psychiatric drug candidates, reinforcing the Company’s distinct approach to developing therapeutics to treat serious brain disorders –

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Feb. 7, 2018– Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to SAGE-217 for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). This is the second Breakthrough Therapy designation granted to Sage since 2016.
The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to offer a potentially expedited development path and review for promising drug candidates, which includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA. This regulatory decision was based primarily on the recent positive results from the Phase 2, placebo-controlled trial of SAGE-217 in 89 adult patients with moderate to severe MDD. In the trial, SAGE-217 met the primary endpoint with a statistically significant mean reduction in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) 17-item total score from baseline at Day 15 in the SAGE-217 group, compared to placebo (p<0.0001). Statistically significant improvements were observed in the HAM-D score compared to placebo by the morning following the first dose through Week 4 and the effects of SAGE-217 remained numerically greater than placebo through the end of follow-up at Week 6. SAGE-217 was generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse events in the SAGE-217 group were headache, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence.
Detailed results of the Phase 2, placebo-controlled trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
About FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation
The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned for use, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus an organizational commitment involving the FDA’s senior managers with more intensive guidance from the FDA. Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for approval.
About Major Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common but serious mood disorder in which patients exhibit depressive symptoms, such as a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a two-week period, and demonstrate impaired social, occupational, educational or other important functioning. It is estimated that approximately 16 million people in the U.S. suffer from MDD each year. While antidepressants are widely used for treatment, large scale studies have demonstrated the need for additional therapies.
About the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)
HAM-D is a validated rating scale used to provide an assessment of depression, and as a guide to evaluate recovery. This scale is an accepted regulatory endpoint for depression. The scale is used in clinical research to rate the severity of a patient’s depression by probing mood, feelings of guilt, suicidal ideation, insomnia, agitation, anxiety, weight loss, and somatic symptoms.
About SAGE-217
SAGE-217 is a next generation positive allosteric modulator that targets synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptors and has a pharmacokinetic profile intended for daily oral dosing. The GABA system is the major inhibitory signaling pathway of the brain and CNS and contributes significantly to regulating CNS function. SAGE-217 is currently being developed in the treatment of MDD and certain other affective disorders, Parkinson’s disease and sleep disorders.

12352,ï»¿Avita Medical Reports Results of RECELL System in Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Compassionate Use and Continued Access Studies for Third-Degree Burns in Pediatric Patients,AVITA Medical Announces Presentation at ABA Meeting Highlighting Results of Study Using RECELL System to Treat Third-Degree Burns in Pediatric Patients,"The IDE compassionate use and continued access studies involve assessing of Spray-On Skin Cells prepared using the RECELL system + meshed autografts in 107 pediatric patients with deep burn injuries
 The interim analyses results: healing within 4wks. (98%); patients with >50% TBSA achieve the same rate of healing as patients with ≤50% TBSA; donor sites healed within a wk. & 2wks. (62.5% & 100%); Presented at the American Burn Association (ABA)
 The RECELL system is an autologous cell harvesting device utilizes the patient’s own skin to produce a suspension of Spray-On Skin Cells in 30mins. for the treatment of thermal burns. In Sept’18, it has received FDA’s approval for acute thermal burns in patients ≥ 18yrs. with TGA registration in Australia & CFDA clearance in China","Professor Fiona Wood, co-inventor of the RECELL System, described her experience treating
more than 3,500 patients using RECELL and resulting benefits including reduced time to healing
and decreased length of hospitalization
The publication of the RECELL System pivotal trial in the treatment of second-degree burns was
selected as a top journal publication for 2018
Valencia, Calif., USA, and Melbourne, Australia, AVITA Medical (ASX: AVH, OTCQX: AVMXY)
a global regenerative medicine company, announced that interim results describing clinical outcomes for
pediatric patients treated using the RECELL® System were presented at the American Burn Association (ABA)
51st Annual Meeting in Las Vegas by Jeffrey Carter, MD, FACS University Medical Center New Orleans Burn
Center and LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine. Patients enrolled in the Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE) Compassionate Use and Continued Access studies had mixed-depth and full-thickness
(third-degree) burns and were treated with the combination of Spray-On Skin™ Cells prepared using the
RECELL system and widely meshed autografts. Patients in the studies experienced excellent healing
outcomes, with 98% of wounds healed four weeks after treatment. Dr. Carter’s presentation describing the
treatment of pediatric patients was selected as a “Best of the Best Abstract” out of more than 500 abstract
submissions to the ABA meeting.
Another one of the ten presentations related to the RECELL System at the ABA meeting was a long-term
review of patient outcomes by the co-inventor of the technology, Professor Fiona Wood, AM, Burns Service
of Western Australia, Fiona Stanley and Perth Children’s Hospitals. Professor Wood described her
experience treating more than 3,500 patients with burns and other cutaneous injuries. In addition, the 2018
publication of the RECELL System pivotal trial in second-degree burns in the Journal of Burn Care & Research
was recognized during the “The Year in Review: The Top Journal Publications” session of the ABA meeting.
The RECELL System uses a small amount of a patient’s own skin to prepare Spray-On Skin Cells at the point
of care in as little as 30 minutes, providing a new way to treat thermal burns. The RECELL System was
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2018 for the treatment of acute
thermal burns in patients 18 years and older. The pediatric presentation includes a class of patients that fall
outside of the currently approved U.S.
Best of the Best Abstract – Pediatric Burn Care
Dr. Carter presented data showing that 98% of mixed-depth/full-thickness burn Injuries in pediatric patients
treated using Spray-On Skin Cells in combination with widely spaced meshed autografts were healed within
four weeks of treatment. The presentation titled “Evaluation of a Pediatric Population Treated for Burn
Injuries Using an Autologous Skin Cell Suspension: Interim Analysis” described the interim outcomes for 23
pediatric patients with a median age of 6.7 years old (ranging from 0.8 to 16.0) treated under FDA-IDE
approved Compassionate Use and Continued Access programs. In patients with extensive burn injuries, lack
of available donor skin is a major limitation achieving permanent closure, and the longer a wound remains
open the more susceptible a patient is to infection. In the U.S., one-third of burn injuries occur in children,
and the availability of donor skin for traditional meshed autografts is even more limited in pediatric patients
with extensive injuries. The use of the RECELL System, a donor skin sparing technology that enables rapid
definitive closure of burn wounds, has the potential to improve patient outcomes.
In this study of pediatric patients which included those with life-threatening thermal burn injuries, Spray-On
Skin Cells prepared using the RECELL System were applied in combination with widely meshed splitthickness autografts to achieve definitive closure using minimal donor skin. A total of 107 burn injuries were
treated in the study, and 98% achieved definitive healing within four weeks of treatment. Importantly, for
patients with greater than 50% total body surface area (TBSA) burns, treatment with the combination of
Spray-On Skin Cells and widely meshed split-thickness autografts achieved the same high rate of healing at
week four as patients with smaller burns (burns equal to or less than 50% TBSA) treated with the same
combination. In addition, in the study the donor sites on all patients were treated with Spray-On Skin Cells,
and 62.5% of the donor sites were healed within a week of treatment, and 100% were completely healed
within two weeks of treatment.
“This interim analysis supports the use of the RECELL System as a viable option for treatment in these
deeper burn injuries in pediatric patients,” said Jeffrey Carter, MD, FACS University Medical Center New
Orleans Burn Center and LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine. “In this vulnerable patient
population, we observed excellent clinical outcomes with 98% of wounds healing within four weeks of
treatment, and with the majority of burn sites having cosmetic outcomes rated as satisfactory or equivalent
compared to uninjured skin. The early healing of donor sites contributed to a decrease between harvest
times for patients with limited donor skin availability.”
Co-Inventor of the RECELL System Describes More than Ten years of Experience with the RECELL System
Professor Wood described her long-term experience treating more than 3,500 patients using the RECELL
System in a presentation titled “10 years of clinical experience using point of care non cultured autologous
skin cell suspension harvested using the RECELL System.” Professor Wood, the co-inventor of the technology
forming the basis for the RECELL System, provided an analysis of the long-term impact of the integration of
the RECELL System as the standard of care in a health system providing burn care to a population of 2.6
million in Western Australia. For more than a decade the RECELL System was used in the treatment of more
than 3,500 patients, 90% of which had acute burn injuries, 9% were treated for scar revision, and 1% had
other wounds. More than 700 of these patients were pediatric patients, with approximately 50% suffering
scald injuries.
“Our use of cell-based therapies which ultimately evolved into the RECELL System was driven by our desire
to reduce the time to healing and improve the outcomes for our burn patients. The quality of life must be
worth the pain of survival,“ said Professor Fiona Wood, AM, Burns Service of Western Australia, Fiona
Stanley and Perth Children’s Hospitals. “Treatment using the RECELL System was associated with a reduction
in the number of surgical procedures, earlier intervention, and reduction in time to healing and length of
stay. The RECELL System facilitated early intervention and wound healing as a solo treatment in partialthickness injuries, and in combination with traditional techniques in deeper injuries with limited donor sites.
Using a cumulative outcome index, intervention within one week of injury was associated with significantly
improved outcome at three months which was maintained at one-year post injury.”

(NASDAQ: REGN), announced today a collaboration to discover, develop and commercialize new RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing disease targets expressed in the eye and central nervous system (CNS), in addition to a select number of targets expressed in the liver. The collaboration will leverage both companies’ scientific and technological expertise and will build on Alnylam’s recent preclinical data showing potent and highly durable delivery of RNAi therapeutics to achieve target gene silencing in the eye and CNS. The collaboration will also benefit from Regeneron’s industry-leading VelociSuite® technologies and capabilities from the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC).
Under the terms of the alliance, Alnylam will work exclusively with Regeneron to discover RNAi therapeutics for eye and CNS diseases. Regeneron will lead development and commercialization for all programs targeting eye diseases, with Alnylam entitled to potential milestone and royalty payments. The companies will jointly advance and alternate leadership on CNS programs, with the lead party retaining global development and commercial responsibility. For CNS programs, both companies will have the option at candidate selection to participate equally in potential future profits of programs led by the other party.
The collaboration also includes a select number of RNAi therapeutic programs designed to target genes expressed in the liver, which can influence a wide variety of diseases throughout the body. These programs include a planned joint effort evaluating anti-C5 antibody-siRNA combinations for C5 complement-mediated diseases including evaluating the combination of Regeneron’s pozelimab (REGN3918), currently in Phase 1 development, with Alnylam’s cemdisiran, currently in Phase 2 development. Alnylam will retain control of cemdisiran monotherapy development, and Regeneron will lead combination development. The parties will equally share investment and potential future profits on the monotherapy program, and Alnylam will receive royalties on any potential combination product sales. For all other alliance liver programs, the parties will alternate leadership and participate equally in potential profits. The companies will continue their previously-announced collaboration to identify RNAi therapeutics for the chronic liver disease nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) based on novel RGC findings. Alnylam retains broad global rights to all of its other unpartnered liver-directed clinical and preclinical pipeline programs.
“At Regeneron we believe the best use of our resources is to invest in potentially game-changing science that will yield innovative medicines for patients with serious diseases. This collaboration couples proven and emerging RNAi technology, which holds important promise in many diseases, with Regeneron’s world-leading genetics research and target discovery engine,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “This collaboration enables us to reach targets inside the cell complementing our expertise in antibodies, which are ideal for extracellular targets and those on the cell surface. Through the RGC and our other research groups, we are already identifying additional targets that may be well-suited for RNAi-based drug development, particularly in the eye and CNS.”
“This new industry-leading alliance is aimed at realizing what we believe to be a significant opportunity for RNAi therapeutics as potentially transformative medicines for ocular and CNS diseases. We are thrilled to collaborate with Regeneron, a like-minded science-based organization, to significantly accelerate our efforts to bring RNAi therapeutics to patients,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “Importantly, the alliance structure enables Alnylam to continue to build its industry-leading pipeline of RNAi therapeutics while retaining significant product rights. In addition, the near-term payments under this new agreement will strengthen Alnylam’s balance sheet with over $2 billion in pro forma cash upon closing of the transaction, supporting our global efforts to develop and commercialize multiple products as potentially breakthrough medicines and advance our profile toward sustainable profitability.”
Regeneron has agreed to make a $400 million upfront payment to Alnylam and to purchase $400 million of Alnylam equity at a price per share of $90.00 (4.44 million common shares), based on the volume-weighted average price over the last fifteen-trading-day period. Alnylam is eligible to receive up to an additional $200 million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain criteria during early clinical development for the eye and CNS programs. The companies plan to advance programs directed to 30 targets and introduce many into clinical development during the initial five-year discovery period, which includes an option to extend. For each program, Regeneron will provide Alnylam with $2.5 million in funding at program initiation and an additional $2.5 million at lead candidate identification, translating to the potential for approximately $30 million in annual discovery funding to Alnylam as the alliance reaches steady state. The alliance and equity-related agreements are subject to customary closing conditions and clearances, including clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
Alnylam, alongside multiple other leading life sciences companies, is also a member of Regeneron’s pre-competitive consortium to sequence the DNA of 500,000 individuals in the UK Biobank health resource and subsequently make the data publicly available to the global research community.

 The study demonstrated a non-inferiority data based on plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per milliliter (c/mL) and resulted in no virologic failure
 Dovato is a qd regimen of dolutegravir (DTG,50 mg) & lamivudine (3TC, 300 mg) involved in reduction of exposure to the number of ARVs and is under review by EMA and Health Canada, additional submissions planned throughout 2019. In 2009, GSK and Pfizer collaborated to build ViiV Healthcare focusing on HIV therapies","Approval based on GEMINI pivotal trials in which Dovato achieved non-inferior efficacy compared to a dolutegravir-based, traditional, three-drug regimen through 48 weeks, with no cases of resistance
Dovato strengthens ViiV Healthcare’s industry-leading portfolio of innovative treatment approaches for people living with HIV.
Issued: London, UK
ViiV Healthcare today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dovato, a complete, once-daily, single-tablet regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg and lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults with no antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history and with no known resistance to either DTG or 3TC. Dovato, a two-drug regimen (2DR), reduces exposure to the number of ARVs from the start of treatment, while still maintaining the efficacy and high barrier to resistance of a traditional DTG-based three-drug regimen.[1]
Deborah Waterhouse, CEO, ViiV Healthcare, said: “Building on our innovative portfolio of medicines, Dovato is powered by dolutegravir, an antiretroviral included in multiple combination therapies and the most prescribed integrase inhibitor in the world,[2] coupled with the established profile of lamivudine. With Dovato, the first complete, single-tablet, two-drug regimen for treatment-naïve adults, ViiV Healthcare is delivering what patients are requesting—a chance to treat their HIV-1 infection with as few drugs as possible, marking a significant step in HIV treatment.”
The approval of Dovato is supported by the landmark global GEMINI 1 and 2 studies that included more than 1,400 HIV-1 infected adults. In these studies, DTG + 3TC demonstrated non-inferiority based on plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per milliliter (c/mL), a standard measure of HIV-1 control, at Week 48 when compared to a three-drug regimen of DTG and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), in treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected adults. The safety results for DTG + 3TC seen in GEMINI 1 and 2 were consistent with the product labelling for DTG and 3TC. No patient who experienced virologic failure in either treatment arm developed treatment-emergent resistance.[1]
Pedro Cahn, principal investigator for the GEMINI study program said: “People are now living longer with HIV and will spend a lifetime taking drugs to suppress their virus. The approval of the fixed dose combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine, a complete, single-tablet, two-drug regimen, marks a pivotal moment in the treatment of HIV-1. Treatment-naïve people living with the virus have a powerful option that delivers non-inferior efficacy to a dolutegravir-based three-drug regimen, allowing them to take fewer ARVs and get and remain suppressed.”
Jeff Berry, Test Positive Aware Network (TPAN), said: “The approval of Dovato is a welcome paradigm shift, as it brings an innovative treatment approach to newly diagnosed adults with HIV-1. By exposing patients to fewer drugs at the start of treatment, the hope is to help address concerns arising from overall management of prolonged ARV therapy.”
DTG/3TC as a complete, once-daily, single-tablet, two-drug regimen for HIV-1 therapy is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and regulatory authorities in Canada, Australia, Switzerland, and South Africa and several additional submissions are planned throughout 2019.
About Dovato (dolutegravir/lamivudine)
Dovato is approved as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults with no known antiretroviral treatment history and with no known substitutions associated with resistance to either dolutegravir or lamivudine. Dovato is a once-daily, single-tablet, two-drug regimen that combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir (Tivicay, 50 mg) with the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) lamivudine (Epivir, 300 mg).
Like a DTG-based three-drug regimen, Dovato uses only two drugs to inhibit the viral cycle at two different sites. INSTIs, like dolutegravir, inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection. Lamivudine is an NRTI that works by interfering with the conversion of viral RNA into DNA which in turn stops the virus from multiplying.
Trademarks are owned by or licensed to the ViiV Healthcare group of companies.

GEMINI 1 and 2 study design
GEMINI 1 (204861) and GEMINI 2 (205543) are duplicate, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group, non-inferiority studies. These studies evaluate a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine compared with a three-drug, first-line regimen of DTG + TDF/FTC in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve adult participants with baseline HIV-1 viral loads up to 500,000 copies per milliliter. The trials are designed to study the efficacy and safety of once-daily dolutegravir and lamivudine compared to once-daily dolutegravir and the fixed-dose combination of TDF/FTC at 48 weeks in HIV-1-infected, ART-naïve adult participants. The GEMINI studies are ongoing for 148 weeks. For more information, please search for NCT02831673 (GEMINI 1) or NCT02831764 (GEMINI 2) on www.clinicaltrials.gov.

“Achieving Fast Track Designation from the FDA underscores the high unmet medical need for patients
suffering from Huntington’s disease, for which there are currently no approved, disease-modifying treatments,”
stated Matt Kapusta, chief executive officer of uniQure. “We are nearing the initiation of a Phase I/II study of
AMT-130, the first one-time administered AAV gene therapy to enter clinical testing for Huntington’s disease,
and are on track to treat the first patient in the second half of 2019.”
The FDA’s Fast Track program is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to
treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. A therapy granted Fast Track Designation may be
eligible for several benefits, including more frequent meetings and communications with the FDA and, if
relevant criteria are met, the potential for Accelerated Approval, Priority Review or Rolling Review of a Biologics
License Application (BLA) or New Drug Application (NDA).
About Huntington’s Disease
Huntington’s disease is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that leads to loss of muscle coordination,
behavioral abnormalities and cognitive decline, resulting in complete physical and mental deterioration. The
disease is an autosomal dominant condition with a disease-causing CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of
the huntingtin gene, that leads to the production and aggregation of abnormal protein in the brain. Despite the
clear etiology of Huntington’s disease, there are no therapies to delay the onset or to slow the disease’s
progression.

Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BOLD), a leading AAV-based genetic medicines company focused on developing and commercializing innovative products for serious rare neuromuscular diseases, today announced it has expanded its scientific platform and pipeline to advance vectorized antisense treatments for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). This approach combines the delivery power of AAV with the precision tools of antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, to develop potential best-in-class therapeutic candidates for these devastating neuromuscular diseases. To accelerate these promising new programs, Audentes has entered into a licensing agreement and will collaborate with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, utilizing the expertise of Kevin M. Flanigan, M.D. and Nicolas S. Wein, Ph.D., two recognized leaders in the field of genetic medicines for neuromuscular diseases.
“Today’s announcement represents a significant step forward in expanding our scientific platform and deepening our pipeline of product candidates for neuromuscular diseases with high unmet medical need,” stated Matthew R. Patterson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We see tremendous potential in combining AAV with validated oligonucleotide-based approaches to treat diseases that are not amenable to traditional AAV-based gene replacement. We believe this approach, combined with our in-house large-scale cGMP manufacturing capability, can deliver best-in-class therapies for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy.”
“We are excited to be collaborating with Audentes to advance these novel, highly differentiated approaches for DMD and DM1,” stated Dr. Flanigan,Director of Nationwide Children’s Center for Gene Therapy.
Vectorized exon skipping uses an AAV vector to deliver an antisense sequence designed to induce cells to skip over faulty or misaligned sections of genetic code, leading to the expression of a more complete, functional protein. For the treatment of DMD, this approach has the potential to provide significant advantages over microdystrophin gene replacement strategies that produce a substantially truncated protein, which may limit the degree and durability of disease correction, as well as existing ASO therapies, whose efficacy is limited by poor biodistribution to muscle tissue.
Audentes and Nationwide Children’s are collaborating to develop AT702, an AAV-antisense candidate designed to induce exon 2 skipping for DMD with duplications of exon 2 and mutations in exons 1-5 of the dystrophin gene. In preclinical studies of mice with exon 2 duplications, AT702 demonstrated robust proof-of-concept with dose-dependent increases in production of wild type or near-wild type length dystrophin protein and improvements in muscle function. Audentes is currently conducting additional preclinical work and expects to commence a Phase 1/2 study at Nationwide Children’s in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Separate from the Nationwide Children’s collaboration, Audentes is also conducting preclinical work to advance AT751 and AT753, additional vectorized exon skipping candidates, to treat DMD patients with genotypes amenable to exon 51 and exon 53 skipping. Both AT751 and AT753 utilize the same vector construct backbone as AT702, enabling a potentially accelerated path into clinical development. With these initial programs, Audentes is targeting more than 25% of patients with DMD, and has plans to leverage its vectorized exon skipping platform to develop further product candidates to address up to 80% of DMD patients over time.
In addition, Audentes and Nationwide Children’s are evaluating vectorized RNA knockdown and vectorized exon skipping for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Both approaches are designed to prevent the accumulation of toxic dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) RNA in affected cells, thereby restoring normal cellular function. RNA knockdown and exon skipping have both been clinically validated in studies with ASOs. As with DMD, combining these approaches with AAV delivery is expected to overcome the biodistribution limitations of ASO-based therapies. Preclinical studies are underway, and Audentes expects an IND for the selected product candidate, AT466, to be filed in 2020.
Audentes plans to leverage its proprietary AAV gene therapy technology platform, consisting of end-to-end internal expertise from vector construct engineering to state-of the-art large-scale cGMP manufacturing, to rapidly advance these programs from discovery through clinical development. Internal process and analytical development, fill-finish, and QC testing capabilities complete the company’s fully-integrated approach to production and release of product candidates for clinical and commercial use. The current 1,000-liter scale manufacturing operation provides enough capacity for global commercialization of the company’s lead program AT132, as well as continued clinical development of pipeline programs, and the facility is designed for expansion to include an additional 8,000 liters of production capacity.
Conference Call
At 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today, April 8, 2019, Audentes management will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss the expansion of its AAV technology platform and new development programs for DMD and DM1.

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common type of muscular dystrophy in children, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 to 5,000 male births, with more than 300,000 patients living with the disease worldwide. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes the protein dystrophin, a structural protein involved in maintaining muscle cell integrity. Patients with DMD typically develop muscle weakness in the early years of life and become wheelchair-bound in their early teens. As the disease progresses, patients typically develop respiratory, orthopedic, and cardiac complications. Cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties usually begin by the age of 20, and few individuals with DMD live beyond their thirties. There is no cure for DMD, and for most patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments.
About Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1
Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), is a rare, neuromuscular disease that affects multiple organ systems, and is characterized primarily by myotonia and progressive muscle wasting and weakness. DM1 has several forms which range in age of presentation and severity, including congenital, infantile, juvenile, and adult (classic). There are more than 100,000 patients living with DM1 across the United States, Europe, and Japan. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by a mutation called a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Patients with DM1 experience reduced quality of life and shortened life expectancy. There are no disease modifying therapies approved for DM1.

 BA3071 is an investigational CTLA-4 inhibitor will be evaluated in P-I/II as monothx and in combination with Tislelizumab, with its expected onset in H2’19 and IND submission in mid-2019. Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is an IgG4 anti–PD-1 mAb targeted to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages","SAN DIEGO and BEIJING, China and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., – BioAtla ®, LLC, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of Conditionally Active Biologic (CAB) protein therapeutics, and BeiGene, Ltd. (Nasdaq: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative molecularly-targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer, today announced that the two companies have entered into a global co-development and collaboration agreement for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of BioAtla’s investigational CAB CTLA-4 antibody (BA3071). BA3071 is a novel, CTLA-4 inhibitor that is designed to be conditionally activated in the tumor microenvironment in order to reduce systemic toxicity and potentially enable safer combinations with checkpoint inhibitors such as BeiGene’s investigational anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab, a humanized IgG4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages.

Under the terms of the collaboration, BioAtla will co-develop the CAB-CTLA-4 antibody to defined early clinical objectives and BeiGene will then lead the parties’ joint efforts to develop the product candidate and be responsible for global regulatory filings and commercialization. Subject to the terms of the agreement, BeiGene will hold a co-exclusive license with BioAtla to develop and manufacture the product candidate globally and an exclusive license to commercialize the product candidate globally. BeiGene will be responsible for all costs of development, manufacturing and commercialization in Asia (ex-Japan), Australia and New Zealand, and the parties will share development and manufacturing costs and commercial profits and losses upon specified terms in the rest of the world. BioAtla will receive an upfront payment of $20 million and a milestone payment upon reaching the defined early clinical objectives. BioAtla is also eligible to receive up to $249 million in subsequent development and regulatory milestones globally and commercial milestones in the BeiGene territory, together with tiered royalties on sales in the BeiGene territory. Additional terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
“BeiGene is a recognized leader in China-inclusive global clinical development, with broad oncology clinical programs, which include tislelizumab,” said Scott Smith, President of BioAtla. “This collaboration complements our strategy of building our pipeline of innovative CAB oncology candidates, advancing combination product therapies, and effectively addressing markets with strong growth potential and high unmet medical need.”
“BioAtla has developed an exciting proprietary protein discovery and expression platform to generate CABs, which in turn have been applied to BA3071, a novel, investigational CTLA-4 inhibitor that is designed to be conditionally activated in the tumor microenvironment,” commented Dr. Lai Wang, Senior Vice President, Asia Pacific Clinical Development, Global Research, Clinical Operations and Biometrics, for BeiGene. “The unique nature of BA3071 provides an exciting opportunity to combine this CTLA-4 antibody with our anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab. We look forward to working with BioAtla through proof-of-concept, followed by global development of this potentially unique cancer therapy as a single agent or in combination with other therapies.”
“We believe that our collaboration with BeiGene will accelerate the global development and potential commercialization of BA3071 and advance the prospects and potential of safer and more effective combination therapies for the treatment of several cancer indications,” stated Jay M. Short, Ph.D., Chairman, CEO and co-founder of BioAtla. “The application of BioAtla’s CAB technology to CTLA-4 inhibition may offer greater potency and safety, thereby improving this important cancer therapy and expanding its potential applications.”
About BA3071
BA3071 is a novel, investigational conditionally active CTLA-4 inhibitor. The first investigational new drug (IND) filing is currently planned for mid-2019. Subject to regulatory clearance of the IND, a Phase 1/2 multi-center, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and antitumor activity of BA3071 alone and in combination with BeiGene’s tislelizumab, an investigational anti-PD-1 inhibitor, is anticipated to start in the second half of 2019.
The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells. The CTLA-4 pathway is a key immune checkpoint pathway that provides a downregulating signal to T cells. The blockade of CTLA-4 is intended to induce an antitumor immune response by promoting the activation and proliferation of tumor-specific T cells. Although inhibition of CTLA-4 has been shown to significantly improve antitumor response, it may also lead to immune attack of healthy cells. To minimize on-target off-tumor toxicity, BioAtla has applied its proprietary CAB technology with the intent to activate binding to the CTLA-4 receptor only on T cells in the tumor microenvironment.
Inhibition of immune checkpoints using anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies has revolutionized the management of patients with advanced-stage melanoma and are among the most promising components of treatment approaches for many other cancers. Employing BioAtla’s proprietary CAB technology, BA3071 is designed to improve the efficacy and safety of anti-CTLA-4 therapy, as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, by restricting its activation and that of tumor specific T cells to the tumor microenvironment.
About Conditionally Active Biologics (CABs)
Conditionally Active Biologics are proteins generated using BioAtla’s proprietary protein discovery, evolution and expression technologies. These proteins can be monoclonal antibodies, enzymes and other proteins designed with functions dependent on changes in micro physiological conditions (e.g., pH level, oxidation, temperature, pressure, presence of certain ions, hydrophobicity and combinations thereof) both outside and inside cells.
Studies have shown that cancerous tumors create highly specific conditions at their site that are not present in normal tissue. These cancerous microenvironments are primarily a result of the well understood unique glycolytic metabolism associated with cancer cells, referred to as the Warburg Effect in aerobic cancer cells. CAB proteins are designed to deliver their therapeutic payload and/or recruit the immune response in specific and selected locations and conditions within the body and to be active only in the presence of a particular cellular microenvironment. In addition, the activation is designed to be reversible to repeatedly switch ‘on and off’ should the CAB move from a diseased to a normal cellular microenvironment and vice versa. CABs can be developed in a variety of formats, including antibodies, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecifics, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts) and combination therapies.
About Tislelizumab
Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is an investigational humanized IgG4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to FcγR on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug candidate produced from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologic program, and is being developed as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.
Clinical trials of tislelizumab include a global Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); a global Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); a global Phase 3 clinical trial in second-line patients with esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC); a global Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with gastric cancer (GC); a global Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with ESCC; a global Phase 3 trial in patients with Stage III NSCLC; a global Phase 2 clinical trial in second- or third-line patients with HCC; a global Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) NK/T-cell lymphomas; and a global Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors. In China, BeiGene has completed a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with R/R classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), and is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with non-squamous NSCLC; a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with squamous NSCLC; a Phase 2 clinical trial in second-line urothelial cancers (UC); and a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors.
The new drug application (NDA) in China for R/R cHL has been accepted by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) and granted priority review.
BeiGene and Celgene Corporation have a global strategic collaboration for the development of tislelizumab in solid tumor cancers outside of Asia (except Japan).

12489,Amgen's Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg) Receives FDA's Approval for Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk for Fracture,FDA Approves EVENITY (romosozumab-aqqg) For The Treatment Of Osteoporosis In Postmenopausal Women At High Risk For Fracture,"The FDA’s approval is based on two P-III FRAME & ARCH studies result assessing Evenity (210mg) vs PBO & alendronate (70mg) in 7,180 & 4,093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis respectively
 The P-III FRAME & ARCH study results: @12mos. and 24mos. significant reduction in vertebral (spine) fracture; @33 mos. reduction in risk of clinical fracture; increment in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck @12mos.
 Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg) is a mAb, inhibits sclerostin resulting in an increment of bone formation and decreases in bone resorption and is collaboratory developed by Amgen and UCB. Evenity also has a boxed warning in its label as it increases the risk for MI, stroke, & cardiovascular death","One in Two Women in the United States Will Suffer a Fracture in Her Lifetime Due to Osteoporosis(1)EVENITY is the First and Only Bone Builder With a Dual Effect That Both Increases Bone Formation and Decreases Bone Loss(2)EVENITY Rapidly Reduces Fracture Risk and Builds New Bone With 12 Months of Therapy(2)

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. and BRUSSELS,Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and UCB (Euronext Brussels: UCB) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EVENITY™ (romosozumab-aqqg) for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. EVENITY is the first and only bone builder with a unique dual effect that both increases bone formation and to a lesser extent reduces bone resorption (or bone loss) to rapidly reduce the risk of fracture. A full course of EVENITY therapy is 12 monthly doses administered by a healthcare provider.2 Since osteoporosis is a chronic disease, continued therapy with an anti-resorptive agent should be considered once EVENITY therapy is completed.

“One in two women will experience a fracture due to osteoporosis in her lifetime.1 These fractures can be devastating, with many leading to hospital stays and life-altering consequences.3 The FDA approval of EVENITY represents an important therapeutic development for patients who need a medicine that can rapidly increase bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of future fractures within 12 months,” said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a significant women’s health issue that far too often gets overlooked. As a leader in bone health with more than 20 years of osteoporosis research experience, Amgenis as committed as ever to combatting this disease to help women at high risk for fracture reduce their risk of a first and subsequent fracture.”
Osteoporosis is a serious, chronic condition with no cure.4,5 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), osteoporosis is a major public health crisis, affecting millions of people worldwide. In the U.S. alone, 10 million Americans suffer from osteoporosis.6 Osteoporosis-related fractures, known as bone breaks, are common, and the disease is responsible for an estimated two million fractures per year.6 After her first fracture, a woman is five times more likely to suffer another fracture within a year.7 In fact, her fracture risk remains elevated over time if left untreated. Fractures for postmenopausal women can be life-altering events which can lead to loss of mobility.4 Each year, osteoporosis-related fractures account for 432,000 hospital admissions and 180,000 nursing home admissions.3 Given the aging population in the U.S., annual direct costs from osteoporosis are expected to reach approximately $25.3 billion by 2025.1
“After spending 30 years caring for women with osteoporosis and in clinical research, I know that women at high risk of fracture need another therapy that reduces fractures quickly,” said Felicia Cosman, M.D., professor of medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, co-editor in chief of the journal Osteoporosis International and principal investigator of the FRAME trial. “EVENITY acts by a novel mechanism of action to reduce the risk of new vertebral fracture within 12 months, and it produces rapid and dramatic improvements in bone mass. These benefits are sustained upon transition to an anti-resorptive medication and address a critical need for patients at high risk of fracture.”
The FDA based its approval of EVENITY on the results of two Phase 3 studies. In the placebo-controlled FRAME study, treatment with EVENITY resulted in a significant reduction of new vertebral (spine) fracture at 12 months compared to placebo. This significant reduction in fracture risk persisted through the second year in women who received EVENITY during the first year and transitioned to denosumab compared to those who transitioned from placebo to denosumab. In addition, EVENITY significantly increased bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck compared to placebo at 12 months. Following the transition from EVENITY to denosumab at month 12, BMD continued to increase through month 24.
In the active-controlled ARCH study, treatment with EVENITY for 12 months followed by 12 months of alendronate significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months. EVENITY followed by alendronate significantly reduced the risk of clinical fracture (defined as a composite of symptomatic vertebral fracture and nonvertebral fracture) after a median follow-up of 33 months. EVENITY significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck at 12 months compared to alendronate. Twelve months of treatment with EVENITY followed by 12 months of treatment with alendronate significantly increased BMD compared with alendronate alone.
EVENITY has a Boxed Warning in its product label which advises that EVENITY may increase the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke and cardiovascular death. EVENITY should not be initiated in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the preceding year. Consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. If a patient experiences a heart attack or stroke during therapy, EVENITY should be discontinued.2
The most common adverse reactions (≥5 percent) reported with EVENITY were arthralgia (joint pain) and headache.
This approval comes with a post-marketing requirement from the FDA to assess the cardiovascular safety of EVENITY in postmenopausal osteoporosis women. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study, potentially followed by a comparative safety study or trial. Amgen is committed to the safety of patients and will continue to monitor all safety data as it emerges.
“Women who experience a fracture due to osteoporosis are at significant risk for another fracture within one to two years;7 however, many of these patients are not diagnosed with osteoporosis as the underlying cause of fracture so they do not receive the proper care, and as a result, may experience new fractures,” said Dr. Pascale Richetta, head of bone and executive vice president, UCB. “We are excited EVENITY is now approved in the U.S. and that physicians will have a new treatment option for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk for fracture.”
“Osteoporosis is a serious disease that is underdiagnosed and often goes untreated. In fact, approximately 80 percent of patients who have had one or more osteoporotic-related fractures are not being identified or treated,”8,9 said Elizabeth Thompson, chief executive officer, National Osteoporosis Foundation. “This approval is great news for patients and physicians because it gives them another much needed treatment option to help reduce the risk of life changing fractures.”
Amgen is committed to supporting the osteoporosis community and to helping appropriate patients with affordable access to EVENITY. The Amgen Assist® support program can help patients and physician offices navigate insurance coverage and identify access resources for patients. Amgen also provides patient assistance for its medicines marketed in the U.S. in a variety of ways, including free medicines through The Amgen Safety Net Foundation for qualifying individuals with no or limited drug coverage.
EVENITY is expected to be available in approximately one week from select wholesalers in the U.S., at which time the price of EVENITY will be publicly available.
About EVENITY™ (romosozumab-aqqg)
EVENITY is a bone-building humanized monoclonal antibody. It is designed to work by inhibiting the activity of sclerostin, which simultaneously results in increased bone formation and to a lesser extent decreased bone resorption. The EVENITY development program includes 19 clinical studies that enrolled more than 14,000 patients. EVENITY has been studied for its potential to reduce the risk of fractures in an extensive global Phase 3 program that included two large fracture trials comparing EVENITY to either placebo or active comparator in nearly 12,000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Amgen and UCB are co-developing EVENITY.
About the Pivotal EVENITY Clinical Trials
FRAME (Fracture study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1) that evaluated 7,180 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The study evaluated the efficacy of EVENITY treatment (210 mg administered monthly), compared with placebo, in reducing the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 12 months. The study also evaluated the efficacy of treating with EVENITY for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months, compared with placebo followed by denosumab, in reducing the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 24 months.
ARCH (Active-controlled fracture study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture) is a randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study (Study 2) of EVENITY in 4,093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and previous fracture history. This event-driven study evaluated 12 months of EVENITY treatment (210 mg administered monthly) followed by at least 12 months of alendronate treatment (70 mg), compared with alendronate treatment alone, to assess its efficacy in reducing the risk of clinical fracture (non-vertebral fracture and symptomatic vertebral fracture) through the primary analysis period and the incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months.
About Osteoporosis-related Fractures
Worldwide, one in three women and one in five men, over the age of 50, will suffer a fracture due to osteoporosis.8 Similarly, in the U.S. one in two women will fracture in her lifetime due to osteoporosis.1 With an aging population these numbers will rise, yet despite this, there is a large gap in the management and treatment of osteoporosis, especially in the post-fracture setting, with an estimated four out of five patients remaining undiagnosed and untreated after a fracture.8 Without proper care or access to effective intervention options, they remain at risk of painful and disabling fractures in the future.
Important U.S. Product Information
EVENITY™ is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
The anabolic effect of EVENITY wanes after 12 monthly doses of therapy. Therefore, the duration of EVENITY use should be limited to 12 monthly doses. If osteoporosis therapy remains warranted, continued therapy with an anti-resorptive agent should be considered.
Important U.S. Safety Information
POTENTIAL RISK OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE AND CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH
EVENITY™ may increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. EVENITY™ should not be initiated in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the preceding year. Consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Monitor for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction and stroke and instruct patients to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy, EVENITY™ should be discontinued.
In a randomized controlled trial in postmenopausal women, there was a higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, in patients treated with EVENITY™ compared to those treated with alendronate.
Contraindications: EVENITY™ is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with EVENITY™. EVENITY™ is contraindicated in patients with a history of systemic hypersensitivity to romosozumab or to any component of the product formulation. Reactions have included angioedema, erythema multiforme and urticaria.
Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, dermatitis, rash and urticaria have occurred in EVENITY™-treated patients. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue further use of EVENITY™.
Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia has occurred in patients receiving EVENITY™. Correct hypocalcemia prior to initiating EVENITY™. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia, particularly in patients with severe renal impairment or receiving dialysis. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D while on EVENITY™.
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ): ONJ, which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving EVENITY™. A routine oral exam should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of EVENITY™. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ (chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, denosumab, angiogenesis inhibitors, and corticosteroids) may increase the risk of developing ONJ. Other risk factors for ONJ include cancer, radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia and coagulopathy.
For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment should guide the management plan of each patient. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of EVENITY™ should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment.
Atypical Femoral Fractures: Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving EVENITY™. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated.
During EVENITY™ treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Interruption of EVENITY™ therapy should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment.
Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) reported with EVENITY™ were arthralgia and headache.
EVENITY™ is a humanized monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.
Please see accompanying EVENITY™ full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide.

The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.
Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’sresearch, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. While Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key manufacturing facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’s efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies Amgen has acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen’s systems and Amgen’s data. Amgen’s stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

12506,ï»¿AstraZeneca and Merck's Lynparza (olaparib) Receive EU's Approval as a Monotherapy to Treat Germline BRCA-Mutated HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer,Lynparza approved in EU for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated HER2-negative advanced breast cancer,"The approval is based on P-III OlympiAD trial assessing Lynparza (300mg, bid) vs CT (capecitabine, eribulin or vinorelbine) in 302 patients with germline BRCA1- and/or BRCA2-mutated, HER2-negative (HR-positive or triple negative) breast cancer 
 The P-III study results: 42% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death; PFS (7.0mos. vs 4.2mos.); ORR (52% vs 23%)
 Lynparza (olaparib) is a PARP inhibitor targeted to block DNA damage response in cells/tumors harboring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR). In Jul,2017 AZ and Merck globally collaborated to co-develop and co-commercialize Lynparza","AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza reduced the risk of disease
progression or death by 42% vs. chemotherapy in Phase III OlympiAD trial
First PARP inhibitor approved in the EU for patients with this
difficult-to-treat disease and third EU approval for Lynparza
 

AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced the European Commission has approved Lynparza (olaparib) as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutations (gBRCAm), and who have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
Under the licensed indication, patients should have previously been treated with an anthracycline and a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting unless they were unsuitable for these treatments. Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should also have progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy.
Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology, said: “With this approval, Lynparza provides patients throughout the EU with a targeted and oral chemotherapy-free treatment option for a difficult-to-treat cancer. It also reinforces the importance of testing for biomarkers including BRCA, hormone receptor and HER2 expression, helping physicians to make the most informed treatment decisions for patients.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “In the OlympiAD trial, which supported this approval, Lynparzademonstrated a meaningful improvement in progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy in patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer. We look forward to making this new option available across the EU, where we hope it will improve outcomes for many patients.”
The approval was based on data from the randomised, open-label, Phase III OlympiAD trial which tested Lynparza vs. physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine). In the trial, Lynparza provided patients with a statistically-significant median progression-free survival improvement of 2.8 months (7.0 months for Lynparza vs. 4.2 months for chemotherapy). Patients taking Lynparza experienced an objective response rate (ORR) of 52%, which was double the ORR for those in the chemotherapy arm (23%).
This is the third indication for Lynparza in the EU, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to deliver Lynparza as quickly as possible to more patients across multiple settings. Lynparza has a broad clinical development programme, including the ongoing Phase III OlympiA which is testing Lynparza as an adjuvant treatment in patients with gBRCAm HER2-negative breast cancer.
About OlympiAD
OlympiAD was a global, randomised, open-label, multi-centre Phase III trial of 302 patients, assessing the efficacy and safety of Lynparza tablets (300mg twice daily) compared to the physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin or vinorelbine); 205 patients were randomised to receive Lynparza and 97 patients were randomised to receive chemotherapy. Patients in the OlympiAD trial had germline BRCA1– and/or BRCA2-mutated, HER2-negative (HR-positive or triple negative) breast cancer and received Lynparza for treatment in the metastatic setting.
Prior to enrolment, all patients were treated with an anthracycline (unless it was contraindicated) and a taxane chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. Patients with metastatic breast cancer (71% of patients) had received no more than two previous chemotherapy treatments for metastatic disease. Patients with HR-positive breast cancer had received at least one endocrine (hormonal) therapy (in the adjuvant or metastatic setting) and had disease progression during therapy, unless they had disease for which endocrine therapy was considered inappropriate. Previous treatment with platinum chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting was allowed (28% of patients).
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in the OlympiAD trial of patients who received Lynparzawere nausea (58%), anaemia (40%), fatigue (including asthenia) (37%), vomiting (30%), neutropenia (27%), respiratory tract infection (27%), leukopenia (25%), diarrhoea (21%) and headache (20%). The percentage of patients who discontinued treatment in the Lynparza arm was 5% vs. 8% in the chemotherapy arm.
About advanced breast cancer
Advanced/metastatic breast cancer refers to Stage III and IV breast cancer. Stage III disease may also be referred to as locally-advanced breast cancer, while metastatic disease is the most-advanced stage of breast cancer (Stage IV) and occurs when cancer cells have spread beyond the initial tumour site to other organs of the body outside the breast. Since there is no cure for the disease, the goal of current treatment is to delay disease worsening or death.
In 2018, there were an estimated 2.1 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide – one in four cancer cases among women (24.2%). In Europe the estimated 5-year prevalence of breast cancer in 2018 was 2,054,887 cases.1 Approximately 30% of women who are diagnosed with early breast cancer will go on to develop advanced disease.
About BRCA
Breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.
About Lynparza
Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.
Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, is approved for multiple indications in advanced ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer and has been used in over 20,000 patients worldwide. On 26 February 2019, AstraZeneca and MSD announced that Lynparza became the first PARP inhibitor to demonstrate benefit in gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer in the Phase III POLO trial.
Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
About the AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as a monotherapy. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

12513,ï»¿Â­Alkermes' Reports Results of Aristada (aripiprazole lauroxil) and Invega Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) in P-IIIb ALPINE Study to Treat Schizophrenia,Alkermes Announces Positive Topline Results From Innovative Study of ARISTADA and INVEGA SUSTENNA for the Treatment of Schizophrenia,"The P-IIIb ALPINE Study involves assessing of Aristada and Invega Sustenna in 200 patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, followed by an outpatient phase for a total of six months
 P-III study results: @4wks. reductions in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores (-17.4 points, -20.1 points); @9 & 25 wks. PANSS total scores continued to improve (-19.8 points, -22.5 points & -23.3 points, -21.7 points)
 Aristada is an injectable antipsychotic available as four doses (441 mg, 662 mg or 882 mg monthly, 882 mg q6w and 1064 mg once every two months) developed for Schizophrenia approved in the US","— Large, randomized ALPINE trial showed both long-acting injectable medications effectively controlled schizophrenia symptoms throughout six-month study —— ARISTADA demonstrated significant and similar efficacy to current market-leader INVEGA SUSTENNA, with differences in safety and tolerability parameters —— Data provide clinical evidence of efficacy, safety and tolerability of ARISTADA INITIO® and once-every-two-month ARISTADA dosing regimen, with favorable overall retention rate in study —

DUBLIN, (Nasdaq: ALKS) today announced positive topline results from ALPINE (Aripiprazole Lauroxil and Paliperidone palmitate: INitiation Effectiveness), a first-of-its-kind, six-month study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ARISTADA® (aripiprazole lauroxil) and INVEGA SUSTENNA® (paliperidone palmitate) when used to initiate patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia in the hospital and maintain treatment in an outpatient setting. Patients randomized to the ARISTADA treatment group were initiated using the ARISTADA INITIO® regimen* followed by ARISTADA (1064 mg) every two months. Patients randomized to the INVEGA SUSTENNA treatment group were initiated using a loading dose of INVEGA SUSTENNA (234 mg) followed by INVEGA SUSTENNA (156 mg) every month.
“The ALPINE study showed that both ARISTADA, given every two months, and INVEGA SUSTENNA, given every month, demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline in schizophrenia symptoms, and that the efficacy was similar for both medicines throughout the six-month study. This research provides evidence that these two long-acting medicines, each with their own distinct safety and tolerability profile, may be clinically useful in helping to bridge the critical transition between inpatient and outpatient settings of care,” said Craig Hopkinson, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Alkermes. “These data underscore that ARISTADA INITIO along with the two-month dose of ARISTADA together represent a novel approach to treatment initiation and a compelling clinical option for patients and healthcare professionals alike. The ALPINE study illustrates Alkermes’ commitment to expanding the body of evidence for schizophrenia treatment and developing important medicines that help meet critical unmet needs in patient care.”
The ALPINE study met its pre-specified primary endpoint, demonstrating that both ARISTADA and INVEGA SUSTENNA had statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores from baseline at Week 4 (ARISTADA group: -17.4 points, p<0.001; INVEGA SUSTENNA group: -20.1 points, p<0.001). Additionally, PANSS total scores continued to improve at Week 9 and Week 25, the study’s pre-specified secondary endpoints (ARISTADA group: -19.8 points, p<0.001 at Week 9 and -23.3 points, p<0.001 at Week 25; INVEGA SUSTENNA group: -22.5 points, p<0.001 at Week 9 and -21.7 points, p<0.001 at Week 25). Improvements in PANSS total scores from baseline were similar and not statistically different between treatment groups at any assessment time point during the study.
The most common adverse events reported in the ARISTADA treatment group were injection site pain (17.2%), increase in weight (9.1%) and akathisia (9.1%). The most common adverse events reported in the INVEGA SUSTENNA treatment group were injection site pain (24.8%), increase in weight (16.8%) and akathisia (10.9%). Overall, 56.6% of patients in the ARISTADA treatment group and 42.6% of patients in the INVEGA SUSTENNA treatment group completed the six-month study.
“People living with schizophrenia face a complex treatment system and countless challenges that can disrupt continuity of care and make them vulnerable to relapse and re-hospitalization,” said Dr. Jelena Kunovac, founder and president, Altea Research, and ALPINE study investigator. “The results from ALPINE validate the role that long-acting atypical antipsychotics can play in rapidly and effectively stabilizing patients in the hospital and supporting their continuity of care after discharge. The ability to start and stay on effective medication is essential to helping patients and caregivers achieve long-term treatment goals.”
Alkermes expects to submit results from the ALPINE study to peer-reviewed journals for publication and present full study results, including efficacy, safety, tolerability and exploratory analyses, at upcoming scientific meetings.
ALPINE Study Design
ALPINE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase 3b study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ARISTADA and INVEGA SUSTENNA in 200 subjects experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. The study included a two-week inpatient phase, during which all subjects were initiated onto either ARISTADA or INVEGA SUSTENNA, followed by an outpatient phase for a total of six months. Patients randomized to the ARISTADA treatment group were initiated using the ARISTADA INITIO regimen—comprised of ARISTADA INITIO (675 mg) in combination with a single 30 mg oral dose of aripiprazole—on day 1, followed by ARISTADA (1064 mg) on day 8 and every two months thereafter. Patients randomized to the INVEGA SUSTENNA treatment group received an initiation dose of INVEGA SUSTENNA (234 mg) on day 1, followed by INVEGA SUSTENNA (156 mg) on day 8 and every month thereafter.
The study’s pre-specified primary endpoint was the change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores at Week 4 within each treatment group. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included the change from baseline in PANSS total scores at Week 9 and Week 25 within each treatment group, as well as between treatment group comparisons at Week 4, Week 9 and Week 25. PANSS is a standard psychiatric scale used for measuring symptom severity in schizophrenia.
About Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a complex and often difficult-to-treat disease that affects more than 2.4 million people in the U.S.,1 contributes to more than 800,000 hospital admissions each year2 and results in an estimated $32-65 billion in treatment and other economic costs annually.3 One study of adults hospitalized with schizophrenia found that approximately 40 percent did not receive any outpatient follow-up care within 30 days of discharge 4 and another found that among patients who are hospitalized and discharged, more than 15 percent are readmitted within 30 days.5 Long-acting therapies for schizophrenia may help eliminate the burden of taking a daily oral antipsychotic and support medication adherence,6 which is a key factor in risk of relapse.7 However, despite research demonstrating the benefits of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs), including potential improvements in symptoms,6 only 11 percent of patients with schizophrenia in the U.S. are treated with LAIs.8
About ARISTADA INITIO®
ARISTADA INITIO, in combination with a single 30 mg dose of oral aripiprazole, is indicated for the initiation of ARISTADA when used for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and can be used to initiate patients onto any dose of ARISTADA. The first ARISTADA dose may be administered on the same day as the ARISTADA INITIO regimen or up to 10 days thereafter.
About ARISTADA®
ARISTADA is an injectable atypical antipsychotic approved in the U.S. in four doses and three dosing durations for the treatment of schizophrenia (441 mg, 662 mg or 882 mg monthly, 882 mg once every six weeks and 1064 mg once every two months). Once in the body, ARISTADA converts to aripiprazole.
INDICATION and IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION for ARISTADA INITIO® (aripiprazole lauroxil) and ARISTADA® (aripiprazole lauroxil) extended-release injectable suspension, for intramuscular use
INDICATION
ARISTADA INITIO, in combination with oral aripiprazole, is indicated for the initiation of ARISTADA when used for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.
ARISTADA is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED
PSYCHOSIS
Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. ARISTADA INITIO and ARISTADA are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. 
Contraindication: Known hypersensitivity reaction to aripiprazole. Reactions have ranged from pruritus/urticaria to anaphylaxis.
Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke: Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, have been reported in placebo-controlled trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine. ARISTADA INITIO and ARISTADA are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.
Potential for Dosing and Medication Errors: Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between ARISTADA INITIO and ARISTADA could occur. ARISTADA INITIO is intended for single administration in contrast to ARISTADA which is administered monthly, every 6 weeks, or every 8 weeks. Do not substitute ARISTADA INITIO for ARISTADA because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): A potentially fatal symptom complex may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including ARISTADA INITIO and ARISTADA. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available.
Tardive Dyskinesia (TD): The risk of developing TD (a syndrome of abnormal, involuntary movements) and the potential for it to become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic increase. The syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribing antipsychotics should be consistent with the need to minimize TD. Discontinue ARISTADA if clinically appropriate. TD may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn.
Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include:

Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus: Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with oral aripiprazole. Patients with diabetes should be regularly monitored for worsening of glucose control; those with risk factors for diabetes should undergo baseline and periodic fasting blood glucose testing. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia, including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should also undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients require continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.
Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.
Weight Gain: Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.
Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors: Compulsive or uncontrollable urges to gamble have been reported with use of aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges less frequently reported include sexual urges, shopping, binge eating and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors which may result in harm for the patient and others if not recognized. Closely monitor patients and consider dose reduction or stopping aripiprazole if a patient develops such urges.
Orthostatic Hypotension: Aripiprazole may cause orthostatic hypotension which can be associated with dizziness, lightheadedness, and tachycardia. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure, and warn patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and risk of dehydration and syncope.
Falls: Antipsychotics including ARISTADA INITIO and ARISTADA may cause somnolence, postural hypotension or motor and sensory instability which may lead to falls and subsequent injury. Upon initiating treatment and recurrently, complete fall risk assessments as appropriate.
Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis: Leukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotics. Monitor complete blood count in patients with pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count or history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Discontinue ARISTADA INITIO and/or ARISTADA at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC and in severely neutropenic patients.
Seizures: Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.
Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: ARISTADA INITIO and ARISTADA may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are certain therapy with ARISTADA INITIO and/or ARISTADA does not affect them adversely.
Body Temperature Regulation: Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Advise patients regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration. Appropriate care is advised for patients who may exercise strenuously, may be exposed to extreme heat, receive concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or are subject to dehydration.
Dysphagia: Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use; use caution in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Concomitant Medication: ARISTADA INITIO is only available at a single strength as a single-dose pre-filled syringe, so dosage adjustments are not possible. Avoid use in patients who are known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers or taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, or strong CYP3A4 inducers, antihypertensive drugs or benzodiazepines.
Depending on the ARISTADA dose, adjustments may be recommended if patients are 1) known as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and/or 2) taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, or strong CYP3A4 inducers for greater than 2 weeks. Avoid use of ARISTADA 662mg, 882mg, or 1064 mg for patients taking both strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors. (See Table 4 in the ARISTADA full Prescribing Information)
Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions: In pharmacokinetic studies the safety profile of ARISTADA INITIO was generally consistent with that observed for ARISTADA. The most common adverse reaction (≥5% incidence and at least twice the rate of placebo reported by patients treated with ARISTADA 441mg and 882 mg monthly) was akathisia.
Injection-Site Reactions: In pharmacokinetic studies evaluating ARISTADA INITIO, the incidences of injection site reactions with ARISTADA INITIO were similar to the incidence observed with ARISTADA. Injection-site reactions were reported by 4%, 5%, and 2% of patients treated with 441 mg ARISTADA (monthly), 882 mg ARISTADA (monthly), and placebo, respectively. Most of these were injection-site pain and associated with the first injection and decreased with each subsequent injection. Other injection-site reactions (induration, swelling, and redness) occurred at less than 1%.
Dystonia: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first days of treatment and at low doses.
Pregnancy/Nursing: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure. Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Inform patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ARISTADA INITIO and/or ARISTADA during pregnancy. Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. The benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ARISTADA INITIO and/or ARISTADA and any potential adverse effects on the infant from ARISTADA INITIO and/or ARISTADA or from the underlying maternal condition.

Please see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning for ARISTADA INITIO and ARISTADA.

PALO ALTO, Calif., April 10, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Cognoa, a company at the forefront of digital behavioral health for children, today announces it has exclusively licensed technology from the Stanford University School of Medicine to accelerate development and worldwide commercialization of a novel digital therapeutic for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Underscoring the need for earlier access to personalized therapies, Cognoa has already received Breakthrough Device designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its first digital therapeutic device using the technology.

Cognoa’s ASD digital therapeutic uses the licensed technology to target the core deficit of social-emotional reciprocity in autism. Social-emotional reciprocity is the ability to recognize, interpret and respond to social cues such as facial expressions and emotional states. Study results from a randomized clinical trial, recently published by peer-reviewed medical journal, JAMA Pediatrics, showed children who used the technology on Google Glass tested better for socialization, play and coping skills than those who only received standard of care behavioral therapy for ASD. Cognoa is actively working to further develop and productize the technology for increased accessibility on more broadly available digital platforms.
“Digital therapeutics can extend a therapist’s reach into the home, complementing in-person therapies for improved life-long outcomes,” said Brent Vaughan, CEO and co-founder of Cognoa, Inc. “We know that many families are facing obstacles to get their children the help they need. This technology accelerates our goal to empower parents with access to evidence-based solutions so they can more directly impact the progress of their children.”
Today, most children in the U.S. who receive an autism diagnosis, and subsequent treatments, do so after the age when interventions have the greatest opportunity to impact the life of the child. Cognoa will integrate the licensed technology into its precision health platform for the earlier diagnosis and treatment of pediatric behavioral health conditions. By uniquely combining artificial intelligence machine learning diagnostics and therapeutics within the same platform, Cognoa is working to create a new standard in behavioral healthcare so that children receive an earlier diagnosis and more effective therapies for the greatest potential impact on their lives.
About Cognoa, Inc.
Cognoa is developing AI-based digital diagnostics and personalized therapies that are designed to make earlier diagnoses and effective treatments available to more children to improve outcomes and lower behavioral healthcare costs. When more physicians are empowered to identify behavioral conditions and developmental delays earlier, more children can benefit from treatments at a younger age when there is the greatest potential for improved lifelong outcomes. Cognoa currently provides the Cognoa Child Development app via partnerships with employers, payers and ABA therapy centers to empower parents and caregivers to better support their children’s unique behavioral health and growth. Cognoa intends to seek FDA review and clearance that will allow the company to support its diagnostic and therapeutic claims with robust clinical data.

RALEIGH, N.C.- BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (NASDAQ: BDSI), a rapidly growing commercial-stage specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to patients living with chronic pain, today announced that it has entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Shionogi, Inc., to commercialize Symproic® (naldemedine) tablets 0.2 mg in the United States and Puerto Rico effective immediately. Symproic is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults with chronic non-cancer pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent (e.g., weekly) opioid dosage escalation. Symproic is a comprehensively studied OIC product with seven global Phase III clinical trials and received the highest category of endorsement from the American Gastroenterological Association in patients with laxative-refractory OIC.

It is estimated that approximately 40% – 60% of adults with chronic non-cancer pain on non-buprenorphine based opioid therapy will experience OIC, making it one of the most commonly reported side effects in this patient population and can significantly interfere with the appropriate management of chronic pain. Symproic has the potential to become a leading therapy option for OIC given its proven clinical profile and differentiation.

“We are very excited to add Symproic to our commercial portfolio of highly differentiated products for patients suffering from chronic pain and its associated conditions,” stated Herm Cukier, CEO of BDSI. “The product fits very synergistically both strategically and operationally with BELBUCA® (buprenorphine buccal film) CIII, enabling us to leverage our existing commercial organization and capabilities. We are confident Symproic has the potential to become a leading treatment option for OIC and expect to see an accretive contribution to cash flow in the first half of 2020.”

Under the terms of the agreement, BDSI will pay Shionogi, Inc., an initial payment of $20 million and an additional $10 million in six months. In addition, Shionogi is eligible to receive tiered royalty payments based on Net Sales of Symproic.

With the addition of Symproic, the company expects the long-term net sales potential of its product portfolio to be in the range of $325 – $400 million. Additionally, the company has reaffirmed its expectation to become operating cash flow positive by the end of 2019.

ABOUT SYMPROIC

Symproic® (naldemedine) tablets 0.2 mg is indicated for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent (e.g., weekly) opioid dosage escalation. Symproic® was made available to patients in the U.S. in October 2017.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT SYMPROIC®

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and patients at increased risk of recurrent obstruction, due to the potential for GI perforation.

Patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to Symproic. Reactions have included bronchospasm and rash.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Cases of GI perforation have been reported with use of another peripherally acting opioid antagonist in patients with conditions that may be associated with localized or diffuse reduction of structural integrity in the wall of the GI tract. Monitor for the development of severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue if this symptom develops.

Symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including hyperhidrosis, chills, increased lacrimation, hot flush/flushing, pyrexia, sneezing, feeling cold, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting have occurred in patients treated with Symproic.

Patients having disruptions to the blood-brain barrier may be at increased risk for opioid withdrawal or reduced analgesia. Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using Symproic in such patients. Monitor for symptoms of opioid withdrawal in such patients.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Avoid use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) because they may reduce the efficacy of Symproic.

Use with moderate (e.g., fluconazole) and strong (e.g., itraconazole) CYP3A inhibitors and P-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) may increase Symproic concentrations. Monitor for potential adverse reactions.

Avoid use of Symproic with another opioid antagonist due to potential for additive effect and increased risk of opioid withdrawal.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Symproic crosses the placenta and may precipitate opioid withdrawal in a fetus due to the immature fetal blood-brain barrier. Symproic should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including opioid withdrawal in breastfed infants, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment of Symproic is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions with Symproic as compared to placebo in clinical trials were: abdominal pain (8% vs 2%), diarrhea (7% vs 2%), nausea (4% vs 2%), and gastroenteritis (2% vs 1%).

In pooled Studies 1 and 2, the incidence of adverse reactions of opioid withdrawal was 1% (8/542) for Symproic and 1% (3/546) for placebo. In Study 3 (52-week data), the incidence was 3% (20/621) for Symproic and 1% (9/619) for placebo.

To report suspected Adverse Reactions, contact Shionogi at 1-800-849-9707 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT BELBUCA®
BELBUCA® (buprenorphine buccal film), CIII is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Limitations of Use
Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with long-acting opioid formulations, reserve BELBUCA® for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.
BELBUCA® is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.

WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS); LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL EXPOSURE; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS
Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse
BELBUCA® exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient’s risk prior to prescribing BELBUCA®, and monitor patients regularly for these behaviors and conditions.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)
To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the FDA has required a REMS for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to
complete a REMS-compliant education program,
counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products,
emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and
consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety.
Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of BELBUCA®. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of BELBUCA® or following a dose increase.
Accidental Exposure
Accidental exposure to even one dose of BELBUCA®, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of buprenorphine.
Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome
Prolonged use of BELBUCA® during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.
Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

BELBUCA® is contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory depression; acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment; known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus; and hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to buprenorphine.

BELBUCA® contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance. As an opioid, BELBUCA® exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed BELBUCA® and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.

Potential serious adverse events caused by opioids include addiction, abuse, and misuse; life-threatening respiratory depression; neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome; risks due to interactions with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system depressants; risk of life-threatening respiratory depression in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients; adrenal insufficiency; QTc prolongation; severe hypotension; risks of use in patients with increased intracranial pressure, brain tumors, head injury, or impaired consciousness; hepatotoxicity; risk of overdose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; anaphylactic/allergic reactions; risk of use in patients with gastrointestinal conditions; increased risk of seizures in patients with seizure disorders; risks of use in cancer patients with oral mucositis; risks of driving and operating machinery.

The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported by patients treated with BELBUCA® in the clinical trials were nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, somnolence, diarrhea, dry mouth, and upper respiratory tract infection.

 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) 100mg is an anti-PD-1 therapy involves blocking of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands i.e PD-L1 & PD- L2 and is evaluated in 900 trial globally in oncology","KEYTRUDA Now Approved for First-Line Treatment of Patients with Stage III NSCLC Who Are Not Candidates for Surgical Resection or Definitive Chemoradiation, or Metastatic NSCLC, and Whose Tumors Express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%), with No EGFR or ALK Genomic Tumor Aberration

KENILWORTH, N.J.–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded label for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic NSCLC, and whose tumors express PD-L1 (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-042 trial, in which overall survival (OS) was sequentially tested as part of a pre-specified analysis plan. In the trial, KEYTRUDA monotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS compared with chemotherapy alone in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a TPS ≥50%, with a TPS ≥20%, and then in the entire study population (TPS ≥1%).
“This expanded first-line indication now makes KEYTRUDA monotherapy an option for more patients with non-small cell lung cancer, including those for whom combination therapy may not be appropriate,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories.
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.
“The KEYNOTE-042 trial demonstrated a survival benefit with KEYTRUDA monotherapy across histologies in certain patients with stage III or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% of tumor cells,” said Dr. Gilberto Lopes, associate director for global oncology at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami. “As a practicing oncologist, having additional options available for patients is important in the rapidly evolving treatment landscape for lung cancer, which remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States.”
KEYTRUDA was the first anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic NSCLC approved in the first-line setting as combination therapy or monotherapy.
About KEYNOTE-042
The approval was based on data from the KEYNOTE-042 trial, a randomized, multi-center, open-label, active-controlled trial in patients with stage III NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic NSCLC, and whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) and who had not received prior systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations; autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of radiation in the thoracic region within 26 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment were ineligible.
The study enrolled 1,274 patients who were randomized (1:1) to receive KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks (n=637) or investigator’s choice of either of the following chemotherapy regimens (n=637):
Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every three weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every three weeks on Day 1 for a maximum of six cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every three weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies; or
Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 every three weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every three weeks on Day 1 for a maximum of six cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every three weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies
Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. The main efficacy outcome measure was OS in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% NSCLC, the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥20% NSCLC, and the overall population with TPS ≥1% NSCLC. Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% NSCLC, the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥20% NSCLC, and the overall population with TPS ≥1% NSCLC as assessed by a blinded independent central radiologists’ (BICR) review according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ.

The results of all efficacy outcome measures in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥20% NSCLC were intermediate between the results of those with PD-L1 TPS ≥1% and those with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%. In a pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis for patients with TPS 1-49% NSCLC, the median OS was 13.4 months (95% CI, 10.7-18.2) for the KEYTRUDA group and 12.1 months (95% CI, 11.0-14.0) in the chemotherapy group, with an HR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.77-1.11).
In KEYNOTE-042, the safety of KEYTRUDA was investigated in patients with PD-L1 expressing, previously untreated stage III NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic NSCLC. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 19% of 636 patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3.0%), death due to unknown cause (1.6%), and pneumonia (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 33% of patients; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) were pneumonitis (3.1%), pneumonia (3.0%), hypothyroidism (2.2%), and increased ALT (2.0%). The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (7%), pneumonitis (3.9%), pulmonary embolism (2.4%), and pleural effusion (2.2%). The most common adverse reaction (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA was fatigue (25%).
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 950 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.
KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing
Melanoma
KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%).
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

The intended clinical trial will be a proof of concept study combining Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide (GLP-1 analogue) and Gilead’s cilofexor (FXR agonist) and firsocostat (ACC inhibitor) for the treatment of patients with NASH. The companies are also exploring the potential to collaborate on preclinical research to advance understanding of the disease.
NASH is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterized by fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver, which can lead to scarring or fibrosis, that impairs liver function. If left untreated, individuals living with NASH may face serious consequences, including end-stage liver disease, liver cancer and the need for liver transplantation, and are at a significantly higher risk of liver-related mortality.
“NASH is a complex disease that often affects people with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Currently, patients living with NASH have limited treatment options. We are excited to work with Novo Nordisk on this important collaboration, which would bring together Novo Nordisk’s broad expertise related to diabetes and metabolism and Gilead’s expertise in both liver disease and combination therapies,” said John McHutchison, AO, MD, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development at Gilead Sciences. “We look forward to working with the Novo Nordisk team to explore opportunities to advance our complementary research capabilities and approaches in NASH to help address this significant unmet need for patients.”
“We are very pleased about the potential to enter into this clinical collaboration with Gilead, which would combine Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide program in NASH with Gilead’s clinical programs to provide novel approaches for the treatment of NASH. By combining the leading molecular science and clinical expertise of our two companies within the rapidly expanding liver and metabolic diseases, we aim to develop innovative, new and effective combination therapies to help people with NASH,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Chief Science Officer and Executive Vice President of Novo Nordisk.
Cilofexor and firsocostat, alone or in combination, are investigational compounds and are not approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authority. Safety and efficacy have not been established for these agents. Semaglutide has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority for the treatment of patients living with NASH.

In 2014, Omron and AliveCor collaborated to develop products for heart health","Global heart health technology leader secures FDA clearance on groundbreaking blood pressure monitor with EKG in a single device for home use
LAKE FOREST, IL, – Omron Healthcare, Inc., the global leader in personal heart health and wellness technology, has secured FDA clearance on its new Complete, the first blood pressure monitor with EKG capability in a single device, and will open pre-orders on April 15th at 12:00 pm EST in the U.S. on OmronHealthcare.com.
Complete is an upper arm blood pressure monitor that allows users to simultaneously monitor EKG and blood pressure readings at home. EKG readings can be measured by touching electrodes conveniently located on the top face and both sides of the monitor for easy access and comfort. EKG is an essential measurement for those with atrial fibrillation, also known as arrythmia or Afib[1], a condition causing irregular heartbeat that can lead to heart health-related complications, including increased risk of stroke and heart failure.
“Millions of Americans are living with Afib and a stroke risk that is five times higher than average, and many others may not know they have this condition since it is difficult to diagnose. Recent studies[2] predict that the number of individuals with Afib could reach epidemic levels as a result of the growing aging Baby Boomer population. Monitoring this condition and the risk it carries is part of our Going for Zero mission. That’s why Omron developed Complete as an accessible, easy-to-use, at-home solution to provide a more complete heart health picture and greater peace of mind,” said Ranndy Kellogg, president & CEO of Omron Healthcare, Inc.
Omron developed Complete in partnership with AliveCor, the market leader in FDA-cleared personal EKG technology. Complete uses the advanced new algorithm designed by AliveCor for improved detection of the possibility of Afib along with trusted medical-grade blood pressure measurement from Omron.
“Irregular heartbeat is unpredictable and can be difficult to detect without regular monitoring. The Omron Complete empowers anyone who suspects they might have arrythmia or has family history of the condition to monitor their status easily at home,” said Kellogg.
Complete is the recent recipient of the iF Design Award 2019, presented by iF International Forum Design GmbH, one of the world’s most prestigious design awards. This award was presented to Complete for its uniqueness, innovation, aesthetic appearance and performance.

− Treatment Effect Includes a 90 Percent Median Decrease in Composite AAR Relative to Placebo, with 50 Percent of Givosiran Patients Attack-Free –

− Ninety-Nine Percent of Patients Enrolled in Open-Label Extension Study –

− Alnylam to Host Conference Call Saturday, April 13th at 8:00 am ET –

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.-, the leading RNAi therapeutics company, announced today positive complete results from the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) in development for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). The clinical data are being presented in an oral presentation at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) International Liver Congress™ being held April 10-14 in Vienna, Austria.
The full ENVISION results demonstrated a 74 percent mean and 90 percent median reduction in the primary endpoint measure of annualized rate of composite attacks in patients on givosiran relative to placebo during the six-month double-blind period. In addition, givosiran achieved statistically significant positive results for five of nine secondary endpoints, with an overall safety and tolerability profile that the Company believes is encouraging, especially in this high unmet need disease. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 89.6 percent of givosiran patients and 80.4 percent of placebo patients; serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 20.8 percent of givosiran patients and 8.7 percent of placebo patients. Ninety-three of 94 patients, or 99 percent, enrolled in the open-label extension (OLE) period of the study. Based on the ENVISION results, the Company plans to complete its rolling submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) and file a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in mid-2019.
“Given the high unmet need in this disease setting, we are very pleased for the patients and families living with acute hepatic porphyria for whom these results signal hope for a potential new therapeutic option,” said Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., President of R&D at Alnylam. “Givosiran substantially reduced the frequency of attacks, providing strong support for a treatment benefit, with a consistent effect across all components of the primary endpoint and all subgroups analyzed. In this disease with high burden and associated comorbidities, we’re encouraged by the overall tolerability profile. We firmly believe givosiran has the potential to be a transformative medicine for patients living with AHP.”
“Currently, there are no approved therapies aimed at preventing the painful, often incapacitating attacks and chronic symptoms associated with AHP,” said Manisha Balwani, M.D., M.S, Associate Professor of the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Department of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and principal investigator of the ENVISION study. “The results from ENVISION are promising and demonstrate a strong treatment effect for givosiran, with reduction of attacks and improvement in patient-reported measures of overall health status and quality of life. Thus, givosiran represents a novel and targeted treatment approach that has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of patients who are struggling with the disabling symptoms of this disease.”
Efficacy Results
Givosiran met the primary efficacy endpoint with a 74 percent mean reduction relative to placebo in the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks, defined as those requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or hemin administration, in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) over six months (p equal to 6.04×10-9). There was a corresponding 90 percent median reduction in composite annualized attack rate (AAR), with a median AAR of 1.0 in givosiran patients compared with a median AAR of 10.7 in placebo patients. Fifty percent of givosiran-treated patients were attack-free during the six-month treatment period as compared to 16.3 percent of placebo-treated patients. The reductions in attack rates were observed across all components of the primary endpoint. The treatment benefit for givosiran compared to placebo was maintained across all pre-specified patient subgroups, including age, race, geography, historical attack rates, prior hemin prophylaxis status, disease severity, and other baseline characteristics.
Givosiran also demonstrated statistically significant differences in five of nine hierarchically tested secondary endpoints relative to placebo. These included mean reductions of:

91 percent in urinary aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in patients with AIP at three months (p equal to 8.74×10-14).
83 percent in urinary ALA in patients with AIP at six months (p equal to 6.24×10-7).
73 percent in urinary levels of porphobilinogen (PBG) in patients with AIP at six months (p equal to 8.80×10-7).
77 percent in the number of annualized days on hemin in patients with AIP (p equal to 2.35×10-5).
73 percent in composite AAR for patients with any AHP (p equal to 1.35×10-8).
The remaining four secondary endpoints did not meet the prespecified criteria for statistical significance in hierarchical testing.
Safety and Tolerability
AEs were reported in 43/48 (89.6 percent) of givosiran patients and 37/46 (80.4 percent) of placebo patients.SAEs were reported in 10/48 (20.8 percent) of givosiran patients and 4/46 (8.7 percent) of placebo patients.SAEs in givosiran patients consisted of two cases of chronic kidney disease (CKD; 4.2 percent), and one case (2.1 percent) each of asthma, device-related infection, gastroenteritis, hypoglycemia, abnormal liver function test, major depression, pain management, and pyrexia.Three SAEs in givosiran patients were reported as related to study drug: pyrexia, abnormal liver function test, and CKD (one case).The two SAEs of CKD noted above were considered serious due to elective hospitalization for diagnostic evaluation.There were no deaths in the study. One patient, described below, in the givosiran arm (2.1 percent) discontinued treatment due to an AE. AEs reported in greater than 10 percent of givosiran patients and seen more frequently compared to placebo were nausea (27.1 versus 10.9 percent), injection site reactions (16.7 versus 0 percent), CKD (10.4 versus 0 percent), and fatigue (10.4 versus 4.3 percent). Four of five of the patients with AEs reported as CKD had a prior history of CKD or a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2; no patients had clinically significant proteinuria and there were no treatment discontinuations due to renal AEs.
Liver transaminase increases greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or baseline were observed in 7/48 (14.6 percent) patients on givosiran and 1/46 (2.2 percent) patients on placebo; all had evidence of iron overload or liver disease at baseline. As previously reported and as noted above, one patient on givosiran discontinued treatment due to an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater than eight times ULN, a protocol-defined stopping rule; this elevation did not meet Hy’s Law and subsequently resolved. In the other six givosiran-treated patients, peak ALT levels ranged from 3.0-5.4 times ULN and were not accompanied by bilirubin increases; the ALT elevations were asymptomatic and all events resolved with continued dosing (N=5) or after a brief pause in dosing (N=1).
Patient Perspectives
In exploratory measures of patient-reported outcomes, a greater proportion of patients reported an improvement in overall health status on givosiran (89 percent) than placebo (37 percent), as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Questionnaire. Similarly, patients on givosiran reported an overall higher level of treatment satisfaction on givosiran (72 percent) than placebo (14 percent) and an increased ability to perform activities of daily living, as measured by the Porphyria Patient Experience Questionnaire (PPEQ). Specifically, a greater proportion of patients on givosiran reported improvements in traveling for work or pleasure (35.1 versus 13.2 percent), participating in social activities (35.1 versus 7.9 percent), planning for future events (35.1 versus 10.5 percent), doing household chores (35.1 versus 5.3 percent), and exercising moderately (32.4 versus 5.3 percent), relative to patients on placebo.

About Acute Hepatic Porphyria
Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) refers to a family of rare, genetic diseases characterized by potentially life-threatening attacks and for some patients chronic debilitating symptoms that negatively impact daily functioning and quality of life. AHP is comprised of four subtypes, each resulting from a genetic defect leading to deficiency in one of the enzymes of the heme biosynthesis pathway in the liver: acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and ALAD-deficiency porphyria (ADP). These defects cause the accumulation of neurotoxic heme intermediates aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), with ALA believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both attacks and ongoing symptoms between attacks. Common symptoms of AHP include severe, diffuse abdominal pain, weakness, nausea, and fatigue. The nonspecific nature of AHP signs and symptoms can often lead to misdiagnoses of other more common conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, appendicitis, fibromyalgia, and endometriosis, and consequently, patients afflicted by AHP often remain without a proper diagnosis for up to 15 years. In addition, long-term complications of AHP and its treatment can include chronic neuropathic pain, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and liver disease, including iron overload, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, there are no treatments approved to prevent debilitating attacks or to treat the chronic manifestations of the disease.
About Givosiran
Givosiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) in development for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). Monthly administration of givosiran has the potential to significantly lower induced liver ALAS1 levels in a sustained manner and thereby decrease neurotoxic heme intermediates, aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), to near normal levels. By reducing accumulation of these intermediates, givosiran has the potential to prevent or reduce the occurrence of severe and life-threatening attacks, control chronic symptoms, and decrease the burden of the disease. Givosiran utilizes Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability and a wide therapeutic index. Givosiran has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and PRIME Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Givosiran has also been granted Orphan Drug Designations in both the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of AHP. The safety and efficacy of givosiran were evaluated in the ENVISION Phase 3 trial with positive results; these results have not been evaluated by the FDA, the EMA or any other health authority.
About RNAi
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.
About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals

About the TAPPAS trial in Advanced or Metastatic Angiosarcoma
The TAPPAS trial was designed to compare treatment with TRC105 and Votrient to treatment with single agent Votrient in up to 340 patients with advanced or metastatic angiosarcoma. Patients were randomized in equal numbers and the primary endpoint was progression free survival by RECIST 1.1. Key secondary endpoints included objective response rate, overall survival, safety and tolerability.
About TRC105 (carotuximab)
TRC105, the oncology formulation of carotuximab, is a novel, clinical stage antibody to endoglin, a protein overexpressed on proliferating endothelial cells that is essential for angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. TRC105 has received orphan designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in both the US and EU. The ophthalmic formulation of TRC105, DE-122, is currently being studied in the randomized Phase 2 AVANTE trial in patients with wet AMD. For more information about the clinical trials, please visit TRACON’s website at www.traconpharma.com/clinical_trials.php.
About DE-122 (carotuximab)
DE-122, a novel ophthalmic formulation of carotuximab, is active in preclinical choroidal neovascularization (CNV) models and expected to enhance the effect of approved VEGF inhibitors used to treat wet AMD. DE-122 is being investigated in the Phase 2 randomized AVANTE trial assessing the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections in combination with Lucentis® (ranibizumab) compared to Lucentis monotherapy in patients with wet AMD.

Santhera to Present Long-term Efficacy Results with Idebenone in DMD
at the 2019 MDA Clinical and Scientific Conference
April 15, 2019 / Page 2 of 3
In February, Santhera announced topline results from the SYROS study which demonstrated that long-term treatment with idebenone consistently reduced the rate of respiratory function loss in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) for up to 6 years in a real-world setting. This long-term data further supports the potential for idebenone to modify the course of respiratory function decline in DMD and thereby delay the time to clinically relevant milestones.
The posters can be viewed here and the findings from the SYROS study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
DMD is one of the most common and devastating types of progressive muscle weakness and degeneration starting at an early age and leading to early morbidity and mortality due to respiratory failure. It is a genetic, degenerative disease that occurs almost exclusively in males with an incidence of up to 1 in 3,500 live male births worldwide. DMD is characterized by a loss of the protein dystrophin, leading to cell damage, impaired calcium homeostasis, elevated oxidative stress and reduced energy production in muscle cells. With age, progressive respiratory muscle weakness affecting thoracic accessory muscles and the diaphragm causes respiratory disease, impaired clearance of airway secretions, recurrent pulmonary infections due to ineffective cough, and eventually respiratory failure. There is currently no treatment approved for slowing loss of respiratory function in patients with DMD.
About Idebenone in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Idebenone is a synthetic short-chain benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) capable of stimulating mitochondrial electron transport, reducing and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and supplementing cellular energy levels.
DELOS was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study which randomized 64 patients, not taking concomitant steroids, to receive either idebenone (900 mg/day) or matching placebo. The study met its primary endpoint, the change from baseline in peak expiratory flow (PEF) expressed as percent of predicted, which demonstrated that idebenone can slow the loss of respiratory function. Supportive data for idebenone were shown in the Phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled DELPHI study and its 2-year open-label extension study (DELPHI-E).
SYROS was a prospectively planned, retrospective collection of long-term respiratory function data from 18 patients who completed the DELOS study and subsequently received idebenone (900 mg/day) under Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). The SYROS study showed that the previously observed beneficial effect of idebenone in reducing the rate of respiratory function decline was maintained for up to six years during treatment.

12662,ï»¿Generium and Selexis Launch Eculizumab Biosimilar for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) in Russia,Generium Launches First Biosimilar of Eculizumab; Becomes Fifth Marketed Product Using Selexis SUREtechnology Platform,"Generium’s biosimilar of Eculizumab is developed using Selexis’ SUREtechnology Platform which is based on Selexis SGE (Selexis Genetic Elements) consist of human DNA based element, controlling the chromatin across mammalian cells
 Eculizumab is a monoclonal IgG2/4 Ab developed as a fifth biosimilar SUREtechnology Platform involved in reduction of the destruction of red blood cells and need for blood transfusion & improves renal function in patients with PNH & aHUS respectively
 Currently 115 clinical programs are utilizing the SUREtechnology Platform including 9 P-III programs useful in addressing complicated and intractable diseases by developing complex protein therapies","Geneva, Switzerland, and Moscow, Russia, Selexis SA and Generium JSC today announced that a fifth Selexis SUREtechnologyPlatform™-generated biological product has been approved for marketing. The latest approved product is a biosimilar monoclonal antibody, eculizumab, indicated for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Generium is the first company in the world to develop and market a biosimilar of eculizumab.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare, life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by destruction of red blood cells by the complement system, a part of the body’s innate immune system. In people with PNH, eculizumab reduces both the destruction of red blood cells and need for blood transfusion. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is an extremely rare, life-threatening and progressive disease that frequently has a genetic component. In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system. The disease is characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. Eculizumab significantly improves renal function in patients with aHUS.

“This biologic’s market approval in Russia represents another major milestone for Selexis,” said Igor Fisch, PhD, CEO, Selexis SA. “There are currently more than 115 clinical programs utilizing the SUREtechnology Platform, including nine Phase 3 programs. The increasing number of Selexis-generated research cell banks used in clinical programs, and now a fifth marketed product, validate our ongoing scientific innovation and our commitment to helping our partners address complicated and intractable diseases by developing complex protein therapeutics faster, safer and more cost efficiently.”

“The joint efforts of Russian, U.S. and Swiss scientists have made it possible to achieve significant progress in the development of high-tech medicines for the treatment of rare diseases such as a PNH and aHUS, with the economic benefits of local production,” said Dmitriy Kudlay, CEO of Generium. “We believe working with Selexis improves the quality of our products and we are proud to take another step forward in helping the clinical community in Russia in their fight against rare diseases.”

Selexis’ SUREtechnology Platform is based on Selexis SGE® (Selexis Genetic Elements) — novel human DNA-based elements that control the dynamic organization of chromatin across mammalian cells. These elements increase transcription rates of transgenes by rendering the expression cassette independent of the locus of integration and thus allowing higher and more stable expression of any recombinant proteins. SUREtechnology improves the way cells are used in the discovery, development and manufacturing of recombinant proteins.

The Selexis SURE CHO-M Cell Line™ is a proprietary high-performance mammalian cell line derived from CHO-K1 cells. The genome of Selexis SURE CHO-M Cell Line has been fully sequenced and is used to characterize the sequence of the transgene, identify transgene integration loci and to document the monoclonality of cell populations. Selexis SURE CHO-M Cell Line is used for the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies.

12670,Novartis Reports FDA's Acceptance of BLA for Brolucizumab (RTH258) to Treat Wet AMD,Novartis announces FDA filing acceptance and Priority Review of brolucizumab (RTH258) for patients with wet AMD,"The BLA submission is based on P-III HAWK and HARRIER study results assessing brolucizumab (3/6 mg, q12w/q8w) vs aflibercept in 1800 patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration nAMD or wet AMD at 400 sites
 P-III HAWK and HARRIER: @48wks. best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline (6.6, 6.9 letters vs 6.8, 7.6 letters); patients with disease activity (23.5%, 21.9% vs 33.5%, 31.4%); key markers used by physicians to help guide management of the disease (31%, 26%)
 Brolucizumab (RTH258) is a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) that inhibits VEGF receptors, with its expected launch in end of 2019. Novartis has utilized its Priority Review Voucher for brolucizumab’s FDA review","Novartis announces FDA filing acceptance and Priority Review of brolucizumab (RTH258) for patients with wet AMD
 By 2020, over 1.5 million people in the US are likely to have wet AMD, the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries
 Filing is based on Phase III data from the HAWK and HARRIER trials for brolucizumab
 Novartis used a priority review voucher to expedite review of brolucizumab in the US and, if approved by FDA, anticipates launching by the end of 2019
Basel, Novartis announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
accepted the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for brolucizumab (RTH258) for
the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), also known as neovascular
AMD, or nAMD. Seeking to make brolucizumab available as quickly as possible, Novartis
used a priority review voucher to expedite FDA review. If approved by the FDA, Novartis
anticipates launching brolucizumab by the end of 2019.
Estimates suggest that by 2020, 1.5 to 1.75 million people in the US will be living with wet
AMD, a leading cause of blindness worldwide and a rapidly growing public health concern1
.
As the disease progresses, patients may experience loss of central vision, resulting in an
inability to complete daily tasks. Without treatment, vision can rapidly deteriorate and may
lead to blindness2
.
“Reaching this milestone is an important step in our efforts to reimagine the treatment journey
for people with wet AMD and their caregivers,” said Fabrice Chouraqui, President, Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corporation. “We are looking forward to the potential of a new option for
patients with wet AMD, who often have to navigate considerable physical and emotional
difficulties caused by deteriorating vision.”
The regulatory application is primarily based on Phase III data from the HAWK and HARRIER
trials — prospective, randomized, double-masked multi-center studies3,4
. The primary
endpoint of these studies was non-inferiority to aflibercept in mean change in best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to week 48 (mean change in BCVA of 6.6 letters for
brolucizumab 6 mg versus 6.8 letters for aflibercept in HAWK and 6.9 letters versus 7.6
letters, respectively, in HARRIER). HAWK and HARRIER are the first and only global head-tohead trials in patients with wet AMD that prospectively demonstrated efficacy at week 48
starting with a 12-week dosing regimen.
Additionally, at week 48 in the studies, key secondary endpoint assessments showed
significantly fewer brolucizumab patients with disease activity (23.5% of brolucizumab 6 mg
patients versus 33.5% of aflibercept patients in HAWK, and 21.9% versus 31.4%,
respectively, in HARRIER (P=0.0022 for both) as well as retinal fluid – key markers used by
physicians to help guide management of the disease in clinical practice (31% fewer patients
Page 2 of 5
on brolucizumab 6 mg had intra-retinal fluid (IRF) and/or sub-retinal fluid (SRF) in HAWK, and
26% fewer in HARRIER, versus aflibercept (P<0.0001 for both)5,6
.
“Wet AMD robs people of their precious sight and takes a major toll on the lives of millions of
people who face not only vision loss, but also the burden of frequent injections into their
eyes,” said Dawn Prall George, executive director, The Support Sight Foundation. “We are
always excited about potential new treatment options and hopeful they may help people
manage this devastating disease.”
About brolucizumab (RTH258)
Brolucizumab (RTH258) is a humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) and the most
clinically advanced, humanized single-chain antibody fragment to reach this stage of
development. Single-chain antibody fragments are highly sought after in drug development
due to their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid clearance from systemic circulation
and drug delivery characteristics7-9
.
The proprietary innovative structure results in a small molecule (26 kDa) with potent inhibition
of, and high affinity to, all VEGF-A isoforms7,10
. In preclinical studies, brolucizumab inhibited
activation of VEGF receptors through prevention of the ligand-receptor interaction7,9,10
.
Increased signaling through the VEGF pathway is associated with pathologic ocular
angiogenesis and retinal edema11
. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit
the growth of neovascular lesions, resolve retinal edema and improve vision in patients with
chorioretinal vascular diseases12
.
About HAWK and HARRIER study design
With more than 1,800 patients across nearly 400 sites worldwide, HAWK (NCT02307682) and
HARRIER (NCT02434328) are the first and only global head-to-head trials in patients with
nAMD that prospectively demonstrated efficacy at week 48 using an innovative q12w/q8w
regimen, with a majority of patients on q12w immediately following the loading phase3-5
. Both
studies are 96-week prospective, randomized, double-masked multi-center studies and part of
the Phase III clinical development of brolucizumab3,4,6
.
The studies were designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of
brolucizumab 6 mg (HAWK and HARRIER) and 3 mg (HAWK only) versus aflibercept 2 mg in
patients with nAMD3,4. In both trials, patients were randomized to either brolucizumab or
aflibercept3,4. Immediately following the 3-month loading phase, patients in the brolucizumab
arms received a q12w dosing interval with an option to adjust to a q8w dosing interval based
on masked disease activity assessments at defined visits3,4. Aflibercept was dosed bi-monthly
according to its label at the time of study initiation3-6
.
Brolucizumab met the primary efficacy objective of non-inferiority versus aflibercept in mean
change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to week 48 with high statistical
significance5
. Additionally, brolucizumab demonstrated superiority in three secondary
endpoints considered key parameters of nAMD: central subfield retinal thickness, retinal fluid
(intraretinal fluid and/or subretinal fluid) and disease activity5
.
At year two, the most frequent ocular adverse events (≥5% of patients in any treatment arm)

About neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD or wet AMD)
nAMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss and legal blindness in people over the age of
65 in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia, impacting an estimated 20 to 25 million
people worldwide2,13. nAMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the
macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. These blood vessels are
fragile and leak fluid, disrupting the normal retinal architecture and ultimately causing damage
to the macula1,14,15
.
Early symptoms of nAMD include distorted vision or metamorphopsia and difficulties seeing
objects clearly16
. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential. As the disease progresses,
cell damage increases, further reducing vision quality. This progression can lead to a
complete loss of central vision, leaving the patient unable to read, drive or recognize familiar
faces14
. Without treatment, vision can rapidly deteriorate2
.

EXTON, Pa., Fibrocell Science, Inc. (Nasdaq: FCSC), a cell and gene therapy company focused on transformational autologous cell-based therapies for skin and connective tissue diseases, today announced the completion of a collaboration agreement with Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize Fibrocell’s lead gene therapy candidate, FCX-007, for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a rare, life-threatening genetic disorder diagnosed at infancy with no cure or treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA).

“We are proud to partner with Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, a company recognized for its innovation in drug development for rare skin diseases and its commitment to the epidermolysis bullosa community. This agreement provides resources and non-dilutive capital to continue the development and, if approved, commercialize FCX-007, a potentially transformative treatment for RDEB patients,” said John Maslowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fibrocell. “With Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals providing funding for the development of FCX-007, Fibrocell can allocate additional resources to advance clinical development of FCX-013 for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma.”

Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals will receive an exclusive license to commercialize FCX-007 in the United States. Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals will be responsible for all development and manufacturing expenses up to $20 million prior to the initial Biologics License Application (BLA) filing with the FDA. If development spending exceeds $20 million, Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals will be responsible for 70% of the excess costs and Fibrocell will cover 30% of these additional expenses. Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals will also be responsible for all commercialization activities for FCX-007. Fibrocell will maintain responsibility for clinical development, regulatory interactions, and manufacturing of the product under a future supply agreement with Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals.
Fibrocell will receive an upfront payment of $7.5 million, $2.5 million for the first patient enrolled in the Phase 3 clinical trial and $30 million upon BLA approval and commercial readiness. Fibrocell is also eligible to receive up to $75 million in sales milestones, consisting of $25 million when FCX-007 achieves $250 million in cumulative net sales and an additional $50 million upon attaining $750 million in cumulative net sales. In addition, Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals will pay Fibrocell a 30% share of the gross profits from FCX-007 sales.

Fibrocell will retain sole ownership of the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which may be granted upon market approval of FCX-007. The PRV can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent New Drug Application or BLA, and can be sold to another entity.

“We believe our collaboration with Fibrocell is synergistic and serves both of our long-term objectives well. It increases the breadth of Castle Creek’s potential epidermolysis bullosa therapies by combining our clinical trial evaluating our investigational topical therapy (CCP-020) for epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) with Fibrocell’s gene therapy to potentially treat RDEB,” said Greg Wujek, Chief Executive Officer of Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals. “Castle Creek values the contributions of the Fibrocell team in progressing development of FCX-007, and we are excited to work with them to continue advancing this novel EB therapy that offers the potential to bring relief to patients suffering from this chronic, painful and debilitating disease.”

FCX-007 is a genetically-modified autologous fibroblast that encodes the gene for type VII collagen (COL7). In a recent Type B meeting, the FDA provided guidance on various design aspects of Fibrocell’s proposed Phase 3 clinical trial, named DEFI-RDEB. The trial is designed as an open label, multi-centered, intra-patient controlled study expected to enroll 15-20 patients. The trial is expected to initiate in the second quarter of 2019.

FCX-007 is being developed in collaboration with Intrexon Corporation (Nasdaq: XON). As part of our existing Exclusive Channel Collaboration (ECC), Fibrocell will pay Intrexon 50% of all upfront, milestone, and profit share payments from Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals. Payments to Intrexon do not include funds received by Fibrocell from Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals in connection with the development and manufacturing costs or payments for supply of FCX‑007. FCX‑007’s development continues subject to the 2012 ECC.

Based on Fibrocell’s receipt of the upfront payment from Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals and reduction of expenses associated with the development of FCX-007, the Company believes its existing cash will be sufficient to fund operations into the third quarter of 2020.

In connection with the successful completion of the agreement with Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, Fibrocell also concluded the strategic alternative review process announced last year. Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc. acted as financial advisor to Fibrocell.

About FCX-007

FCX-007 is Fibrocell’s clinical stage, gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of RDEB, a congenital and progressive orphan skin disease caused by the deficiency of COL7. FCX-007 is a genetically-modified autologous fibroblast that encodes the gene for COL7. By genetically modifying autologous fibroblasts ex vivo to produce COL7, culturing them and then treating wounds locally via injection, FCX-007 offers the potential to address the underlying cause of the disease by providing high levels of COL7 directly to the affected areas while avoiding systemic distribution.

About FCX-013 

FCX-013 is Fibrocell’s clinical stage, gene therapy candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma. FCX-013 is an autologous fibroblast genetically modified using lentivirus and encoded for matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), a protein responsible for breaking down collagen. FCX-013 incorporates Intrexon’s proprietary RheoSwitch Therapeutic System®, a biologic switch activated by Veledimex—an orally administered compound—to control protein expression at the site of the localized scleroderma lesions. FCX‑013 is designed to be injected under the skin at the location of the fibrotic lesions where the genetically-modified fibroblast cells will produce MMP-1 to break down excess collagen accumulation.

About Fibrocell 

Fibrocell is an autologous cell and gene therapy company translating personalized biologics into medical breakthroughs for diseases affecting the skin and connective tissue. Fibrocell’s most advanced product candidate, FCX-007, is the subject of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of RDEB. Fibrocell is also developing FCX-013 for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma and is currently enrolling the Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.

About Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) Syndrome
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is the most common adenomatous polyposis syndrome. It is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by the early onset of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps throughout the colon. FAP has a birth incidence of about 1 out of 8,300 worldwide, manifests equally in both sexes1, and, if left untreated, patients with this syndrome will most likely develop colorectal cancer. In addition, an increased risk exists for the development of other malignancies2. Removing the colon is currently the only way to prevent colorectal cancer from developing in these patients1.

About Lumasiran
Lumasiran (formerly known as ALN-GO1) is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase (GO) in development for the treatment of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1). Lumasiran is designed to reduce hepatic levels of the GO enzyme, thereby depleting the substrate necessary for the production of oxalate – the metabolite that directly contributes to the pathophysiology of PH1. Lumasiran utilizes Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability and a wide therapeutic index. Lumasiran has received both U.S. and EU Orphan Drug Designations, a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The safety and efficacy of lumasiran have not been evaluated by the FDA, EMA or any other health authority.
About Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1)
PH1 is an ultra-orphan disease in which excessive oxalate production results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of painful and recurrent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones. Compromised kidney function exacerbates the disease as the excess oxalate can no longer be effectively excreted, resulting in subsequent accumulation and crystallization in bones, eyes, skin, and heart, leading to severe illness and death. Current treatment options are very limited and include frequent renal dialysis or combined organ transplantation of liver and kidney, a procedure with high morbidity that is limited due to organ availability. Although a small minority of patients respond to Vitamin B6 therapy, there are no approved pharmaceutical therapies for PH1.
About RNAi
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.
About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals

 Tessa’s TT12 is an autologous cell therapy based on HPVSTs targeting HPV 16/18 antigens and genetically modified with a decoy TGF-β receptor. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an anti-PD-1 therapy involves blocking of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands i.e PD-L1 & PD- L2","The collaboration will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tessa’s armored human papillomavirus-specific T cell (HPVST) therapy combined with MSD’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) to address the limited number of effective treatment options for metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer
 
SINGAPORE – Tessa Therapeutics, a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on autologous and off-the-shelf, allogeneic therapies targeting solid tumors, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with MSD (tradename of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA), through a subsidiary, to evaluate Tessa’s armored human papillomavirus-specific T cell (HPVST) therapy, or TT12, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), MSD’s anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, in patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV 16 and 18-positive cervical cancer.
Under the agreement, Tessa will conduct a multi-center Phase 1b/2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination. The trial is planned for initiation in the United States, Singapore and South Korea.
“We are very excited to work with MSD to evaluate the potential of KEYTRUDA® in combination with Tessa’s VST therapy for cervical cancer,” said Mr. Andrew Khoo, Tessa Therapeutics CEO and Co-Founder. “Cervical cancer is a major cause of death in women, especially in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world. Furthermore, the current prognosis and treatment options for patients with metastatic cervical cancer are poor. We look forward to developing this novel combination further, which has the potential to bring more effective treatment options for such patients.”
Tessa’s TT12 is an autologous cell therapy product composed of HPVSTs that have been trained to target HPV 16/18 antigens and genetically modified with a decoy TGF-β receptor to overcome the suppressive tumor microenvironment. The safety and optimal dose selection of armored HPVSTs in combination with another anti-PD-1 antibody is currently being evaluated in a separate, ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial in the United States, in patients with relapsed HPV-associated cancers. Preliminary results from this trial show that armored HPVSTs and its combination with anti-PD-1 are well-tolerated, have minimal toxicities and early signs of efficacy.
Dr. Ivan D. Horak, M.D., Tessa Therapeutics President of Research and Development said, “Tessa’s TT12 Phase 1 study has shown encouraging results, supporting the effectiveness of armoured HPVSTs in targeting HPV-positive tumors and the addition of anti-PD-1 may remove potential immune inhibition that can hamper the tumor-killing activity of the HPVSTs. Bringing this therapy into a Phase 1b/2 trial and the expansion of clinical sites into Asia reflect our desire to bring novel therapies to more cancer patients globally, as well as our belief in the therapy’s potential to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced stages of HPV-positive tumors.”

About Cervical Cancer and Armored HPVST Immunotherapy
According to the World Health Organization, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common in less developed regions. Cervical cancer is caused by sexually acquired infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), with two HPV types (16 and 18) accounting for 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancerous cervical lesions.
Various studies have reported poor outcome of patients with metastatic cervical cancer. Currently, the median survival time for metastatic cervical cancer is only 8 to 13 months1 and the 5-year survival rate is 16.5% compared to 91.5% for localized cervical cancer2. Contrary to patients with early-stage cervical cancer and locally advanced cervical cancer who have access to conventional treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, patients with metastatic cervical cancer have no standard treatment because of its heterogeneous manifestations.
T cells are a critical part of the body’s immune system that play a central role in fighting virus infections and cancers. Virus-Specific T cells (VSTs), in particular, have the ability to recognize and kill infected cells while activating other parts of immune system for a coordinated response.
HPVSTs are produced by collecting patient’s blood and selectively expanding T cells which recognize HPV 16/18 antigens. To increase durability in the tumor microenvironment, the HPVSTs are armored by modifying the cells to express a decoy TGF-β receptor. The armored HPVSTs are expanded before undergoing strict quality control prior to infusion back into the patient.

First-in-human biodistribution data show transduction in intended CNS targets and widespread SMN expression comparable to tissue from unaffected control 
More than 150 patients treated with Zolgensma, only 5% of screened patients up to 5 years old excluded due to AAV9 antibody titers greater than 1:50
Basel, – AveXis, a Novartis company, today announced that interim data from its Phase 3 STR1VE trial of Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi; AVXS-101)[1] in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1 showed prolonged event-free survival, an early and rapid increase in CHOP-INTEND scores and significant milestone achievement compared to untreated natural history, consistent with data from the pivotal Phase 1 START trial. First-in-human biodistribution individual case study data from STR1VE showed Zolgensma successfully transduced intended targets in the central nervous system (CNS) and provided widespread SMN expression comparable to tissue from unaffected individual. Additional data presented showed 95 percent of patients screened across the Zolgensma clinical development program and Managed Access Program were not excluded from treatment due to elevated AAV9 antibody titers greater than 1:50. These data were presented today at the 2019 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Clinical and Scientific Conference in Orlando, Florida.
“These STR1VE data reinforce what was seen in the pivotal Phase 1 START trial, including trends toward prolonged survival and milestone achievement never seen in the natural history of the untreated disease,” said Olga Santiago, MD, Chief Medical Officer, AveXis. “With a patient population and baseline characteristics closely matched to the START trial, these data build upon the body of evidence supporting the use of Zolgensma for SMA Type 1.”
Interim Phase 3 STR1VE Data as of September 27, 2018
STR1VE is an ongoing, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one-time intravenous infusion of Zolgensma in patients with SMA Type 1 who are less than six months of age at the time of gene therapy. The study was designed to enroll the broadest possible population of SMA Type 1 patients with one or two copies of the SMN2 backup gene and who have bi-allelic SMN1 gene deletion or point mutations. These criteria are well-matched to the patient population that was enrolled in the pivotal Phase 1 START trial while potentially providing treatment to some of the rarer subpopulations on an exploratory basis. STR1VE is projected to complete in 2020.
As of September 27, 2018, 21 of 22 (95 percent) patients were alive and event-free.[2] The median age was 9.5 months, with 6 of 7 (86 percent) patients who could have reached 10.5 months of age or older surviving event-free. Untreated natural history indicates that 50 percent of babies with SMA Type 1 will not survive or will require permanent ventilation by the time they reach 10.5 months of age[3].
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) scores increased by an average of 7.0 points one month after gene transfer and 11.8 points three months after gene transfer, reflecting improvement in motor function from baseline. These data are similar to CHOP-INTEND achievement by the proposed therapeutic dose cohort (Cohort 2) in the pivotal START trial, which demonstrated mean increases of 9.8 and 15.4 points at the same time points, respectively. Early CHOP-INTEND increases appear to be associated with eventual milestone achievement.
Preliminary assessments of patients treated with Zolgensma showed the achievement of motor milestones, including three patients who could sit without support for at least 30 seconds as of September 27, 2018 (median of 9.4 months), increasing to eight patients who could achieve the same milestone as of December 31, 2018 (median age of 12.5 months).

Safety observations are comparable to those seen in the pivotal Phase 1 START trial. Adverse events of special interest, including elevated transaminases, platelet count decrease and thrombocytopenia, were transient and did not cause any long-term sequelae. One patient died from respiratory failure, which was deemed by the investigator and independent Data Safety Monitoring Board to be unrelated to treatment. This patient had demonstrated significant motor improvement, with a 27-point increase in CHOP-INTEND from baseline five months post-infusion.
AveXis is grateful to the courageous patients and families who participate in our trials, enabling us to further our efforts to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients with rare genetic diseases.
Biodistribution of Zolgensma
First-in-human analysis of tissues from the deceased patient showed that Zolgensma successfully transduced tissues of the CNS, including brain and spinal cord motor neurons, and showed widespread expression of SMN comparable to tissue from an unaffected individual and clearly distinguishable from untreated SMA patient samples.
Evaluation of Zolgensma transgene DNA, mRNA and SMN protein biodistribution was assessed by ddPCRTM, RT-PCR and immunohistochemical SMN protein staining, respectively. The results of these analyses consistently demonstrated that Zolgensma vector genomes, RNA transcripts and SMN protein were broadly distributed and detected in all organs tested. Zolgensma vector genomes per diploid genome were detected in cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions. Correspondingly, in each of these spinal cord regions, SMN protein was expressed in spinal motor neurons at levels similar to non-SMA Type 1 tissues. SMN protein expression was also detected in cortical and subcortical regions of the motor cortex and medulla. Both Zolgensma and non-SMA Type 1 tissues were clearly distinct from tissues from untreated SMA Type 1 patients.
Analysis of the motor neuron marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) demonstrated that motor neurons were abundant and of normal size and shape in the Zolgensma-treated patient tissue. In contrast, ChAT motor neuron staining in the non-treated SMA Type 1 patient tissue was sparse, suggesting the motor neurons were sick and/or dying.
These human data support the mechanism of action initially identified in non-human non-clinical studies in murine and non-human primate models, that a single intravenous administration of Zolgensma is able to restore SMN expression to motor neurons that lack a functional SMN1 gene, thereby addressing the root cause of SMA.
AAV9 Antibody Data 
Zolgensma introduces a functional copy of the SMN gene using the adeno-associated viral vector 9 (AAV9). AAV9 is a common virus not known to cause disease in humans, and there is a low prevalence of anti-AAV antibodies in young children, lowering the probability of immunological reaction to the AAV9 vector[4],[5],[6].
Approximately five percent of patients (9/177) up to five years of age who underwent screening for Zolgensma were excluded from treatment across the clinical development program (including intravenous and intrathecal administration) and Managed Access Program due to elevated AAV9 antibody titers greater than 1:50. Of those screened, more than 150 patients have been dosed with Zolgensma to date.
About Zolgensma®
Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi; AVXS-101) is an investigational gene therapy currently in development as a one-time infusion for SMA Type 1. Zolgensma is designed to address the monogenic root cause of SMA and prevent further muscle degeneration by providing a copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through rapid and sustained SMN protein expression. Zolgensma represents the first in a proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. In December, the FDA accepted the company’s Biologics License Application for use of Zolgensma with SMA Type 1 patients. The drug previously received Breakthrough Therapy designation and has been granted Priority Review by the FDA, with regulatory action anticipated in May 2019. In addition, the drug is anticipated to receive approval in Japan and the European Union later this year.
About Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in 10,000 live births and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. The most severe form of SMA is Type 1, a lethal genetic disorder characterized by rapid motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, which results in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support by 24 months of age for more than 90 percent of patients.

12748,ï»¿FDA Orders Immediate Stop on Commercialization of Surgical Mesh for Women with Pelvic Collapse in the US,"FDA takes action to protect women’s health, orders manufacturers of surgical mesh intended for transvaginal repair of pelvic organ prolapse to stop selling all devices","The US FDA has ordered all medical device manufacturers including Boston Scientific and Coloplast to stop sales & distribution of surgical mesh for the transvaginal repair of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) for the protection of women’s health
 The PMA submitted failed to provide long term assessment of safety & benefits compared to transvaginal surgical tissue repair without the use of mesh and FDA has reclassified them in class III (high risk) since 2016. The companies have 10 days for the submission of withdraw plans from the US markets
 In 2002, the first mesh device was identified as class II moderate-risk device for transvaginal repair of POP in women","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today ordered the manufacturers of all remaining surgical mesh products indicated for the transvaginal repair of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) to stop selling and distributing their products in the U.S. immediately. The order is the latest in a series of escalating safety actions related to protecting the health of the thousands of women each year who undergo surgery transvaginally to repair POP.
The FDA has determined that the manufacturers, Boston Scientific and Coloplast, have not demonstrated a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for these devices, which is the premarket review standard that now applies to them since the agency reclassified them in class III (high risk) in 2016. As part of the 2016 reclassification, manufacturers were required to submit and obtain approval of premarket approval (PMA) applications, the agency’s most stringent device review pathway, in order to continue marketing their devices in the U.S. The companies will have 10 days to submit their plan to withdraw these products from the market.
“In order for these mesh devices to stay on the market, we determined that we needed evidence that they worked better than surgery without the use of mesh to repair POP. That evidence was lacking in these premarket applications, and we couldn’t assure women that these devices were safe and effective long term,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Patient safety is our highest priority, and women must have access to safe medical devices that provide relief from symptoms and better management of their medical conditions. The FDA has committed to taking forceful new actions to enhance device safety and encourage innovations that lead to safer medical devices, so that patients have access to safe and effective medical devices and the information they need to make informed decisions about their care.”
Surgical mesh has been used by surgeons since the 1950s to repair abdominal hernias. In the 1970s, gynecologists began implanting surgical mesh for abdominal repair of POP and, in the 1990s, for the transvaginal repair of POP. In 2002, the first mesh device for transvaginal repair of POP was cleared for use as a class II moderate-risk device. About 1 in 8 women has surgery to repair POP over her lifetime, and a subset of these surgeries are completed transvaginally with the use of surgical mesh. However, the percentage of women undergoing transvaginal POP mesh procedures has decreased in recent years after the FDA began issuing warnings about the risks associated with using transvaginal mesh used for POP repair.
Two manufacturers have been marketing three surgical mesh products for transvaginal repair of POP. In reviewing the PMAs submitted by the two manufacturers, the agency determined they failed to provide an adequate assessment of the long-term safety of these devices and failed to demonstrate an acceptable long-term benefit of these devices compared to transvaginal surgical tissue repair without the use of mesh (native tissue repair). Since the FDA has not received sufficient evidence to assure that the probable benefits of these devices outweigh their probable risks, the agency has concluded that these products do not have a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Boston Scientific filed two PMAs for its devices, the Uphold LITE Vaginal Support System and the Xenform Soft Tissue Repair System, and Coloplast filed a PMA for its device, Restorelle DirectFix Anterior. In February 2019, the FDA convened an advisory panel to solicit input from experts on how to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP. The panel recommended that to support a favorable benefit-risk profile, the effectiveness of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP should be superior to native tissue repair at 36 months and the safety outcomes for surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP should be comparable to native tissue repair. The FDA agreed with these recommendations, and because such data were not provided by manufacturers in their PMAs, the FDA decided not to approve them. Even though these products can no longer be used in patients moving forward, Boston Scientific and Coloplast are required to continue follow-up of the subjects already enrolled in their 522 studies.
Women who have had transvaginal mesh placed for the surgical repair of POP should continue with their annual and other routine check-ups and follow-up care. There is no need to take additional action if they are satisfied with their surgery and are not having complications or symptoms. Patients should notify their health care professionals if they have complications or symptoms, including persistent vaginal bleeding or discharge, pelvic or groin pain or pain with sex. They should also let their health care professional know if they have surgical mesh, especially if they plan to have another surgery or other medical procedures. Women who were planning to have mesh placed transvaginally for the repair of POP should discuss other treatment options with their doctors.
Over the past several years, the FDA has seen a significant increase in the number of reported adverse events associated with the use of surgical mesh for transvaginal POP repair. As a result, the agency has taken several, escalating actions for the protection of public health:
July 2011: FDA issued an FDA Safety Communication, which identified concerns and issued new recommendations about the use of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP.
September 2011: FDA convened a public meeting of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel to discuss the benefits and risks of this use. Subsequently, the FDA issued 131 orders to conduct postmarket surveillance studies (“522 orders”) to 34 manufacturers of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP. Most manufacturers elected to stop marketing surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP after receiving their 522 orders.
January 2016: The FDA completed its reclassification of surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of POP into the highest risk class of devices (class III), which requires premarket approval (PMA) applications, the agency’s most stringent device review pathway, in order to stay on the market.
July 5, 2018: This was the deadline for applications to be filed for premarket approval for any surgical mesh marketed for transvaginal POP repair. Manufacturers that did not file PMAs by this deadline were required to withdraw their products from the market. Those that did were allowed to keep their products on the market while the FDA reviewed their PMAs.
February 12, 2019: The FDA convened an advisory committee meeting to share the available evidence and seek expert opinion on how to evaluate the risks and benefits of these devices. The committee was asked to provide scientific and clinical input on assessing the effectiveness, safety, and benefit-risk of mesh placed transvaginally in the anterior vaginal compartment, as well as identifying the appropriate patient population and physician training needed for these devices.
The action today is part of the FDA’s overarching commitment to advance women’s health and improve access to safe and effective medical devices. This includes the issuance of a Medical Device Safety Action Plan and the agency’s work to implement a new active surveillance system to quickly detect new device safety signals and efforts to strengthen Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs), which link different real-world data sources to generate clinical evidence about medical products used by patients. In particular, the FDA is focusing on addressing clinical questions on device therapies that are unique to women, such as the treatment of uterine fibroids and pelvic floor disorders including POP. The FDA partnered with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Urogynecologic Society, the National Library of Medicine and others on this effort, known as the Women’s Health Technologies CRN, or WHT-CRN. Providing patients with access to the safest possible medical devices on the market to meet their health care needs remains a top FDA priority.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CR_Health-Hero-FDA-approval-of-muscular-dystrophy-drug-09-16_.jpg,MedTech|Regulatory,0,Surgical Mesh,Pelvic Collapse|MedTech|Regulatory|Commercialization|FDA|Immediate|Orders|Stop|the US|Women,publish,17/4/2019,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/fda-takes-action-to-protect-womens-health-orders-manufacturers-of-surgical-mesh-intended-for-transvaginal-repair-of-pelvic-organ-prolapse-to-stop-selling-all-devices-2/,https://pharmashots.com/12748/%ef%bb%bffda-orders-immediate-stop-on-commercialization-of-surgical-mesh-for-women-with-pelvic-collapse-in-the-us/

 The focus of the collaboration is to provide a diagnostic solution to both clinical and medical professionals by evaluating maternal and fetal biomarkers during pregnancy and to assess adverse outcomes including preterm birth and preeclampsia for improving health
 NX Prenatal’s NeXosome technology harvest microparticles (exosomes) from the mother’s blood, maintaining the balance between mother & fetus during the pregnancy","Thermo Fisher and NX Prenatal to develop clinical mass spectrometry-based workflows for monitoring maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and evaluating risk of complications.
SAN JOSE, Calif., – Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world leader in serving science, and NXPrenatal Inc., a recognized leader in the detection, monitoring and management of pregnancy-related complications using novel exosome-based methods, have entered into a collaboration to develop clinical mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays to monitor fetal health in utero and assess the risk of adverse outcomes, including preterm birth and preeclampsia.
This new collaboration recognizes the challenges faced by medical professionals who have few tools available for noninvasive risk stratification for adverse pregnancy outcomes. By combining NX Prenatal’s NeXosome platform with Thermo Fisher’s leading liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instrumentation, the workflows can address the reliability, accuracy and precision of the analytical solutions currently available to clinical scientists.
“Our collaboration with NX Prenatal is aiming to enable us to better evaluate maternal and fetal biomarkers during pregnancy that correlate with adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth,” said Brad Hart, senior director, clinical research, chromatography and mass spectrometry, Thermo Fisher Scientific. “The co-development of a commercially available clinical mass spectrometry-based proteomics assay has the potential to provide a diagnostic solution to both clinical scientists and medical professionals offering more confidence in the evaluation of novel biomarkers that can support a safe delivery and healthy future for mother and baby.”
“At NX Prenatal, we are developing novel assays and noninvasive early warning systems to detect subtle molecular changes in the maternal-fetal environment, all with the goal of improving the rate of healthy pregnancy outcomes,” said Brian D. Brohman, CEO of NX Prenatal. “Our collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific brings together our novel NeXosome platform with their leading analytical technology with the goal of optimizing clinical mass spectrometry-based workflows, in an effort to provide the precision necessary for personalized diagnostic solutions to improve health outcomes for both mother and child.”
The unique NeXosome technology is used to enrich maternal blood samples for microparticles, such as exosomes, which play key roles in maintaining certain balances between the mother and fetus during pregnancy. Aberrations in these balances have been shown to correlate with the likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Merging the NeXosome platform with Thermo Fisher LC-MS technology has the potential to generate fast, efficient and accurate data for the analysis of exosome-derived proteomic biomarkers, which may lead to increased information about maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Ultimately, the analysis has the potential to support obstetrical care decisions in conjunction with traditional clinical assessments.

 The focus of the collaboration is to develop immuno-oncology candidates for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers administered directly to the gut lymphatics to potentially tune systemic and local immunity
 PureTech’s lymphatic targeting technology is designed to enable the transport of drug directly into the lymphatic system when administered orally targeting cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases","PureTech Health to receive up to $26 million in upfront payments, research support, and preclinical milestones and is eligible to potentially receive more than $200 million in milestones, in addition to royalties
Collaboration will initially focus on developing Boehringer Ingelheim’s novel immuno-oncology product candidates
PureTech Health plc (LSE: PRTC) (“PureTech Health”), an advanced biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines for dysfunctions of the Brain-Immune-Gut (BIG) axis, today announced that it has entered into a research collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop novel product candidates for an undisclosed number of targets by leveraging PureTech’s proprietary lymphatic targeting technology for immune modulation. Under terms of the agreement, PureTech Health will receive up to $26 million, including upfront payments, research support, and preclinical milestones, and is eligible to receive more than $200 million in development and sales milestones, in addition to royalties on product sales. The collaboration will initially focus on applying PureTech’s lymphatic targeting technology to an immuno-oncology product candidate designated by Boehringer Ingelheim.
“We see great promise in leveraging PureTech’s platform to target the lymphatic system and deliver therapeutic candidates directly to the lymph nodes responsible for priming, educating and proliferating immune cells,” said Clive Wood, PhD, global head of discovery research at Boehringer Ingelheim. “The approach is a potentially powerful tool for modulating the immune system and may allow us to improve efficacy and reduce systematic toxicities through precise targeting.”
The partnership leverages the potential of the proprietary lymphatic targeting platform that PureTech Health is developing through its internal R&D division. The approach harnesses the gut’s lipid transport mechanisms to enable oral administration and transport of drug candidates directly through the gut-draining lymphatic vasculature, also bypassing first pass metabolism in the liver. More specifically, the therapeutic candidates are directed to the mesenteric lymph nodes, which program as many as 70 per cent of circulating adaptive immune cells. By targeting the lymphatic system directly, the technology has the potential to achieve more effective and precise immunomodulation of local tissues, while sparing the patient from the risks of extensive systemic exposure to the drug. PureTech’s lymphatic targeting approach, which is based on the research of Chris Porter, PhD, Director of the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MIPS) at Monash University, can potentially be applied to therapeutic molecules across a range of physiochemical properties and holds promise for the development of novel therapeutics for gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and autoimmune diseases as well as cancer.
“This collaboration signals the exciting potential of another proprietary platform from our internal R&D to enable novel immunotherapy approaches by harnessing the lymphatic system’s capacity for immune cell trafficking and immunomodulation,” said Daphne Zohar, co-founder and chief executive officer of PureTech Health. “We look forward to working with the excellent scientific teams at Boehringer Ingelheim to advance this important program, which has the potential to greatly expand therapeutic options for patients with cancer.”
The research collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim will focus first on using this approach to administer an immuno-oncology candidate for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers directly to the gut lymphatics. About 70 per cent of immune cells reside in lymphatic tissues associated with the GI tract, so targeting immunomodulatory agents with this approach could potentially tune both systemic and local immunity. Once the product candidates enter the development stage, Boehringer Ingelheim will assume full responsibility for development and PureTech Health will be eligible for various developmental and sales milestones in addition to royalties on product sales.
About PureTech’s Lymphatic Targeting Platform
PureTech’s proprietary lymphatic targeting platform is designed to the body’s natural lipid transport mechanisms to enable the transport of drug molecules directly into the lymphatic system when administered orally. This pathway facilitates entry into the mesenteric lymph nodes, which are crucial centres for immune cell priming, education and proliferation in the GI tract. Targeting the lymphatic vasculature enables rational design of therapeutics to modulate immunity in a tissue-specific manner and minimize systemic toxicity due to global immunosuppression. Preclinical data suggest PureTech’s lymphatic targeting platform could potentially enable more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics addressing cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This technology is based on the pioneering research of Professor Chris Porter and his team at the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, who continue to collaborate with PureTech Health on the programme. All the relevant intellectual property associated with his work on this technology is exclusively licensed to PureTech and is supported by additional PureTech Health patents.

 The VeClose Study involves assessment of VenaSeal & ClosureFast radiofrequency ablation (RFA) device demonstrating vein closure 91.4% & 85.2% respectively for 5yrs.
 The VenaSeal closure system is the non-tumescent, non-thermal, non-sclerosant procedure which utilizes a medical adhesive delivered endovenously to close the vein & eliminates the risk of nerve injury while treating saphenous vein","-DUBLIN and LONDON – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced five-year outcomes from the VeClose Extension Study. Nick Morrison, M.D., Center for Vein Restoration, Mesa, Ariz., presented at the 2019 Charing Cross Symposium in London. The new data demonstrate durable and consistent long-term outcomes of the Medtronic VenaSeal(TM) Closure System in treating patients with chronic venous disease.
The VeClose Extension Study is a follow-on study with the purpose of evaluating long-term outcomes at five years post-treatment with the VenaSeal Closure System. The aggregate complete closure rate of the great saphenous vein (GSV) was 94.6 percent (53/56) in the VenaSeal subjects who completed five-year follow-up, including 47 randomized subjects and nine roll-in subjects.
In the original VeClose Study, patients were randomized to receive treatment with VenaSeal or the Medtronic ClosureFast(TM) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) device. By Kaplan-Meier analysis of the randomized cohorts to evaluate success over the life of the study through five years, vein closure estimates were 91.4 percent for VenaSeal and 85.2 percent for RFA, demonstrating continued non-inferiority of VenaSeal to RFA through five years.
Patient improvement was rated on three assessments: Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), a clinical venous disease assessment; and the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and EQ-5D – both of which provide patient-reported quality of life (QoL) outcomes. By all measurements, subjects sustained or maintained improvements in QoL after treatment with either VenaSeal or RFA. These first prospective five-year data for VenaSeal demonstrate a strong clinical portfolio with sustained long-term outcomes.
“The five-year data support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of life-enhancing capability of both VenaSeal and ClosureFast in treating patients with chronic venous disease,” said Dr. Morrison. “Furthermore, the data demonstrate long-term, strong, and consistent outcomes. The industry will benefit from long-term data like this so that physicians and patients can be confident in their treatment choice.”
The original VeClose Study was a U.S. pivotal clinical trial that was conducted under an investigational device exemption (IDE) as a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of the VenaSeal Closure System to RFA. VeClose Study outcomes have been previously reported, and the study has since concluded.
“The Medtronic commitment to long-term clinical evidence and improving patient outcomes is underscored by the release of this five-year VeClose Extension Study data,” said Sandra Lesenfants, vice president and general manager of the endoVenous business, which is part of the Aortic, Peripheral, and Venous division at Medtronic. “VenaSeal has already been used in more than 100,000 procedures and that number is growing daily. We want to continue to expand minimally invasive innovation to improve the quality of life for all patients with venous disease.”
In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers, and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and services of the highest quality that deliver clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the world.

12806,World Health Organization (WHO) Reports 10 Guidelines on Digital Health Interventions,WHO releases first guideline on digital health interventions,"WHO recommends 10 guidelines for the countries to utilize digital health technology via mobile phones, tablets and computers for improving health and essential services worldwide
 WHO guidelines on digital technologies recommends on how digital tools can maximize the impact in health systems. The guidelines also include recommendations about telemedicine addressing the patient’s accessibility for health services in remote areas via phones and web portals
 The organization has developed eHealth Strategy Toolkit, MAPS toolkit & Digital Health Atlas where implementers can register their digital health activities. In 2019, a Department focusing on Digital Health is also developed to enhance WHO’s role in assessing digital technologies","WHO today released new recommendations on 10 ways that countries can use digital health technology, accessible via mobile phones, tablets and computers, to improve people’s health and essential services.
“Harnessing the power of digital technologies is essential for achieving universal health coverage,” says WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Ultimately, digital technologies are not ends in themselves; they are vital tools to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable.”
Over the past two years, WHO systematically reviewed evidence on digital technologies and consulted with experts from around the world to produce recommendations on some key ways such tools may be used for maximum impact on health systems and people’s health.
One digital intervention already having positive effects in some areas is sending reminders to pregnant women to attend antenatal care appointments and having children return for vaccinations. Other digital approaches reviewed include decision-support tools to guide health workers as they provide care; and enabling individuals and health workers to communicate and consult on health issues from across different locations.
“The use of digital technologies offers new opportunities to improve people’s health,” says Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist at WHO. “But the evidence also highlights challenges in the impact of some interventions.”
She adds: “If digital technologies are to be sustained and integrated into health systems, they must be able to demonstrate long-term improvements over the traditional ways of delivering health services.”
For example, the guideline points to the potential to improve stock management. Digital technologies enable health workers to communicate more efficiently on the status of commodity stocks and gaps. However, notification alone is not enough to improve commodity management; health systems also must respond and take action in a timely manner for replenishing needed commodities.
“Digital interventions, depend heavily on the context and ensuring appropriate design,” warns Dr Garrett Mehl, WHO scientist in digital innovations and research. “This includes structural issues in the settings where they are being used, available infrastructure, the health needs they are trying to address, and the ease of use of the technology itself.”
Digital health interventions are not sufficient on their own
The guideline demonstrates that health systems need to respond to the increased visibility and availability of information. People also must be assured that their own data is safe and that they are not being put at risk because they have accessed information on sensitive health topics, such as sexual and reproductive health issues.
Health workers need adequate training to boost their motivation to transition to this new way of working and need to use the technology easily. The guideline stresses the importance of providing supportive environments for training, dealing with unstable infrastructure, as well as policies to protect privacy of individuals, and governance and coordination to ensure these tools are not fragmented across the health system.
The guideline encourages policy-makers and implementers to review and adapt to these conditions if they want digital tools to drive tangible changes and provides guidance on taking privacy considerations on access to patient data.
“Digital health is not a silver bullet,” says Bernardo Mariano, WHO’s Chief Information Officer. “WHO is working to make sure it’s used as effectively as possible. This means ensuring that it adds value to the health workers and individuals using these technologies, takes into account the infrastructural limitations, and that there is proper coordination.”
The guideline also makes recommendations about telemedicine, which allows people living in remote locations to obtain health services by using mobile phones, web portals, or other digital tools. WHO points out that this is a valuable complement to face-to-face-interactions, but it cannot replace them entirely. It is also important that consultations are conducted by qualified health workers and that the privacy of individuals’ health information is maintained.
The guideline emphasizes the importance of reaching vulnerable populations, and ensuring that digital health does not endanger them in any way.

WHO’s work on digital health
This guideline represents the first of many explorations into the use of digital technologies and has only covered a fraction of the many aspects of digital health.
In 2018, governments unanimously adopted a World Health Assembly resolution calling on WHO to develop a global strategy on digital health to support national efforts to achieve universal health coverage. That strategy is scheduled to be considered at the World Health Assembly in 2020.
Although WHO is expanding its focus on digital health, the Organization has been working in this area for years, for example, through the development of the eHealth Strategy Toolkit in 2012, published in collaboration with International Telecommunications Union (ITU).
To support governments in monitoring and coordination of digital investments in their country, WHO has developed the Digital Health Atlas, an online global repository where implementers can register their digital health activities. WHO has also established innovative partnerships with the ITU, such as the BeHe@lthy, BeMobile initiative for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, as well as efforts for building digital health capacity through the WHO Regional Office for Africa.
Over the years, WHO has released a number of resources to strengthen digital health research and implementation, including the mHealth Assessment and Planning for Scale (MAPS) toolkit, a handbook for Monitoring and Evaluation of Digital Health, and mechanisms to harness digital health to end TB.
On 6 March 2019, Dr Tedros announced the creation of the Department of Digital Health to enhance WHO’s role in assessing digital technologies and support Member States in prioritizing, integrating and regulating them",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/who.png,Regulatory,World Health Organization,0,regulatory|10 guidelines|digital health interventions|reports|WHO,publish,18/4/2019,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/who-releases-first-guideline-on-digital-health-interventions/,https://pharmashots.com/12806/world-health-organization-who-reports-10-guidelines-on-digital-health-interventions/
12815,Pfizer &amp; Eli Lilly Report Results of Tanezumab in Long-Term P-III Study for Osteoarthritis,Pfizer And Lilly Announce Top-Line Results from Long-Term Phase 3 Study Of Tanezumab In Patients With Osteoarthritis,"The P-III A4091058 study involves assessing of Tanezumab (2.5 & 5mg, q8w) vs NSAIDS (naproxen 500 mg/celecoxib 100 mg/diclofenac extended release 75 mg, q2d) in 3,021 patients with moderate-to-severe OA in ratio 1:1:1 for 56wks. across globe + 24-week safety follow-up study
 The P-III A4091058 results: composite 1EPs for safety (3.8% & 7.1% vs 1.5%); incidence of RPOA (3.2% & 6.3% vs 1.2%); joint replacement (5.3% & 8.0% vs 2.6%); subchondral fracture (6&7 vs 4) no pathological fracture observed; one case of osteonecrosis with tanezumab 5 mg
 Tanezumab is a mAb that selectively targets nerve growth factor (NGF) act against pain without producing addiction and has received FDA’s FT designation for OA and chronic low back pain","NEW YORK & INDIANAPOLIS–Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) today announced top-line results from a Phase 3 study evaluating tanezumab 2.5 mg and 5 mg. The objective of the study was to compare the long-term joint safety and 16-week efficacy of tanezumab relative to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. The tanezumab 5 mg treatment arm met two of the three co-primary efficacy endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in pain and physical function compared to NSAIDs at the 16-week analysis, while patients’ overall assessment of their OA was not statistically different than NSAIDs. Patients who received tanezumab 2.5 mg did not experience a statistically significant improvement in pain, physical function or patients’ overall assessment of their OA at 16 weeks compared to NSAIDs. In the safety analysis, there was a higher rate of joint safety events in the tanezumab arms compared to NSAIDs at 80 weeks; the difference was statistically significant. Joint safety was a composite measure consisting of adjudicated outcomes of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA) type 1 or type 2, subchondral insufficiency fracture, osteonecrosis or pathological fracture. Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that is part of an investigational class of non-opioid chronic pain medications known as nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitors.
“We are analyzing these findings in the context of the recent Phase 3 results as we assess potential next steps for tanezumab,” said Ken Verburg, tanezumab development team leader, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We plan to review the totality of data from our clinical development program for tanezumab with regulatory authorities.”
“Lilly and Pfizer recognize the significant unmet needs for patients living with osteoarthritis,” said Christi Shaw, president, Lilly Bio-Medicines. “We are committed to understanding these results for people who suffer from chronic pain.”
In this study, tanezumab 2.5 mg or 5 mg was administered subcutaneously (SC) every eight weeks, for a total of 56 weeks. Preliminary safety data showed that the overall adverse event profile with tanezumab was generally consistent with previous studies of tanezumab in OA, though in this study, discontinuations due to adverse events were higher among those receiving tanezumab compared to NSAIDs during the 56-week treatment period. The study also included a 24-week safety follow-up period, for a total of 80 weeks of observation. There were 10 deaths in the study; nine occurred in the tanezumab treatment arms and one in the NSAID treatment arm. None were considered treatment-related: five occurred during the treatment period and five occurred after the treatment period.
The incidence of the primary composite joint safety endpoint was 7.1 percent in the tanezumab 5 mg arm, 3.8 percent in the tanezumab 2.5 mg arm and 1.5 percent in the NSAIDs arm. RPOA accounted for the majority of events observed in the composite joint safety endpoint. The incidence of RPOA overall was 6.3 percent in the tanezumab 5 mg arm, 3.2 percent in the tanezumab 2.5 mg arm and 1.2 percent in the NSAIDs arm. The majority of RPOA events (81 percent) observed with tanezumab were RPOA type 1. There was one patient with osteonecrosis in the tanezumab 5 mg arm, and no patients in the tanezumab 2.5 mg or NSAIDs arms. Subchondral insufficiency fracture was observed in seven, six and four patients receiving tanezumab 5 mg, tanezumab 2.5 mg and NSAIDs, respectively. There were no pathological fractures observed in patients treated with tanezumab or NSAIDs. The incidence of total joint replacement was 8.0 percent in the tanezumab 5 mg arm, 5.3 percent in the tanezumab 2.5 mg arm and 2.6 percent in the NSAIDs arm.
The full results from this study will be submitted for future scientific publication or presentation.
About the Study
Study A4091058 was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SC administration of tanezumab for 56 weeks compared to NSAIDs in patients with moderate-to-severe OA. The study was conducted worldwide (United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America).
Patients considered for this study had experienced inadequate pain relief from or intolerance to acetaminophen and either tramadol or opioids (or unwilling to take opioids). They were on a stable dose of NSAID before being screened into the study and had experienced at least some benefit from stable NSAID treatment during the period prior to randomization. On average patients had suffered from OA for approximately eight years and had baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores of seven out of 10. At the beginning of the study, they also reported a significant impact of their pain on their ability to function in everyday life.
A total of 3,021 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either tanezumab 2.5 mg every eight weeks, tanezumab 5 mg every eight weeks, or oral NSAIDs (either naproxen 500 mg, celecoxib 100 mg or diclofenac Extended Release 75 mg) twice daily over the 56-week treatment period. The study also included a 24-week safety follow-up period.
The primary safety endpoint evaluated a composite measure of adjudicated outcomes of RPOA type 1 or type 2, subchondral insufficiency fracture, primary osteonecrosis or pathological fracture through 80 weeks (56 weeks of treatment plus a 24-week safety follow-up period). RPOA type 1 was defined as a significant loss of joint space width ≥2 mm (predicated on optimal joint positioning) within approximately one year, without gross structural failure. RPOA type 2 was defined as abnormal bone loss or destruction, including limited or total collapse of at least one subchondral surface that is not normally present in conventional end-stage OA. The co-primary efficacy endpoints evaluated changes from baseline to week 16 in the WOMAC Pain subscale, the WOMAC Physical Function subscale, and the Patient’s Global Assessment of OA.
About Tanezumab
Tanezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that works by selectively targeting, binding to and inhibiting NGF. NGF levels increase in the body as a result of injury, inflammation or in chronic pain states. By inhibiting NGF, tanezumab may help to keep pain signals produced by muscles, skin and organs from reaching the spinal cord and brain. Tanezumab has a novel mechanism that acts in the periphery in a different manner than opioids and other analgesics, including NSAIDs, and in studies to date, tanezumab has not demonstrated a risk of addiction, misuse or dependence.
In June 2017, Pfizer and Lilly announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for tanezumab for the treatment of OA and chronic low back pain. Fast Track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies that treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs.

 The collective studies result: @16wks. sPGA 0/1 & PASI 90 (88%, 84% & 75%); Skyrizi vs adalimumab, PASI 90 (72% vs 47%); Skyrizi vs ustekinumab, DLQI score (66% & 67% vs 43% & 47%); Skyrizi vs PBO, @28wks. sPGA 0/1 (87.4% vs 61.3%); improvement in skin clearance with 3mos.dose regimen
 Skyrizi (risankizumab) is a humanized immunoglobulin mAb inhibits IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit. On Mar’16, Boehringer Ingelheim & AbbVie collaborated to develop & commercialize Skyrizi globally","SKYRIZI™(risankizumab) is a novel, humanized immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody designed to selectively inhibit IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis1 . IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses.
Approval of SKYRIZI™ (risankizumab) is based on results from clinical studies showing significant improvement in levels of skin clearance after just 16 weeks and at 52 weeks with every 3 month dosing in more than 2000 adult patients 2-5
MONTREAL, April 18, 2019 /CNW/ – AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a global research and development-based biopharmaceutical company, announced today that Health Canada has approved SKYRIZI™ (risankizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
Canadians living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were well represented in all four of the pivotal clinical trials leading to Health Canada’s approval, showing the Canadian leadership in this clinical development program.
In clinical studies, SKYRIZI™ significantly improved levels of skin clearance after just 16 weeks and maintained clearance at one year (52 weeks).2-5
“When treating patients with a chronic disease like psoriasis, it is important to have several options available. With SKYRIZI™, we can simplify their treatment by offering a greater chance of clear skin with a safe and easy three-month dosing regimen. As a dermatologist, this allows me to spend the time I have with my patients on other issues pertaining to their overall health and well-being,” said Dr. Melinda Gooderham, Dermatologist from the SKiN Centre for Dermatology in Peterborough, Ontario.
Kathryn Clay, President, Canadian Association of Psoriasis Patients added “Psoriasis is a chronic condition affecting more than one million Canadians and many patients still do not reach their treatment goals or lose response to medication over time so we need options for them. Despite tremendous progress, there is still much to be done as highlighted in our report Treat Psoriasis Seriously.”
Stéphane Lassignardie, General Manager, AbbVie Canada added: “We are committed to continuing to find new and better medications that will improve the lives of those living with psoriasis. There are still areas of unmet medical need and we are thrilled that people will be able to access SKYRIZI™.”
SKYRIZI™ received Health Canada approval based on results from four pivotal Phase 3 studies, ultIMMa-1, ultIMMa-2, IMMvent and IMMhance evaluating more than 2,000 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.2-5 SKYRIZI™ is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.
Highlights from the pivotal Phase 3 program

In the ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 studies, SKYRIZI™ I met the co-primary endpoints of sPGA 0/1 and PASI 90 at Week 16 (p<0.001).1,4 After 16 weeks of treatment, 88 percent (ultIMMa-1) and 84 percent (ultIMMa-2) of SKYRIZI™ patients achieved sPGA 0/1 and 75 percent of patients receiving SKYRIZI™ in both studies achieved PASI 90.2,4,5
Among patients with sPGA of 0/1 at Week 28 in the IMMhance study, 87.4% (97/111) maintained response with continued treatment with SKYRIZI™ compared to 61.3% (138/225) with withdrawal (placebo) at Week 525.
SKYRIZI™ demonstrated superiority versus adalimumab in the IMMvent study, with 72 percent of patients achieving PASI 90 compared to 47 percent of patients treated with adalimumab at Week 16 (p<0.001).2,4 Following re-randomization at Week 16, 66 percent of patients who started on adalimumab and switched to SKYRIZI™ achieved PASI 90, compared to 21 percent who continued on adalimumab at Week 44 (p<0.001).2,4 The co-primary endpoints of sPGA 0/1 and PASI 90 at Week 16 were met (p<0.001).2,4, 5
SKYRIZI™ was also reported to improve health-related quality of life in Phase 3 studies. In ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2, significantly more patients treated with SKYRIZI™ self-reported a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 0/1 (no impact on health-related quality of life) at Week 16 (66 percent in ultIMMa-1 and 67 percent in ultIMMa-2) compared with ustekinumab (43 percent in ultIMMa-1 and 47 percent in ultIMMa-2)2,5
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions through the 16-week placebo-controlled period in the SKYRIZI™ group were upper respiratory tract infections (13%) compared with 10% in the placebo group. Common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1% of patients treated with SKYRIZI™ included tinea infections, headache, pruritus, fatigue and injection site reactions.4, 5

Janssen to hold the rights for bedaquiline (Ex- DS-TB) and linezolid is available from multiple manufacturers, including Mylan
 TB Alliances has also licensed Pretomanid to Mylan for DS & MDR-TB and sublicensed bedaquiline for DS-TB only in BPaMZ regimen (bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide for 4-6mos.)
 Pretomanid as part of the BPaL regimen is under FDA & EMA review. Mylan gets a non-exclusive & exclusive license to commercialize Pretomanid in low-& middle -income & high-income markets respectively. Janssen will retain exclusive rights to market bedaquiline as part of the combination therapy for MDR-TB","TB is a global epidemic responsible for 1.6 million deaths in 2017(1)Regimens under clinical development include treatment options for drug-resistant forms of TB
NEW YORK and HERTFORDSHIRE, England and PITTSBURGH, April 18, 2019 Non-profit drug developer, TB Alliance, and pharmaceutical company, Mylan N.V.(NASDAQ: MYL), today announced a global collaboration to make the experimental drug pretomanid accessible for use in two investigational drug regimens for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).
TB, a bacterial infection transmitted through the air, is a challenging disease to treat, often requiring treatment through a combination of antibiotics. It also is the leading cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS2 and accounts for more than 1 in 4 fatalities from antimicrobial resistance annually.3 TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2017, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in the Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions, followed by the African region. There is a growing resistance to available drugs, which means the disease is becoming deadlier and more difficult to treat. There were 558,000 cases of drug resistant TB in 2017.1
Multidrug resistant- (MDR) and extensively drug resistant- (XDR) TB are forms of the disease caused by bacteria that do not respond to first-line anti-TB drugs. Current treatments, therefore, consist of combinations of many different drugs, which may need to be taken for up to two years. Patients may take as many as 20 pills a day, resulting in numerous side-effects and often creating a significant economic burden.4 Drug sensitive- (DS) TB treatment, which consists of treatment with up to four drugs daily for six to nine months, has traditionally fared better with a global treatment success rate of approximately 82%; however, rising rates of resistance are complicating treatment and necessitating different options.1
“The TB drug pipeline is showing significant promise as we progress in our goal to provide transformative benefit to people with TB,” said Mel Spigelman, President and CEO of TB Alliance. “We are determined to take steps now to ensure that pretomanid, if approved, will be able to reach patients in need as part of an appropriate treatment regimen.”
Mylan CEO Heather Bresch added, “For more than a decade, Mylan has led the charge in accelerating access to high quality and affordable antiretrovirals for people living with HIV all over the world. We look forward to collaborating with TB Alliance to bring that same level of commitment and innovation to the millions of people suffering from tuberculosis, many of whom also have HIV. The drug regimens under development represent an important step in transforming the TB treatment landscape.”
Advancing Treatment for Patients
Pretomanid is a new chemical entity and a member of a class of compounds known as nitroimidazooxazines. TB Alliance began preclinical development of pretomanid in 2002, and it has since studied pretomanid in 20 clinical trials alone or in combination with other anti-TB drugs. Pretomanid has been administered in a clinical trial setting to more than 1,200 people in 14 countries.
The two pretomanid-based regimens under development include:
For XDR-TB and MDR-TB that is treatment-intolerant or non-responsive: All oral, six- to nine-month treatment regimen consisting of bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid (“BPaL” regimen)
For DS-TB and MDR-TB: All oral, four- and six-month treatments, respectively, consisting of bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide (“BPaMZ” regimen)
TB Alliance is currently advancing the development of pretomanid in three ongoing late-stage clinical trials. The Nix-TB and ZeNix trials are evaluating the BPaL regimen for treatment of XDR-TB and related highly resistant forms of TB, while the SimpliciTB trial is evaluating the BPaMZ regimen for the treatment of DS-TB in four months and MDR-TB in six months.
The BPaL regimen has been studied in the ongoing Phase 3 Nix-TB trial, an open-label, single arm trial. Nix-TB participants with XDR-TB and treatment-intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB were treated with bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid over six months, extended to nine months in some cases, with the intent to cure. In interim results from the first 75 participants presented at the 2018 Union World Conference on Lung Health, 89% of the trial participants had a favorable outcome with their clinical infection resolved and sputum cultures negative for TB after six months of treatment and six months of post-treatment follow-up.5
The BPaMZ regimen is being studied in the ongoing late-stage SimpliciTB clinical trial, initiated in 2018, for the treatment of both DS- and MDR-TB. The BPaMZ regimen was previously evaluated in TB Alliance’s Phase 2b study called NC-005, in which people with MDR-TB who were treated with the BPaMZ regimen cleared TB bacteria from their lungs up to three times faster than drug-sensitive TB patients treated with the standard first-line treatment (HRZE).6
A Global Commitment
The collaboration between Mylan and TB Alliance includes a global license from TB Alliance to Mylan for pretomanid for use in the following regimens:

As part of the BPaL regimen, TB Alliance has granted a license to Mylan to manufacture and commercialize pretomanid, pending regulatory approval, for XDR-TB and treatment-intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB. The BPaL regimen includes bedaquiline, which is exclusively manufactured and marketed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) outside of DS-TB, and linezolid, which is available from multiple manufacturers, including Mylan. A New Drug Application for pretomanid as part of the BPaL regimen is currently under Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.7 In addition, a marketing authorization application for pretomanid as part of the BPaL regimen is under review by the European Medicines Agency. Janssen will retain the exclusive rights to market bedaquiline including as part of any combination therapy for the treatment of MDR-TB for the term of its patents.
As part of the BPaMZ regimen, TB Alliance has licensed pretomanid to Mylan for DS- and MDR-TB, and has granted a sublicense for bedaquiline to Mylan, for its development and commercialization for use in DS-TB only, under its license agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. Janssen has granted its consent to this sublicense. If the BPaMZ regimen is proven successful in the SimpliciTB trial, Mylan will seek regulatory approval of pretomanid as part of the BPaMZ regimen in DS-TB and MDR-TB as well as bedaquiline as part of the regimen in DS-TB. As with the BPaL regimen, Janssen will retain the exclusive rights to market bedaquiline as part of the combination therapy for the treatment of MDR-TB for the term of its patents.
Under the terms of the agreements comprising the collaboration and pending regulatory approvals, Mylan anticipates being the first company with the license to commercialize pretomanid for use in these regimens in certain low- and middle-income countries, where the vast majority of the global TB burden is located. The license agreement for pretomanid for the aforementioned countries will be non-exclusive, reflecting the commitment by TB Alliance and Mylan to ensure affordable and sustainable access to new TB treatments from multiple sources. Mylan has an exclusive license agreement for commercializing pretomanid for use in the BPaL and BPaMZ regimens in high-income markets.
Moving forward, TB Alliance and Mylan will work together to support antimicrobial stewardship and ensure that upon introduction, pretomanid is accessible to those who need it in the appropriate treatment regimen, pending regulatory approval and the issuance of new treatment guidelines by the World Health Organization.

Almirall, S.A. (ALM) announced today that the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, in the UK) has published its final guidance approving ILUMETRI® (Tildrakizumab), a humanized, high-affinity IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody, for treating adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy.1 Following a single health technology assessment submission to NICE in August 2018 and the subsequent questions for clarification and appraisal committee meetings, NICE completed their assessment of Tildrakizumab and has recommended Tildrakizumab as a cost effective treatment option for the NHS for the patients specified in the Final Appraisal Determination (FAD).
Tildrakizumab is a high affinity, humanised, IgG1 K antibody targeting interleukin IL 23 p19 that represents an evolving treatment strategy in chronic plaque psoriasis.3 Tildrakizumab constitutes an important step forward in the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.3
Tildrakizumab is administered by subcutaneous injection. Its convenient dosing regimen, every 3 months during maintenance, could offer convenience and quality of life for patients, potentially achieving an improved treatment satisfaction.4 The low frequency of injections, only 4 doses per year during maintenance, may also encourage adherence.1 
Almirall in-licensed Tildrakizumab from Sun Pharma Global FZE (Sun Pharma) in May 2016. The agreement is for commercialization of ILUMETRI® (Tildrakizumab) in Europe. It was approved by the European Commission in September 2018, is already available in Germany and is due to be marketed in all EU Member states.
 
 
Approval based on reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 phase III trials positive results
 
Its approval in Europe is based on reSURFACE 1 and 23 positive results, with the dose of 100mg. Both pivotal phase III clinical trials, which included over 1,800 patients from more than 200 clinical sites worldwide, showed that Tildrakizumab offers clinically meaningful benefits over time, which is promising news for patients and physicians.3
According to both studies’ data, an average of 62% of patients achieved 75% of skin clearance (Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index or PASI 75) by week 12 and an average of 77% at week 28 after only three doses. Moreover, an average of 54% of patients treated with Tildrakizumab 100mg achieved PASI 90 and an average of 23% reached PASI 100 at week 28; while an average of 58% of patients treated with Tildrakizumab 200mg achieved PASI 90 and an average of 29% reached PASI 200 at week 28.5
The results of a pooled analysis through 3 years2 from reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 phase III trials3 show the consistent maintenance of efficacy and safety over 3 years of Tildrakizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were responders at week 28. According to the data, PASI 75 responses were maintained with continued treatment with Tildrakizumab in 9 out of 10 patients up to week 148.3,4 More than 50% of patients reported that psoriasis no longer affected their lives after only 3 doses.1,3,4 Tildrakizumab was well-tolerated with very low drug-related serious adverse events and discontinuation rates.1,2
 
About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic immune disease that appears on the skin. It affects an estimated 7.8 million adults in Europe and approximately 125 million people worldwide.6 It is a non-contagious disorder that accelerates the growth cycle of skin cells and results in thick scaly areas of skin. The most common form of psoriasis, called plaque psoriasis, appears as red, raised areas of skin covered with flaky white scales, which may be itchy and painful and can crack and bleed. Despite different treatment options existing, many people with plaque psoriasis continue to struggle with the ongoing, persistent nature of this chronic disease.

12851,ï»¿Almac Diagnostic Collaborates with Queen's University to Bring Personalized Chemotherapy for Esophageal Cancer,Almac Group Partner with Queen’s Researchers to pioneer potentially life-changing oesophageal cancer test,"Almac Diagnostic and Queen’s University validate a test to decide the chemotherapy to be used for early-stage esophageal cancer to remove the tumor, improve prognosis and QoL
 The focus of the collaboration is to bring personalized therapies for esophageal cancer. Additionally, Almac Diagnostic has developed DNA Damage Immune Response (DDIR) Signature to personalize chemotherapy for breast cancer
 The test increases the molecular understanding of each patient’s cancer and enables the clinicians to decide the right chemotherapy to shrink the tumor","18 Apr 2019 – Researchers at Queen’s University Belfast and the University of Cambridge, in partnership with the stratified medicine company Almac Diagnostic Services, has validated a test that for the first time could enable clinicians to decide the most appropriate chemotherapy for early stage oesophageal cancer. This personalised medicine approach of tailoring treatment to the individual could lead to more patients having their tumours successfully removed, improving their prognosis and quality of life.
Current treatment for oesophageal cancer involves a course of standard chemotherapy aiming to reduce the tumour size before follow-up surgery can be carried out to remove it. Only around 20 per cent of tumours will reduce in size following the standard course of chemotherapy. For oncologists identifying the most effective chemotherapy to reduce the size of oesophageal tumours before they are operated on is a challenge.
Dr Richard Turkington, Senior Clinical Lecturer at Queen’s University Belfast, and lead author on the study explains: “The UK has the highest incidence in the world of a particular type of oesophageal cancer called oesophageal adenocarcinoma, with 16,000 cases each year. One-third of patients are diagnosed with tumours which have not spread and can be removed by surgery following a course of chemotherapy. However, less than one in five patients show evidence of shrinkage from the chemotherapy when their tumour is removed.”
“In order to cure more oesophageal cancers we need to identify the most effective treatment for each patient to give them the best chance of all of their cancer being removed. At present we apply a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach where everyone gets the same type of chemotherapy before their surgery. But we know that different chemotherapies work better for different patients so we need to match the right treatment to the right patient. This test enabled us to gain a molecular understanding of each patient’s cancer, which could then inform the decision to select the right chemotherapy to shrink the tumour.”
Queen’s has collaborated with Almac Diagnostic Services to bring personalised medicine to oesophageal cancer. Almac Diagnostic Services has previously developed the DNA Damage Immune Response (DDIR) Signature, previously known as DDRD, to personalise chemotherapy for breast cancer but further studies indicated that it may be applied to other cancer types. The DDIR Signature is a 44 gene signature which uses the expression of each gene present in each tumour to generate a score for each patient. A high score indicates that the tumour has a higher likelihood of responding to DNA damaging chemotherapies.
Professor Richard Kennedy, McClay Professor of Medical Oncology at Queen’s University Belfast and Global Vice-president of Biomarker Development at Almac Diagnostic Services commented: “This study highlights the benefits of close collaboration between academia and industry and the strong links between Queen’s and Almac in particular. It expands the indications for the DDIR signature to oesophageal adenocarcinoma and brings stratified medicine a step closer in this difficult to treat cancer.”
This research study is part of the Oesophageal Cancer Clinical and Molecular Stratification (OCCAMS) consortium led by Professor Rebecca Fitzgerald from the Medical Research Council Cancer Unit at the University of Cambridge and funded by Cancer Research UK.
Professor Fitzgerald commented: “The OCCAMS collaboration is a UK wide network of centres for the collection of tissue samples and clinical information to study the biology and treatment of oesophageal cancer. A key aim of the consortium is to translate laboratory discoveries into clinical progress and this study is an example of using this knowledge to improve diagnosis and treatment for oesophageal cancer patients.”
The research has been published in the prestigious journal Gut, one of the highest ranking gastroenterology journals in the world and is freely available to the research community. The research team is continuing to test the assay further in other sample collections and through clinical trials.
The research paper is available from the journal Gut here.

About Almac Group
‘Partnering to Advance Human Health’
The Almac Group is an established contract development and manufacturing organisation that provides an extensive range of integrated services to the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors globally. The services range from R&D, biomarker discovery development and commercialisation, API manufacture, formulation development, clinical trial supply, IRT (IVRS/IWRS) through to commercial-scale manufacture.
The international company is a privately-owned organisation that has organically grown over 50 years and now employs over 5,000 highly skilled personnel.
Almac is headquartered in Craigavon, Northern Ireland with 17 operations across Europe, the US (Pennsylvania, North Carolina and California) and Asia (Singapore and Tokyo).“We are analyzing these findings in the context of the recent Phase 3 results as we assess potential next steps for tanezumab,” said Ken Verburg, tanezumab development team leader, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We plan to review the totality of data from our clinical development program for tanezumab with regulatory authorities.”
“Lilly and Pfizer recognize the significant unmet needs for patients living with osteoarthritis,” said Christi Shaw, president, Lilly Bio-Medicines. “We are committed to understanding these results for people who suffer from chronic pain.”
In this study, tanezumab 2.5 mg or 5 mg was administered subcutaneously (SC) every eight weeks, for a total of 56 weeks. Preliminary safety data showed that the overall adverse event profile with tanezumab was generally consistent with previous studies of tanezumab in OA, though in this study, discontinuations due to adverse events were higher among those receiving tanezumab compared to NSAIDs during the 56-week treatment period. The study also included a 24-week safety follow-up period, for a total of 80 weeks of observation. There were 10 deaths in the study; nine occurred in the tanezumab treatment arms and one in the NSAID treatment arm. None were considered treatment-related: five occurred during the treatment period and five occurred after the treatment period.
The incidence of the primary composite joint safety endpoint was 7.1 percent in the tanezumab 5 mg arm, 3.8 percent in the tanezumab 2.5 mg arm and 1.5 percent in the NSAIDs arm. RPOA accounted for the majority of events observed in the composite joint safety endpoint. The incidence of RPOA overall was 6.3 percent in the tanezumab 5 mg arm, 3.2 percent in the tanezumab 2.5 mg arm and 1.2 percent in the NSAIDs arm. The majority of RPOA events (81 percent) observed with tanezumab were RPOA type 1. There was one patient with osteonecrosis in the tanezumab 5 mg arm, and no patients in the tanezumab 2.5 mg or NSAIDs arms. Subchondral insufficiency fracture was observed in seven, six and four patients receiving tanezumab 5 mg, tanezumab 2.5 mg and NSAIDs, respectively. There were no pathological fractures observed in patients treated with tanezumab or NSAIDs. The incidence of total joint replacement was 8.0 percent in the tanezumab 5 mg arm, 5.3 percent in the tanezumab 2.5 mg arm and 2.6 percent in the NSAIDs arm.
The full results from this study will be submitted for future scientific publication or presentation.
About the Study
Study A4091058 was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SC administration of tanezumab for 56 weeks compared to NSAIDs in patients with moderate-to-severe OA. The study was conducted worldwide (United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America).
Patients considered for this study had experienced inadequate pain relief from or intolerance to acetaminophen and either tramadol or opioids (or unwilling to take opioids). They were on a stable dose of NSAID before being screened into the study and had experienced at least some benefit from stable NSAID treatment during the period prior to randomization. On average patients had suffered from OA for approximately eight years and had baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores of seven out of 10. At the beginning of the study, they also reported a significant impact of their pain on their ability to function in everyday life.
A total of 3,021 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either tanezumab 2.5 mg every eight weeks, tanezumab 5 mg every eight weeks, or oral NSAIDs (either naproxen 500 mg, celecoxib 100 mg or diclofenac Extended Release 75 mg) twice daily over the 56-week treatment period. The study also included a 24-week safety follow-up period.
The primary safety endpoint evaluated a composite measure of adjudicated outcomes of RPOA type 1 or type 2, subchondral insufficiency fracture, primary osteonecrosis or pathological fracture through 80 weeks (56 weeks of treatment plus a 24-week safety follow-up period). RPOA type 1 was defined as a significant loss of joint space width ≥2 mm (predicated on optimal joint positioning) within approximately one year, without gross structural failure. RPOA type 2 was defined as abnormal bone loss or destruction, including limited or total collapse of at least one subchondral surface that is not normally present in conventional end-stage OA. The co-primary efficacy endpoints evaluated changes from baseline to week 16 in the WOMAC Pain subscale, the WOMAC Physical Function subscale, and the Patient’s Global Assessment of OA.
About Tanezumab
Tanezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that works by selectively targeting, binding to and inhibiting NGF. NGF levels increase in the body as a result of injury, inflammation or in chronic pain states. By inhibiting NGF, tanezumab may help to keep pain signals produced by muscles, skin and organs from reaching the spinal cord and brain. Tanezumab has a novel mechanism that acts in the periphery in a different manner than opioids and other analgesics, including NSAIDs, and in studies to date, tanezumab has not demonstrated a risk of addiction, misuse or dependence.
In June 2017, Pfizer and Lilly announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for tanezumab for the treatment of OA and chronic low back pain. Fast Track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies that treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs.

MALVERN, Pa., April 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — TELA Bio®, Inc., a regenerative medicine company leading the development of advanced medical devices for soft tissue reconstruction, announced today that the company’s Restella™ Reconstructive BioScaffolds have been awarded 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for implantation to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists in patients requiring soft tissue repair or reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive procedures.
“We are excited to bring Restella Reconstructive BioScaffolds to U.S. surgeons and patients. These products were purposefully engineered to allow for rapid tissue integration and revascularization and biomechanical control,” said Antony Koblish, president and chief executive officer of TELA Bio. “Specifically designed for use in reconstructive surgery, Restella products leverage the strong clinical experience of our OviTex® Reinforced BioScaffolds that have now been implanted in more than 4,500 patients.”
The TELA Bio technology platform is based on interwoven polymer through layers of biologic tissue in a patented “lockstitch” pattern that creates a unique embroidered construction. The biologic material, derived from ovine rumen, is optimized to reduce foreign body response, minimize inflammation, and enable functional tissue remodeling. The interwoven polymer helps provide support along with improved handling and load-sharing capability.
While biologic materials are often used for soft tissue reinforcement in reconstructive surgery, many surgeons report that currently available materials are costly and may stretch over time leading to patient dissatisfaction.

12899,Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) + Inlyta (axitinib) Receive FDA's Approval as 1L Treatment for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,FDA Approves Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in Combination With Inlyta (axitinib) as First-Line Treatment for Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC),"The approval is based on P-III KEYNOTE-426 study assessing Keytruda (pembrolizumab, 200mg, q3w up to 24mos.) + Inlyta (axitinib,5mg, bid) vs sunitinib (50mg, qd for 4wks.) in 861 patients in ratio (1:1) who had not received systemic therapy for advanced RCC
 The P-III KEYNOTE-426 & median 12.8mos. follow up studies result: 47% reduction in risk of death; 31% reduction in PFS; ORR (59% vs 36%); OS (90% vs 78%); m-PFS (15.1 vs 11.1 mos.); CRR (6% vs 2%); PRR (53% vs 34%)
 Keytruda (pembrolizumab, IV, 100mg) is a mAb blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 and activating the T lymphocytes. Inlyta (axitinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is prescribed to treat advanced kidney cancer","Approval Based on Results of KEYNOTE-426, Where KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib Reduced the Risk of Death by Nearly Half Compared to Sunitinib

Monday, April 22, 2019 6:45 am EDT
KENILWORTH, N.Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with Inlyta (axitinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The approval is based on findings from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 trial, which demonstrated significant improvements in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) for KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib (KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination) compared to sunitinib. Consistent results were observed across pre-specified subgroups, IMDC risk categories and PD-L1 tumor expression status. For the main efficacy outcome measures of OS and PFS, the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination reduced the risk of death by 47% compared to sunitinib (HR=0.53 [95% CI, 0.38-0.74]; p<0.0001); for PFS, the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination showed a reduction in the risk of progression of disease or death of 31% compared to sunitinib (HR=0.69 [95% CI, 0.57-0.84]; p=0.0001). The ORR, an additional efficacy outcome measure, was 59% for patients who received the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination (95% CI, 54-64) and 36% for those who received sunitinib (95% CI, 31-40) (p<0.0001). This is the first indication for KEYTRUDA in advanced RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer, and the first anti-PD-1 therapy FDA-approved as part of a combination regimen that significantly improved OS, PFS, and ORR versus sunitinib in patients with advanced RCC.
“This represents a new treatment option for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, who will now have access to KEYTRUDA as part of a first-line combination regimen,” said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “Today’s approval reflects Merck’s commitment to patients with cancer and further supports the use of KEYTRUDA to help improve survival outcomes for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.”
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.
“Given the aggressive nature of the disease, many patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma need additional treatment options that can help improve survival outcomes,” said Dr. Brian Rini, medical oncologist at Cleveland Clinic Cancer Center and professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. “Pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib offers an important new therapeutic option for physicians to consider when approaching initial treatment for patients newly diagnosed with advanced renal cell carcinoma.” Dr. Rini reports consulting and research funding from Merck.
About KEYNOTE-426
The approval was based on data from the pre-specified interim analysis of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 trial, a randomized, multi-center, open-label trial conducted in 861 patients who had not received systemic therapy for advanced RCC. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. Randomization was stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk categories (favorable versus intermediate versus poor) and geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”). Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression within the last two years were ineligible.
Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:
KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks up to 24 months in combination with axitinib 5 mg orally, twice daily (n=432).
Sunitinib 50 mg orally, once daily for four weeks and then off treatment for two weeks (n=429).
Among the 861 patients, the study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range, 26 to 90); 38% age 65 or older; 73% male; 79% White and 16% Asian; 19% and 80% of patients had a baseline Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; and patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 31% favorable, 56% intermediate, and 13% poor.
Treatment with the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to modified RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR, as assessed by BICR.
The trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS, PFS, and ORR in patients randomized to receive the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination compared to sunitinib.
With a median follow-up time of 12.8 months (range, 0.1 to 22 months), OS was significantly improved in patients who received the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination compared to sunitinib (HR=0.53 [95% CI, 0.38-0.74]; p<0.0001). Estimated 12-month OS rates were 90% (95% CI, 86-92) with the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination versus 78% (95% CI, 74-82) with sunitinib. Median OS was not reached with either treatment regimen. Progression-free survival was also significantly improved with the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination compared to sunitinib (HR=0.69 [95% CI, 0.57-0.84]; p=0.0001). Median PFS was 15.1 months (95% CI, 12.6-17.7) in patients receiving the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination versus 11.1 months (95% CI, 8.7-12.5) with sunitinib. In the study, the ORR was 59% for patients who received the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination (95% CI, 54-64) and 36% for those who received sunitinib (95% CI, 31-40) (p<0.0001), with a complete response rate of 6% and 2% and a partial response rate of 53% and 34%, for patients receiving the KEYTRUDA-axitinib combination versus sunitinib, respectively.
In KEYNOTE-426, the safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib was investigated in patients with previously untreated, advanced RCC. The median duration of exposure to the combination therapy of KEYTRUDA and axitinib was 10.4 months (range, 1 day to 21.2 months). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib. Serious adverse reactions in ≥1% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib included hepatotoxicity (7%), diarrhea (4.2%), acute kidney injury (2.3%), dehydration (1%), and pneumonitis (1%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction of either KEYTRUDA or axitinib occurred in 31% of patients; 13% KEYTRUDA only, 13% axitinib only, and 8% both drugs. The most common adverse reaction (>1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA, axitinib or the combination was hepatotoxicity (13%), diarrhea/colitis (1.9%), acute kidney injury (1.6%), and cerebrovascular accident (1.2%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients receiving in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and axitinib were diarrhea (56%), fatigue/asthenia (52%), hypertension (48%), hepatotoxicity (39%), hypothyroidism (35%), decreased appetite (30%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (28%), nausea (28%), stomatitis/mucosal inflammation (27%), dysphonia (25%), rash (25%), cough (21%), and constipation (21%).
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 950 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%).
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis, or Hepatoxicity (in Combination With Axitinib)
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Hepatotoxicity (in Combination With Axitinib)
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST were seen in 20% and 13% of patients, respectively. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used in monotherapy. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

 The P-III COAST-X study results: @16 & 52wks. met its 1Eps & 2Eps; improvement in the signs and symptoms of nr-axSpA; improvement in ASDAS & BASDAI; patients achieve low disease activity (ASDAS <2.1); improvement in SIJ; improvement in SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score; no new safety signals observed
 Taltz (ixekizumab) is a mAb, targeting interleukin 17A (IL-17A) cytokine by inhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor and is under FDA review for radiographic axSpA with its expected regulatory action in H2’19","INDIANAPOLIS, April 22, 2019 – Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today that Taltz® (ixekizumab) met the primary and all major secondary endpoints in COAST-X, a Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Taltz for the treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) in patients who are biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD)-naïve. These results provide clinical evidence to support a potential role for Taltz in the treatment of nr-axSpA patients.
Taltz met the primary endpoint at both week 16 and week 52, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of nr-axSpA, as measured by the proportion of patients who achieved Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response compared to placebo.
Taltz also met the major secondary endpoints at week 16 and week 52, including significant improvement in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), significant improvement in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity (BASDAI), proportion of patients achieving low disease activity (ASDAS <2.1), significant improvement in sacroiliac joint inflammation (SIJ) as assessed by MRI (week 16) and significant improvement in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score.
In COAST-X, the safety profile of Taltz was consistent with previously reported Phase 3 studies of Taltz. No new safety signals were detected.
“Non-radiographic axSpA is a challenging diagnosis that is not only missed in clinics, but also has limited treatment options for physicians to offer patients,” said Atul Deodhar, M.D., professor of medicine, Oregon Health & Science University and clinical investigator for the COAST program. “The COAST-X results offer compelling evidence that Taltz could provide a much-needed new alternative if approved for this patient population.”
Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting predominantly the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton and is estimated to affect 4.5 million adults worldwide.1,2,3 AxSpA is recognized as a single disease entity, with a patient subset defined by the presence of radiographically defined structural damage of the sacroiliac joints (radiographic axSpA or ankylosing spondylitis [AS]) and a patient subset without clear structural damage radiographically (nr-axSpA).4 These two patient subsets share a similar burden of disease and similar clinical features, such as spinal inflammation and chronic inflammatory back pain.5,6 The COAST-X study is part of a clinical development program that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Taltz across various population subsets of patients with axSpA. Results from COAST-V and COAST-W, which evaluated Taltz in AS, were reported in 2018.
“We’re encouraged by the results of the COAST-X trial, which support our belief that Taltz could become the first IL-17A antagonist to be approved in the U.S. for people with non-radiographic axSpA,” said Christi Shaw, president, Lilly Bio-Medicines. “The COAST-X data add to the growing body of evidence from our COAST program, which demonstrates that Taltz may work across the axSpA disease spectrum.”
Lilly plans to submit detailed data from COAST-X for disclosure at scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed journals later this year. Based on these positive data, Lilly plans to submit to regulatory authorities in 2019 for approval for nr-axSpA.
Lilly’s application for radiographic axSpA is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and regulatory action is expected later this year.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR TALTZ (ixekizumab) injection
Taltz is approved for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. Taltz is also approved to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TALTZ
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections
Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.
Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis
Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
Hypersensitivity
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each ≤0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group (Crohn’s disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than in the placebo group (0%) during clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease.
Immunizations
Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions (>1%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis was consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis.

About Taltz®
Taltz (ixekizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with interleukin 17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor.7 IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Taltz inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.7
About COAST-X
COAST-X is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Taltz (ixekizumab) for the treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) in patients who are biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD)-naïve. Patients were required to have an established diagnosis of nr-axSpA and active disease defined by a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score ≥4 and total back pain ≥4 at screening and baseline, and were required to have objective signs of inflammation by presence of sacroiliitis on MRI or presence of elevated CRP.
About the Taltz Program in axSpA
The COAST-X study is part of a clinical development program that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab across various population subsets of patients with axSpA. The COAST program includes three registration studies each of one year duration: COAST-V in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/radiographic axSpA who are bDMARD-naïve; COAST-W in patients with AS/radiographic axSpA who previously had an inadequate response or were intolerant to TNF inhibitors; and COAST-X in patients with non-radiographic axSpA who are bDMARD-naïve. Patients may enroll into a long-term extension study after completion of any of the registration studies to receive ixekizumab treatment for up to an additional two years (COAST-Y).

Roche is the only provider of a fully automated brightfield Dual ISH solution for the detection of HER2 amplification. With the new VENTANA HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assay, Roche provides an improved brightfield assay that is fully automated on the BenchMark IHC/ISH instruments. The assay provides clear results to pathology labs more quickly, allowing clinicians to make treatment decisions earlier.
As a global leader in breast cancer diagnostics, Roche provides a comprehensive menu of both diagnostic and predictive assays, including the VENTANA HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody that is indicated as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom Herceptin treatment is considered.

About Herceptin (trastuzumab)
Herceptin® is a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target and block the function of the HER2 receptor, a protein found on the outside of many normal cells and in high quantities on the outside of cancer cells in HER2-positive cancers. Herceptin binds to a specific section of the HER2 protein, inhibiting the signals it sends that encourage tumour cell growth, while also calling on the body’s immune system to attack the cancer cells.
Since it was first approved in 1998, Herceptin has been used to treat over two million patients worldwide, diagnosed with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. It has also become the backbone of other innovative treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer, which have continued to improve the outcomes of patients with this otherwise aggressive disease. In addition to the standard intravenous formulation, Herceptin is available in a subcutaneous (SC) formulation which was first approved in 2013. Herceptin SC represents a significant step forward in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer as it offers patients a faster, more convenient and less painful way to receive treatment with Herceptin.

 The P-III PROMISE 1 & 2 studies result: met 1EPs & 2Eps; @12wks. change in monthly migraine days; responder rates at least 75% & 50%; reduction in migraine prevalence days 1-28, at least 50%,75%,100%; change in mean monthly acute migraine medication days; reductions in patient-reported impact scores on the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6)
 Eptinezumab (IV, q12w) is a mAb targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) indicated for the prevention of migraine. Alder has submitted its BLA on Feb 21,2019 with expected PDUFA action date within 74 days post submission and plans to launch it in Q1’20","BOTHELL, Wash., April 22, 2019 Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALDR), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of migraine, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for eptinezumab. Eptinezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb), administered intravenously, for migraine prevention targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and is Alder’s lead commercial candidate. The company submitted its BLA on February 21, 2019 and continues to expect to receive a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date within 74 days following the submission. If the FDA grants approval of eptinezumab, Alder anticipates a Q1 2020 commercial launch.

“Migraine is far more than a headache, it’s a serious neurological disease with a debilitating impact to patients that can lead to other issues including depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances,” said Bob Azelby, Alder’s president and chief executive officer. “The FDA’s acceptance of our BLA is an important milestone, and the company remains focused on supporting the application review for the first quarterly infusion therapy for patients suffering from episodic and chronic migraine. In the meantime, we continue to make substantial progress scaling our medical, manufacturing and commercial infrastructure to enable a successful launch of eptinezumab for migraine patients, if approved.“
Eptinezumab has been evaluated in several global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess its safety and efficacy in both chronic and episodic migraine prevention. The BLA includes, and is supported by, positive data from Alder’s PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2 Phase 3 clinical trials, an open-label safety study, a pharmacokinetic (PK) comparability study and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) data packages. The safety profile of eptinezumab was similar to placebo across all treatment arms in the Phase 3 studies. The most common adverse events across the studies was nasopharyngitis. Top-line results from the PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2 Phase 3 clinical trials were presented at the American Association of Neurology (AAN) and American Headache Society (AHS) meetings in the second quarter of 2018 and are planned for publication in 2019.
About Eptinezumab PROMISE Clinical Trial Program
PROMISE 1 (PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous eptinezumab Safety and Efficacy 1) was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for episodic migraine prevention. In the study, patients were randomized and 888 received eptinezumab (300 mg, 100 mg or 30 mg) or placebo, administered by infusion once every 12 weeks. To be eligible for the trial, patients must have experienced at most 14 headache days per month, of which at least four met the criteria for migraine. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over the 12-week treatment period. Secondary study endpoints include at least 75 percent and at least 50 percent responder rates assessed through 12 weeks, and proportion of patients experiencing migraine on the day following administration. In June 2017, Alder announced that eptinezumab met the primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints in PROMISE 1.
PROMISE 2 (PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for chronic migraine prevention. In the study, patients were randomized and 1,072 received eptinezumab (300 mg or 100 mg) or placebo, administered by infusion once every 12 weeks. To be eligible for the trial, patients must have experienced at least 15 headache days per month, of which at least eight met the criteria for migraine. Patients that participated in the trial had an average of 16.1 migraine days per month at baseline. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over the 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Secondary study endpoints included proportion of patients experiencing migraine on the day following administration and reduction of migraine prevalence days 1-28, reduction of at least 50%, 75%, and 100% from baseline in mean monthly migraine days assessed through 12 weeks, change from baseline in mean monthly acute migraine-specific medication days, and reductions from baseline in patient-reported impact scores on the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). In January 2018, Alder announced that eptinezumab met the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints in PROMISE 2.

12947,NuVasive Reports Results of Cohere Porous PEEK Implants for Degenerative Cervical Disc,Clinical Study Demonstrates NuVasive Cohere Porous PEEK Spinal Interbody Promotes Improved Early Outcomes Over Structural Allograft And Smooth PEEK,"The study involves assessing of Cohere Porous PEEK vs structural allograft/smooth PEEK in 167 patients with degenerative cervical disc underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF)
 The study resulted in clinical improvement relative to preoperative (pre-op) scores, @postoperative (post-op) improvements in NDI scores and pain by 6wks. vs 3mos., improvement over baseline by 2wks. vs 6wks., improvement was maintained up to 1yr
 Cohere Porous PEEK is manufactured through extrusion process providing 3D porous architecture and is designed to promote bone growth while maintaining the biomechanical and imaging properties of PEEK","SAN DIEGO, April 22, 2019 NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA), the leader in spine technology innovation, focused on transforming spine surgery with minimally disruptive, procedurally integrated solutions, today announced the results of the study “Early Clinical Outcomes Comparing Porous PEEK, Smooth PEEK, and Structural Allograft Interbody Devices for Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion,” published online in the Journal of Spine & Neurosurgery, which concludes that the NuVasive proprietary Cohere® Porous polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implant demonstrates a clear benefit in promoting improved early outcomes over structural allograft and smooth PEEK in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures.
 
In the study, 167 patients presenting with degenerative cervical disc disease underwent ACDF using Cohere Porous PEEK™, structural allograft or smooth PEEK in the interbody space. Patients receiving Cohere exhibited significant clinical improvements relative to preoperative (pre-op) scores, better outcomes than alternative treatments as early as six weeks and sustained improvements relative to other treatments through 12-months post-op.
As cited in the study’s results, patients who were treated with Cohere Porous PEEK interbody fusion devices achieved clear improvements in neck disability index (NDI) scores and pain by six-weeks post-op, while patients treated with smooth PEEK showed significant improvements starting at three-months post-op. While structural allograft patients began to improve over baseline by six weeks, Porous PEEK patients showed statistically significant improvements over baseline by two weeks and significantly greater improvements than allograft and smooth PEEK patients by six-weeks post-op. This early improvement was maintained at all reported post-op time points out to one-year post-op.
“This is the first comparative study between NuVasive’s Cohere Porous PEEK, smooth PEEK and allograft interbody spacers in ACDF, and it was found that patients treated with a Porous PEEK implant experienced incrementally improved early clinical improvements, which were sustained through the course of the study,” said Kyle Malone, senior director of Medical Affairs at NuVasive. “Studies like this both corroborate the preclinical data as well as reaffirm NuVasive’s commitment to clinical research and the necessity of having this as part of the product development process so we continually offer surgeons the best, most clinically proven technologies for their patients.”
Cohere Porous PEEK provides a unique three-dimensional porous architecture designed to elicit and encourage bone in-growth1 and stabilization without compromising implant strength or radiolucency. NuVasive incorporated the proprietary technology, which is validated with more than 10 years of scientific research, after acquiring Vertera Spine in September 2017.

12961,BAROnova's TransPyloric Shuttle Device Receives FDA's Approval for the Treatment of Obesity in Adults,BAROnova Announces FDA Approval of the TransPyloric Shuttle (TPS) Device,"The approval is based on ENDObesity II study results assessing TransPyloric Shuttle (TPS) vs sham in 302 patients suffering from obesity with a BMI of 30-40 kg/m2 in 9 centers across the US
 The ENDObesity II study results: @12mos. loss 3.4x weight (9.5% vs 2.8%); weight loss>10%of body wt. (40% vs 14%); 67% loss >5% of body wt.; improvement in BP, cardiometabolic risk factors & QoL
 The TransPyloric Shuttle is a device made up of solid silicone involves delayed gastric emptying which results in weight reduction and is designed to be delivered & retrieved endoscopically to reside in the stomach for 1 year","SAN CARLOS, Calif., April 23, 2019 – BAROnova, Inc., a medical device company focused on the development of first-in-class non-surgical solutions for the treatment of obesity, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the TransPyloric Shuttle® (TPS®) Device, a non-surgical weight loss solution for adult individuals suffering from obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 40 kg/m2. The device is approved for up to 12 months of treatment, during which time patients undergo lifestyle modification counseling to help develop and maintain healthier habits.
The TPS device is delivered and retrieved endoscopically and relies on its mechanical structure to maintain its shape to keep it in the stomach as opposed to traditional inflatable intragastric balloons. The constructed TPS is the size of a small peach (~5.6 cm in diameter), 85-90% smaller than the fluid-filled balloons. Once in stomach, it is designed to slow the passage of food so patients feel full sooner and stay full longer. The 12-month treatment duration is twice as long as intragastric balloons currently approved in the U.S. The longer treatment duration potentially allows patients the opportunity to achieve more durable lifestyle changes and health benefits.
“Those of us who participated in the pivotal trial have the firsthand experience with the TPS device and were pleased with its patient outcomes. In addition to the clinically meaningful weight loss seen in the study group who received the device, we also observed cardio-metabolic improvements in that cohort. We are excited to see that the device is approved by the FDA and look forward to using it in our clinical practice,” said Dr. Richard Rothstein, the Joseph M. Huber Professor and Chair of Medicine for the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, and the lead investigator for the ENDObesity II study.
Obesity is one of the biggest drivers of the healthcare costs in the U.S., currently estimated as much as $210 billion annually. Effectively treating this condition will have a substantial impact on controlling ever-increasing healthcare costs.
“The vast majority of patients with obesity are left untreated today. Endoscopically delivered intragastric devices can help close the obesity treatment gap and offer alternative options for qualified patients who are not eligible, or unwilling, to undergo metabolic and bariatric surgery. The TPS device design addresses some of the limitations with the first-generation intragastric devices and offers longer treatment duration which is clinically attractive,” commented Dr. Wayne English, Associate Professor of Surgery, Clinical Trial Research Director at Vanderbilt University Weight Loss Center, and a principal investigator for the ENDObesity II study.
“FDA approval is a significant milestone for the company,” said Lian Cunningham, M.D, PhD, Senior Vice President of Clinical Affairs and Regulatory Affairs of BAROnova Inc. “The TPS device is unique in its treatment efficacy and duration. Further validation of potential comorbidity benefits, like cardiometabolic improvement observed in the pivotal study, during the post-market phase may translate to important advantages in achieving healthcare coverage for the TPS device in the future. We look forward to bringing this new technology to patients and physicians.”
The approval of the TPS is based on data from its pivotal trial (ENDObesity®II study), a randomized, double-blind, and sham-controlled study that enrolled 302 patients from nine investigational centers across the United States. Patients treated with the TPS device on average lost 3.4x more weight when compared to the sham-control group (9.5% for the TPS group and 2.8% for the Control, p<0.0001) at the 12-month follow up. Approximately 67% of people treated with TPS lost 5% or more of their body weight, exceeding the study endpoint target of 50% (p<0.0001). Forty percent (40%) of people treated with TPS lost 10% or more weight (vs. 14% in sham-treated controls). A weight loss of 5% or more is considered clinically meaningful for achieving important health benefits. Improvements in blood pressure and other cardiometabolic risk factors as well as quality of life were also observed with TPS treatment. The most common adverse events among people treated with the TPS device were gastrointestinal events, such as stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia, as expected with an intragastric device designed to treat obesity through delayed gastric emptying.
About Obesity
Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) >30 kg/m2. Individuals with obesity are at increased risk of developing over 70 comorbid conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a worldwide epidemic that has placed a major burden on healthcare systems globally. There are currently over 75 million adults in the United States with a BMI between 30-40 kg/m2 and over 600 million adults worldwide who are candidates for a safe and effective non-surgical therapy.
About the TransPyloric Shuttle
The TransPyloric Shuttle is a novel device that is designed to be inserted and removed trans-orally using standard endoscopic techniques. It is mechanically constructed using solid silicone components and is not subject to inflation or deflation risks. The TPS/TPS Delivery Device is indicated for weight reduction in adult patients with obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35.0-40.0 kg/m2 or a BMI of 30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2 with one or more obesity-related comorbid conditions and is intended to be used in conjunction with a diet and behavior modification program. The device is intended to reside in the stomach for 12 months. The TransPyloric Shuttle’s primary mechanism of action is delayed gastric emptying which is a known mechanism of weight loss.

SAN DIEGO and PENNINGTON, N.J., April 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — OncoSec Medical Incorporated (OncoSec) (NASDAQ:ONCS), a company developing intratumoral cancer immunotherapies, today announced a triple combination clinical trial of OncoSec’s TAVO™, epacadostat, and KEYTRUDA® in patients with squamous cell carcinoma head and neck (SCCHN) cancer. This study, the “TRIFECTA” study, will be conducted by the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.
TRIFECTA, formally entitled, “The Trifecta Study: Optimizing Antitumor Immunity Using Tavokinogene Telseplasmid with Electroporation, Pembrolizumab, and Epacadostat in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck,” will evaluate the combination use of OncoSec’s TAVO™ (intratumoral IL-12 tavokinogene telseplasmid), epacadostat (IDO inhibitor), and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody) in patients with SCCHN cancer.
TRIFECTA will be an investigator-initiated clinical trial by UCSF otolaryngologist, Dr. Chase Heaton, to determine whether the triple combination can increase the overall response rate (ORR) in SCCHN compared with historical data for KEYTRUDA® as a monotherapy. The costs of this clinical trial will be shared with others and will require minimal financial commitment from OncoSec.
The response rate in patients with unresectable SCCHN is very low when treated with anti-PD1 antibodies as a monotherapy, with only 13-16%1 2 durable remissions. Treatment failures are more common in patients whose tumors either lack anti-tumor immune cells or have an overabundance of regulatory immune cells that suppress effective anti-tumor immune responses. TAVO™ has previously demonstrated the ability to reverse this type of anti-PD-1 resistance in patients with metastatic melanoma.
“Effective anticancer immune responses require three steps, including immune priming and tumor infiltration with T cells; activation of partially exhausted TILs; and selective modulation of T cell populations to maximize the ratio of effector to regulatory immune cells,” said Dr. Alain Algazi, Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at UCSF and Clinical Strategic Advisor to OncoSec. “Based on this framework, we hypothesize that the combination of TAVO’s tumor infiltration mechanism, with pembrolizumab’s TIL technology and epacadostat’s T cell modulating capabilities will substantially increase the ORR to pembrolizumab in patients with SCCHN and that the combination will be well tolerated in this population.”
TRIFECTA is a single-arm open-label clinical trial in which 35 evaluable patients will receive TAVO™, pembrolizumab, and epacadostat. The primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1 and will be compared to historical data for pembrolizumab monotherapy in SCCHN and to existing data regarding the combination of pembrolizumab and epacadostat.
Melanoma patients in the anti-PD-1 refractory setting have found renewed clinical responses with the combination of KEYTRUDA® with TAVO™ in the KEYNOTE-695 trial. TAVO’s mechanism of action may also enhance the activity of epacadostat as expression of IDO is driven by IFN-g, which, in TAVO-treated patients may create a broader target and therefore opportunity to limit this suppressive IDO axis. Due to its favorable safety profile, clinical activity and ability to trigger adaptive resistance (increases in both IDO and PD-L1 expression) via a robust IFN-g response, TAVO™ is a strong backbone for a combination strategy with epacadostat and Merck’s anti-PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab.
“Supporting this investigator-initiated clinical is a very cost-effective way to learn if the three-way combination of TAVO™, epacadostat and pembrolizumab can significantly improve the historical anti-PD-1 monotherapy durable remission response rate of 13-16%,” said Daniel O’Connor, President and Chief Executive Officer of OncoSec. “Studies such as these continue to build on the body of clinical evidence in support of TAVO™ in a variety of combination therapies. We believe it is important to support investigator led studies such as this one, especially considering the prestige of the medical institution and the oncologists involved.”
About OncoSec Medical Incorporated
OncoSec is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing cytokine-based intratumoral immunotherapies to stimulate the body’s immune system to target and attack cancer. OncoSec’s lead immunotherapy platform – TAVO™ (tavokinogene telseplasmid) – enables the intratumoral delivery of DNA-based interleukin-12 (IL-12), a naturally occurring protein with immune-stimulating functions. The technology, which employs electroporation, is designed to produce a controlled, localized expression of IL-12 in the tumor microenvironment, enabling the immune system to target and attack tumors throughout the body. OncoSec has built a deep and diverse clinical pipeline utilizing TAVO™ as a potential treatment for multiple cancer indications either as a monotherapy or in combination with leading checkpoint inhibitors; with the latter potentially enabling OncoSec to address a great unmet medical need in oncology: anti-PD-1 non-responders. Results from recently completed clinical studies of TAVO™ have demonstrated a local immune response, and subsequently, a systemic effect as either a monotherapy or combination treatment approach. In addition to TAVO™, OncoSec is identifying and developing new DNA-encoded therapeutic candidates and tumor indications for use with its ImmunoPulse® platform.

 The P-III ultIMMa-1 & ultIMMa-2 result: @16 wks. PASI 90 (75% vs 5% & 2%); PASI 100 (36% & 51% vs 0% & 2%); @52wks. PASI 90 (82% & 81% vs 56% & 60%); @16 wks. integrated results showed maintenance of PASI 90 and PASI 100 for 1yr. (88% & 80%) respectively
 Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) is an IL-23 inhibitor that works by binding to p19 subunit, administered four doses/yr. after two initial doses and has received MHLW approval for plaque psoriasis, Health Canada approval and EMA’s CHMP positive opinion for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis with its expected regulatory decision in EU and availability in the US in H1’19 & May’19 respectively","Approval based on clinical trials showing people treated with SKYRIZI™ (risankizumab-rzaa) every 12 weeks – four doses a year after two initial doses – achieved high levels of durable skin clearance at 16 weeks and maintained this response at one year[1-3]
– At 16 weeks after two doses, 75 percent of people treated with SKYRIZI achieved 90 percent skin clearance (PASI 90)[1-3]
– At one year, most people (82 and 81 percent) treated with SKYRIZI achieved PASI 90, with the majority (56 and 60 percent) achieving completely clear skin (PASI 100)[1]
– SKYRIZI is expected to be available in the U.S. in early May
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., April 23, 2019 /- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved SKYRIZI™ (risankizumab-rzaa), an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.3 In clinical trials, SKYRIZI produced high rates of durable skin clearance – most people (82 and 81 percent) treated with SKYRIZI achieved 90 percent skin clearance (PASI 90) at one year, with the majority (56 and 60 percent) achieving complete skin clearance (PASI 100).1
“The complex nature of psoriasis and the variability or loss of treatment response over time can prevent some patients from achieving their treatment goals,” said Kenneth B. Gordon, M.D., a principal investigator for the ultIMMa-1 pivotal trial and professor and chair of dermatology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. “In clinical trials, risankizumab demonstrated high levels of skin clearance that persisted through one year. I’m pleased the dermatology community now has a new option that can help patients achieve and maintain a high level of treatment response.”
The recommended dose for SKYRIZI is 150mg – administered by two subcutaneous injections every 12 weeks following two initiation doses at week 0 and 4. SKYRIZI can be administered in-office or by self-injection after training.3
“The approval of SKYRIZI is an important advance in the treatment of adults with plaque psoriasis who are seeking high levels of durable skin clearance that can be maintained over time,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “SKYRIZI builds on AbbVie’s legacy in immunology, expanding our portfolio to help meet the evolving needs in psoriatic disease and reinforcing our continued pursuit of innovations that improve care for people living with immune-mediated conditions.”
Affecting 7.5 million Americans, psoriasis is the most prevalent autoimmune disease in the U.S.4 It is characterized by over activation of the immune system and widespread inflammation that causes painful, itchy plaques anywhere on the skin.5 People with psoriasis also experience a significant emotional, psychological and social burden that can negatively impact their quality of life.4
“People living with plaque psoriasis can be profoundly impacted by their disease both physically and emotionally,” said Stacie Bell, Ph.D., vice president of research and medical affairs, National Psoriasis Foundation. “The approval of a new therapy represents an important step forward in the treatment of psoriasis, offering dermatologists another option to help patients achieve their treatment goals.”
The approval of SKYRIZI is supported by results from AbbVie’s global Phase 3 psoriasis program, which assessed the safety and efficacy of SKYRIZI in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis across four randomized, placebo and/or active-controlled pivotal studies: ultIMMa-1, ultIMMa-2, IMMhance and IMMvent. The co-primary endpoints of these studies were Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and static Physician Global Assessment [sPGA] score of clear or almost clear [sPGA 0/1] at 16 weeks versus placebo.1-3,6
Highlights across the pivotal studies include:1,3
In ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 at 16 weeks, PASI 90 was achieved in 75 percent of people treated with SKYRIZI, compared to 5 and 2 percent receiving placebo, respectively (p<0.001). PASI 100 was achieved in 36 and 51 percent of people treated with SKYRIZI, compared to 0 and 2 percent receiving placebo, respectively (p<0.001).
In ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 at one year (52 weeks), 82 and 81 percent of people treated with SKYRIZI achieved PASI 90, and 56 and 60 percent achieved PASI 100, respectively (p<0.001).
An integrated analysis of ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 showed most people treated with SKYRIZI who achieved PASI 90 and PASI 100 at week 16 maintained this response at one year (88 and 80 percent, respectively).
The frequency of adverse events through one year was similar to events observed during the first 16 weeks. The most common adverse events associated with SKYRIZI included upper respiratory infections (13 percent), headache (3.5 percent), fatigue (2.5 percent), injection site reactions (1.5 percent) and tinea infections (1.1 percent). SKYRIZI requires an initial evaluation for tuberculosis (TB) prior to starting treatment, and patients are instructed to report signs and symptoms of infection.3
More information about the psoriasis clinical program can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02684370, NCT02684357, NCT02672852, NCT02694523).
SKYRIZI is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization of SKYRIZI globally.
AbbVie recently received approval of SKYRIZI from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as from Health Canada for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. AbbVie also received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommending marketing authorization for SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy, with a regulatory decision in Europeexpected in the first half of this year.

 Losmapimod is a selective p38α/β mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, evaluated in 3,500 candidates for multiple indication in 24 clinical studies","Fulcrum plans to launch a Phase 2b clinical trial in FSHD in mid-2019
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 23, 2019 – Fulcrum Therapeutics, a biotechnology company focused on
discovering and developing therapies to rebalance gene expression, today announced an exclusive
worldwide license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for development and commercialization of the
investigational drug losmapimod. Fulcrum intends to advance losmapimod into a Phase 2b trial in the
rare and devastating genetic disease facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), for which there
are currently no approved treatments.
Under the terms of the agreement, as payment for the license, GSK received shares of Fulcrum
preferred stock representing a high single-digit ownership percentage of the company on a fully diluted
basis, and will be eligible to receive future milestone payments and royalties. Fulcrum obtained all
worldwide development and commercialization rights for losmapimod, as well as existing drug
substance and drug product materials for use in its clinical trials. Fulcrum also received a right of
reference to INDs filed with the FDA relating to losmapimod and an exclusive license to all related
patents and data, which build on Fulcrum-generated intellectual property.
“Losmapimod is a foundational clinical asset for Fulcrum that has the potential to become the first
approved therapy that targets the root cause of FSHD. Fulcrum believes losmapimod has the potential
to slow or halt the progressive muscle weakness that characterizes the condition, which would
significantly improve patients’ quality of life,” said Robert J. Gould, Ph.D., Fulcrum’s president and chief
executive officer. “The agreement shows confidence in our unique approach to rebalancing gene
expression in severe genetically defined disorders. We will work urgently to advance the compound
through the clinic.”
Fulcrum’s proprietary product engine identified inhibitors of p38/ mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK) as powerful inhibitors of DUX4 expression. DUX4 is the gene that is the root cause of FSHD, a
progressive muscle wasting disorder. Losmapimod is a selective p38/ MAPK inhibitor that GSK has
tested extensively in clinical trials, but never in muscular dystrophies. Fulcrum’s novel insight into the
DUX4 regulatory pathway led the team to review existing p38/ MAPK inhibitors, and Fulcrum
identified losmapimod as a compound with the potential to address the root cause of FSHD by
decreasing DUX4 expression.
GSK evaluated losmapimod in more than 3,500 healthy volunteers and patients in 24 clinical trials across
multiple indications, including several Phase 2 trials and a Phase 3 trial in acute coronary syndrome. The
data provide evidence that losmapimod is a well-tolerated agent. Fulcrum has conducted preclinical
testing of losmapimod in patient-derived cell models and observed precise and potent downregulation
of DUX4 expression and restoration of a healthy muscle phenotype without an effect on myogenesis.
Fulcrum has developed an extensive clinical trial network of physicians working on FSHD. An ongoing
natural history study of the disease is informing the clinical development plan. Fulcrum expects to
initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial of losmapimod in patients with FSHD at multiple clinical sites in the U.S.
and Europe in mid-2019.
About FSHD
FSHD, one of the most common muscular dystrophies, is a progressive, degenerative and profoundly
disabling disorder estimated to affect about 1 in 8,333 to 1 in 20,000 people globally. There are no
approved treatments. Symptoms typically arise in adulthood, often beginning with muscle weakness in
the face, leading to an inability to smile. The weakness progresses to the upper body and advances to
the lower limbs, leaving many patients unable to lift their arms above shoulder level or to rise from a
sitting position. People with FSHD often have difficulty performing daily tasks on their own and may
experience severe fatigue and pain. FSHD is caused by a single gene, DUX4, which is normally switched
off at the earliest stages of embryonic development. Patients with FSHD have a mutation that causes the
gene to remain “on” and to continue producing a protein toxic to muscle tissue.
About Losmapimod
Losmapimod is a selective p38/ mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor initially developed
by GlaxoSmithKline and in-licensed by Fulcrum Therapeutics. Fulcrum identified the compound as a
potent regulator of the expression of the DUX4 gene, which causes FSHD. Losmapimod has been
evaluated in more than 3,500 healthy volunteers and patients in 24 clinical trials across multiple
indications, including in several Phase 2 trials and a Phase 3 trial. It has been shown to be generally welltolerated.
About Fulcrum Therapeutics

 SAFEbody technology produces masked ADCs that binds with an antigen in tumor tissues only enhancing the specificity of an ADC with minimization in off-target toxicity on healthy cells","ADC Therapeutics to develop next-generation masked antibody drug conjugates (ADCs),
incorporating Adagene’s SAFEbody™ technology, with potential utility across multiple tumor
types
Collaboration enables focus on targets in which healthy tissue expression precludes
development of ADCs incorporating traditional antibodies
Lausanne, Switzerland and Suzhou, China, April 24, 2019 – ADC Therapeutics, an oncology drug
discovery and development company that specializes in the development of proprietary antibody
drug conjugates (ADCs), and Adagene Inc., an antibody engineering and discovery company, today
announced that they have entered into a discovery collaboration and license agreement. ADC
Therapeutics will use Adagene’s SAFEbody™ technology to generate a masked antibody that will be
combined with ADC Therapeutics’ pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) cytotoxic payload technology for the
development of a novel ADC against a solid tumor target.
Adagene has developed the SAFEbody technology to produce masked antibodies that are activated
to bind to an antigen in the tumor microenvironment by factors present in tumor tissues but not in
healthy tissues. This enables enhanced specificity for targeting of an ADC and minimizes off-target
toxicity on healthy cells, potentially enhancing the therapeutic index of the ADC.
“The SAFEbody technology requires specific conditions within the tumor microenvironment to
unleash the ADC’s full therapeutic potential,” said Patrick van Berkel, Senior Vice President of
Research and Development at ADC Therapeutics. “Combining a SAFEbody with highly potent PBDbased payloads will allow us to develop potent new tumor-specific ADCs that depend on the unique
conditions in the local tumor microenvironment for full activation.”
ADC Therapeutics has entered into the agreement with Adagene for one exclusive target, with the
option to leverage SAFEbody technology for one additional exclusive target. Both potential programs
will focus on targets in which healthy tissue expression does not permit development of ADCs
incorporating traditional antibodies.
Under the terms of the agreement, Adagene will receive research funding for the discovery phase.
Upon success of the discovery collaboration, Adagene will receive an upfront payment, development
and commercial milestone payments, and royalties on net sales. ADC Therapeutics has granted
Adagene certain commercial rights for Greater China. No other financial terms were disclosed.
“We are very pleased to partner our SAFEbody technology with ADC Therapeutics,” said Peter Luo,
Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Adagene. “Adagene’s innovative protein engineering
ability enables us to tailor-make products to limit their on-target off-tumor toxicity. Together with
ADC Therapeutics’ experience in developing ADCs with highly potent PBD payloads, we have the
potential to unlock new treatment options for patients with unmet medical needs.”
“We’re excited to collaborate with Adagene to work toward the next generation of masked ADCs,”
said Chris Martin, Chief Executive Officer at ADC Therapeutics. “As we continue evaluating our potent
ADCs in ongoing clinical trials, we look forward to exploring how Adagene’s SAFEbody technology
2
incorporated in our ADCs may enable us to further improve anti-tumor activity while minimizing side
effects.”

13326,Eli Lilly Facilitates the Withdrawal of Lartruvo (olaratumab) from the Global Market for Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma,Lilly to Establish an Access Program for Patients as it Prepares to Withdraw Lartruvo from the Global Market,"The withdrawal follows the failure of P-III ANNOUNCE study assessing Lartruvo (olaratumab) + doxorubicin followed by Lartruvo as monothx vs doxorubicin + PBO followed by PBO in patients with advanced or metastatic STS, resulted with no improvement in survival of patients
 Lilly to establish a program ensuring current patients access to Lartruvo with limited interruption post withdrawal, agrees to continue in consultation with physician and knowing results of the ANNOUNCE study subject to local regulations, without enrolling any new patient in trial
 Lartruvo (olaratumab) is an Ab targeting PDGFR-α preventing the activation of the receptor possessing in-vitro and in-vivo anti-tumor activity against sarcoma cell lines and disrupted the PDGFR-α signaling pathway in in-vivo tumors","Lilly is working to ensure current patients access to Lartruvo with limited interruption after it is withdrawn from the market

INDIANAPOLIS, April 25, 2019 – Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) today announced that the company has been working to facilitate the withdrawal of Lartruvo® (olaratumab) from the market for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Lilly’s actions to withdraw Lartruvo from the market follow the failure of the Phase 3 ANNOUNCE clinical trial, in which Lartruvo did not improve survival for patients. Lilly is establishing a program to ensure current patients will have access to Lartruvo with limited interruption after it is withdrawn from the market. The program will be established as allowed by local country regulations.
Lilly is working to ensure that patients who are currently receiving Lartruvo may, in consultation with their physician, continue their course of therapy if they have been informed of the risks of Lartruvo and the results of the ANNOUNCE study and wish to continue, subject to local laws and regulations. No new patients should receive Lartruvo outside of participation in ongoing clinical trials.
Lilly also is working to establish a program to allow patients who are currently receiving Lartruvo to continue treatment with limited interruption after Lartruvo is withdrawn from the market, subject to local laws and regulations. More information regarding this program will be provided directly to healthcare professionals in the coming weeks.
“Lilly wants to ensure that patients and physicians feel supported during this important time,” said Anne White, president, Lilly Oncology. “Advanced soft tissue sarcoma is a rare and difficult-to-treat cancer. Establishing this program will give patients who are currently taking Lartruvo the opportunity to continue their treatment program uninterrupted.”
Lilly plans to present the ANNOUNCE data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2019 annual meeting and will publish the results in a medical journal.
About Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Sarcomas are a diverse and relatively rare type of cancer that usually develop in the connective tissue of the body, which include fat, blood vessels, nerves, bones, muscles, deep skin tissues and cartilage. Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a complex disease with multiple subtypes, making it hard to diagnose and difficult to treat. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2019, an estimated 12,750 new STS cases will be diagnosed, and more than 5,000 people will not survive their disease in the U.S. alone. For decades, there have been no first-line therapeutic advancements for STS that have improved overall survival (OS). 
About LARTRUVO® (olaratumab)
LARTRUVO is a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) blocking antibody that specifically binds PDGFR-α and prevents receptor activation. LARTRUVO exhibits in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity against selected sarcoma cell lines and disrupted the PDGFR-α signaling pathway in in vivo tumor implant models.
About the ANNOUNCE Trial
ANNOUNCE was a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study of LARTRUVO in combination with doxorubicin, followed by LARTRUVO monotherapy, versus doxorubicin plus placebo followed by placebo, in patients with advanced or metastatic STS. The two primary endpoints were OS in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and OS in the leiomyosarcoma (LMS) sub-population. Patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic STS not amenable to curative treatment were enrolled and were eligible with any prior number of treatment regimens, provided they had not previously received treatment with an anthracycline.
LARTRUVO was administered at a loading dose of 20 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and 15 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of all subsequent cycles in combination with doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each cycle. Placebo was administered in combination with doxorubicin for 8 cycles. LARTRUVO was continued as monotherapy until disease progression.
Key secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and patient-reported outcomes.
INDICATION
LARTRUVO is indicated, in combination with doxorubicin, for the treatment of adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regimen is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery.
This indication was approved under Accelerated Approval. Continued approval for this indication was contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR LARTRUVO
Warnings and Precautions
Infusion-Related Reactions
Infusion-related reactions (IRR) occurred in 70 (14%) of 485 patients who received at least one dose of LARTRUVO across clinical trials. For 68 of these 70 patients (97%), the first occurrence of IRR was in the first or second cycle. Grade ≥3 IRR occurred in 11 (2.3%) of 485 patients, with one (0.2%) fatality. Symptoms of IRR included flushing, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, or fever/chills, and in severe cases symptoms manifested as severe hypotension, anaphylactic shock, or cardiac arrest. Infusion-related reactions required permanent discontinuation in 2.3% of patients and interruption of infusion in 10% of patients. All 59 patients with Grade 1 or 2 IRR resumed LARTRUVO; 12 (20%) of these patients had a Grade 1 or 2 IRR with rechallenge. The incidence of IRR in the overall safety database (N = 485) was similar (18% versus 12%) between those who did (56%) and those who did not (44%) receive premedication. Monitor patients during and following LARTRUVO infusion for signs and symptoms of IRR in a setting with available resuscitation equipment. Immediately and permanently discontinue LARTRUVO for Grade 3 or 4 IRR.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, LARTRUVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal knockout models link disruption of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) signaling to adverse effects on embryo-fetal development. Administration of an anti-murine PDGFR-α antibody to pregnant mice during organogenesis caused malformations and skeletal variations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LARTRUVO and for 3 months after the last dose.
Most Common Adverse Reactions/Lab Abnormalities

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (all grades; grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients receiving LARTRUVO plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone were nausea (73% vs 52%; 2% vs 3%), fatigue (69% vs 69%; 9% vs 3%), musculoskeletal pain (64% vs 25%; 8% vs 2%), mucositis (53% vs 35%; 3% vs 5%), alopecia (52% vs 40%; 0% vs 0%), vomiting (45% vs 19%; 0% vs 0%), diarrhea (34% vs 23%; 3% vs 0%) decreased appetite (31% vs 20%; 2% vs 0%), abdominal pain (23% vs 14%; 3% vs 0%), neuropathy (22% vs 11%; 0% vs 0%), and headache (20% vs 9%; 0% vs 0%).
The most common laboratory abnormalities (all grades; grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients receiving LARTRUVO plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone were lymphopenia (77% vs 73%; 44% vs 37%), neutropenia (65% vs 63%; 48% vs 38%) and thrombocytopenia (63% vs 44%; 6% vs 11%), hyperglycemia (52% vs 28%; 2% vs 3%), elevated aPTT (33% vs 13%; 5% vs 0%), hypokalemia (21% vs 15%; 8% vs 3%), and hypophosphatemia (21% vs 7%; 5% vs 3%).
Use in Specific Populations

Lactation: Because of the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with LARTRUVO and for at least 3 months following the last dose.

13397,Salix (Bausch Health) Signs an Exclusive License Agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe for its MT-1303 (amiselimod),Salix Enters Into Exclusive License Agreement With Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma To Develop And Commercialize Late Stage Investigational S1P Modulator For The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"MTPC to receive upfront, development & regulatory milestones and royalties on sales. Bausch Health to get exclusive WW rights to develop & commercialize MT-1303 (Ex-Japan & few other countries in Asia) in all fields (Ex. neurology, rheumatology and certain rare dermatology diseases)
 Bausch plans to initiate the development of MTPC’s MT-1303 (amiselimod) in ulcerative colitis. MTPC will utilize the clinical data conducted by Bausch for regulatory approval and further commercialize it in Japan and certain other countries
 MT-1303 (amiselimod) targets sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor to retain lymphocytes sequestered in the lymph nodes and is evaluated in clinical studies for multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus across Europe & Japan","Salix Pharmaceuticals (“Salix”), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC) (“Bausch Health”), announced today that its affiliate has entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC) (TSE: 4508) to develop and commercialize MT-1303 (amiselimod), a late-stage oral compound that targets the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor that plays a role in autoimmune diseases, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and ulcerative colitis. 1,2
Approximately 1.6 million Americans currently suffer from IBD and as many as 70,000 new cases of IBD are diagnosed in the United States annually.3 Of the 1.6 million Americans with IBD, about 907,000 of them have ulcerative colitis.4 Beyond conventional therapies such as mesalamines, steroids and systemic immunosuppressive agents, IBD can also be managed through the use of antibody-based biologics.4 While many patients have benefited from these antibody-based therapies, a number of patients do not respond to biologics.5
“For patients living with IBD, amiselimod represents an opportunity to develop an oral, non-immunogenic treatment as an alternative to biologics and other available therapies,”1 said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. “Today’s announcement reflects Salix’s commitment to serving the unmet needs of gastrointestinal patients and to offering health care providers with new treatment options to consider when they are managing patients who suffer from this chronic, life-long condition.”
Under the agreement, MTPC grants Bausch Health exclusive rights to develop and commercialize MT-1303 worldwide, except for Japan and certain other countries in Asia, in all fields, excluding neurology, rheumatology and certain rare dermatology diseases, where MTPC retains the rights. Bausch plans to initiate development of MT-1303 in ulcerative colitis. Under the terms of the license, Bausch Health will pay to MTPC a one-time up-front payment, as well as certain development and regulatory-based milestone payments and sales-based royalties.
About MT-1303(amiselimod）
MT-1303 is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor functional antagonist and, by inhibiting the receptor function of the lymphocyte sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor, retains lymphocytes sequestered in the lymph nodes and prevents them from contributing to autoimmune reactions. 1Due to this mechanism of action, MT-1303 may potentially be useful for various autoimmune diseases. 2 Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma has conducted clinical trials for MT-1303 for multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus in Europe and in Japan. 2,7 Affinity to S1P1, S1P4 and S1P5 receptor subtypes, suggests that MT-1303 could potentially have a more pronounced effect on ulcerative colitis related inflammation than compounds with restricted activity on S1P1 receptor subtype exclusively or combined activity on S1P1 and S1P5. 8

13511,Takeda Files NDA for Cabometyx (cabozantinib) to MHLW for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma in Japan,Exelixis’ Partner Takeda Announces Filing of New Drug Application in Japan for CABOMETYX (Cabozantinib) for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,"The submission is based on METEOR, CABOSUN and Takeda’s bridging study. METEOR & CABOSUN studies result assessing Cabometyx vs everolimus & sunitinib in patients with RCC + prior treated with at least one VEGFR-TKI inhibitor & untreated advanced RCC with intermediate/poor-risk disease respectively
 In Q2’19, Exelixis is expected to receive $10M as milestones from Takeda under a license agreement signed by the companies in H1’17. Additionally, Takeda has an option to co-fund ongoing P-III CheckMate 9ER study assessing cabozantinib + nivolumab vs sunitinib for untreated advanced RCC
 Cabometyx (cabozantinib) is a VEGFR-TKI inhibitor and is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC & HCC previously treated with sorafenib. In 2016, Ipsen acquired exclusive rights to develop & commercialize Cabometyx (Ex the US & Japan) from Exelixis","Regulatory submission triggers $10 million milestone payment toExelixis under collaboration and license agreement with Takeda —

— Submission based on METEOR and CABOSUN trials as well as Takeda bridging study —

ALAMEDA, Calif.– Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced that Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda), its partner responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of cabozantinib in Japan, has applied to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for approval to manufacture and sell CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib) as a treatment for unresectable and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the country. As a result of the submission, Exelixis will receive a $10 million milestone payment from Takeda, anticipated to be received in the second quarter of 2019.
Takeda’s application is based on the results of three clinical trials: METEOR, the Exelixis-sponsored phase 3 pivotal trial of cabozantinib versus everolimus in patients with advanced RCC that experienced disease progression following treatment with at least one prior VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR-TKI); CABOSUN, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology-sponsored phase 2 trial comparing cabozantinib with sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate- or poor-risk disease; and Cabozantinib-2001, a Takeda-sponsored phase 2 trial in 35 Japanese patients with advanced RCC who had progressed after prior VEGFR-TKI therapy. Takeda’s phase 2 trial was the subject of a late-breaking abstract at the 107th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Urological Society on April 18, 2019.
“Takeda has proven to be a very effective partner in cabozantinib’s development program in Japan since the signing of our collaboration and licensing agreement in early 2017,” said Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelixis. “This Japanese regulatory filing is an important milestone on the path toward offering CABOMETYX as a new therapeutic option for patients with unresectable, metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Japan. We congratulate our Takeda colleagues on the filing and look forward to further progress.”
Per the terms of Exelixis and Takeda’s collaboration and license agreement, Exelixis received a $50 millionupfront payment at the time of signing. Following the milestone associated with this regulatory filing, Exelixis will be eligible to receive from Takeda further development, regulatory and first-sale milestone payments of up to $80 million related both to previously treated and previously untreated RCC and previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as additional development, regulatory and first-sale milestones for potential future cabozantinib indications. Exelixis is also eligible for sales revenue milestones and royalties on net sales of cabozantinib in Japan.
Takeda fully funds cabozantinib development activities that are exclusively for the benefit of Japan and is responsible for 20% of the costs associated with global cabozantinib clinical trials, providing the company opts into those trials. As of today, Takeda has opted into and is co-funding CheckMate 9ER, the ongoing phase 3 pivotal trial of cabozantinib plus nivolumab versus sunitinib in previously untreated advanced RCC.
About RCC
The American Cancer Society’s 2019 statistics cite kidney cancer as among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S.1 Clear cell RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults.2 If detected in its early stages, the five-year survival rate for RCC is high; for patients with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC, however, the five-year survival rate is only 12 percent, with no identified cure for the disease.1 Approximately 32,000 patients in the U.S. and 70,000 globally require treatment, and an estimated 15,000 patients in the U.S. each year are in need of a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer.3
The majority of clear cell RCC tumors have lower than normal levels of a protein called von Hippel-Lindau, which leads to higher levels of MET, AXL and VEGF.4,5 These proteins promote tumor angiogenesis (blood vessel growth), growth, invasiveness and metastasis.6,7,8,9 MET and AXL may provide escape pathways that drive resistance to VEGF receptor inhibitors.5,6
About CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib)
In the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC and for the treatment of patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in the European Union and additional countries and regions worldwide. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the United States and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan.

13528,ï»¿Gilead Reports Results of Selonsertib in P-III STELLAR 3 Study for Bridging Fibrosis (F3) due to NASH,Gilead Announces Topline Data From Phase 3 STELLAR-3 Study of Selonsertib in Bridging Fibrosis (F3) Due to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),"The P-III STELLAR 3 study involves assessing of Selonsertib (18mg, 6mg) vs PBO in 802 patients with F3/bridging fibrosis due to NASH in adults aged 18 to 70yrs for 240wks.
 The P-III study results: @48 wks. did not meet its 1EPs; ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without NASH worsening (9.3%, 12.1% vs 13.2%); well tolerated
 Selonsertib (qd, PO) is a signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor and is evaluated in P-II ATLAS study in combination with selonsertib, cilofexor and firsocostat in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH with its expected results in H2’19. In H1’19, P-III study assessing Selonsertib in patients with F4 fibrosis has also failed in meeting its 1EPs","FOSTER CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 25, 2019– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that STELLAR-3, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selonsertib, an investigational, once daily, oral inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), for patients with bridging fibrosis (F3) due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), did not meet the pre-specified week 48 primary endpoint of a ≥ 1-stage histologic improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH.
In the study of 802 enrolled and dosed patients, 9.3 percent of patients treated with selonsertib 18 mg (p=0.42 versus placebo) and 12.1 percent of patients treated with selonsertib 6 mg (p=0.93) achieved a ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis according to the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) classification without worsening of NASH after 48 weeks of treatment, versus 13.2 percent with placebo. Selonsertib was generally well tolerated and safety results were consistent with prior studies.
“While we had hoped for different outcomes from the STELLAR program, we remain focused and committed to developing highly effective treatments for patients living with advanced fibrosis due to NASH. We are actively exploring the STELLAR data and will work with external collaborators like PathAI and insitro, to further our understanding of this complex disease and advance our development programs. We thank the patients and their physicians who participated in the STELLAR program for contributing to these efforts,” said John McHutchison, AO, MD, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development, Gilead Sciences. “We believe that effective therapy for NASH will ultimately require a combination approach that targets distinct pathways involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. In this regard, we look forward to data from the Phase 2 ATLAS combination trial of selonsertib, cilofexor and firsocostat in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH, which will be available later this year.”
Gilead will now work with the Data Monitoring Committee and investigators to conclude the STELLAR-3 study in a manner consistent with the best interests of each patient.
Selonsertib, cilofexor, and firsocostat, alone or in combination, are investigational compounds and are not approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authority. Safety and efficacy have not been established for these agents.
About Selonsertib and the STELLAR-3 Study
Selonsertib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of ASK1, a protein that promotes inflammation, apoptosis (cell death) and fibrosis in settings of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can be increased in many pathological conditions including liver diseases such as NASH.
The STELLAR-3 study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selonsertib in patients with bridging fibrosis (F3) due to NASH. Eligible adults ages 18 to 70 years were randomized to receive selonsertib 18 mg (n=322), selonsertib 6 mg (n=321) or placebo (n=159) for up to 240 weeks, orally once daily. The primary endpoints of the study are a composite of the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis according to the NASH CRN classification without worsening of NASH as defined by the NAFLD activity score (NAS) at week 48 and event-free survival at week 240 as assessed by time to the first clinical event. Secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients who have a ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH at week 240, and the proportion of patients who have NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis at week 48 and week 240. Further information about the clinical study can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
About Gilead’s Clinical Programs in NASH
NASH is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterized by fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver, which can lead to scarring, or fibrosis, that impairs liver function. Individuals with advanced fibrosis are at a significantly higher risk of liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality.
Gilead is advancing multiple novel investigational compounds for the treatment of advanced fibrosis due to NASH, evaluating single-agent and combination therapy approaches against the core pathways associated with NASH – hepatocyte lipotoxicity, inflammation and fibrosis. Investigational compounds in development include the ASK1 inhibitor selonsertib, the selective, non-steroidal FXR agonist, cilofexor, and the ACC inhibitor, firsocostat, which are being studied in the Phase 2 ATLAS trial as single agents and combinations in advanced fibrosis (F3 and F4) due to NASH.

 The collective studies result demonstrated reduction in HbA1c and weight loss with safe & well tolerated data
 Semaglutide (qd) is an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist administered once-daily with its expected approval in the US, the EU and Canada","Bagsværd, Denmark, 26 April 2019 – Novo Nordisk today announced the submission of a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue in a tablet taken once-daily, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes.

The submission is based on the results from 10 PIONEER clinical trials, which included 9,543 adults with type 2 diabetes. In the PIONEER programme, people treated with oral semaglutide demonstrated greater HbA1c reductions and weight loss in all completed head-to-head trials versus sitagliptin, empagliflozin, liraglutide and dulaglutide, at the end of the trials. Across the PIONEER trials, oral semaglutide had a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) class, with the most common adverse event being nausea.

“Achieving glycaemic control remains a challenge for people with type 2 diabetes, and despite availability of several oral treatment options, a high proportion do not achieve target blood sugar levels,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. “We are excited about the regulatory filing of oral semaglutide in Europe, the first GLP-1 receptor agonist in a tablet, as we believe oral semaglutide has the potential to further improve the treatment of adults living with type 2 diabetes.”

13566,ï»¿AstraZeneca and Merck's Lynparza (olaparib) Receive CHMP's Positive Opinion for 1L Maintenance Treatment of BRCA-Mutated Advanced Ovarian Cancer,Lynparza receives positive EU CHMP opinion for 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer,"The positive opinion is based on SOLO-1 P-III study results assessing Lynparza (300mg, bid) as a monothx vs PBO in 391 patients in ratio (2:1) with BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following 1L Pt-based CT
 The study resulted in 70% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death and demonstrated PFS as (60.4% vs 26.9%) in 36 months with no. of patients with event (102 vs 96)
 Lynparza(olaparib) is a PARP inhibitor targeted to block DNA damage response in cells/tumors harboring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR). In Jul,2017 AZ and Merck globally collaborated to co-develop and co-commercialize Lynparza","AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza is the only PARP inhibitor to demonstrate an improvement in progression-free survival for patients in this setting
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency has adopted a positive opinion, recommending Lynparza (olaparib) as a 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer.
The recommendation is for the use of Lynparza tablets as a maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) BRCA1/2-mutated (germline and/or somatic) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology, said: “There remains a significant unmet need in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer as 70% of women globally relapse within the first three years after their initial treatment. The results of SOLO-1 demonstrate the potential of using Lynparza earlier in the treatment pathway as a maintenance therapy, and reinforce the importance of identifying a patient’s BRCA mutation status as soon as they are diagnosed.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Women with advanced ovarian cancer need and deserve new treatment options. In the SOLO-1 trial, Lynparza demonstrated a significant progression-free survival benefit as maintenance treatment for patients with advanced BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer following response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. If approved, this expanded indication could change the way women in Europe with BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer are treated.”
The positive opinion is based on data from the pivotal Phase III SOLO-1 trial which showed that Lynparza reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 70% vs. placebo following response to platinum-based chemotherapy (HR 0.30 [95% CI 0.23-0.41], p<0.001). Of those patients receiving Lynparza, 60.4% remained progression-free at 36 months vs. 26.9% of women in the placebo arm.
Lynparza is currently approved in 64 countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA status. It is approved in the US as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in 38 countries, including the US, countries in the EU and Japan, for germline BRCAm HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU this includes locally advanced breast cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in other jurisdictions for both ovarian cancer and breast cancer.
About SOLO-1
SOLO-1 was a Phase III randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lynparza tablets (300mg twice daily) as maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo, in patients with BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The trial randomised 391 patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who were in complete or partial clinical response following platinum-based chemotherapy.
Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive Lynparza or placebo for up to two years or until disease progression. Patients who had a partial response at two years were permitted to stay on therapy at the investigator’s discretion. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and key secondary endpoints included time to second disease progression or death, time to first subsequent treatment and overall survival.
The data were presented on 21 October 2018 at the Presidential Symposium of the ESMO 2018 Congress in Munich, Germany and published simultaneously online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The SOLO-1 safety profile was in line with that observed in prior clinical trials. The most common adverse events (AEs) ≥ 20% were nausea (77%), fatigue (63%), vomiting (40%), anaemia (39%) and diarrhoea (34%). The most common ≥ Grade 3 AEs were anaemia (22%) and neutropenia (9%). Some 71% of patients on Lynparza remained on the recommended starting dose. Additionally, 88% of patients on Lynparza continued treatment without an AE-related discontinuation.
About ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with a five-year survival rate of 19%.1 In 2018, there were over 295,000 new cases diagnosed and around 185,000 deaths.2 For newly-diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, the primary aim of treatment is to delay progression of the disease for as long as possible and maintain the patient’s quality of life with the intent of achieving complete remission or cure.3,4,5,6
About BRCA mutations
Breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.
About Lynparza
Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.
Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, is approved for advanced ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer and has been used in over 20,000 patients worldwide. On 26 February 2019, AstraZeneca and MSD announced that Lynparza became the first PARP inhibitor to demonstrate benefit in germline BRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer in the Phase III POLO trial.
Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
About the AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

13664,Sanofi and Lexicon's Zynquista (sotagliflozin) Receive EU's MAA to Treat Type-1 Diabetes in Adults,Zynquista now approved in the European Union for treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes,"The authorization is based on inTandem study consisting of three P-III trials assessing sotagliflozin (200/400 mg) vs insulin as monothx in 3000 adults with inadequately controlled T1D
 The study resulted reduction in average blood sugar (HbA1c), body weight, systolic blood pressure, improvement of time in target blood sugar range, patient-reported outcomes within 24 weeks
 Zynquista (sotagliflozin,PO) is an inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2 proteins and is being evaluated in a program of 11 trials for T2D in adults. In Nov,2015 Lexicon and Sanofi collaborated to develop and commercialize sotagliflozin to treat diabetes","PARIS and THE WOODLANDS, TX – April 26, 2019 – The European Commission
has granted marketing authorization for Zynquista (sotagliflozin), developed by
Sanofi and Lexicon. Zynquista is now approved in the European Union, at once-daily
doses of 200 mg and 400 mg, for use as an adjunct to insulin therapy to improve blood
sugar (glycemic) control in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) mellitus and a body mass
index ≥ 27 kg/m2
, who could not achieve adequate glycemic control despite optimal
insulin therapy.
“Millions of people across Europe who live with type 1 diabetes struggle to
control their blood sugar, even with optimal insulin therapy,” commented
Thomas Danne, Professor of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital ‘Auf der Bult,’
Hannover, Germany. “For the many people living with type 1 diabetes who
are overweight or obese, Zynquista will offer a new treatment option
physicians can now consider in combination with insulin therapy for
appropriate patients.”
Zynquista is an oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation
known as sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and
SGLT2).1 SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract,2
and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney.3
“Zynquista’s dual mechanism of action provides important treatment benefits
for adults with type 1 diabetes, including reducing blood sugar reabsorption
in the kidneys through SGLT2 inhibition and delaying dietary sugar absorption
through local SGLT1 inhibition in the intestinal tract,” added John Reed, M.D.,
Ph.D., Global Head of Research & Development, Sanofi.
The marketing authorization is based on evidence including data from the inTandem
clinical trial program, which included three Phase 3 clinical trials assessing the safety
and efficacy of sotagliflozin, involving approximately 3,000 adults with inadequately
controlled T1D.
4-7
“We are proud to have developed Zynquista in combination with insulin
through the largest Phase 3 clinical trial program to date in adults with type 1
diabetes, and now to have it approved in the European Union,” said Pablo
Lapuerta, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Lexicon.
“We thank the European Commission for recognizing the clinical benefits of
Zynquista for adults with type 1 diabetes and the families and physicians who
participated in the clinical trials.”
These three trials demonstrated that treatment with sotagliflozin, when given to adults
with inadequately controlled T1D as an oral adjunct to insulin, resulted in consistent
and significant reductions from baseline at 24 weeks in average blood sugar (HbA1c),
body weight, systolic blood pressure, a significant improvement of time in target blood
sugar range and improved patient-reported outcomes, versus insulin alone, at both
200-mg and 400-mg doses.
4-7 This was achieved without the usual increase in severe
hypoglycemia that comes with intensification of insulin and with less events of severe
hypoglycemia in the 400-mg dose at 52 weeks.
Consistent with selective SGLT2 inhibitors, clinical trials with sotagliflozin showed an
increased risk of genital mycotic infections and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is
acknowledged to affect people with T1D more frequently than those with type 2
diabetes (T2D). Several leaders in the diabetes scientific community consider the risk
of DKA associated with SGLT inhibitors manageable with appropriate patient selection,
education and ketone monitoring in place.
8-11 The risk of DKA will be addressed by
careful selection of patients for treatment with sotagliflozin and through a riskmanagement plan and a mitigation strategy, including patient, healthcare professional
and care giver educational activities, that will support its safe use.
Zynquista is also currently being evaluated in a program of 11 clinical trials in adults
with T2D, including two trials in people living with T2D and renal impairment, and two
large cardiovascular outcomes trials.
Zynquista (sotagliflozin) is not currently approved for use in any other markets, where it is considered an
investigational product.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7V93l2zj5R12qyqM0614n1556542914.jpg,Pharma,Sanofi | Lexicon,Zynquista | Sotagliflozin,diabetes|pharma|adults|EU|Lexicon|MAA|receive|treat|type 1,publish,29/4/2019,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/zynquista-now-approved-in-the-european-union-for-treatment-of-adults-with-type-1-diabetes/,https://pharmashots.com/13664/sanofi-and-lexicons-zynquista-sotagliflozin-receive-eus-maa-to-treat-type-1-diabetes-in-adults/

 Acutus’ Robust Second-Generation Platform has received FDA’ approval used for patients with electrophysiology procedures to reconstruct the chamber with ultrasound data for visualizing chamber’s anatomy and displaying electrical impulses as dipole density-based or voltage-based maps will be available in Q3’19
 Acutus model is compatible with first and second generation AcQMap platform, will be available in Europe in Q3’19","CARLSBAD, Calif. and MANNHEIM, Germany, April 26, 2019 – Acutus Medical today announced CE mark approval for AcQMap contact mapping software, offering expanded functionality that provides physicians with more options to inform individualized patient therapy. The company also announced FDA clearance of its second generation AcQMap platform. All AcQMap systems retain the unique ability to quickly reconstruct atrial anatomy using ultrasound and map electrical patterns using non-contact, charge density technology, creating ultra-high-resolution 3D images in real time.

AcQMap enables physicians to uncover the electrical activation pattern of the heart with real-time visualization during electrophysiology procedures.
“The contact mapping speed with the new Acutus system was extremely fast, which made it very easy to use,” said Dr. Christian Meyer, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. “Clinically, having this capability available on one system that also does non-contact mapping allows me to do exactly what makes sense case-by-case. For routine cases, my treatment strategy can be confirmed using conventional mapping catheters. In more complex cases, such as atrial fibrillation, I can gather more comprehensive data about each patient’s anatomy and arrhythmia in real time with the non-contact charge density catheter, making AcQMap the complete atrial mapping solution.”
Cardiac ablation treatment can improve quality of life for patients with atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF). AF affects more than 33 million people globally and increases the risk of stroke and heart failure.1,2 AcQMap enables physicians to uncover the electrical activation pattern of the heart with real-time visualization during electrophysiology procedures. With non-contact mapping, physicians see full-chamber, continuous beat-by-beat arrhythmia conduction and can locate arrhythmias outside the pulmonary veins to inform their treatment strategy, enabling an iterative map-ablate-remap approach.
“With the introduction of contact mapping software in Europe, AcQMap is unquestionably the most agile and comprehensive cardiac imaging and mapping system available, offering full spectrum arrhythmia visualization in under three minutes. No other technology offers the suite of solutions incorporated into AcQMap,” said Acutus Medical CEO Vince Burgess. “Our second generation system is engineered to be the cornerstone platform for electrophysiology labs for many years to come. We worked alongside physician partners to understand complex challenges and simple needs to improve the efficiency and safety of electrophysiology procedures. This next-gen AcQMap system has the capability to exponentially improve the day-to-day clinical utility of cardiac mapping and deliver long-term value by offering health systems a comprehensive solution for electrophysiologists and their patients.”
Acutus Medical’s contact mapping software is compatible with both first and second generation AcQMap platforms and will be installed on all European systems in Q3. The second generation AcQMap system is built to support future software innovations and will be available in the U.S. in Q3.

About Acutus Medical
Acutus Medical is a dynamic arrhythmia care company focused on developing distinct, innovative technologies that provide physicians and patients with improved results.

Sandoz to get WW rights to commercialize the proposed biosimilar trastuzumab (Ex- China & Taiwan)
 The agreement is the third biosimilar collaboration for Sandoz in 18 months, which will further focus on the expansion of its oncology portfolio with four oncology biosimilars
 Proposed trastuzumab biosimilar is been evaluated in P-III study for HER2+ breast and gastric cancer tumors. Additionally, Sandoz has 8 approved biosimilars and 10+ in the development phase for oncology, supportive cancer care, and hematology","Collaboration covers proposed trastuzumab biosimilar in Phase III development for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast and gastric tumors
Per licence agreement, EirGenix, Inc is responsible for development and manufacturing; Sandoz has right to commercialize in all markets except China and Taiwan
Agreement is third announced biosimilars collaboration for Sandoz in 18 months; will build on robust portfolio of eight approved molecules, with a further 10-plus in development
Holzkirchen, Germany, April 30, 2018 – Sandoz, a Novartis division and a global leader in biosimilars, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to commercialize a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar. This medicine is currently in Phase III clinical development for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast and specific gastric cancer tumors.
The agreement between Sandoz and EirGenix, Inc, a biotechnology manufacturing and development company that aspires to provide high-quality medicines for individuals and society, aims to bring to market a proposed biosimilar trastuzumab. EirGenix will maintain responsibility for development and manufacturing, and Sandoz has the right to commercialize the medicine upon approval in all markets excluding China and Taiwan.
According to the terms of the agreement, EirGenix will receive an upfront payment on signing, milestone payments, and is entitled to receive profit share payments for sales in the territories. This structure allows Sandoz to keep in-house resources focused on bringing forward a robust internal pipeline. The collaboration further expands the existing Sandoz oncology portfolio of four oncology biosimilar medicines, while enabling the company to further develop its strong hospital presence. Other specific terms of the agreement are confidential.
“Every year, approximately 300,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer, which tends to spread more quickly than HER2-negative tumors, making swift treatment important. While targeted therapy is available, high out-of-pocket costs lead to limited treatment in the US and reimbursement issues have resulted in varying uptake in Europe”,[1],[2] said Stefan Hendriks, Global Head of Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz. “Introducing biosimilars can help create earlier and expanded access to this important medicine, which is why I am so excited about the potential for this collaboration.”
Cancer places a significant and growing burden on healthcare systems around the world with the annual economic cost in 2010 estimated at approximately USD 1.16 trillion[3]. Biologics have helped to advance cancer care, and the reference medicine for trastuzumab is one of the top four cancer medicines by sales in 2018 with sales[4] of approximately USD 6.9 billion[5]. With the loss of exclusivity for the reference medicine, there continues to be a significant opportunity to introduce biosimilar competition to generate savings and increase access to this important medicine.
Sandoz biosimilars are helping patients, particularly in immunology, oncology and endocrinology, access medicines sustainably and affordably. The division has a leading global portfolio with eight marketed biosimilars and a further 10-plus in development. Half of the marketed biosimilar medicines are in oncology, with three in supportive cancer care and one for the treatment of blood cancers. Additional investigational oncology biosimilars are in the pipeline. Broadening the Sandoz oncology offering has benefits for payers, patients and healthcare systems overall.

 The P-III ATLAS & FLAIR studies resulted in maintaining viral suppression period @48wks. and safety & efficacy of two-drug regime, with 85% patients preferring it over prior treatment and if approved will reduce the no. of days of treatment from 365 to 12/year
 Cabotegravir is an investigational integrase inhibitor (INI) developed by ViiV Healthcare to treat HIV. Edurant (rilpivirine) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). ViiV Healthcare and Janssen plans to submit a regulatory application for the combination to EMA, Health Canada in 2019","If approved, cabotegravir and rilpivirine would be the first-ever long-acting, injectable treatment regimen for adults living with HIV
London, 29 April 2019 – ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, today submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval for the investigational, monthly, injectable, two-drug regimen of ViiV Healthcare’s cabotegravir and Janssen’s rilpivirine to treat HIV-1 infection in adults whose viral load is suppressed and who are not resistant to cabotegravir or rilpivirine.
The submission is based on the global ATLAS (Antiretroviral Therapy as Long-Acting Suppression) and FLAIR (First Long-Acting Injectable Regimen) pivotal phase III studies that included more than 1,100 patients from 16 countries and demonstrated the combination of cabotegravir and rilpivirine, injected monthly, was as effective as a standard of care, daily, oral, three-drug regimen in maintaining viral suppression throughout the 48-week study period. These results were presented in March at the 2019 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.
Deborah Waterhouse, CEO of ViiV Healthcare, said: “The long-acting, once-monthly, injectable regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine has the potential to give people living with HIV one month between doses with similar safety and efficacy as today’s standard of care – an oral three-drug regimen that has to be taken every day. ViiV Healthcare is proud to be at the forefront of this innovation in HIV treatment and we look forward to working with the FDA to provide people living with HIV in the US this novel option.”
John C. Pottage, Jr., M.D., Chief Scientific and Medical Officer of ViiV Healthcare, commented: “Our focus on developing innovative new HIV treatments, including long-acting injectable therapies, supports our goal of giving people living with HIV more options for managing the virus. The ATLAS and FLAIR data support the efficacy and safety of this investigational two-drug regimen, and the fact that more than 85 percent of study participants said they preferred it to their prior, daily oral therapy suggests we are delivering a welcome option. If approved, people receiving the monthly injectable regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine will reduce the number of days they have to take treatment from 365 to 12 per year.”
ViiV Healthcare and Janssen plan to submit regulatory applications for the two-drug regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine to the European Medicines Agency, Health Canada and other global agencies in the coming months.
As part of the regulatory submission package to the FDA, ViiV Healthcare submitted a second NDA for an oral tablet formulation of cabotegravir that would be taken as an oral lead-in with an already-approved, once-daily, oral tablet formulation of rilpivirine (marketed by Janssen as EDURANT®).
The ATLAS and FLAIR studies are part of ViiV Healthcare’s innovative clinical trial programme for two-drug regimens.
Notes to editors: About ATLAS and FLAIR
ATLAS (NCT02951052) is a phase III, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority study designed to assess the antiviral activity and safety of a two-drug regimen of long-acting, injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every four weeks compared to continuation of current oral anti-retroviral therapy (ART) of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or protease inhibitor (PI) among virally suppressed individuals. The primary endpoint for ATLAS is the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL per the FDA Snapshot algorithm at Week 48 (Missing, Switch, or Discontinuation = Failure, Intent-to-Treat Exposed [ITT-E] population). Subjects were required to be virally suppressed for six months or greater, on first or second regimen, with no prior failure.
FLAIR (NCT02938520) is a phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority study designed to assess the antiviral activity and safety of a two-drug regimen of intramuscular, long-acting, injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine in virologically suppressed adults living with HIV, following 20 weeks of induction therapy with Triumeq (abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine tablets). The primary endpoint for FLAIR is the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL per the FDA Snapshot algorithm at Week 48 (Missing, Switch, or Discontinuation = Failure, Intent-to-Treat Exposed [ITT-E] population).
About cabotegravir
Cabotegravir is an investigational integrase inhibitor (INI) and is not approved by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world. Cabotegravir is being developed by ViiV Healthcare for the treatment and prevention of HIV. It is being evaluated as a long-acting formulation for intramuscular injection and also as a once-daily oral tablet for use as a lead-in, to establish the tolerability of cabotegravir prior to long-acting injection.
 
About rilpivirine

 The ARIC study results identified the risk of cardiac events by measuring the elevated troponin-I levels, 85% had detectable troponin, adults with high troponin-I level are twice, thrice & 4times likely to have cardiac disease events, ischemic stroke & hospitalized with heart failure respectively
 Abbott’s diagnostic test is the troponin-I blood test with a CE mark, predicts the risk of developing heart disease by measuring heart-specific proteins called troponins. Abbott is pursuing registration for the test in the US","– Research found Abbott’s High-Sensitive Troponin-I blood test may identify adults at risk of having a cardiac event, independent of other heart disease risk factors
– Abbott’s core laboratory diagnostic test is the first troponin blood test with CE Mark that can more accurately predict risk of developing heart disease, when added to other heart disease risk assessments, than using other assessments alone
 
Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today that a new study published in Circulation found its High Sensitive Troponin-I blood test could predict the chance of developing a cardiac event years before it occurs in people with no symptoms when added to current heart disease assessments.1 Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, researchers suggest doctors could add the test to routine physical assessments in healthy middle-aged and older adults to better predict their chances of developing heart disease.
Troponin blood tests are widely used to help physicians detect heart attacks. As healthcare systems make a shift from treating symptoms of heart disease to preventing the onset of it, research now indicates that measuring a person’s troponin levels using Abbott’s High Sensitive Troponin-I blood test also can help predict a person’s chances of having a cardiac event potentially years in advance when they show no signs or symptoms.
In this latest analysis, researchers found that elevated troponin-I levels using Abbott’s High Sensitive Troponin-I blood test are associated with having future cardiac events– such as heart attack, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure hospitalization and death. This increased risk was independent of typical heart disease risk factors, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes. The study found that compared to adults with low levels of troponin-I, adults who had elevated levels of troponin-I were:

More than twice as likely to have a cardiac disease event, such as a heart attack
Nearly three times more likely to have ischemic stroke
More than four times as likely to be hospitalized with heart failure
“Studies increasingly show the value of measuring troponin levels in people who have not been diagnosed with heart disease to help better determine their future risk,” said Christie M. Ballantyne, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director of the Center for Cardiometabolic Disease Prevention, Baylor College of Medicine, and corresponding author of the study. “This study supports the value of adding highly sensitive troponin-I blood tests to current cardiovascular risk assessments to better identify patients who might benefit from more intensive steps to improve their heart health like improved diet and exercise.”
As part of this latest analysis of the ARIC study – an epidemiologic study on the causes of atherosclerosis – researchers looked at 8,121 adults age 54 to 73 years old with no known heart disease at the time their blood was drawn in 1998. Stored blood samples were used to measure troponin-I levels using Abbott’s High Sensitive Troponin-I diagnostic test, and 85% of participants had detectable troponin. Study participants were evaluated for approximately 15 years through 2013 to determine if they had a cardiac event. The study also measured troponin-T, another heart protein, using a different manufacturer’s test. The study found the levels of the troponins were not strongly correlated with each other.
Transforming heart disease from detection to prevention
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally.2 Yet, heart disease can often be prevented if identified early and managed through lifestyle changes and medication as needed. To determine a person’s risk for developing heart disease, physicians currently look at indirect heart health factors, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure and a family history of heart disease. By contrast, Abbott’s High Sensitive Troponin-I blood test looks at a protein that comes directly from the heart and is found at elevated levels in the blood after heart muscle has been injured.
“Advancements in our diagnostic technology are allowing us to see levels of troponin that may indicate early signs of injury to the heart years before heart disease becomes overt or symptoms appear,” said Agim Beshiri, M.D., senior medical director, global medical and scientific affairs, Diagnostics, Abbott. “Having a clearer picture of a patient’s heart health can serve as a wake-up call – empowering people to work with their doctors to take control of their heart health and possibly prevent a future cardiac event.”
Abbott’s High Sensitive Troponin-I test is available for cardiac risk assessment in CE Marked and non-regulated countries, pending country registration. Abbott’s blood test is not yet commercially available in the U.S. and was used for research purposes in this study. Abbott is actively pursuing registration of the High Sensitive Troponin-I test in the U.S.
About the Study
The study, published online today in Circulation,is part of ARIC – a prospective, epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities to investigate the causes of atherosclerosis. In this analysis, a total of 8,121 people with no known cardiovascular disease were included. Researchers measured associations between high-sensitive troponin-I blood test results and heart attack or other coronary heart disease event, stroke, heart failure hospitalization and death. The median follow-up was 15 years.
About ARIC
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) began in 1987. Each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 at their first visit. A total of 15,792 people participated in a detailed medical examination. They have been re-examined periodically, with yearly telephone follow up. To date, the ARIC study has published 1,854 papers in peer-reviewed journals.

 The P-III ARRIVAL study results: mean baseline sweat chloride (101.5 mmol/L); @24wks. mean sweat chloride level (43.1 mmol/L); mean absolute change (-58.6 mmol/L); no patient discontinued therapy due to adverse events
 Kalydeco (ivacaftor, 25,50,75,150 mg) is an oral CFTR potentiator enables the longer opening of CFTR protein at the cell surface to improve the transport of salt and water across the cell membrane and is approved in the US, Canada and EU for the treatment of CF in patients aged >12mos.","-Opportunity to treat the underlying cause of CF earlier than ever before-

-Safety data from Phase 3 ARRIVAL study support treatment with KALYDECO in children ages six to <12 months with eligible mutations-

BOSTON-Apr. 30, 2019– Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq:VRTX) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) for use in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) ages six months to less than 12 months who have at least one mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that is responsive to KALYDECO based on clinical and/or in vitro assay data. KALYDECO is already approved in the U.S., Canada and EU for the treatment of CF in patients ages 12 months and older.
“Today’s approval for KALYDECO allows physicians to begin treating the underlying cause of CF in eligible infants as young as six months of age for the first time, with the potential to modify the course of the disease,” said Margaret Rosenfeld, M.D., MPH, Seattle Children’s Research Institute and Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine.
This FDA approval is based on data from a 24-week Phase 3 open-label safety cohort (ARRIVAL) of 11 children with CF aged six months to less than 12 months who have one of 10 mutations in the CFTR gene (G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D or R117H). The study demonstrated a safety profile similar to that observed in previous Phase 3 studies of older children and adults; most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and no patient discontinued therapy due to adverse events. The most common adverse events (≥30%) were cough (64%), nasal congestion (36%) and rhinorrhea (36%). Three serious adverse events, all considered unrelated to study treatment by the investigators, were observed in three patients.
Mean baseline sweat chloride for the children in this cohort was 101.5 mmol/L (n=11). Following 24 weeks of treatment with KALYDECO, the mean sweat chloride level was 43.1 mmol/L (n=6). In the six subjects with paired sweat chloride samples at baseline and week 24, there was a mean absolute change of -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI; -75.9, -41.3).
Results of this study were presented at the 32nd Annual North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in October 2018.
“The manifestations of CF are often present at birth, which underscores our relentless commitment to reach the youngest CF patients possible in our clinical trials,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “As an important outcome of these efforts, we are now able to treat infants with cystic fibrosis as early as six months of age with KALYDECO.”
KALYDECO was first approved in 2012 in the U.S. and is now available in more than 40 countries with more than 5,000 patients on therapy. For more information on KALYDECO, prescribing information, or patient assistance programs, visit Kalydeco.com or VertexGPS.com.
About Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia.
CF is caused by a defective or missing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF. There are approximately 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene. Some of these mutations, which can be determined by a genetic test, or genotyping test, lead to CF by creating non-working or too few CFTR proteins at the cell surface. The defective function or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cell in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death. The median age of death is in the mid-to-late 20s.
About KALYDECO® (ivacaftor)
KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) is the first medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF in people with specific mutations in the CFTR gene. Known as a CFTR potentiator, KALYDECO is an oral medicine designed to keep CFTR proteins at the cell surface open longer to improve the transport of salt and water across the cell membrane, which helps hydrate and clear mucus from the airways. KALYDECO is available as 150 mg tablets for adults and pediatric patients age 6 years and older. It is also available as 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg granules in pediatric patients ages 6 months to less than 6 years.
People with CF who have specific mutations in the CFTR gene are currently indicated for KALYDECO in different countries across North America, Europe and other International markets.
INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KALYDECO® (ivacaftor)
KALYDECO (ivacaftor) is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 6 months and older who have at least one mutation in their CF gene that is responsive to KALYDECO. Patients should talk to their doctor to learn if they have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if KALYDECO is safe and effective in children under 6 months of age.
Patients should not take KALYDECO if they take certain medicines or herbal supplements, such as: the antibiotics rifampin or rifabutin; seizure medications such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin; or St. John’s wort.
Before taking KALYDECO, patients should tell their doctor if they: have liver or kidney problems; drink grapefruit juice, or eat grapefruit or Seville oranges; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant because it is not known if KALYDECO will harm an unborn baby; and are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed because is not known if KALYDECO passes into breast milk.
KALYDECO may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how KALYDECO works. Therefore the dose of KALYDECO may need to be adjusted when taken with certain medications. Patients should especially tell their doctor if they take antifungal medications such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole; or antibiotics such as telithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin.
KALYDECO can cause dizziness in some people who take it. Patients should not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything that needs them to be alert until they know how KALYDECO affects them.
Patients should avoid food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges while taking KALYDECO.
KALYDECO can cause serious side effects.
High liver enzymes in the blood have been reported in patients receiving KALYDECO. The patient’s doctor will do blood tests to check their liver before starting KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first year of taking KALYDECO, and every year while taking KALYDECO. For patients who have had high liver enzymes in the past, the doctor may do blood tests to check the liver more often. Patients should call their doctor right away if they have any of the following symptoms of liver problems: pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area; yellowing of their skin or the white part of their eyes; loss of appetite; nausea or vomiting; or dark, amber-colored urine.
Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) has been noted in some children and adolescents receiving KALYDECO. The patient’s doctor should perform eye examinations prior to and during treatment with KALYDECO to look for cataracts.
The most common side effects include headache; upper respiratory tract infection (common cold), which includes sore throat, nasal or sinus congestion, and runny nose; stomach (abdominal) pain; diarrhea; rash; nausea; and dizziness.
These are not all the possible side effects of KALYDECO. Please click here to see the full Prescribing Information for KALYDECO.

13872,ï»¿AbbVie's Mavyret (glecaprevir and pibrentasvir) Receives FDA's Approval for All Genotypes of Hepatitis C in Pediatric Patients,FDA approves first treatment for all genotypes of hepatitis C in pediatric patients,"The approval follows the clinical study results assessing Mavyret (glecaprevir & pibrentasvir) in 47 children aged 12-17 yrs. with genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 HCV infection without/mild Cirrhosis resulted in no virus detection @12wks. after receiving Mavyret for 8/16wks.
 The study assessing Mavyret in pediatric patients with cirrhosis/history of a kidney or liver transplant/genotype 5 or 6 HCV infection, safety & efficacy follows the clinical study conducted in adults in 2017
 Mavyret is an oral combination therapy of glecaprevir (ABT-493, broad-genotypic NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (ABT-530, NS5A inhibitor) and has received FDA’s PR & BT designation for HCV in adults","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Mavyret (glecaprevir and pibrentasvir) tablets to treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in children ages 12 to 17. Mavyret was previously approved to treat HCV in adults in 2017.
“Direct-acting antiviral drugs reduce the amount of HCV in the body by preventing the virus from multiplying, and in most cases, they cure HCV infection,” said Jeffrey Murray, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of the Division of Antiviral Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval represents another treatment option for children and adolescents with HCV infection, but for the first time, in all genotypes of HCV.”
HCV is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 2.7 to 3.9 million people in the U.S. have chronic HCV, and children born to HCV-positive mothers are at risk for HCV infection. It is estimated that there are 23,000 to 46,000 children in the U.S. with HCV infection.
With today’s approval, dosing information is provided for Mavyret for the treatment of adult or pediatric patients 12 years and older, or weighing at least 99 pounds, who are infected with any of six identified HCV genotypes either without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.
The safety and efficacy of Mavyret in pediatric patients was evaluated during clinical trials of 47 patients with genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 HCV infection without cirrhosis or with mild cirrhosis. Results of the trials demonstrated that 100 percent of patients who received Mavyret for eight or 16 weeks had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting that patients’ infection had been cured. In pediatric patients with cirrhosis, history of a kidney and/or liver transplant, or genotype 5 or 6 HCV infection, the safety and efficacy of Mavyret are supported by previous studies observed in glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in adults. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of Mavyret in adults.
Treatment duration with Mavyret differs depending on treatment history, viral genotype and cirrhosis status. The most common adverse reactions in patients taking Mavyret were headache and fatigue. Mavyret is not recommended in patients with moderate cirrhosis and contraindicated in patients with severe cirrhosis. It is also contraindicated in patients taking the drugs atazanavir and rifampin.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected adult patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. HBV reactivation in patients treated with direct-acting antiviral medicines can result in serious liver problems or death in some patients. Health care professionals should screen all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before starting treatment with Mavyret.
The FDA granted the approval of Mavyret to AbbVie Inc.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

“This approval is an important step forward in providing people living with moderate to severe psoriasis with a new treatment option,” said Michael Severino, M.D., vice chairman and president, AbbVie. “The results seen in our clinical studies, including high levels of complete skin clearance with 12-week dosing and a favorable safety profile, suggest SKYRIZI has the potential to provide long-term relief from the signs and symptoms of psoriasis. We are proud to expand our portfolio of treatment options for people living with this condition in Europe.”
“In clinical studies, patients saw significantly higher rates of skin clearance with SKYRIZI compared to current standards of care,” said Hervé Bachelez, professor at the University Paris Diderot and the Department of Dermatology of the Saint-Louis Hospital-Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, France and a principal investigator of the ultIMMa-2 study. “As many as 80 percent of patients who achieved clear skin at 16 weeks maintained completely clear skin through one year. We look forward to seeing more of the two-year data from the IMMhance study at the World Congress of Dermatology in June.”
SKYRIZI received EC approval based on results from four pivotal Phase 3 studies, ultIMMa-1, ultIMMa-2, IMMvent and IMMhance evaluating more than 2,000 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.1-4 Across all four studies, the co-primary endpoints were at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and a static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) at week 16.1-4 SKYRIZI is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.
Highlights from the pivotal Phase 3 program
In the ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 studies, SKYRIZI met the co-primary endpoints of sPGA 0/1 and PASI 90 at week 16 (p<0.001).1,4 After 16 weeks of treatment, 88 percent (ultIMMa-1) and 84 percent (ultIMMa-2) of SKYRIZI patients achieved sPGA 0/1 and 75 percent of patients receiving SKYRIZI in both studies achieved PASI 90.1,4
An integrated analysis of patients who received SKYRIZI in the ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 studies showed that, of patients who achieved PASI 90 with SKYRIZI at week 16, 88 percent of these patients maintained PASI 90 with SKYRIZI at one year (52 weeks). Of patients who achieved PASI 100 with SKYRIZI at week 16, 80 percent maintained PASI 100 with SKYRIZI at one year (52 weeks).4
SKYRIZI demonstrated superiority versus adalimumab in the IMMvent study, with 72 percent of patients achieving PASI 90 compared to 47 percent of patients treated with adalimumab at week 16 (p<0.001).2,4 Following re-randomization at week 16, 66 percent of patients who started on adalimumab and switched to SKYRIZI achieved PASI 90, compared to 21 percent who continued on adalimumab at week 44 (p<0.001).2,4 The co-primary endpoints of sPGA 0/1 and PASI 90 at week 16 were met (p<0.001).2,4
Results from IMMhance showed that, among people receiving SKYRIZI who achieved clear or almost clear skin (sPGA 0/1) response at week 28 and were re-randomized to continue SKYRIZI (n=111), 87 percent maintained this response at week 52 compared to 61 percent re-randomized to withdraw (n=225).9 The co-primary endpoints of sPGA 0/1 at week 16 and week 52 were met (p<0.001).3,4
SKYRIZI was also reported to improve health-related quality of life in Phase 3 studies. In ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2, significantly more patients treated with SKYRIZI self-reported a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 0 or 1 (75 percent in ultIMMa-1 and 71 percent in ultIMMa-2) compared with ustekinumab (47 percent in ultIMMa-1 and 44 percent in ultIMMa-2) at one year (p<0.001).1,4 DLQI is a measure of a patient’s health-related quality of life, ranging from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating the disease has less impact on life quality.10

AbbVie received approval of SKYRIZI from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in March 2019, as well as approval for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis from Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2019.
About SKYRIZI (risankizumab) in the European Union
SKYRIZI (risankizumab) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.
Important EU Safety Information4
Risankizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Risankizumab may increase the risk of infection. In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, risankizumab should be used with caution. Treatment with risankizumab should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.
Prior to initiating treatment with risankizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving risankizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating risankizumab in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.
Prior to initiating therapy with risankizumab, completion of all appropriate immunizations should be considered according to current immunization guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with risankizumab. Patients treated with risankizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections, which occurred in 13 percent of patients. Commonly (greater than or equal to 1/100 to less than 1/10) reported adverse reactions included tinea infections, headache, pruritus, fatigue and injection site reactions.

 Additionally, Medtronic has also introduced the Phenom 21 Catheter, a 160 cm length microcatheter used for the delivery of all sizes of Solitaire X
 Solitaire X revascularization is a fourth-generation device containing an optimized delivery system which recovers a patient from acute ischemic stroke","System Offers New Options for Improving Outcomes in Treating Stroke;
World’s Second-Leading Cause of Death, Third-Leading Cause of Disability

DUBLIN – April 30, 2019 – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced the U.S. launch of the Solitaire(TM) X Revascularization Device – and its first use in patients for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. For ten years, the industry-leading Solitaire(TM) Revascularization Device has enabled physicians in helping patients have a better chance at recovering from stroke. Solitaire X is a 4th generation device featuring an optimized delivery system for improved efficiency – while retaining the technical features that have made the Solitaire family of revascularization devices clinically proven and highly effective. In addition, Medtronic introduces Phenom(TM) 21 Catheter, a 160cm length microcatheter for the delivery of all sizes of Solitaire X.
The Solitaire X device mechanically removes blood clots from blocked vessels in the brain to restore blood flow in patients suffering an acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion. When combined with Phenom 21, Solitaire X provides a low clot crossing profile, with smooth delivery to occlusions in distal vessels as small as 2.0mm. This compatible system reinforces Medtronic’s commitment to the fight against stroke.
“Medtronic continues to deliver technological innovations to advance stroke treatment. As a long-time Solitaire user, I am impressed with the ease of the Solitaire X delivery,” said Dr. Reza Jahan, professor of radiology and neurosurgery at UCLA. “I find that Solitaire X 6×40 device combined with Phenom 21 catheter provides smooth navigation especially when working with complicated anatomy.”

Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death, killing nearly 6 million people each year. It is also the third leading cause of disability.1 In the United States, approximately 795,000 people suffer a stroke annually, and it is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability. In fact, in the U.S. a stroke occurs every 40 seconds,2 and every four minutes someone dies of a stroke.3
“Our commitment to enable physicians to improve outcomes for stroke patients worldwide will always be our motivation,” said Stacey Pugh, vice president and general manager of Medtronic’s Neurovascular business, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group at Medtronic. “The net result of that commitment is the launch of a 4thgeneration device – Solitaire X – which marks 10 years of innovation in stroke therapy.”

 The P-III COSMIC-313 study follows ongoing P-Ib study assessing cabozantinib + nivolumab with/without ipilimumab in patients with advanced genitourinary cancers including RCC, previously treated with sorafenib
 Cabometyx is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor promoting an immune-permissive environment in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and is approved in the US for HCC & advanced RCC. Opdivo & Yervoy are checkpoint inhibitors developed by BMS","– COSMIC-313 is the third phase 3 pivotal trial to investigate cabozantinib in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors –

ALAMEDA, Calif.–May 1, 2019– Exelixis, Inc.(NASDAQ: EXEL) today announced that it is initiating COSMIC-313, a phase 3 pivotal trial of cabozantinib (CABOMETYX®) in combination with nivolumab (Opdivo®) and ipilimumab (Yervoy®) versus nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with intermediate- or poor-risk disease per the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival, and the secondary endpoints are overall survival and objective response rate.
“Clinical observations suggest cabozantinib promotes an immune-permissive environment, which could present an opportunity for additive or synergistic effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors,” said Gisela Schwab, M.D., President, Product Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, Exelixis. “The mechanisms of action of single agent cabozantinib and the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab are complementary, and each has demonstrated efficacy in advanced renal cell carcinoma. The further combination of these agents as a triplet regimen may offer promise to previously untreated patients with intermediate- or poor-risk disease, who are known to have poor treatment outcomes.”
COSMIC-313 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled phase 3 pivotal trial that aims to enroll approximately 676 patients at 150 sites globally. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab and to the control arm of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with matched placebo.
Design of this phase 3 pivotal trial was informed by results from the ongoing phase 1b study of cabozantinib plus nivolumab with or without ipilimumab in patients with previously treated advanced genitourinary cancers, including RCC. The phase 1b trial is being conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute and includes centers from its Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network.
Bristol-Myers Squibb is providing nivolumab and ipilimumab for use in this trial.

About RCC
The American Cancer Society’s 2019 statistics cite kidney cancer as among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S.1 Clear cell RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults.2 If detected in its early stages, the five-year survival rate for RCC is high; for patients with advanced or late-stage metastatic RCC, however, the five-year survival rate is only 12 percent, with no identified cure for the disease.1 Approximately 32,000 patients in the U.S. and 70,000 globally require treatment, and an estimated 15,000 patients in the U.S. each year are in need of a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer.3
The majority of clear cell RCC tumors have lower than normal levels of a protein called von Hippel-Lindau, which leads to higher levels of MET, AXL and VEGF.4,5 These proteins promote tumor angiogenesis (blood vessel growth), growth, invasiveness and metastasis.6,7,8,9 MET and AXL may provide escape pathways that drive resistance to VEGF receptor inhibitors.5,6
About CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib)
In the U.S., CABOMETYX tablets are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC and for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib. CABOMETYX tablets have also received regulatory approvals in the European Union and additional countries and regions worldwide. In 2016, Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib outside of the United States and Japan. In 2017, Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib for all future indications in Japan.
The combination of CABOMETYX with nivolumab and ipilimumab is not indicated for previously untreated advanced RCC.

 CRT is an implantable device sending leads for the stimulation of heart muscles leading to an improvement in heart pumping efficiency to treat heart failure. Additionally, Medtronic’s portfolio has therapies & diagnostic tools for HF including MR-conditional CRT-Ds and CRT-Ps","Attain Stability(TM) Quad MRI SureScan(TM) Lead Designed for Precise Placement and Stability

DUBLIN – May 1, 2019 – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) announced it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the Attain Stability(TM) Quad MRI SureScan(TM) left heart lead. Paired with Medtronic quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (CRT-D) and -pacemakers (CRT-P), the Attain Stability Quad lead is the only active-fixation left heart lead, and is designed for precise lead placement and stability. The lead will be commercially available in the U.S. in summer 2019.
“Appropriate placement of left heart leads during implantation of CRT devices is critical to achieve the clinical benefits of this therapy. Unfortunately, with present passive-fixation leads, we are not always able to position the lead in an ideal location due to variations in a patient’s anatomy and size of the target vessel. We also continue to see lead dislodgements that require reprogramming or repeat surgery for lead repositioning. Having a new active fixation left heart lead allows us to target the ideal location in the patient’s vessel with the confidence that the lead will remain in place to allow for continued effective delivery of CRT,” said Steven Zweibel, M.D., F.A.C.C., F.H.R.S., C.C.D.S., director of Electrophysiology at the Hartford Healthcare Heart and Vascular Institute.
CRT is a treatment for heart failure in which an implantable device sends low levels of energy through thin wires, called leads, to stimulate the heart muscle and potentially improve the heart’s pumping efficiency. With the introduction of quadripolar leads (leads with four electrodes), physicians can pace from different locations in the heart, but are limited in where they can place the lead. The Attain Stability Quad lead integrates the benefits of a quadripolar lead with a side-helix that allows physicians to fixate the lead precisely in veins of various sizes, including ones not typically amenable to positioning a passive lead. Additionally, patients with this lead and MR-conditional CRT devices are eligible for either 3 Tesla (T) and 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, if needed.
“Clinical trial evidence shows this lead is a safe and effective option for patients receiving CRT devices,” said Kweli P.

Tmunity will be responsible for development & commercialization of the H3.3K27M TCR therapy
 The focus of the collaboration is to strengthen Tmunity’s portfolio by developing therapies for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) targeting H3.3K27M i.e, K27M mutation in the H3.3 histone
 Tmunity’s portfolio includes T cell therapy platforms, T cell receptors, regulatory T cells, gene transfer, allogeneic T cells and bionic T cells & CAR-T programs used for activating or suppressing immunity","– Collaboration will broaden Tmunity’s pipeline to include a glioma T cell therapy engineered to express a newly discovered T cell receptor –

– Initial research will focus on Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare and typically fatal pediatric brain cancer –

​

PHILADELPHIA, PA, May 1, 2019 – Tmunity Therapeutics, Inc., a private clinical-stage biotherapeutics company focused on saving and improving lives by delivering the full potential of next-generation T cell immunotherapy, today announced it has entered into an exclusive licensing and research collaboration with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) aimed at advancing novel engineered T Cell Receptor (TCR) therapies for rare and currently incurable pediatric conditions with high mortality rates. Initially, research will focus on Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare and highly aggressive brain stem tumor.

As part of the research collaboration, Tmunity will work with one of the world’s leading experts in the field of neuro-oncology gene therapy, Hideho Okada, MD, PhD, a physician-scientist and professor of neurological surgery at UCSF who studies immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at malignant brain tumors. Dr. Okada has discovered and engineered a TCR that binds to and is selective for the H3.3K27M neoantigen. Recent studies have shown that the K27M mutation in the H3.3 histone is observed in more than 70 percent of DIPGs, and that gliomas harboring this mutation are associated with a poor prognosis and survival rate. In animal studies, Dr. Okada found that T cells transfected with the engineered TCR and infused into a mouse model of H3.3K27M-positive glioma harboring the K27M mutation in H3.3 had anti-tumor activity and limited toxicity in treated animals.

“This collaboration with UCSF embodies our commitment to advance novel T cell therapies into the clinic faster. Sadly, children who are diagnosed with DIPG currently have very few therapeutic options and there has been little progress in improving treatments and overall survival rates for DIPG over the last few decades,” said Usman “Oz” Azam, MD, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Board of Tmunity. “We look forward to working with Dr. Okada and his research team to help advance this exciting discovery of a novel TCR therapy that could be a potential breakthrough in the treatment of this devastating pediatric disease, and perhaps other gliomas.”

Approximately 300 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with DIPG each year, with most diagnoses occurring between five and nine years of age. Children with DIPG have a median overall survival of nine to 10 months using currently available treatments that mainly manage symptoms and complications associated with the disease.

“We are excited to join forces with Tmunity to further study the potential of our TCR T cell as a therapy for DIPG,” said Dr. Okada. “The expertise Tmunity brings in clinical development, regulatory and manufacturing is invaluable as our pre-clinical research suggests that our discovery may show promise as a therapeutic approach in pediatric patients with DIPG.”

The exclusive collaboration between Tmunity and UCSF brings together leading technologies and expertise from both groups to accelerate the clinical development of this novel T cell therapy. Under the terms of the agreement, Tmunity will work closely with Dr. Okada’s laboratory with the intention of moving quickly into IND-enabling studies and into the clinic. Tmunity will be responsible for leading the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the H3.3K27M TCR T cell therapy. The negotiations were led by the Technology Management team in the UCSF Innovation Ventures office, which leads the university’s business development, technology licensing, and efforts to translate cutting-edge science into therapies and products that directly benefit patients worldwide.

13985,Sanofi's Dengvaxia Receives FDA's Approval to Prevent Dengue in Endemic Region in the US,First FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease in endemic regions,"The approval follows three studies assessing Dengvaxia vs PBO in 35,000 patients with 9 through 16 years of age with laboratory-confirmed dengue caused by serotypes 1–4 living in dengue-endemic areas including Puerto Rico, Latin America and the Asia Pacific
 Dengvaxia is not indicated for the patients who are not previously infected with dengue virus, prior dengue infection can be assessed through medical record/serological testing
 Dengvaxia is a live, attenuated vaccine administered thrice with initial dose followed by two doses at six & twelve months later and has received FDA’s PR & Tropical Disease PR voucher for tropical diseases with the approval in 19 countries including EU","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today the approval of Dengvaxia, the first vaccine approved for the prevention of dengue disease caused by all dengue virus serotypes (1, 2, 3 and 4) in people ages 9 through 16 who have laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and who live in endemic areas. Dengue is endemic in the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
“Dengue disease is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in the world and global incidence has increased in recent decades,” said Anna Abram, FDA deputy commissioner for policy, legislation, and international affairs. “The FDA is committed to working proactively with our partners at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as international partners, including the World Health Organization, to combat public health threats, including through facilitating the development and availability of medical products to address emerging infectious diseases. While there is no cure for dengue disease, today’s approval is an important step toward helping to reduce the impact of this virus in endemic regions of the United States.”
The CDC estimates more than one-third of the world’s population is living in areas at risk for infection by dengue virus which causes dengue fever, a leading cause of illness among people living in the tropics and subtropics. The first infection with dengue virus typically results in either no symptoms or a mild illness that can be mistaken for the flu or another viral infection. A subsequent infection can lead to severe dengue, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a more severe form of the disease that can be fatal. Symptoms may include stomach pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding, confusion and difficulty breathing. Approximately 95 percent of all severe/hospitalized cases of dengue are associated with second dengue virus infection. Because there are no specific drugs approved for the treatment of dengue disease, care is limited to the management of symptoms.
Each year, an estimated 400 million dengue virus infections occur globally according to the CDC. Of these, approximately 500,000 cases develop into DHF, which contributes to about 20,000 deaths, primarily among children. Although dengue cases are rare in the continental U.S., the disease is regularly found in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.
“Infection by one type of dengue virus usually provides immunity against that specific serotype, but a subsequent infection by any of the other three serotypes of the virus increases the risk of developing severe dengue disease, which may lead to hospitalization or even death,” said Peter Marks, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “As the second infection with dengue is often much more severe than the first, the FDA’s approval of this vaccine will help protect people previously infected with dengue virus from subsequent development of dengue disease.”
The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine was determined in three randomized, placebo-controlled studies involving approximately 35,000 individuals in dengue-endemic areas, including Puerto Rico, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. The vaccine was determined to be approximately 76 percent effective in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed dengue disease in individuals 9 through 16 years of age who previously had laboratory-confirmed dengue disease. Dengvaxia has already been approved in 19 countries and the European Union.
The most commonly reported side effects by those who received Dengvaxia were headache, muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, injection site pain and low-grade fever. The frequency of side effects was similar across Dengvaxia and placebo recipients and tended to decrease after each subsequent dose of the vaccine.
Dengvaxia is not approved for use in individuals not previously infected by any dengue virus serotype or for whom this information is unknown. This is because in people who have not been infected with dengue virus, Dengvaxia appears to act like a first dengue infection – without actually infecting the person with wild-type dengue virus – such that a subsequent infection can result in severe dengue disease.Therefore, health care professionals should evaluate individuals for prior dengue infection to avoid vaccinating individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus. This can be assessed through a medical record of a previous laboratory-confirmed dengue infection or through serological testing (tests using blood samples from the patient) prior to vaccination.
Dengvaxia is a live, attenuated vaccine that is administered as three separate injections, with the initial dose followed by two additional shots given six and twelve months later.
The FDA granted this application Priority Review and a Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher under a program intended to encourage development of new drugs and biologics for the prevention and treatment of certain tropical diseases. The approval was granted to Sanofi Pasteur.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanofi.jpg,Pharma,Sanofi,Dengvaxia,dengue|pharma|approval|endemic region|FDA|prevent|receives|US,publish,5/2/2019,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/first-fda-approved-vaccine-for-the-prevention-of-dengue-disease-in-endemic-regions-2/,https://pharmashots.com/13985/sanofis-dengvaxia-receives-fdas-approval-to-prevent-dengue-in-endemic-region-in-the-us/

14012,ï»¿GSK Reports Results of Trelegy Ellipta in P-III CAPTAIN Study for Asthma,Phase III CAPTAIN study of Trelegy Ellipta in patients with asthma meets primary endpoint,"The P-III CAPTAIN study involves assessing of Trelegy Ellipta (FF/UMEC/VI) (100/31.25/25, 100/62.5/25, 200/31.25/25 and 200/62.5/25 mcg) vs Relvar/Breo Ellipta (FF/VI) (100/25 and 200/25 mcg) in 2,436 patients with uncontrolled asthma prior treated with ICS/LABA across 15 countries
 The P-III CAPTAIN study results: met its 1EPs; @24wks. 100/62.5/25mcg vs 200/62.5/25mcg, improvement in lung function & trough FEV1 (110ml &r 92ml); 100/62.5/25 and 200/62.5/25 vs 100/25 and 200/25, 13% reduction in exacerbations
 Trelegy Ellipta (qd) is an inhaler triple therapy of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol indicated for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD. In 2017, Trelegy Ellipta (100/62.5/25 mcg) has received FDA’s approval for COPD","GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVA) today announced headline results from the pivotal phase III CAPTAIN study of once-daily single inhaler triple therapy Trelegy Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol: FF/UMEC/VI) compared to Relvar/Breo Ellipta (FF/VI), in the treatment of patients living with uncontrolled asthma.
The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant 110mL improvement in lung function (measured by change from baseline in trough FEV1 at 24 weeks of treatment) for FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25mcg (p<0.001, 95% CI: 66-153 mL) compared with Relvar/Breo 100/25mcg and a statistically significant 92mL improvement in trough FEV1for FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25mcg versus Relvar/Breo 200/25mcg (p<0.001, 95% CI: 49-135 mL).
The key secondary endpoint was annualised rate of moderate/severe exacerbations for FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 and 200/62.5/25) versus Relvar/Breo (100/25 and 200/25) and demonstrated a 13% (95% CI: -5.2 to 28.1) reduction in exacerbations, however this was not statistically significant. Therefore, all subsequent analyses were considered descriptive.
Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D, GSK, said: “We believe a once-daily single inhaler triple therapy that improves lung function is an advance for patients with uncontrolled asthma since this option is not currently available. We plan to submit these data for regulatory review after the full dataset is available.”
CAPTAIN was also designed to investigate two further doses of FF/UMEC/VI (100/31.25/25 and 200/31.25/25 mcg) compared to Relvar/Breo (100/25 and 200/25). There were increases in trough FEV1 of a similar magnitude to those of FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 and 200/62.5/25, with no difference in exacerbation rates.
The safety profile of FF/UMEC/VI was consistent with the known profile of the individual components and their combinations. Adverse event rates were similar across all six study arms with the most common adverse events being reported as nasopharyngitis (13-15%), headache (5-9%), upper respiratory tract infection (3-6%) and bronchitis (3-5%).
Dr. Paul Meunier, Vice President of Respiratory Medicine at Innoviva noted that: “The CAPTAIN study has shown that triple therapy in a single inhaler provides a potential new treatment option for asthma management in patients uncontrolled on ICS/LABA.”

CAPTAIN (Clinical study of Asthma Patients receiving Triple therapy through A single INhaler) is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled, six-arm parallel group, global multicentre study evaluating FF/UMEC/VI (100/31.25/25, 100/62.5/25, 200/31.25/25 and 200/62.5/25 mcg) versus FF/VI (100/25 and 200/25 mcg) given once-daily to patients whose asthma is inadequately controlled despite treatment with ICS/LABA (>250mcg/day fluticasone propionate, or equivalent) maintenance asthma medication. In the study 2,436 patients were treated across 15 countries with approximately 400 patients randomly assigned to each of the six treatment arms.
CAPTAIN evaluated as its primary endpoint the change from baseline in trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) at 24 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoint was the annualised rate of moderate/severe asthma exacerbations.

The following ISI is based on the Highlights section of the US Prescribing Information for Trelegy Ellipta. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labelled safety information.
Trelegy Ellipta is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma.
Trelegy Ellipta is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or any of the ingredients.
LABA monotherapy increases the risk of serious asthma-related events.
Trelegy Ellipta should not be initiated in patients experiencing episodes of acutely deteriorating COPD. Do not use Trelegy Ellipta to treat acute symptoms.
Trelegy Ellipta should not be used in combination with other medicines containing LABA because of risk of overdose.
Candida albicans infection of the mouth and pharynx has occurred in patients treated with fluticasone furoate, a component of Trelegy Ellipta. Monitor patients periodically. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk.
There is an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD taking Trelegy Ellipta. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonia.
Patients who use corticosteroids are at risk for potential worsening of infections (e.g. existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex). Use Trelegy Ellipta with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients.
There is a risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from systemic corticosteroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to Trelegy Ellipta.
Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage of Trelegy Ellipta in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, consider appropriate therapy.
If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue Trelegy Ellipta and institute alternative therapy.
Use Trelegy Ellipta with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation.
Assess patents for decrease in bone mineral density initially and periodically thereafter after prescribing Trelegy Ellipta.
Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use Trelegy Ellipta long term. Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if symptoms occur.
Worsening of urinary retention may occur in patients taking Trelegy Ellipta. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if symptoms occur.
Use Trelegy Ellipta with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis.
Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia in patients taking Trelegy Ellipta.
The most common adverse reactions reported for Trelegy Ellipta (incidence ≥1%) are upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, bronchitis, oral candidiasis, headache, back pain, arthralgia, influenza, sinusitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, dysgeusia, constipation, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, oropharyngeal pain, cough, and dysphonia.
About asthma
Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma affects 358 million people worldwide. Despite medical advances, more than half of patients continue to experience poor control and significant symptoms. At least 30% of patients adherent to ICS/LABA therapy remain uncontrolled which can negatively impact their lives.
The causes of asthma are not completely understood but likely involve an interaction between a person’s genetic make-up and the environment. Key risk factors are inhaled substances that provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways.

 Presage’s CIVO platform is an intratumoral microdosing platform used to evaluate patients’ unique responses to microdoses of multiple cancer drugs and is helpful in the drug development process","Research agreement to support Phase 0 tumor microdosing studies
SEATTLE, May 2, 2019 /– Presage Biosciences, a cancer biotechnology company pioneering a new cancer drug development approach using its CIVO™ intratumoral microdosing platform, today announced it has entered into a research collaboration with Celgene Corporation to evaluate several of Celgene’s early stage assets in Phase 0 trials. Presage’s CIVO platform is used to evaluate patients’ unique responses to microdoses of multiple cancer drugs.
“It is widely recognized that in vitro and animal models of cancer have failed to predict drug efficacy in cancer patients. With CIVO, we now have the opportunity to address this fundamental issue by directly evaluating each patient’s individual response to multiple drug options,” said Rich Klinghoffer, PhD, Presage CEO. “Celgene’s early support enabled Presage to bring the CIVO platform from the laboratory setting into the clinic. We are very pleased to be collaborating again with Celgene to use CIVO in Phase 0 clinical trials.”
In anticipation of expansion in offering Phase 0 services, Presage has hired Kirsten Anderson as its SVP of Clinical Development. Ms. Anderson has over 25 years of clinical drug development experience and clinical trial management with expertise in oncology.
“Presage’s CIVO platform allows us to rapidly assess the effect of early pipeline agents and drug combinations with the potential for actionable insights from the tumor microenvironment,” said Ms. Anderson. “This approach offers truly novel acumen for oncology treatment that can help streamline drug development and offer targeted patient selection.”
The collaboration with Celgene comes on the heels of Presage’s recently completed clinical trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of utilizing the CIVO platform in sarcoma patients. The trial demonstrated that CIVO is well tolerated and highlighted drug-specific tumor cell and microenvironment responses to both small molecule and biologic agents. Presage expects to publish the results later this year.
About CIVO and Phase 0 Trials
To address the challenges inherent in cancer drug discovery, Presage is advancing a new approach to rapidly evaluate multiple drug candidates and enhance knowledge applicable for future trial design. Exploratory Investigational New Drug (eIND) studies, also known as Phase 0 trials, allow for the evaluation of minute amounts of drugs in patients to assess pharmacodynamic effects. CIVO is a patented platform that enables intratumoral microdosing and analysis of multiple cancer agents.

 The P-III KATHERINE study results: reduction in risk of breast cancer recurrence (50%); @3yrs. iDFS (88.3% vs 77.0%); absolute improvement (11.3%); worse prognosis in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment
 Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) is an ADC, a combination of trastuzumab and DM1, delivering CT directly to HER2+ cancer cells. It has received approval in 104 countries including the US & EU for HER2+ m-breast cancer and is developed using ADC technology licensed from ImmunoGen","The approval is based on data showing Kadcyla cut the risk of disease recurring by half compared to Herceptin in the adjuvant setting for specific patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer
The application was approved in just over 12 weeks under the US FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review pilot programme
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kadcyla® (trastuzumab emtansine) for adjuvant (after surgery) treatment of people with HER2-positive early breast cancer (eBC) who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant (before surgery) taxane and Herceptin® (trastuzumab)-based treatment.
“This approval is a significant treatment advance for HER2-positive early breast cancer. By working closely with the FDA and participating in the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot programme, we are able to make Kadcyla available for people with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant therapy much sooner than anticipated,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “With every step forward in reducing the risk of disease recurrence, we come closer to the goal of helping each person with early breast cancer have the greatest opportunity for cure.”
The goal in treating eBC is to provide people with the best chance for a cure, which may involve treatment before and after surgery as part of a comprehensive treatment approach.1,2 While we come closer to this goal with each advance, many people still have a disease recurrence in the long-term.3 Neoadjuvant treatment is given before surgery with the goal of shrinking tumours and helping to improve surgical outcomes.2 Adjuvant treatment is given after surgery and aims to eliminate any remaining cancer cells in the body to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.2
The FDA rapidly reviewed and approved the application under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) and Assessment Aid pilot programmes, leading to an approval in just over 12 weeks after completing the submission. Kadcyla is the first Roche medicine approved under the RTOR pilot programme, which is exploring a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible.4 For this indication, Kadcyla was also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases.5
This approval is based on results of the phase III KATHERINE study showing Kadcyla significantly reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence or death from any cause (invasive disease-free survival; iDFS) by 50% (HR=0.50, 95% CI 0.39-0.64, p<0.0001) compared to Herceptin as an adjuvant treatment in people with HER2-positive eBC who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and Herceptin-based treatment.6 At three years, 88.3% of people treated with Kadcyla did not have their breast cancer return compared to 77.0% treated with Herceptin, an absolute improvement of 11.3%.6 People who have residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment have a worse prognosis than those with no detectable disease.7,8
The most common Grade 3 or higher side effects (>2%) with Kadcyla in the KATHERINE study were decreased platelet count and high blood pressure. The most common side effects (>25%) with Kadcyla were fatigue; nausea; increased blood levels of liver enzymes; musculoskeletal pain; bleeding; decreased platelet count; headache; numbness, tingling or pain in the hands or feet; and joint pain.6,9

About the KATHERINE study10
KATHERINE is an international, multi-centre, two-arm, randomised, open-label, phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Kadcyla versus Herceptin as an adjuvant therapy in people with HER2-positive eBC who have pathological invasive residual disease in the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes following neoadjuvant therapy that included Herceptin and taxane-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is iDFS, which in this study is defined as the time from randomisation free from invasive breast cancer recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints include iDFS including second primary non-breast cancer, disease-free survival and overall survival.


About Kadcyla
Kadcyla is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) engineered to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to HER2-positive cancer cells, potentially limiting damage to healthy tissues.11,12 It combines two anti-cancer properties joined together by a stable linker: the HER2-targeting properties of trastuzumab (the active ingredient in Herceptin) and the chemotherapy agent DM1.13 Kadcyla is the only ADC approved as a single agent in 104 countries including the US and EU for the treatment of people with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have previously received Herceptin and taxane chemotherapy, separately or in combination. Roche licenses technology for Kadcyla under an agreement with ImmunoGen, Inc.

 Abide’s ABX-1431 is a selective inhibitor of serine hydrolase monoacylglycerol lipase (MGLL), increasing endocannabinoid signaling to restore homeostatic balance in CNS and is evaluated in P-IIa & P-I for Tourette syndrome & neuropathic pain respectively","Abide’s world-class discovery platform is focused on harnessing the therapeutic potential of one of the largest and most diverse enzyme classes – the serine hydrolases (SHs) – with the potential to deliver unprecedented compounds across a broad range of central nervous system (CNS) indications
Abide’s lead product ABX 1431 is a first-in-class inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGLL), modulating the endocannabinoid system. ABX-1431 is in clinical development for Tourette’s (exploratory phase IIa) and neuropathic pain (phase I)
Lundbeck to acquire Abide for USD 250 million in upfront payment and with additional development and sales milestones
Valby, Denmark, San Diego, USA, 6 May 2019 – H. Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) and Abide Therapeutics, Inc. (Abide) today announced signing of a definitive agreement in which Lundbeck LLC has agreed to acquire Abide. Under the terms of the agreement, Lundbeck may pay USD 250 million (approximately DKK 1.65 billion) upfront with a commitment to pay future development and sales milestones to the group of current owners of up to USD 150 million (approximately DKK 1 billion). This acquisition provides Lundbeck a novel discovery platform and a U.S.-based research hub.

Dr. Deborah Dunsire, President and CEO of Lundbeck commented “The acquisition of Abide provides us with a differentiated chemo-proteomic platform to discover new classes of drugs for a broad spectrum of brain diseases starting with those that harness the therapeutic potential of the endocannabinoid system. Abide’s innovative R&D platform provides us with a unique opportunity to strengthen our pipeline now and well into the future, putting Lundbeck in position to deliver multiple new and transformative treatments for brain diseases.”

“Developing first-in-class CNS mechanisms requires in depth expertise across the spectrum of drug discovery and development. Lundbeck’s commitment to brain health convinced us that together this was the best way to attain Abide’s goal to develop novel therapeutics that make a fundamental difference in the lives of patients with a range of neurological and mood disorders. This together with the support for the La Jolla discovery site means that we can continue to leverage the insights of Ben Cravatt’s laboratory at Scripps Research and maintain our outstanding discovery team,” said Alan Ezekowitz, CEO of Abide.

Abide has developed a world class platform to discover potent and selective serine hydrolase inhibitors.
Serine hydrolases are one of the largest and most diverse classes of enzymes found in nature, which include lipases, esterases, thioesterases, amidases, peptidases and proteasesi. In mammals, serine hydrolases represent roughly 1% of all proteins and have vital roles in many pathophysiological processes, including blood clotting, digestion, nervous system signaling, inflammation and cancer.

The lead molecule ABX-1431 is a potent selective inhibitor of the serine hydrolase monoacylglycerol lipase (MGLL) that potentiates endocannabinoid signaling to restore homeostatic balance in the central nervous system. It has the potential to address multiple indications in psychiatry and neurology and is initially being explored in clinical trials as a first-of-its-kind compound for the treatment of Tourette syndrome (exploratory phase IIa) and for neuropathic pain (phase I).

In addition to the clinical and pre-clinical programs targeting MGLL, Abide has a rich pipeline of inhibitors targeting other serine hydrolases that may be pursued as future novel treatments to improve the quality of life for patients living with neurological and/or psychiatric disorders. The chemo-proteomic platform may also be further expanded to characterize other enzyme systems within the serine hydrolase family, leading to the development of additional active agents that modify enzyme function.

After closing, Abide’s laboratory in La Jolla, California will become a U.S. drug discovery hub for Lundbeck.

Deal terms
Lundbeck may pay USD 250 million upfront to the current investors of Abide Therapeutics, Inc. Furthermore, Lundbeck is required to pay up to USD 150 million in future development and sales milestones.

The transaction is expected to be financed by Lundbeck’s existing cash reserves.

Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisors and Goodwin Procter LLP served as legal counsel to Abide. Baker McKenzie served as legal counsel to Lundbeck.

The board of directors of Abide has unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2019, subject to the receipt of customary regulatory approvals, including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S.

Financial guidance
The transaction will not have any impact on Lundbeck’s 2019 financial guidance range provided in February 2019. The expected operational costs related to Abide will be covered within the current guidance range for 2019.

14082,ï»¿Astellas Reports Results of Mirabegron in P-IV PLUS Study to Reduce Overactive Bladder Symptoms in Men,New Data Show Mirabegron Reduced OAB Symptoms in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Currently Treated with Tamsulosin,"The P-IV PLUS study involves assessing of Mirabegron(25mg,50mg) vs PBO in 715 men patients with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms receiving tamsulosin for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to underlying benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) aged ≥40 yrs.
 The P-IV PLUS study results: @12wks. reduction in no. of micturition/day, increment in mean volume voided (MVV)/micturition, reduction in urgency episodes/day, improvements in total urgency and frequency score, TEAEs (25.9% vs 31.4%), no difference in IPSS score is observed
 Mirabegron is a beta‐3 adrenergic agonist targeting CYP2D6 and has received FDA’s approval as monothx. or in combination with solifenacin succinate for the treatment of OAB symptoms, marketed as Myrbetriq in the US","Data Presented at the American Urological Association 2019 Annual Meeting
Astellas Pharma Inc. today announced results from the Phase 4, 12-week PLUS trial, the first large-scale, randomized trial in North America and Europe evaluating the efficacy and safety of mirabegron vs. placebo in men with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms receiving tamsulosin for underlying benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). These two conditions may cause symptoms of urinary urgency and urinary frequency.1 The results were presented during a plenary session at the American Urological Association (AUA) 2019 Annual Meeting in Chicago(LBA-03) on Sunday, May 5.
PLUS is Astellas’ second major trial specifically designed to study the effects of mirabegron in controlling OAB symptoms in men being treated for BPH. The results show that among men with OAB symptoms receiving tamsulosin for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to underlying BPH, mirabegron was statistically superior to placebo as an add-on therapy in reducing mean number of micturitions (episodes of urination) per day, the primary endpoint of the study.2
“Lower urinary tract symptoms are highly prevalent in men over the age of 40.3 Additionally, the overlap of symptoms in OAB and BPH can pose a treatment challenge for clinicians,” said Steven Kaplan, M.D., primary researcher and director at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “These results show that mirabegron has the potential to reduce OAB symptoms in men with BPH currently treated with tamsulosin.”
Patients receiving tamsulosin plus mirabegron experienced a greater mean change in reduction of micturitions per 24 hours from baseline to end of treatment (EOT)
(-2.00 [95% CI: -2.26, -1.74]), compared with those receiving tamsulosin plus placebo (-1.62 [95% CI: -1.88, -1.36]), with a statistically significant adjusted mean difference between groups (-0.39 [95% CI: -0.76, -0.02]. Mirabegron also showed an increase in mean volume voided (MVV) per micturition, a reduction in urgency episodes per day and improvements in total urgency and frequency score vs. placebo. No statistically signficant difference was observed in total International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS).2
Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in post-void residual volume and maximum urinary flow. Overall, 25.9% of patients taking tamsulosin plus mirabegron reported TEAEs vs. 31.4% of tamsulosin plus placebo patients. Drug-related TEAE rates were higher with tamsulosin plus mirabegron patients (11.9%), compared to the tamsulosin plus placebo patients (5.9%). Serious TEAE rates were similar in both groups. Six (1.7%) tamsulosin plus mirabegron patients and one (0.3%) tamsulosin plus placebo patient experienced urinary retention (two tamsulosin plus mirabegron patients required catheterization).2
“As a leader in urology, Astellas is focused on advancing research to identify potential new treatment approaches for urologic conditions in both men and women,” said Eric Guan, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs Americas, Astellas. “Men in particular have remained an under-recognized patient population, though studies suggest about 90 percent of men between 50 and 80 years of age experience lower urinary tract symptoms.1 We are encouraged by the results of the PLUS study as they enhance our understanding of urologic conditions that commonly impact men and shed light on new pathways for further research.”
In the United States, mirabegron is marketed as Myrbetriq®, a beta-3 adrenergic agonist approved by the FDA as a monotherapy, or in combination with the muscarinic antagonist solifenacin succinate, for the treatment of OAB with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency.
About PLUS Study
The Phase 4, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study (North America and Europe) randomized 715 male patients ≥40 years. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirabegron vs. placebo as an add-on therapy for treating OAB symptoms in men concurrently receiving tamsulosin for LUTS due to underlying BPH. Patients were randomized to receive 25 mg mirabegron or placebo at the start of the study, then were titrated at week four to 50 mg mirabegron or placebo equivalent. The primary endpoint was a mean change from baseline to week 12 (end of treatment) in average number of micturitions (episodes of urination) per day based on a 3-day diary.2 For more information on the PLUS trial (NCT02757768), visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/.
About Overactive Bladder (OAB) 
Overactive bladder is a urine storage problem of urgency, with or without urge urinary incontinence (leakage), often with urinary frequency and nocturia.4 It has been estimated by this year, 546 million people worldwide will be affected by OAB.5 For people with OAB, inappropriate signals are sent to the muscles in the bladder causing them to contract before the bladder is full.6 These bladder contractions may cause strong, sudden urges, and a frequent need to go to the bathroom.
Indications and Usage
Myrbetriq® (mirabegron) is a beta‐3 adrenergic agonist indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency.
Important Safety Information
Do not use Myrbetriq in patients who have known hypersensitivity reactions to mirabegron or any component of the tablet.
Myrbetriq can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. Myrbetriq is not recommended for use in severe uncontrolled hypertensive patients (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg). Worsening of hypertension was reported infrequently in Myrbetriq clinical trial patients with OAB.
In patients taking Myrbetriq, urinary retention has been reported in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and in patients taking antimuscarinic medications for the treatment of OAB. A controlled clinical safety study in patients with BOO did not demonstrate increased urinary retention in Myrbetriq patients; however, Myrbetriq should still be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant BOO. For example, monitor these patients for signs and symptoms of urinary retention. Myrbetriq should also be administered with caution to patients taking antimuscarinic medications for the treatment of OAB.
Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with Myrbetriq. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Cases of angioedema have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue Myrbetriq and initiate appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway.
Since Myrbetriq is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure to CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol and desipramine is increased when co‐administered with Myrbetriq. Appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary, especially with narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, such as thioridazine, flecainide, and propafenone.
In clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (> 2% and > placebo) for Myrbetriq 25 mg and 50 mg versus placebo, respectively, were hypertension (11.3%, 7.5% vs 7.6%), nasopharyngitis (3.5%, 3.9% vs 2.5%), urinary tract infection (4.2%, 2.9% vs 1.8%), and headache (2.1%, 3.2% vs 3.0%).
In postmarketing experience, the following events have also occurred: atrial fibrillation, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and dizziness.

Monday, May 6, 2019 – 6:45am
EDT
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both VYNDAQEL® (tafamidis meglumine) and VYNDAMAX™ (tafamidis) for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX are two oral formulations of the first-in-class transthyretin stabilizer tafamidis, and the first and only medicines approved by the FDA to treat ATTR-CM.
Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is a rare, life-threatening disease characterized by the buildup of abnormal deposits of misfolded protein called amyloid in the heart and is defined by restrictive cardiomyopathy and progressive heart failure. Previously, there were no medicines approved to treat ATTR-CM; the only available options included symptom management, and, in rare cases, heart (or heart and liver) transplant. It is estimated that the prevalence of ATTR-CM is approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and only one to two percent of those patients are diagnosed today.
“The approvals of VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX are a testament to the significant research and development investment in our innovative cardiovascular outcomes trial, ATTR-ACT. We are proud to bring these medicines to ATTR-CM patients who are in dire need of treatment,” said Brenda Cooperstone, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer, Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. “VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX reduce cardiovascular mortality and the frequency of cardiovascular-related hospital stays in patients with wild-type or hereditary forms of this rare disease, giving them a chance for more time with their loved ones.”
“Pfizer’s purpose is to deliver breakthrough medicines that change patients’ lives. The approvals of VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX deliver on this promise for patients with ATTR-CM,” said Paul Levesque, Global President, Rare Disease. “This milestone is a gamechanger for patients, who until today had no approved medicines for this rare, debilitating and fatal disease. We will continue to focus efforts on working with the physician community to increase awareness and ultimately detection and diagnosis of this disease.”
The recommended dosage is either VYNDAQEL 80 mg orally once-daily, taken as four 20 mg capsules, or VYNDAMAX 61 mg orally once-daily, taken as a single capsule. VYNDAMAX was developed for patient convenience; VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX are not substitutable on a per milligram basis.
“ATTR-CM is not only fatal, but also significantly underdiagnosed, with some patients cycling through multiple doctors and a myriad of tests over a period of years while the disease progresses,” said Isabelle Lousada, Founder and CEO, Amyloidosis Research Consortium. “ATTR-CM is a rare disease for which more education and awareness is needed. The approval of these medicines represents an important advance for patients; however, it is equally important that we work as a community to recognize the critical importance of early diagnosis.”
The FDA approval was based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT), the first global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study to investigate a pharmacological therapy for the treatment of this disease. In ATTR-ACT, VYNDAQEL significantly reduced the hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations compared to placebo over a 30-month period (p=0.0006). Additionally, individual components of the primary analysis demonstrated a relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization of 30% (p=0.026) and 32% (p
Pfizer is committed to helping eligible ATTR-CM patients who have been prescribed VYNDAQEL or VYNDAMAX gain appropriate access. Pfizer supports patients by helping them understand their insurance coverage requirements and can connect eligible patients with financial assistance resources which may be available including the Pfizer Patient Assistance Program.*
About ATTR-CM
Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a rare and fatal condition that is caused by destabilization of a transport protein called transthyretin, which is composed of four identical sub units (a tetramer). When unstable transthyretin tetramers dissociate, they result in misfolded proteins that aggregate into amyloid fibrils and deposit in the heart, causing the heart muscle to become stiff, eventually resulting in heart failure. There are two sub-types of ATTR-CM: hereditary, also known as variant, which is caused by a mutation in the transthyretin gene and can occur in people as early as their 50s and 60s; or with no mutation and associated with aging, known as the wild-type form, which is thought to be more common and usually affects men after age 60. Often ATTR-CM is diagnosed only after symptoms have become severe. Once diagnosed, the median life expectancy in patients with ATTR-CM, dependent on sub-type, is approximately two to 3.5 years.
About VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine) and VYNDAMAX (tafamidis)
VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine) and VYNDAMAX (tafamidis) are oral transthyretin stabilizers that selectively bind to transthyretin, stabilizing the tetramer of the transthyretin transport protein and slowing the formation of amyloid that causes ATTR-CM.
VYNDAMAX 61 mg is a once-daily oral capsule developed for patient convenience. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX are not substitutable on a per milligram basis.
VYNDAQEL was granted Orphan Drug Designation for ATTR-CM in both the EU and U.S. in 2012 and in Japan in 2018. In June 2017 and May 2018, respectively, the FDA granted VYNDAQEL Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations for ATTR-CM. In November 2018, the FDA granted Priority Review for the new drug application (NDA) for VYNDAQEL.
In March 2019, the Ministry of Labor Health and Welfare in Japan approved VYNDAQEL, under SAKIGAKE designation, for patients with wild-type and variant forms of ATTR-CM. Regulatory submissions for the use of VYNDAQEL in patients with ATTR-CM have been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and are under review.
VYNDAQEL was first approved in 2011 in the EU for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), in adult patients with early-stage symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment. ATTR-PN is a neurodegenerative form of amyloidosis that leads to sensory loss, pain and weakness in the lower limbs and impairment of the autonomic nervous system, Currently, it is approved for ATTR-PN in 40 countries, including Japan, countries in Europe, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Israel, Russia, and South Korea. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX are not approved for the treatment of ATTR-PN in the U.S.
VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine) and VYNDAMAX (tafamidis) Important Safety Information
Adverse Reactions
In studies in patients with ATTR-CM the frequency of adverse events in patients treated with VYNDAQEL was similar to placebo.
Specific Populations
Pregnancy: Based on findings from animal studies, VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
Lactation: There are no available data on the presence of tafamidis in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. Tafamidis is present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX.

About the EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 Studies
EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 are six-month Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled global trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of two doses of galcanezumab-gnlm administered subcutaneously (120 mg or 240 mg once-monthly, following a 240 mg starting dose) compared with placebo in patients with episodic migraine. To be eligible for the trials, patients must have experienced between four and 14 migraine headache days per month. Patients that participated in these trials had an average of 9.1 migraine headache days per month at baseline. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments, including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives), NSAIDs, and acetaminophen during the study. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine headache days over the six-month, double-blind treatment phase.
About Migraine
Migraine is a neurologic disease characterized by recurrent episodes of severe headache accompanied by other symptoms including nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and changes in vision.2,3 More than 30 million U.S. adults have migraine, with three times more women affected by migraine compared to men.4 According to the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, total annual healthcare costs associated with migraine are estimated to be as high as $56 billion annually in the United States, yet it remains under-recognized and under-treated.5

14147,ï»¿Roche Reports Results of Risdiplam in FIREFISH and SUNFISH Studies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy,Roche presents data from the risdiplam pivotal FIREFISH and SUNFISH studies in spinal muscular atrophy at the 2019 AAN Annual Meeting,"The FIREFISH, Part 1 (dose-escalation study) & 2 studies involve assessing of Risdiplam in 21 & 41 infants with Type 1 SMA respectively. Combined results: infants sit with/without support (64.7%); median duration of treatment (14.8mos.); event-free survival overall (85.7%) & (88.2%) in the therapeutically dosed group
 The SUNFISH, Part 1 & 2 studies involve assessing of Risdiplam vs PBO in children and young adults with Type 2 or 3 SMA aged 2–25 yrs. Combined results: @12mos. increment in SMN protein> 2-folds; improvement in MFM32 scale by 3points (58%) including 71% & 42% patients with 2-11 & 12-25yrs. respectively, no treatment-related withdrawal is observed
 Risdiplam is an oral SMN2 splicing modifier, being evaluated for patients with SMA aged 1month to 60yrs. and is developed in collaboration with SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics","In the dose-finding Part 1 of FIREFISH, infants with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy survive and achieve key milestones beyond those expected in the natural history of the disease
New data from the dose-finding Part 1 of SUNFISH reinforce risdiplam as a promising investigational therapy for people with Type 2 or 3 spinal muscular atrophy
No treatment-related safety findings leading to withdrawal seen to date in risdiplam trials
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced new data from the dose-finding Part 1 of the pivotal FIREFISH trial showing infants with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) achieved key motor milestones after one year of treatment with investigational risdiplam.[1] Among the infants who received the dose selected for the confirmatory Part 2 of the study (n=17), 7 (41.2%) were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, assessed by the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III). In addition, 11 (64.7%) infants were able to sit (with or without support) while 9 (52.9%) achieved upright head control after 12 months of treatment as assessed by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 (HINE-2). Finally, 1 infant (5.9%) achieved the milestone of standing (supports weight) by this 12-month time point.
The data were presented at the 71st American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting from 4-10 May in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Roche leads the clinical development of risdiplam, an investigational, orally administered survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for SMA, as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.
“The continued improvements in motor milestones and function in the FIREFISH study to date are meaningful for this typical SMA Type 1 population where the majority of babies started treatment at nearly seven months old,” said FIREFISH study lead investigator Giovanni Baranello, MD, Carlo Besta Neurological Research Institute Foundation, Developmental Neurology Unit, Milan, Italy.* “These encouraging findings further validate a treatment approach that increases survival motor neuron protein in both the central nervous system and throughout the body.”
Part 1 of FIREFISH also assessed motor function with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND), a scale used for infants with Type 1 SMA.[1] Results showed that 10 out of 17 infants (58.8%) in the therapeutically dosed group achieved a CHOP-INTEND total score of 40 points or more.[1] Median change from baseline to month 12 in CHOP-INTEND was 17.5 points. The maximum CHOP-INTEND score was 57 points after 12 months treatment, increasing from a maximum of 49 points after 8 months.[[1]
Among all 21 infants enrolled in Part 1 of the FIREFISH study, the median duration of treatment is 14.8 months, with 19 infants treated for more than 12 months.[2] Three infants experienced fatal complications of their disease after approximately 1, 8, and 13 months of treatment. None of these has been attributed by the investigator as related to risdiplam. No infant has lost the ability to swallow during the study, and no infant has required tracheostomy or permanent ventilation. [2] The event-free survival was 18 out of 21 (85.7%) overall and 15 out of 17 (88.2%) in the therapeutically dosed group. The most common adverse events included fever (pyrexia; 52.4%), upper respiratory tract infections (42.9%), diarrhea (28.6%), vomiting (23.8%), cough (23.8%) pneumonia (19.0%) and constipation (19.0%).[2]
“We are highly encouraged by our latest findings for risdiplam, which take us one step closer to potentially bringing the first oral treatment option to the SMA community,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and head of Global Product Development. “While SMA has seen important advances over the past few years, significant medical need remains for people living with all types of SMA across multiple age groups. We look forward to sharing additional data from our broad development programme for risdiplam as it emerges.”
Roche also presented new data from Part 1 of its pivotal SUNFISH trial in people aged 2 -25 years with Type 2 or 3 SMA. The dose-finding SUNFISH Part 1 includes a particularly broad patient population. Baseline functional status ranged from individuals unable to sit to those capable of walking. Scoliosis ranged from none to severe. As previously reported, a sustained median increase from baseline in SMN protein of greater than two-fold, as measured in blood, was seen after 12 months of treatment with risdiplam.
The most common adverse events in Part 1 of the SUNFISH study were fever (pyrexia; 41%), cough (33%), vomiting (29%), upper respiratory tract infections (26%), persistent sore throat (oropharyngeal pain; 22%) and cold (nasopharyngitis; 20%).[3] The most common serious adverse event that occurred in two of the 51 patients exposed to risdiplam was pneumonia.[3] To date there have been no treatment-related safety findings leading to withdrawal from any study.[2],[3]
An exploratory efficacy analysis of Part 1 (n=51) of the SUNFISH study assessed motor function, using the Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM32) scale. This scale is designed to detect motor function changes in a broad range of patients, from weak Type 2 to strong Type 3 SMA, and is therefore more appropriate for the SUNFISH population. One patient withdrew from the trial during the open-label extension.[3] Among the patients for which the MFM32 scale has been completed at all visits up to month 12 (n=43), 58% saw an improvement of at least 3 points on the scale from baseline, including 71% among patients 2-11 years old and 42% aged 12-25 years.[3]While Part 1 of the SUNFISH study was not designed or powered to detect efficacy, the change from baseline in total MFM32 score is the primary efficacy endpoint in the ongoing Part 2 (n=180) of the trial.
The confirmatory Part 2 portions of the SUNFISH and FIREFISH studies have completed enrollment and will conduct their primary efficacy analyses in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020, respectively.
Roche is planning to include the new data presented at the AAN Annual Meeting in regulatory filings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency during the second half of 2019.

About SMA
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe, inherited, progressive neuromuscular disease that causes devastating muscle atrophy and disease-related complications.[4] It is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and one of the most common rare diseases, affecting approximately one in 11,000 babies.[5] SMA leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscle movement.[6] Depending on the type of SMA, an individual’s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.[7]
SMA is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that results in a deficiency of SMN protein.[6] SMN protein is found throughout the body and increasing evidence suggests SMA is a multi-system disorder and the loss of SMN protein may affect many tissues and cells, which can stop the body from functioning.[8]

About risdiplam
Risdiplam is an investigational orally-administered medicine being studied in a broad range of patients with SMA from 1 month to 60 years of age. It is designed to provide sustained increases in SMN protein centrally and peripherally through daily dosing and is being evaluated for its potential ability to help the SMN2 gene produce more functional SMN protein throughout the body.[9]
Roche leads the clinical development of risdiplam as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics. Risdiplam is currently being evaluated in four multicentre trials in people with SMA:

FIREFISH (NCT02913482) – an open-label, two-part seamless pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study in 21 infants. The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for Part 2. Per protocol, four infants enrolled (“Cohort A”) were required to remain at their low dose for over 12 months in order to evaluate longer term safety at multiple doses. The remaining patients (“Cohort B”; n=17) were allowed by the protocol to more quickly escalate to the expected therapeutic dose selected in Part 2. Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA for 24 months, followed by an open-label extension. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in November 2018. The primary objective of Part 2 is to assess efficacy as measured by the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). Part 2 is ongoing.
SUNFISH (NCT02908685) – a two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal clinical trial in children and young adults (2–25 years old) with Type 2 or 3 SMA. Part 1 determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2. The primary objective of Part 2 is to evaluate motor function using total score of Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) at 12 months. Enrolment for Part 2 was completed in September 2018 with 180 patients randomised and the study is ongoing.
JEWELFISH (NCT03032172) – an open-label exploratory trial in people with all types of SMA aged 6 months–60 years who have been previously treated with SMN-targeting therapy or olesoxime. The study is currently recruiting.
RAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334) – a new trial in pre-symptomatic SMA initiated earlier this year.

14154,ï»¿BioMarin's Palynziq (pegvaliase injection) Receives European Commission's MAA Approval for Phenylketonuria,European Commission Approves Palynziq (pegvaliase injection) for Treatment of Phenylketonuria (PKU) in Patients Aged 16 Years or Older,"The approval is based on P-III PRISM-2 study results assessing Palynziq (pegvaliase injection, 20 & 40 mg) vs PBO in 215 PKU patients with inadequate blood Phe level >600 micromol/L aged >16 followed by an extension study @36mos.
 The collective results: @8wks. maintained mean blood Phe levels (553.0 & 566.3 µmol/L vs 1509.0 & 1164 µmol/L); reduction in blood Phe level, @12mos.& @24mos. (1233 to 565 & 345 µmol/L); @36mos. maintained blood Phe level (341 µmol/L); improvement in inattention and mood symptoms
 Palynziq (pegvaliase injection, SC, qd) is PEGylated recombinant substitute of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme, administered at a dose up to 60mg and has received FDA’s approval for the reduction of Phe level in patients with PKU (Phe level> 600 µmol/L) in May’18","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., May 6, 2019 / BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:BMRN) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for Palynziq® (pegvaliase injection) at doses of up to 60 mg once daily, to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) aged 16 and older, who have inadequate blood Phe control (blood Phe levels greater than 600 micromol/L) despite prior management with available treatment options. Palynziq, a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme, is the first enzyme substitution therapy approved in Europe to target the underlying cause of PKU by helping the body to break down Phe. In addition, the EC acknowledged that the Phase 3 trial and extension study is suggestive of an improvement in inattention and mood symptoms.

 
On March 1, 2019 BioMarin announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), adopted a positive opinion for the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Palynziq. This is BioMarin’s second approved treatment for this rare genetic disease.
PKU is a rare genetic disease that manifests at birth and results in a variety of cumulative toxic effects on the brain and is marked by an inability to break down Phe, an amino acid that is found in most forms of protein. PKU affects approximately 50,000 diagnosed patients in the developed world, and in Europe, approximately 1 in every 10,000 newborn babies are affected by this disease.I Approximately 18,000 patients aged 16 and older are affected by PKU in Europe and the Middle East. Left untreated, high levels of Phe become toxic to the brain and may lead to serious neurological and neuropsychiatric-related issues, affecting the way a person thinks, feels, and acts. Due to the seriousness of these symptoms, in many countries, infants are screened at birth to ensure early diagnosis and treatment to avoid intellectual disability and other complications. According to EU treatment guidelines, PKU patients should maintain lifelong control of their Phe levels.
“The approval of Palynziq is the latest milestone after more than 15 years of an ongoing commitment to the PKU community. BioMarin has brought the only two approved therapies for PKU to patients around the world, and we will continue to draw on our expertise in PKU to advance the standard of care in this serious rare disease,” said Jean-Jacques Bienaimé, chairman and chief executive officer of BioMarin. “Today would not be possible without the efforts of our employees, partners in Europe, patients, families and clinicians. We thank the European Commission for recognizing the vast potential benefits of Palynziq for patients affected by PKU.”
“Palynziq is a new and promising treatment for the PKU community,” said Dr. Amaya Bélanger-Quintana, Head of the Metabolic Department of the University Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain. “Many adult PKU patients struggle daily with their special diet, leading many of them to relax or stop their treatment despite knowing the negative consequences this will have on to their well-being. Palynziq provides a new opportunity for adult PKU patients to attain the metabolic control their doctors and they want for themselves.”
On May 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Palynziq® (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection to reduce blood Phe concentrations in adult patients with PKU, who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 µmol/L on existing management.
The Palynziq EC approval was based on the totality of data from the Palynziq clinical development program including a Phase 3 pivotal study, PRISM-2, which showed that a group of patients taking either 20 mg or 40 mg of Palynziq maintained mean blood Phe levels at 553.0 µmol/L and 566.3 µmol/L respectively after eight weeks, compared to their baseline in the randomized discontinuation trial (RDT) of 596.8 µmol/L and 410.9 µmol/L. The corresponding 20 mg and 40 mg placebo treated groups mean blood Phe levels returned to pre-treatment baseline levels of 1509.0 µmol/L and 1164 µmol/L compared to their RDT baselines of 563.9 µmol/L and 508.2 µmol/L respectively, the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) allows for daily doses up to 60mg. The 8-week PRISM-2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized drug discontinuation trial (RDT) consisted of 86 patients who were randomized to either remain on Palynziq or receive matching placebo.
The approval was also based on data from an ongoing open-label extension study at 36 months, where patients being treated with Palynziq showed a sustained reduction in mean blood Phe over time, durability of response and an increase in participants reaching important blood Phe thresholds. Mean blood phenylalanine levels reduced from 1233 micromol/l at baseline to 565 micromol/l at Month 12 (n=164) and 345 micromol/l at Month 24 (n =90), and these reductions in mean blood phenylalanine levels were maintained through Month 36 (341 micromol/l; n =48). At 36 months, 66% reached Phe levels of ≤360 µmol/L and 72% reached Phe levels of ≤600 µmol/L (the recommended treatment target in the EU). These results were observed concurrent with a median increase in protein intake from intact food of 25g over baseline after 36 months on treatment. In addition, the data collected in the Phase 3 trial and extension study was suggestive of an improvement in inattention and mood symptoms as measured by the inattention subscale of the investigator-rated Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS IV) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) tool that was modified to be specific to PKU (PKU-POMS).
Phase 3 Study Design
The Phase 3 program consists of two studies. PRISM-1 study was a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multi-center study that enrolled 261 patients, and its primary objective was to characterize the safety and tolerability of Palynziq during induction, titration, and maintenance dosing. The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate blood Phe levels during induction, titration, and maintenance dosing to achieve a target dose of Palynziq 20mg/day or 40mg/day.
215 patients who completed PRISM-1 or PAL-003 (Phase 2 long term extension) enrolled into PRISM-2, which included a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injections of Palynziq self-administered by adults with PKU, followed by an open-label extension. The primary efficacy endpoint is change from the RDT baseline in blood Phe at eight weeks.
Patients who reached a target dose and achieved ≥20% decrease in blood Phe from PRISM-1 baseline were randomized into the RDT portion of the PRISM-2 study to either continue their Palynziq dose or to start matching placebo. Those participants not reaching a ≥20% reduction in blood Phe from PRISM-1 baseline did not match the inclusion criteria for the RDT and enrolled into the open label extension portion of the study. In the open-label extension, physicians were allowed to modify dose based on blood Phe response using a range of doses from 5 mg/day to 60 mg/day. Patients were evaluated for safety, changes in Phe levels and neurocognitive assessments focused on inattention and mood symptoms.
About Phenylketonuria
PKU, or PAH deficiency, is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 50,000 diagnosed patients in the regions of the world where BioMarin operates and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme PAH. This enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If the active enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability, seizures, tremors, behavioral problems and psychiatric symptoms. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU under the age of 40 in countries with newborn screening programs are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon after. PKU can be managed with a Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by low-protein modified foods and Phe-free medical foods; however, it is difficult for most adult patients to adhere to the strict diet to the extent needed for achieving adequate control of blood Phe levels.
To learn more about PKU and PAH deficiency, please visit www.PKU.com. Information on this website is not incorporated by reference into this press release.
About Palynziq
Palynziq substitutes the deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme in PKU with the PEGylated version of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase to break down Phe. Palynziq is administered using a dosing regimen designed to facilitate tolerability; Palynziq’s safety profile consists primarily of immune-mediated responses, including anaphylaxis, for which robust risk management measures effective in clinical trials are in place.
The dosing and administration of Palynziq follows an induction, titration, and maintenance paradigm. Periodic blood Phe monitoring is recommended, and patients should be counseled on how to adjust their dietary intake, as needed, based on blood Phe concentrations.
U.S. FDA-Approved Indication
PALYNZIQ® (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection is a phenylalanine-metabolizing enzyme indicated to reduce blood phenylalanine concentrations in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood phenylalanine concentrations greater than 600 µmol/L on existing management.
Important Safety Information
BOXED WARNING: RISK OF ANAPHYLAXIS

Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of PALYNZIQ and may occur at any time during treatment with PALYNZIQ.
Administer the initial dose of PALYNZIQ under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection. Prior to self-injection, confirm patient competency with self-administration, and patient’s and observer’s (if applicable) ability to recognize signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and to administer auto-injectable epinephrine, if needed.
Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to all patients treated with PALYNZIQ. Prior to the first dose, instruct the patient and observer (if applicable) on its appropriate use. Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Instruct patients to carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during treatment with PALYNZIQ.
PALYNZIQ is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the PALYNZIQ REMS. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies, is available at www.PALYNZIQREMS.com or by telephone 1-855-758-REMS (1-855-758-7367).
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Anaphylaxis

Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis reported include syncope, hypotension, hypoxia, dyspnea, wheezing, chest discomfort/chest tightness, tachycardia, angioedema (swelling of face, lips, eyes, tongue), throat tightness, skin flushing, rash, urticaria, pruritus, and gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea).
Anaphylaxis generally occurred within 1 hour after injection; however, delayed episodes occurred up to 48 hours after PALYNZIQ administration.
Consider having an adult observer for patients who may need assistance in recognizing and managing anaphylaxis during treatment with PALYNZIQ. If an adult observer is needed, the observer should be present during and for at least 60 minutes after administration of PALYNZIQ, and should be able to administer auto-injectable epinephrine and call for emergency medical support upon its use.
Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with auto-injectable epinephrine. Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to all patients receiving PALYNZIQ and instruct patients to carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during treatment with PALYNZIQ. Prior to the first dose, instruct the patient and observer (if applicable) on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, on how to properly administer auto-injectable epinephrine, and to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Consider the risks associated with auto-injectable epinephrine use when prescribing Palynziq. Refer to the auto‑injectable epinephrine prescribing information for complete information.
Consider the risks and benefits of readministering PALYNZIQ following an episode of anaphylaxis. If the decision is made to readminister PALYNZIQ, administer the first dose under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis and closely observe the patient for at least 60 minutes following the dose. Subsequent dose titration of PALYNZIQ should be based on patient tolerability and therapeutic response.
Consider premedication with an H1-receptor antagonist, H2-receptor antagonist, and/or antipyretic prior to administration of PALYNZIQ based upon individual patient tolerability.
Other hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions other than anaphylaxis have been reported in 196 of 285 (69%) patients treated with PALYNZIQ.
Consider premedication with an H1-receptor antagonist, and/or antipyretic prior to PALYNZIQ administration based upon individual patient tolerability.
Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction, recurrence of the reaction, and the clinical judgment of the healthcare provider, and may include dosage adjustment, temporary drug interruption, drug discontinuation, or treatment with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (at least 20% of patients in either treatment phase) were injection site reactions, arthralgia, hypersensitivity reactions, headache, generalized skin reaction lasting at least 14 days, pruritus, nausea, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue.
Of the 285 patients exposed to PALYNZIQ in an induction/titration/maintenance regimen in clinical trials, 31 (11%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were hypersensitivity reactions (6% of patients)—including anaphylaxis (3% of patients) and angioedema (1% of patients)—arthralgia (4% of patients), generalized skin reactions lasting at least 14 days (2% of patients), and injection site reactions (1% of patients)
The most common adverse reactions leading to dosage reduction were arthralgia (14% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (9% of patients), injection site reactions (4% of patients), alopecia (3% of patients), and generalized skin reactions lasting at least 14 days (2% of patients)
The most common adverse reactions leading to temporary drug interruption were arthralgia (13% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (13% of patients), anaphylaxis (4% of patients), and injection site reactions (4% of patients)
Blood Phenylalanine Monitoring and Diet

Obtain blood phenylalanine concentrations every 4 weeks until a maintenance dosage is established.
After a maintenance dosage is established, periodically monitor blood phenylalanine concentrations.
Counsel patients to monitor dietary protein and phenylalanine intake, and adjust as directed by their healthcare provider.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Effect of PALYNZIQ on other PEGylated products

In a single dose study of PALYNZIQ in adult patients with PKU, 2 patients receiving concomitant injections of medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension (a formulation containing PEG 3350) experienced hypersensitivity reactions, and 1 of the 2 patients also experienced anaphylaxis.
The clinical effects of concomitant treatment with different PEGylated products is unknown. Monitor patients treated with PALYNZIQ and concomitantly with other PEGylated products for hypersensitivity reactions.

14171,ï»¿Novartis Reports Results of MS Progression Discussion Tool in a Validation Study for Patients with Multiple Sclerosis,Novartis presents first-of-its-kind algorithm-based tool to help MS patients and physicians evaluate and discuss early signs of progression to secondary progressive MS,"The Validation study involves assessing of MSProDiscuss in 198 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or a suspected transition to SPMS across the US, Canada & Germany
 The validation study resulted that MSProDiscuss can differentiate between RRMS and SPMS, utilizing information from the patient’s symptoms experienced in the 6mos., which were further converted into visual output through the algorithm providing physicians with better insights, presented at AAN’19
 MSProDiscuss is an algorithm-based tool, supporting & facilitating physicians & patients to evaluate the risk of transitioning RRMS to SPMS. The tool is housed on neuro-compass, the educational MS site, developed in collaboration with Adelphi Value with its expected WW availability in H1’20","Up to 80% of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS)[1], a stage of the disease leading to continuous functional decline, which is often undiagnosed or diagnosed only retrospectively[2] 
Data presented at AAN show that MSProDiscussTM, a scientifically-validated digital tool, was able to provide information to support differentiation between RRMS and SPMS with high sensitivity and specificity 
These findings support potential use of the tool in clinical practice to help evaluate and discuss early signs suggestive of MS progression, an important step to ensure optimal management of the disease
Basel, May 7, 2019 – Novartis today announced results from a validation study of the innovative, algorithm-based digital solution MS Progression Discussion Tool, or MSProDiscussTM. The tool aims to support and facilitate a discussion between physicians and patients living with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have transitioned, or are at risk of transitioning from relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Diagnosing SPMS can be challenging but if carried out in a timely manner, could help to prevent further irreversible damage[3]. The study findings, presented today at the 2019 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting (AAN) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, support the validity and potential use of MSProDiscussTM to help evaluate and discuss early signs suggestive of progression in clinical practice.
“One of the greatest challenges in MS is diagnosing the transition from RRMS to SPMS as the course of the disease is unique for every MS patient,” said Tjalf Ziemssen, MD, Professor at the Center of Clinical Neuroscience, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, and study investigator. “The study results are a promising step toward having a scientifically-validated tool for clinical use that can facilitate physician-patient conversations and ultimately help to get ahead of MS progression.”
MS neurologists in the United States, Canada, and Germany tested the tool with 198 patients with a diagnosis of RRMS, SPMS or a suspected transition to SPMS[4]. In the validation study, physicians went through a series of weighted questions with the patients based on their experience in the last six months. The questions aim to gather information on symptoms and how they impact daily life and activities. Once completed, the algorithm generated a visual output that the physicians could use to facilitate a discussion around the level of disease progression. The results from the validation study demonstrated that MSProDiscussTM was able to differentiate between RRMS and SPMS patients with high sensitivity and specificity and thus also inform about patients in transition[4].
“With this innovative digital tool, we aim to reimagine clinical practice for neurologists and MS patients. Through harnessing high quality data and analytics, MSProDiscussTM was developed in collaboration with renowned MS researchers, physicians and patients and is a testament to the Novartis commitment to improve the lives of MS patients beyond the development of drugs,” said Danny Bar-Zohar, Global Head of Neuroscience Development, Novartis Pharmaceuticals.
The tool is in final development stage and undergoing pilot-testing in several US centers. The worldwide rollout is planned for early 2020. The tool is housed on neuro-compass, the independent educational MS site, and can be accessed via the link www.msprodiscuss.com.
About MSProDiscussTM
The MS Progression Discussion Tool (MSProDiscussTM) is a physician-completed tool for use in clinical practice to help evaluate and discuss the risk of transitioning RRMS to SPMS with the patient. This tool is for educational and discussion purposes only.
The tool uses information from patient symptoms and impact on daily life experienced in the past six months to generate a traffic light visual output that complements physician discussion regarding patient transition to SPMS.

The tool was developed with Adelphi Value, using a mixed-methods approach, and funded by Novartis Pharma.
About Multiple Sclerosis
MS is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system that affects around 2.3 million people worldwide[1]. There are three main forms of MS: RRMS (the most common form of the condition at diagnosis), SPMS and primary progressive MS (PPMS)[5]. MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss[6].
SPMS follows an initial form of RRMS, which accounts for approximately 85% of all MS diagnoses, and is characterized by gradual worsening of neurological function over time[7]. This leads to a progressive accumulation of neurological disability. There remains a high unmet need for safe and effective treatments to help delay disability progression in SPMS with active disease (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity)[2].
Novartis in Neuroscience
Novartis has a strong ongoing commitment to neuroscience and to bringing innovative treatments to patients suffering from neurological conditions where there is a high unmet need. We are committed to supporting patients and physicians in multiple disease areas, including MS, migraine, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease and have a promising pipeline in MS, Alzheimer’s disease and spinal muscular atrophy.

14186,ï»¿AstraZeneca Reports Results of Calquence (acalabrutinib) in P-III ASCEND Study for R/R Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia,Calquence Phase III ASCEND trial met primary endpoint at interim analysis in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and will stop early,"The P-III ASCEND study involves assessing of Calquence (acalabrutinib, 100mg, q2d) vs Rituximab + Idelalisib/Bendamustine in 310 previously treated patients in a ratio (1:1) with CLL
 The P-III ASCEND study resulted in meeting its 1EPs i.e, improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), increment in the time for the next treatment and is safe & tolerable
 Calquence (acalabrutinib) is a BTK inhibitor, inhibiting its activity in B-cells, currently being evaluated in 26 studies by AstraZeneca & Acerta Pharma and has received FDA’s accelerated approval for MCL with one prior therapy in Oct’17","Calquence significantly increased the time patients live without disease progression
AstraZeneca today announced positive results from the Phase III ASCEND trial of Calquence (acalabrutinib) in previously-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Results showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with Calquence monotherapy compared to a combination regimen of rituximab plus physician’s choice of idelalisib or bendamustine. Importantly, the safety and tolerability of Calquence was consistent with the known profile.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, R&D Oncology said: “Calquence is the first BTK inhibitor to show benefit in a Phase III trial as a monotherapy compared to current standard-of-care combinations used in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We look forward to presenting detailed results at a forthcoming medical meeting.”
Within AstraZeneca’s robust development programme for Calquence, ASCEND is the first of two Phase III CLL trials expected to read out in 2019. The second is ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) in treatment-naïve, front-line CLL. Calquence is currently approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the US, Brazil, the UAE, and Qatar, and is being developed for the treatment of CLL and other blood cancers.
About ASCEND
ASCEND (ACE-CL-309) is a global, randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of Calquence in previously-treated patients with CLL. In the trial, 310 patients were randomised (1:1) into two groups. Patients in the first group received Calquence monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression). Patients in the second group received rituximab plus physician’s choice of idelalisib or bendamustine.1
The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and key secondary endpoints include physician-assessed PFS, IRC- and physician-assessed overall response rate and duration of response, as well as overall survival, patient reported outcomes and time to next treatment (TTNT).1
About Calquence
Calquence (acalabrutinib) was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials
Calquence is an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity2. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.
As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating Calquencein 26 clinical trials that are company-sponsored. Calquence is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma, and multiple myeloma and other haematologic malignancies. Several Phase III clinical trials in CLL are ongoing, including ASCEND, ELEVATE-TN, ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006) evaluating Calquence vs. ibrutinib in previously-treated CLL and ACE-CL-311 evaluating Calquence in combination with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in previously-untreated fit patients with CLL.
About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
CLL is the most common type of leukaemia in adults3. In the US, it accounts for approximately one in four new cases of leukaemia, with the average age at the time of diagnosis being approximately 70 years of age4. In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections3. As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets3. This could result in anaemia, infection and bleeding3. B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.

 Results: reduction in risk of disability progression associated with exposure and lower B-cell levels & permanent disability progression; @24wks. reduction in CDP; @48wks. RMS, PPMS patients with CDP treated with Ocrevus vs switched to Ocrevus, (10.4 %, 43.7% vs 15.7%, 53.1%); @12, 24 & 52 wks. in RMS reduction in nerve cell damage, inflammation biomarker in serum and CSF
 Ocrevus (ocrelizumab, IV) is a mAb targeting CD20+ B cells, administered every 6mos. and is approved in 85 countries including NA, SA, Eastern Europe & EU for both RMS & PPMS","New analyses show the effect of OCREVUS on reducing the risk of disability progression is associated with exposure and lower B-cell levels
Long-term data in RMS and PPMS show that earlier treatment with OCREVUS significantly reduced the risk of permanent disability progression
Over 100,000 people have been treated with OCREVUS globally, in clinical trial and real-world settings; data presented at the AAN Annual Meeting highlights a consistent and favourable benefit-risk profile
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced new OCREVUS® (ocrelizumab) data in relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) were presented at the 71st American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting from 4-10 May in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. New analyses on OCREVUS show its effect on reducing the risk of disability progression is associated with higher exposure to the medicine and lower B-cell levels, and show the positive impact of OCREVUS in significantly reducing disability progression.
With rapidly growing real-world experience and more than 100,000 patients treated globally, OCREVUS is the first and only therapy with six-month dosing approved for both relapsing MS (RMS), (including RRMS and active, or relapsing, secondary progressive MS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Additionally, new safety data presented at AAN representing 4,501 patients with RMS and PPMS and 12,559 patient years of exposure to OCREVUS, across all OCREVUS clinical trials, remain consistent with the medicine’s favourable benefit-risk profile.
“These are the first data to show that higher OCREVUS exposure is associated with greater control of disability progression without impacting safety,” said Stephen Hauser, MD, chair of the Scientific Steering Committee of the OPERA studies and director of the Weill Institute for Neurosciences at the University of California, San Francisco. “These analyses, along with long-term data that show OCREVUS reduced the risk of permanent disability progression, create a compelling case for initiating the therapy early in the disease course and provide important information that clinicians can use to inform treatment decisions.”
New data from pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and exposure analyses – or how OCREVUS is processed in an individual’s body over time – show higher exposure to OCREVUS correlated with lower B-cell levels and lower rates of disability progression in patients. In patients with RMS, OCREVUS reduced the risk of 24-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) at all exposure levels compared with interferon beta-1a. There was lower risk of disability progression with higher exposure to OCREVUS.
A similar pattern was observed for patients with PPMS, in which OCREVUS reduced the risk of 24-week CDP at all exposure levels compared with placebo. OCREVUS reduced T1 gadolinium-enhancing and new/enlarging T2 MRI lesions to nearly undetectable levels in RMS and PPMS patients and reduced annualized relapse rates to low levels (0.13-0.18) in RMS patients across all exposure segments. Notably, safety findings remained consistent across all OCREVUS exposure levels, suggesting that higher exposure does not increase the likelihood of adverse events.
Long-term data, of over five years, from the Phase III OPERA and ORATORIO open-label extension (OLE) trials in RMS and PPMS, show that earlier treatment with OCREVUS significantly reduced the risk of permanent disability progression and this effect was sustained over time. In the OPERA OLE, the proportion of RMS patients with 48-week CDP was lower for those treated with continuous OCREVUS (total of five years on OCREVUS) compared with patients who switched to OCREVUS after two years of interferon beta-1a treatment in the double-blind period (total of three years on OCREVUS) (10.4% vs. 15.7%; p=0.004). In the ORATORIO OLE, the proportion of PPMS patients with 48-week CDP was lower in those treated with continuous OCREVUS over five and a half years compared with patients who switched to OCREVUS from placebo after the 120-week double-blind period (43.7% vs 53.1%; p=0.03).
Additionally, interim results of the Phase III Ocrelizumab Biomarker Outcome Evaluation (OBOE) study show that OCREVUS reduced the presence of a nerve cell damage and inflammation biomarker in serum and cerebrospinal fluid at 12, 24 and 52 weeks in patients with RMS. These one-year data add to the growing body of evidence to identify biomarkers of disease progression in MS and the benefit of OCREVUS on these markers.
OCREVUS is now approved in 85 countries across North America, South America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, as well as in Australia, Switzerland and the European Union.

About multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects up to a million people in the U.S., for which there is currently no cure. MS occurs when the immune system abnormally attacks the insulation and support around nerve cells (myelin sheath) in the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, causing inflammation and consequent damage. This damage can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue and difficulty seeing, and may eventually lead to disability. Most people with MS experience their first symptom between 20 and 40 years of age, making the disease the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in younger adults.
Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of the disease and is characterized by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. Approximately 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. The majority of people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), in which they experience steadily worsening disability over time. Relapsing forms of MS (RMS) include people with RRMS and people with active SPMS who continue to experience relapses. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is a debilitating form of the disease marked by steadily worsening symptoms but typically without distinct relapses or periods of remission. Approximately 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form of the disease. Until the FDA approval of OCREVUS, there have been no FDA approved treatments for PPMS.
People with all forms of MS experience disease activity – inflammation in the nervous system and permanent loss of nerve cells in the brain – even when their clinical symptoms aren’t apparent or don’t appear to be getting worse. An important goal of treating MS is to reduce disease activity as soon as possible to slow how quickly a person’s disability progresses.

About OCREVUS (ocrelizumab)
OCREVUS is the first and only therapy approved for both RMS (including RRMS and active, or relapsing, SPMS) and PPMS, with six-month dosing. OCREVUS is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to target CD20-positive B cells, a specific type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage. This nerve cell damage can lead to disability in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on preclinical studies, OCREVUS binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, and therefore important functions of the immune system may be preserved.
OCREVUS is administered by intravenous infusion every six months. The initial dose is given as two 300 mg infusions given two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as single 600 mg infusions.

14197,ï»¿Sanofi's Dupixent (dupilumab) Receives European Commission Approval for Severe Asthma with Type 2 Inflammation,Dupixent (dupilumab) Approved for Severe Asthma by European Commission,"The approval is based on LIBERTY ASTHMA program including two P-III (QUEST and VENTURE) & one P-IIb studies assessing Dupixent + SOC vs PBO in 2,888 adults and adolescents aged 12+ in patients with severe asthma + type 2 inflammation, characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or fractional exhaled nitric oxide
 Results in patients with eosinophils ≥300 cells/µliter & FeNO levels ≥25 parts/billion: reduction in severe exacerbations (67% & 65%); Improvement in lung function, @12wks. improvement in FEV1 (33% vs 16% & 30% vs 14%) (26% vs 10%), reduction in oral corticoid use @24wks. (70% vs 42%)
 Dupixent (dupilumab,200mg & 300mg) is a biologic, targeting IL-4 & IL-13, marketed as a pre-filled syringe and has received EU’s & FDA approval for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis & asthma respectively"," Only biologic approved in the EU for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation,
as characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled
nitric oxide (FeNO)
 In clinical trials, Dupixent improved lung function and quality of life, and
reduced severe exacerbations and oral corticosteroid use
PARIS and TARRYTOWN, NY – May 7, 2019 – The European Commission has approved
Dupixent® (dupilumab) for use in adults and adolescents 12 years and older as an addon maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by
raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), who are
inadequately controlled with high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus another medicinal
product for maintenance treatment.
“People whose severe asthma is inadequately controlled on current therapy
continue to have trouble breathing and suffer potentially life-threatening
exacerbations. This daily burden and unpredictability can significantly diminish
quality of life, causing missed days of school, work and social activities,” said Tonya
Winders, President, Global Allergy and Asthma Patient Platform (GAAPP).
“GAAPP welcomes the addition of new treatments such as Dupixent, designed to
help those with severe asthma take control of their symptoms and get on with their
daily lives.”
Despite standard-of-care treatment, people with severe asthma often have inadequately
controlled, persistent symptoms that may make them suitable for treatment with a biologic
therapy. These patients live with coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing, and are at
risk of severe asthma attacks that may require emergency room visits or hospitalizations.
In addition to taking maintenance ICS treatment, patients with severe asthma often rely
on oral corticosteroids (OCS) when their symptoms worsen. While OCS can provide relief
for severe symptoms, current asthma guidelines suggest limiting their chronic use to the
most severe patients due to the potential for serious side effects.
“Type 2 inflammation is responsible for many of the hallmark symptoms of asthma
– and Dupixent is the first and only treatment approved for patients in the European
Union with severe asthma characterized by multiple biomarkers of type 2
inflammation,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief
Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “Dupixent is now approved in asthma and atopic
dermatitis, and we continue to study this novel treatment in younger populations
with these diseases, as well as other conditions driven by type 2 inflammation,
including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and food and environmental
allergies.”
Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4)
and interleukin-13 (IL-13), two key proteins that play a central role in type 2 inflammation
that underlies specific types of asthma as well as several other allergic diseases. This
effect is associated with the reduction of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers including FeNO,
immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eotaxin-3 (CCL26).
“Today’s approval marks an important moment for adolescents and adults in the
European Union who suffer from severe asthma with type 2 inflammation,” said
John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. “In clinical
trials, Dupixent not only reduced exacerbations and oral corticosteroid use, but it
also improved lung function and patients’ overall quality of life. Dupixent offers a
new treatment option for those who remain inadequately controlled with current
medications, including those dependent on oral corticosteroids – which may have
potentially serious side effects when used chronically.”
About the LIBERTY ASTHMA Clinical Program
The EC approval is based on clinical data from 2,888 adults and adolescents who
participated in three pivotal trials from the global LIBERTY ASTHMA program, including
the Phase 3 QUEST and VENTURE trials and a Phase 2b trial. QUEST enrolled 1,902
patients with persistent asthma and evaluated whether adding Dupixent to standard-ofcare therapy could reduce severe exacerbations and improve lung function (measured by
FEV1). VENTURE enrolled 210 patients with severe oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma
and evaluated whether adding Dupixent to standard-of-care therapy could reduce the use
of maintenance oral corticosteroids. The Phase 2b trial enrolled 776 adult patients with
moderate-to-severe asthma and evaluated whether adding Dupixent to standard-of-care
therapy could improve lung function.
In these trials, Dupixent:
 Reduced severe exacerbations: In QUEST, by week 52 exacerbations were
reduced by up to 67% compared to placebo in patients with eosinophils ≥300
cells/microliter and up to 65% for those with FeNO levels ≥25 parts per billion. In
the Phase 2b trial, by week 24 exacerbations were reduced by up to 81% compared
to placebo in patients with eosinophils ≥300 cells/microliter.
 Improved lung function: In QUEST, by week 12 Dupixent improved FEV1 by up
to 33% (vs. up to 16% for placebo) in patients with blood eosinophils of ≥300
cells/microliter and up to 30% (vs. up to 14% for placebo) in patients with FeNO
≥25 parts per billion. In the Phase 2b trial, by week 12 Dupixent improved FEV1 by
up to 26% (vs. 10% for placebo) in patients with blood eosinophils of ≥300
cells/microliter.
 Reduced oral corticosteroid use: In VENTURE, by week 24 more than half of
Dupixent patients completely eliminated oral corticosteroids, and overall use
reduced by 70% (vs. 42% for placebo).
 Safety: In asthma clinical trials, the most common adverse reaction was injection
site erythema (redness). Anaphylactic reaction has been reported very rarely in the
asthma development program.
All trials enrolled patients irrespective of minimum baseline type 2 inflammatory
biomarkers, such as eosinophils or FeNO levels. Recently updated Global Initiative for
Asthma (GINA) guidelines characterize type 2 inflammation by eosinophils ≥150
cells/microliter or FeNO ≥20 parts per billion. In these pivotal trials, patients with
eosinophils ≥150 cells/microliter or FeNO ≥25 parts per billion benefited most from
Dupixent. In the Phase 2b trial and QUEST, the greatest improvements in exacerbations
and lung function were observed in patients with higher baseline levels of type 2 disease.
In VENTURE the effect of Dupixent on oral corticosteroid use, exacerbations and lung
function, was similar irrespective of baseline levels of type 2 inflammation.
About Dupixent
Dupixent is also approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe
atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. In October 2018, Dupixent was
approved in the U.S. as an add-on maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-tosevere asthma aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral
corticosteroid-dependent asthma. It is also approved in the U.S. for adults and
adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose
disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those
therapies are not advisable. Dupixent is being developed jointly by Regeneron and Sanofi
as part of a global collaboration agreement.
Dupixent comes in a 200 mg pre-filled syringe for patients with severe asthma or a 300
mg pre-filled syringe for those who have severe asthma and are on oral corticosteroids or
with co-morbid moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It is given as a subcutaneous
injection every other week at different injection sites after the initial loading dose. Dupixent
can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare
professional.
In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are also studying
dupilumab in a broad range of clinical development programs for diseases driven by
allergic and other type 2 inflammation, including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps
(Phase 3 completed), pediatric asthma and atopic dermatitis (6 to 11 years of age, Phase
3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 2/3), eosinophilic
esophagitis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phase 3) and food and
environmental allergies (Phase 2). Dupilumab is also being studied in combination with
REGN3500, which targets IL-33. These potential uses are investigational and the safety
and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Dupilumab and
REGN3500 were invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology that
yields optimized fully-human antibodies.

 The P-II DESTINY-Breast01 study result: met its 1EPs; safe & tolerable as in previous trials; supporting the onset of FDA’s BLA submission in H2’19
 Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (DS-8201) is an ADC, delivers cytotoxic agents to the targeted cancer cell via linker attached to a mAb, currently evaluating in 5 trials for multiple cancer and has received FDA’s BT & MHLW’s Sakigake designation for HER2+ LA/m-breast cancer & adnavced gastric cancer respectively","Pivotal Phase II DESTINY-Breast01 trial met primary endpoint, supporting global regulatory submission plan to start in H2 2019
AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo) today announced positive top-line results for the pivotal Phase II DESTINY-Breast01 trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201). The HER2-targeting antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and potential new medicine was evaluated in patients with HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine.
The response rate in DESTINY-Breast01, as assessed by an independent review committee, confirms in a heavily-pretreated, global patient population the unprecedented clinical activity in the recently-published Phase I trial. The safety and tolerability profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan was also consistent with previous experience. These results are expected to support planned global regulatory submissions, including a Biologics License Application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) anticipated in the second half of 2019.
DESTINY-Breast01 is a pivotal Phase II, open-label, global, multicentre, two-part trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan. The optimal dose of 5.4mg/kg was previously identified in part one of the trial. Today’s results from part two evaluated the efficacy and safety of that dose in patients who have failed or discontinued previous treatment with trastuzumab emtansine.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, R&D Oncology, said: “We are encouraged to see positive data from trastuzumab deruxtecan, with the DESTINY-Breast01 trial now reinforcing what earlier data have shown. We believe this antibody drug conjugate has the potential to redefine the treatment of patients with HER2-expressing cancers, and we are eager to bring it as quickly as possible to patients with refractory HER2-positive breast cancer who continue to have high unmet medical need.”
Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo, said: “These results confirm our commitment to pursue accelerated regulatory pathways in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with trastuzumab deruxtecan. We are more dedicated than ever to our comprehensive and ambitious development strategy evaluating the potential across a spectrum of HER2–expressing cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal.”
Trastuzumab deruxtecan has been granted US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Fast Track Designation for HER2-positive patients in the advanced or refractory breast cancer setting. A recent publication in The Lancet Oncology reported long-term Phase I safety and preliminary efficacy results in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. This potential new medicine is currently in development for the treatment of multiple HER2-expressing cancers, including in patients with HER2-low expression.
AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo plan to present the data from DESTINY-Breast01 at a forthcoming medical meeting.
About HER2
HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein found on the surface of some cancer cells that is associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. To be considered HER2-positive, tumour cancer cells are usually tested by one of two methods: immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). IHC test results are reported as: 0, IHC 1+, IHC 2+, or IHC 3+. A finding of IHC 3+ and/or FISH amplification is considered positive. There are currently no targeted therapies for HER2-FISH-negative, IHC 2+ or IHC 1+ tumours.
Unmet need in HER2-positive breast cancer
Approximately one in five breast cancers are HER2-positive. Several unmet treatment needs remain today in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Many HER2-positive breast cancers eventually advance to the point where no currently-approved HER2-targeting medicine continues to control the disease; after treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine, optimal treatment is less-clearly defined and choices may be limited.
About DESTINY-Breast01
DESTINY-Breast01 is a pivotal Phase II, open-label, global, multicentre, two-part trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate. Secondary objectives include duration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival and overall survival.
The first part of the trial includes a pharmacokinetic stage and a dose-finding stage to identify the recommended dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan to be evaluated in the second part of the trial. The second part enrolled patients into one of two cohorts: patients resistant or refractory to trastuzumab emtansine (part 2a) and patients who discontinued treatment with trastuzumab emtansine for reasons other than resistant or refractory disease (part 2b). Enrolment into DESTINY-Breast01 was completed in September 2018, with 253 patients at more than 100 sites across North America, Europe, Japan and other countries in Asia.
The safety and tolerability profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan in DESTINY-Breast01 was consistent with the recently-publishedPhase I trial, in which the most common adverse events (≥30%, any grade) included nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, anaemia, diarrhoea, and constipation. Cases of drug-related pneumonitis, including grade 5 events, have also been reported in the clinical development programme.
About trastuzumab deruxtecan
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201; [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in the US only) is the lead product in the investigational ADC franchise of the Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise and the most-advanced programme in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic agents to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells.
A broad and comprehensive development programme with trastuzumab deruxtecan is underway in North America, Europe and Asia, including five pivotal trials in HER2-expressing breast and gastric cancers, including in breast cancer patients with HER2-low expression. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is also in Phase II development for HER2-expressing advanced colorectal cancer and metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC, and Phase I development in combination with nivolumab for HER2-expressing metastatic breast and bladder cancers.
Trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in 2017 by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab and have disease progression after trastuzumab emtansine. Fast Track Designation was also granted in the US for the treatment of HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer in patients who have progressed after prior treatment with HER2-targeted medicines, including trastuzumab emtansine. Trastuzumab deruxtecan has received SAKIGAKE designation for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
About the collaboration between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo
In March 2019, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialise trastuzumab deruxtecan as a medicine worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo will be solely responsible for manufacturing and supply.

14226,ï»¿FDA Issues an Alert on Medtronic's Pacemaker or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemaker for its Premature Battery Depletion,FDA Alerts Providers and Patients to Check for Premature Battery Depletion in Certain Medtronic Pacemakers: FDA Safety Communication,"FDA issues an alert to inform patients and health care practitioners about the unexpected drainage of Medtronic’s implantable pacemakers leading to a serious injury or death. The affected CRT-P includes Azure, Astra, Percepta, Serena and Solara models
 The alert is due to three events where device’s capacitor cracked, without any warning to the patient or health care provider. As of April 10, 2019, 131,889 have been sold in the US and doctors were unable to communicate with the device due to battery depletion resulting in loss of pacemaker function leading to dizziness, death, within a year of pacemaker implantation
 Medtronic’s MyCareLink Monitor helps patients to monitor battery status and general functioning of their implanted pacemaker or CRT-P. the device is designed with ~7.5 and 15 years or 6 and 10 years before requiring battery replacement. The US FDA approves enhancement in the device to detect capacitor failures in new devices, reducing the risk of premature battery depletion","Audience:
Patients with a Medtronic pacemaker or cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P)
Caregivers of patients with a Medtronic pacemaker or CRT-P
Cardiologists, electrophysiologists, cardiac surgeons, and primary care physicians treating patients with heart failure or heart rhythm problems using a Medtronic pacemaker or CRT-P
Medical Specialties:
Cardiac Electrophysiology, Cardiology, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Heart Failure

Purpose:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this safety communication to alert health care providers and patients about issues that may cause batteries in certain Medtronic implantable pacemakers or cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-Ps) to drain more quickly than expected without warning patients or health care providers.

Devices:
Medtronic’s implantable pacemakers or cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-Ps) are devices that provide pacing for slow heart rhythms and heart failure. Pacemakers and CRT-Ps are both implanted under the skin in the upper chest area with connecting insulated wires called leads that go into the heart. A patient may need a pacemaker or CRT-P if their heartbeat is too slow (bradycardia) or needs coordination to treat heart failure.
Implanted pacemakers and CRT-Ps have electronics and are powered by lithium-ion batteries. One of the key electronic components is a capacitor, which stores electrical energy.
Patients can use remote monitoring systems, such as Medtronic’s MyCareLink Monitor, to help their health care providers monitor battery status and general functioning of their implanted pacemaker or CRT-P. Health care providers receive CareAlert notifications through manual transmissions from the patient or wirelessly connecting to the patient’s implanted pacemaker or CRT-P when the patient’s device has CareAlerts programmed “ON.” The patient and health care provider receive an Elective Replacement Indicator (ERI) CareAlert notification when the battery level drops below a certain limit.
Affected Medtronic implantable pacemaker and CRT-P device models include:

Azure models: W1DR01, W2DR01, W3DR01, W1SR01, W2SR01, W3SR01
Astra models: X1DR01, X2DR01, X3DR01, X1SR01, X2SR01, X3SR01
Percepta models: W1TR01, W1TR04, W4TR01, W4TR04
Serena models: W1TR02, W1TR05, W4TR02, W4TR05
Solara models: W1TR03, W1TR06, W4TR03, W4TR06
Summary of Problem and Scope:
The FDA is aware of three medical device reports in which a Medtronic implantable pacemaker or CRT-P battery had fully drained because of a crack in the device’s capacitor, without any warning to the patient or health care provider. As of April 10, 2019, 131,889 have been sold in the U.S.
If a capacitor in an implanted pacemaker or CRT-P is cracked, it can create an electric short, which can cause a battery to drain earlier than expected. If the battery is completely drained, the device will no longer deliver pacing therapy. The patients who rely heavily on pacing or who are pacemaker dependent may be most at risk for having an adverse outcome.
In all three medical device reports the FDA received, Medtronic reported that health care providers were unable to communicate with the device due to battery depletion, resulting in loss of pacemaker function. Medtronic also reported these events occurred within one year after the patient was implanted with the pacemaker or CRT-P, on average within seven months of getting the device implanted. The devices are designed to last between approximately 7.5 and 15 years or 6 and 10 years before requiring battery replacement, depending on the device and the amount of pacing. One of the reported events resulted in the death of a pacemaker-dependent patient. In a second reported event, the patient experienced dizziness during follow-up and the health care provider was unable to communicate with the device, which resulted in the patient getting their device replaced. In the third reported event, there was no harm to the patient because the device was not implanted when the health care provider became aware that a connection with the device could not be established.
Steps Taken for Newly-Manufactured Devices
This year, Medtronic received the FDA’s approval for a new step in the manufacturing process developed to better detect capacitor failures and for a different capacitor to reduce the risk of rapid battery depletion in newly-manufactured devices.

Recommendations for Health Care Providers:
Prophylactic removal and replacement of affected devices is NOT recommended, but the FDA recognizes that some patients who depend on pacing for survival may determine, in consultation with you, that device replacement is appropriate for their needs. Consider whether elective device replacement is warranted for any of your pacemaker patients due to pacemaker dependent status or other high-risk features.
Be aware of sudden battery level drops during follow up visits and remote transmissions. Watch for decreases in battery level out of proportion to the life of the device from the time of implant even if the level remains within the normal range.
Advise your patients to continue to use their remote monitors.
For Azure, Percepta, Serena, and Solara devices:
These devices have wireless CareAlerts programmed by the health care provider. The monitor must remain powered on to ensure automatically scheduled transmissions are sent. CareAlerts should be programmed to “ON.”
For Astra devices:
These devices do not have wireless capability and require manual transmission by the patient. To ensure timely transmission of any CareAlerts done manually by the patient, the patient should have a transmission schedule and CareAlerts should be programmed “ON.”
Replace the pacemaker or CRT-P immediately at the time of an ERI alert. Currently, there is not a factor, method, or test to identify when devices with this form of premature battery depletion are approaching ERI, or to accurately predict remaining battery life once ERI appears. Once ERI is reached, an affected device is unlikely to have the standard three months of battery life remaining.
Treat pacemaker-dependent patients with a device that has reached ERI as a medical emergency.
Recommendations for Patients and Caregivers:
Check that home monitoring transmissions are successful and occurring at the prescribed times so health care providers receive notifications of battery level drops to help inform care decisions.
Always keep the remote monitor plugged in.
The remote monitor must remain plugged in to ensure any wireless CareAlerts programmed by your health care provider and any automatically scheduled remote transmissions occur on time.
If you have an Astra device, do the manual transmission according to the schedule provided.
Monitor your MyCareLink Heart App on your smart phone to check for changes to your battery level.
Seek immediate medical care if you feel lightheaded, dizzy, chest pain, severe shortness of breath or if you are caring for someone who has lost consciousness. These may be signs your device’s battery has had a sudden drop or has drained.
Talk to your health care provider about whether your device is affected, how best to manage your medical condition and what actions to take with your device.
Contact Medtronic Technical Services Monday through Friday at 1-800-505-4636 if you have any questions.
FDA Actions:
The FDA will continue to work with Medtronic to monitor affected pacemakers and CRT-Ps for any adverse events related to premature battery depletion. The FDA will keep the public informed as new information becomes available.

Reporting Problems to the FDA:
Prompt reporting of adverse events can help the FDA identify and better understand the risks related to the use of medical devices. If you suspect or experience a problem with these devices, we encourage you to file a voluntary report through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program. Health care personnel employed by facilities that are subject to the FDA’s user facility reporting requirements should follow the reporting procedures established by their facilities.

Novartis to get WW rights of Xiidra and will take ~400 employees associated with the product, with its expected closure in H2’19
 The focus of the acquisition is to strengthen Novartis’ ophthalmic & front-of-the-eye portfolio, allowing Takeda to focus on its key therapy areas i.e, gastroenterology, rare diseases, plasma-derived therapies, oncology and neuroscience
 Xiidra (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution, 5%, q2d) is an eyedrop solution and is approved in the US, Canada & Australia to treat signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and generated a revenue of $0.4B in 2018. Additionally, Takeda also sell rights of its TachoSil to Ethicon for ~400M","Xiidra (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) 5% fits strategically within industry-leading USD 4.6 billion Novartis ophthalmic pharmaceutical portfolio, laying groundwork for front-of-the-eye pipeline products currently in development[1]
Xiidra is the first and only prescription treatment approved for both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with a mechanism of action that targets inflammation[2]
Xiidra achieved USD 0.4 billion of revenue in 2018 and is well positioned for blockbuster potential; closing expected in second half of 2019, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals 
Deal terms include a USD 3.4 billion upfront payment with potential milestone payments of up to USD 1.9 billion
Basel, May 9, 2019 – Novartis announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited to acquire the assets associated with Xiidra® (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) 5% worldwide. Xiidra is the first and only prescription treatment approved to treat both signs and symptoms of dry eye by inhibiting inflammation caused by the disease[2]. The transaction would bolster the Novartis front-of-the-eye portfolio and ophthalmic leadership. Closing of the transaction is expected in second half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. On closing, Novartis plans a smooth transition of operations and integration of Xiidra into its pharmaceuticals portfolio.
Dry eye is a common inflammatory disease that, left untreated, can become extremely painful and lead to permanent damage to the cornea and vision[3]. This damage manifests in the form of signs that can be objectively measured by eye care professionals through various clinical tests (such as corneal staining), and symptoms (such as pain and discomfort). Xiidra, with its anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, is the first dry eye treatment approved to treat both the signs of eye damage and the physical symptoms experienced by patients. Additional benefits of Xiidra, exhibited in phase III studies, include a timely onset of action and well-tolerated safety profile.
“Xiidra, with its unique dual benefits, is an example of the type of innovative advances we invest in for the benefit of patients,” said Paul Hudson, CEO Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “We look forward to leveraging our well-established commercial infrastructure to bring this medicine to more patients.”
In addition to powering Novartis’ ability to serve more patients suffering from eye disease, the additional commercial experience established with Xiidra is expected to better position the company for front-of-the-eye pipeline products currently in development.
Deal terms include a USD 3.4 billion upfront payment with potential milestone payments of up to USD 1.9 billion. As part of the agreement, Novartis will be taking on approximately 400 employees associated with the product.
About dry eye disease
Dry eye disease is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface[3]. In the US, it is estimated that more than 34 million people are impacted by the disease[3]. It is diagnosed by an eye care professional based on patient-reported symptoms such as eye dryness, overall eye discomfort, stinging, burning, a gritty feeling or fluctuating blurry vision, as well as signs of damage to the eye’s surface, which include redness and corneal damage that can be objectively evaluated by an eye care professional through various tests[4]. Dry eye disease can interrupt daily activities such as reading, driving, working, using technology and spending time outside in bright light and cold or windy conditions[3]. Aging and gender (more prevalent in females) are recognized as traditional risk factors of dry eye disease while modern risk factors include prolonged digital/computer screen time, contact lens wear and cataract or refractive surgery[4],[5]. Dry eye may be progressive and is one of the most common reasons people visit eye care professionals[6].
About Xiidra
Xiidra is a prescription eye drop solution designed to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease[2]. It is dosed twice per day, approximately 12 hours apart, in each eye[2]. Xiidra is approved to treat signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in multiple markets including the US, Canada and Australia. It is under regulatory review in a number of additional markets.
Approximately 1000 patients were treated with Xiidra in four vehicle-controlled 12-week trials[2]. Each of the four studies assessed the effect of Xiidra on both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease at baseline, week two, six and 12[2].
In three of the four studies, a larger reduction in the eye dryness score (EDS) was observed with Xiidra at six and 12 weeks[2]. In two of the four studies, an improvement in EDS was seen with Xiidra at two weeks[2]. At week 12, a larger reduction in inferior corneal staining score (ICSS) favoring Xiidra was observed in three of the four studies[2]. The most common adverse reactions reported in 5 to 25 percent of patients were instillation site irritation, altered taste sensation (dysgeusia) and reduced visual acuity[2].

 The SMILE study demonstrated a reduction in both biochemical and severe hypoglycemia (84%) without increasing HbA1c levels, improvement in Time in Range spent by patients using the MiniMed 640G system with SmartGuard Suspend before low
 Medtronic’s SmartGuard technology imitates the function of the healthy pancreas with insulin delivery feature (suspend before low) when the glucose level is approaching to its lower limit, thus preventing hypoglycemic attacks","Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced the publication of the SMILE study in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.1 The SMILE study (Study of MiniMed 640G Insulin Pump with SmartGuardTM in prevention of Low Glucose Events in adults with Type 1 diabetes) is the largest randomized controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the MiniMed(TM) 640G system with SmartGuard(TM) Suspend before low technology compared to insulin pump therapy without continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in decreasing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The study was conducted with adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) prone to severe hypoglycemia, a condition that can cause confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, seizures, and in the worst cases can result in coma or death.
“This new data adds to the robust body of evidence of our insulin pump systems and demonstrates the clinical effectiveness of our SmartGuardTM technology – available both within the MiniMed 640G and the MiniMed(TM) 670G systems. Additionally, these results were achieved with a group of patients that are among the most challenging to treat successfully,” said Dr. Robert Vigersky, chief medical officer, Global Medical and Clinical Affairs for the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. “Medtronic is committed to continuous technology innovation and expanding access to our therapies. These results further support our focus to deliver improved glycemic control while reducing the burden of people living with diabetes.”
The SMILE study was conducted at 16 centers in France, Italy, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Canada, and 153 adults, followed up for 6 months, were included in the study analysis. The MiniMed 640G system with SmartGuard Suspend before low had already been proven to reduce hypoglycemia compared to Sensor-Augmented Pump (SAP) therapy in people with T1D.2,3 Now, the SMILE study demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in reducing hypoglycemia compared to insulin pump therapy without CGM in adults at increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. In addition, the study showed improvement in the amount of Time in Range spent by people using the MiniMed 640G system with SmartGuard Suspend before low versus those using insulin pump therapy without CGM.
The SMILE study outcomes were partially presented ahead of its publication at the 12th International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD 2019), in Berlin, in February 2019. The SMILE study results suggest that the therapy would be clinically beneficial for patients impacted by hypoglycemia exposure.
“The study demonstrated the MiniMed 640G system with SmartGuard Suspend before low was associated with significant reduction in both biochemical and severe hypoglycemia compared to insulin pump therapy. This reduction, including 84 percent fewer events of severe hypoglycemia, was achieved without increasing HbA1c levels. The clinical outcomes improvements were more pronounced during the night, when hypoglycemic episodes are most problematic,” said Professor Emanuele Bosi, from the Diabetes Research Institute, Vita Salute San Raffaele University & San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. “Another important conclusion is that patients using SmartGuard Suspend before low showed less fear of hypoglycemia and higher satisfaction with their treatment. Hypoglycemia unawareness and fear of hypoglycemia has a major impact on people with diabetes and their loved ones’ lives. These results confirm the confidence that I have in this advanced technology, and the improvement it provides to my patients in glycemic control and quality of life.”
SmartGuardTM Technology
SmartGuard is Medtronic’s exclusive technology that mimics some of the functions of a healthy pancreas. Each advancement of SmartGuard technology takes on more tasks of diabetes management to help improve glycemic control. SmartGuardSuspend before low feature suspends insulin delivery when sensor glucose is approaching a pre-set low limit, thus helping to prevent hypoglycemia.
The MiniMed 670G system incorporates the Suspend before low feature into its “Manual Mode” and then advances the technology by automating and personalizing the delivery of basal insulin 24 hours a day. It is the only commercially available technology in the world that proactively minimizes the occurrence of hypoglycemia through automatically adjusting basal rate.

Takeda will focus on its key business areas – Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience. This focus enables Takeda to continue to deliver highly-innovative medicines and transformative care to patients around the world, creating long-term value for Takeda shareholders.

Takeda will receive $3.4 billion upfront in cash and up to an additional $1.9 billion in potential milestone payments from Novartis, and approximately $400 million upfront in cash from Ethicon. Takeda intends to use the proceeds from these divestitures to reduce its debt and accelerate deleveraging toward its target of 2.0x net debt/adjusted EBITDA in the medium term. Takeda is committed to rapid deleveraging driven by strong cash flow and divestiture proceeds, while also simplifying our portfolio.

At present, Takeda does not expect these divestitures to have a material impact on its FY2019 consolidated earnings forecast, scheduled to be announced on May 14th. The FY2019 forecast will be updated at a later date to reflect these divestitures once a reliable estimate of their impact can be made, which will depend upon the exact timing of transaction close.

 

Xiidra® (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) 5% product
Takeda has entered into an agreement to sell Xiidra® to Novartis for a $3.4 billion upfront payment and up to an additional $1.9 billion in potential milestone payments.

14301,ï»¿BMS Report Results of Opdivo + Radiation in P-III CheckMate -498 Study in Patients with Newly Diagnosed MGMT-Unmethylated Glioblastoma Multiforme,Bristol-Myers Squibb Announces Phase 3 CheckMate -498 Study Did Not Meet Primary Endpoint of Overall Survival with Opdivo (nivolumab) Plus Radiation in Patients with Newly Diagnosed MGMT-Unmethylated Glioblastoma Multiforme,"The P-III CheckMate -498 study involves assessing of Opdivo (nivolumab) + radiation vs temozolomide + radiation in patients with newly diagnosed O6- MGMT-unmethylated GBM
 The P-III CheckMate -498 (NCT02617589) study demonstrated that it did not meet its 1EPs i.e, OS and is safe for solid tumors
 Opdivo is PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor and is approved as a monothx. as well as combination therapy with Yervoy in the US & EU, currently evaluated in P-III CheckMate -548 (NCT02667587) study assessing Opdivo with SOC, radiation & temozolomide","PRINCETON, N.J.-Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) today announced the Phase 3 CheckMate -498 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) plus radiation versus temozolomide plus radiation in patients with newly diagnosed O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-unmethylated glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) at final analysis. The safety profile of Opdivo was consistent with previously reported studies in solid tumors. The Company will complete a full evaluation of the data from CheckMate -498 and work with investigators on the future presentation and publication of the results.
“While we are disappointed the CheckMate -498 trial did not meet its primary endpoint, GBM is a notoriously aggressive cancer,” said Fouad Namouni, M.D., head, oncology development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “We are grateful to all those who participated in this trial and remain committed to researching the potential of immunotherapy to address the important unmet medical need of patients who suffer from this devastating disease.”
Opdivo is also being studied in patients with newly diagnosed MGMT-methylated GBM in the Phase 3 CheckMate -548 (NCT02667587) study, in which Opdivo is added to the current standard of care, radiation plus temozolomide.
About CheckMate -498
CheckMate -498 (NCT02617589) is a Phase 3 randomized, multi-center study evaluating Opdivo and radiation versus temozolomide and radiation in patients with newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated GBM. After surgery, patients in the experimental arm received Opdivo every two weeks concurrent with radiation, followed by maintenance with Opdivo every four weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the trial was OS. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, and OS rate at two years.
About Glioblastoma Multiforme
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive type of primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Globally, an estimated 300,000 patients develop, and 241,000 patients die from, brain or central nervous system cancer each year. Standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed GBM can include surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy, but treatment options are limited. The last investigational medicine to improve survival for patients with newly diagnosed GBM was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005. The five year survival rate of patients with GBM is less than five percent.
MGMT methylation status is the most commonly used biomarker in GBM and, studies suggest, may be predictive of the likelihood of patients with GBM to respond to alkylating chemotherapy such as temozolomide. Patients with MGMT-unmethylated GBM are generally known to have a worse prognosis than patients with MGMT-methylated GBM.
Bristol-Myers Squibb: Advancing Oncology Research
At Bristol-Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The focus of our research is to increase quality, long-term survival for patients and make cure a possibility. Through a unique multidisciplinary approach powered by translational science, we harness our deep scientific experience in oncology and Immuno-Oncology (I-O) research to identify novel treatments tailored to individual patient needs. Our researchers are developing a diverse, purposefully built pipeline designed to target different immune system pathways and address the complex and specific interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment and the immune system. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines, like I-O, a reality for patients.
About Opdivo
Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
Opdivo’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 25,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
Infusion Reactions
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
Lactation
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.

An additional treatment modality would provide more flexibility in how patients receive vedolizumab, a biologic with a gut-selective mode of action
Vedolizumab set to be the only maintenance therapy to offer the option of intravenous or subcutaneous formulations for patients with ulcerative colitis
Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review a Biologics License Application (BLA) for a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of vedolizumab for maintenance therapy in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Takeda proposes to make vedolizumab SC available in both pre-filled syringe and pen options.
“Acceptance of this regulatory submission for review brings us one step closer to our goal of better meeting the diverse needs of patients with ulcerative colitis in the U.S. The availability of a subcutaneous option for maintenance therapy with vedolizumab, in addition to the currently approved intravenous formulation, would provide physicians and patients with greater flexibility on route of administration, if approved,” said Uthra Sundaram, Senior Vice President, GI Business Unit, Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.
The application is based on the pivotal VISIBLE 1 phase 3 study, which assessed the safety and efficacy of a SC formulation of vedolizumab as maintenance therapy in 216 adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who achieved clinical response* at week 6 following two doses of open-label vedolizumab intravenous (IV) therapy at weeks 0 and 2.1 The results of VISIBLE 1 were presented at the 2018 United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week Congress in Vienna, Austria.
In evaluating the primary endpoint of VISIBLE 1, a statistically significant proportion of patients receiving vedolizumab SC 108 mg maintenance therapy administered every two weeks achieved clinical remission** compared to patients receiving placebo (46.2% vs. 14.3%; p<0.001) at week 52. A similar rate of clinical remission was observed in the vedolizumab IV 300 mg reference arm (42.6%) at week 52. Furthermore, adverse event rates, including severe adverse events and infections, were similar between the SC and IV groups at week 52. Injection-site reactions were generally mild and experienced by 10.4% of patients in the vedolizumab SC treatment arm (vs. 0% in the placebo group), with none leading to treatment discontinuation.1,2

 
“The VISIBLE 1 study provides us with important knowledge on the characterization of the efficacy and safety profile for the investigational subcutaneous formulation of vedolizumab,” said Karen Lasch, M.D., Medical Head, Specialty GI, U.S. Medical Office, Takeda. “Takeda is deeply committed to bringing innovative medicines and treatment modalities to patients living with gastrointestinal diseases.”
 
* Clinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from baseline (week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point.

** Clinical remission is defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no individual subscore >1 point.

About the VISIBLE clinical trial program
The VISIBLE clinical trial program aims to assess the efficacy and safety of an investigational subcutaneous (SC) formulation of vedolizumab as maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).
 
VISIBLE consists of three phase 3 studies involving over 1,000 UC and CD patients which includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies examining the percentage of participants achieving clinical remission at week 52, and an open-label extension study to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of vedolizumab SC.3,4,5

 

About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).6 Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that are often progressive in nature.7,8 UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.9,10 CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.8,9 UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.9,11 CD commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.7 The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to UC or CD.9,12,13

 

About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation.14 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).15 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.16 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.15 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).15,17,18 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.15
 
Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist.14 Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 260,000 patient years of exposure to date.2
 

Therapeutic Indications (vedolizumab IV)
 
Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
 
Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
 

Important Safety Information
 
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
 
Special warnings and special precautions for use
Vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.
 
Infusion-related reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.
 
Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.
 
Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.
 
Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.
 
Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
 
Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.

In evaluating the primary endpoint of VISIBLE 1, a statistically significant proportion of patients receiving vedolizumab SC 108 mg maintenance therapy administered every two weeks achieved clinical remission** compared to patients receiving placebo (46.2% vs. 14.3%; p<0.001) at week 52. A similar rate of clinical remission was observed in the vedolizumab IV 300 mg reference arm (42.6%) at week 52. Furthermore, adverse event rates, including severe adverse events and infections, were similar between the SC and IV groups at week 52. Injection-site reactions were generally mild and experienced by 10.4% of patients in the vedolizumab SC treatment arm (vs. 0% in the placebo group), with none leading to treatment discontinuation.1,2

 
“The VISIBLE 1 study provides us with important knowledge on the characterization of the efficacy and safety profile for the investigational subcutaneous formulation of vedolizumab,” said Karen Lasch, M.D., Medical Head, Specialty GI, U.S. Medical Office, Takeda. “Takeda is deeply committed to bringing innovative medicines and treatment modalities to patients living with gastrointestinal diseases.”
 
* Clinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from baseline (week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point.

** Clinical remission is defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no individual subscore >1 point.

About the VISIBLE clinical trial program
The VISIBLE clinical trial program aims to assess the efficacy and safety of an investigational subcutaneous (SC) formulation of vedolizumab as maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).
 
VISIBLE consists of three phase 3 studies involving over 1,000 UC and CD patients which includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies examining the percentage of participants achieving clinical remission at week 52, and an open-label extension study to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of vedolizumab SC.3,4,5

 

About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).6 Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that are often progressive in nature.7,8 UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.9,10 CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.8,9 UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.9,11 CD commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.7 The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to UC or CD.9,12,13

 

About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation.14 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).15 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.16 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.15 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).15,17,18 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.15
 
Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist.14 Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 260,000 patient years of exposure to date.2
 

Therapeutic Indications (vedolizumab IV)
 
Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
 
Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
 

Important Safety Information
 
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
 
Special warnings and special precautions for use
Vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.
 
Infusion-related reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.
 
Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.
 
Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.
 
Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.
 
Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
 
Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.

14334,ï»¿Boston Scientific to Acquire Vertiflex for its Superion Indirect Decompression System,"Boston Scientific Announces Agreement To Acquire Vertiflex, Inc.","Boston acquires Vertiflex, in all-stock transaction. Vertiflex to receive $465M upfront and commercial milestones for 3yrs. with the expected closure of acquisition in Q2’19
 The focus of the acquisition is to expand Boston’s interventional pain therapies portfolio with the addition of Vertiflex’s Superion Indirect Decompression System
 The Superion Systems creates space between spinous processes of the vertebra, proven to be durable for up to 48mos., providing patients with a reduction in leg pain by 79% and has received FDA’s approval in 2015 for patients with moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis","Acquisition of lumbar spinal stenosis treatment to expand the portfolio of interventional pain therapies
Boston Scientific (NYSE: BSX) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Vertiflex, Inc., a privately-held company which has developed and commercialized the Superion® Indirect Decompression System, a minimally-invasive device used to improve physical function and reduce pain in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The procedure – primarily performed by physicians who treat chronic pain patients with therapies including spinal cord stimulation and radiofrequency ablation – is expected to reach $60 million in sales in 2019. The transaction consists of $465 million in upfront cash and additional payments contingent on commercial milestones for the next three years.
As many as six million people in the U.S. suffer from LSS, the narrowing of the spinal canal, which can cause compression of nearby nerves and result in significant low back and leg pain, disability, functional impairment and diminished quality of life.1
The Superion System – approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 for patients with moderate degenerative LSS – creates space between the spinous processes of the vertebrae. The creation of this space reduces pressure on the nerves and can thereby improve patient mobility and relieve pain, numbness and cramping in the legs. This procedure is a treatment option for patients who have not responded positively to first-line therapies, such as oral pain medication and steroid injections, but do not have severe enough symptoms to require spinal fusion or laminectomy.
“The acquisition of Vertiflex and the Superion System will further our category leadership strategy by expanding the breadth of our pain management product offerings,” said Maulik Nanavaty, president, Neuromodulation, Boston Scientific. “The addition of this differentiated technology, along with our leading spinal cord stimulation and radiofrequency ablation technologies, will provide physicians with the widest variety of solutions available to manage the growing number of patients suffering from chronic pain.”
The Superion System was shown to be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with moderate degenerative LSS in the pivotal, two-year, randomized trial with approximately 400 patients which supported FDA approval.2 These patients were followed for five years and final follow-up with more than 80 patients demonstrated 84 percent of patients treated with the Superion System experienced clinical success on at least two of three questionnaire measures of symptom severity, physical function and patient satisfaction. Additionally, 90 percent of patients were satisfied with the treatment, and the therapy successfully treated leg pain in 80 percent of patients in the long-term follow-up cohort.3 Recently published data also showed an 85 percent decrease in the proportion of patients who were using opioids five years after being treated with the Superion System.4
“Five-year clinical data and real-world experience with the Superion System demonstrate that this minimally invasive and reversable procedure – done without destabilizing the spine – can offer patients safe, long-term pain relief with a relatively rapid recovery time,” said Earl Fender, president and CEO of Vertiflex. “We are proud of the clinical and commercial successes we’ve been able to achieve and look forward to continued adoption of the therapy with the global resources and clinical expertise of the Boston Scientific pain management franchise.”
The transaction is expected to be immaterial to adjusted earnings per share in 2019 and 2020, and accretive thereafter. On a GAAP basis, the transaction is expected to be less accretive, or more dilutive as the case may be, due to amortization expense and acquisition-related net charges. The acquisition is projected to close late in the second quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.
Vertiflex, founded in 2005, is based in Carlsbad, CA and has approximately 100 employees. Additional information about Vertiflex and the Superion System can be found at www.vertiflex.com.

14342,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Roxadustat in Global Phase III Programme for Cardiovascular Safety in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease,Pooled analyses of the roxadustat global Phase III programme confirmed cardiovascular safety,"The P-III global programme involves assessing of Roxadustat vs PBO & epoetin alfa in 9,000+ patients with anemia + CKD not on dialysis (NDD) , dialysis-dependent (DD), ID respectively
 Pooled analyses results: MACE/MACE+ in NDD & DD patients, clinically no difference; MACE/MACE+ in ID patients shows better results
 Roxadustat is hypoxia-inducible-factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, evaluated under the collaboration of AstraZeneca, FibroGen and Astellas with its expected FDA’s regulatory submission in H2’19","Cardiovascular safety endpoints evaluated across CKD patients
not on dialysis, on incident dialysis and on stable dialysis
Better outcome vs. epoetin alfa in incident-dialysis patients
and comparable to placebo in patients not on dialysis
AstraZeneca today announced top-line results from the pooled cardiovascular (CV) safety analyses of the global Phase III programme for roxadustat, a first-in-class hypoxia-inducible-factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI). The global pivotal Phase III trials evaluated roxadustat for treatment of anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) across the non-dialysis-dependent (NDD), incident (newly-initiated) dialysis (ID), and stable dialysis patient groups.
These pooled CV safety assessments of roxadustat are part of the overall benefit/risk assessment that will inform discussions with regulatory authorities. One of the key CV safety endpoints is major adverse CV events (defined as MACE), evaluating a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction in pooled analyses comparing roxadustat vs. placebo in NDD and vs. epoetin alfa in dialysis-dependent (DD) patients. Another key CV safety endpoint evaluated MACE plus heart failure requiring hospitalisation and unstable angina requiring hospitalisation (defined as MACE+).
Pooled MACE/MACE+ in NDD patients
In the pooled analysis of over 4,300 patients, and based on the totality of the adjudicated evidence, the MACE/MACE+ analyses between roxadustat and placebo showed no clinically-meaningful difference.
Pooled MACE/MACE+ in ID patients
In the pool of 1,500 ID patients, a pre-specified sub-population of DD patients, MACE/MACE+ results indicate that ID patients on roxadustat do better than those who are on epoetin alfa. ID patients are a better population to compare roxadustat vs. epoetin alfa than the stable dialysis population, where patients are stable not only on dialysis but also on erythropoietin.
Pooled MACE/MACE+ in DD patients
In the pooled analysis of around 4,000 patients, and based on the totality of the adjudicated evidence, the MACE/MACE+ analyses between roxadustat and epoetin alfa showed no clinically-meaningful difference.
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, R&D BioPharmaceuticals, said: “We are pleased to report these data from the largest clinical programme in the world evaluating this new class of medicines. These results add to the growing body of positive evidence to support roxadustat for the treatment of anaemia in chronic kidney disease patients, following our announcement that the primary efficacy endpoints were met for the OLYMPUS and ROCKIES trials in December 2018. There is a significant unmet medical need among patients living with chronic kidney disease, and we look forward to working with FibroGen to prepare for regulatory submissions of roxadustat.”
Further analyses of overall safety are ongoing and will inform the benefit/risk profile.
AstraZeneca and FibroGen Inc. (FibroGen) will begin discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prepare for regulatory submission, which is anticipated in the second half of 2019. Roxadustat is currently approved in China for the treatment of patients with anaemia in DD CKD.
About roxadustat
Roxadustat is a HIF-PHI that promotes erythropoiesis by increasing endogenous production of erythropoietin and improving iron regulation and overcoming the negative impact of inflammation on haemoglobin synthesis and red blood-cell production by downregulating hepcidin. Use of roxadustat has been shown to induce coordinated erythropoiesis, increasing red blood-cell count while maintaining plasma erythropoietin levels within or near normal physiologic range, in multiple subpopulations of CKD patients, including in the presence of inflammation and without a need for supplemental intravenous iron.
About the global Phase III clinical programme
FibroGen, the originator, and AstraZeneca are collaborating on the development and commercialisation of roxadustat for the treatment of anaemia in patients with CKD in the US, China, and other global markets. FibroGen and Astellas Pharma Inc. (Astellas) are collaborating on the development and commercialisation of roxadustat for the treatment of anaemia in patients with CKD in territories including Japan, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East, and South Africa.
The global Phase III programme consists of more than 9,000 patients and was conducted by AstraZeneca, FibroGen and Astellas.
The OLYMPUS, ALPS and ANDES trials evaluated roxadustat vs. placebo in NDD patients; HIMALAYAS evaluated roxadustat vs. epoetin alfa in ID patients; and ROCKIES, SIERRAS and PYRENEES evaluated roxadustat vs. epoetin alfa in DD patients.
The AstraZeneca-sponsored trial OLYMPUS demonstrated a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in haemoglobin vs. placebo in NDD patients. The AstraZeneca-sponsored trial ROCKIES demonstrated a statistically-significant improvement in haemoglobin vs. epoetin alfa in DD patients.
In the CV pooled safety analyses, safety was characterised based on a number of key CV analyses from the Phase III programme, including MACE outcomes and MACE+ outcomes (MACE plus hospitalisation for unstable angina and hospitalisation for heart failure outcomes). Overall, the analyses will evaluate the totality of evidence for roxadustat and assess the overall benefit-risk profile, to overcome potential bias of a single-arm trial analysis.
About anaemia in CKD
Anaemia can be a serious medical condition in which patients have insufficient red blood cells and low levels of haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.1,2 Anaemia in CKD is associated with increased risk of hospitalisation, CV complications and death,3 also frequently causing significant fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and decreased quality of life.4 Severe anaemia is common in patients with CKD, cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, inflammatory diseases and other serious illnesses.
Anaemia is particularly prevalent in patients with CKD, which affects more than 200 million patients worldwide and is generally a progressive disease characterised by gradual loss of kidney function that may eventually lead to kidney failure.
In the US, according to the United States Renal Data System, a majority of dialysis-eligible CKD patients are currently on dialysis. Of the approximately 507,000 patients receiving dialysis in the US as of 2016, approximately 80% were being treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) for anaemia.5 Patients seldom receive ESA treatment until they initiate dialysis therapy.

14390,ï»¿Boston Scientific Reports Results of Emblem S-ICD System in UNTOUCHED Study to Prevent Sudden Cardiac Death,Late-Breaking Trial Data Highlight Continued Clinical Success Of Boston Scientific EMBLEM™ S-ICD System,"The UNTOUCHED study involves assessing Emblem Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD) system in 1,116 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35% + ischemic heart disease
 The UNTOUCHED study results: complication-free rate (95.8%) @30days post-procedure; induced ventricular fibrillation rates (99.2%); patients performed using a two-incision technique (69%); mean implant time (55.8 mins.)
 Emblem S-ICD system is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, designed to treat & monitor heart rhythm problems and is implanted just under the skin with no wires touching the heart, eliminating the risk associated with electrical wires inside the heart or blood vessels","SAN FRANCISCO and MARLBOROUGH, Mass., May 10, 2019 /- Boston Scientific (NYSE: BSX) today announced acute results from the UNTOUCHED study evaluating safety and efficacy of the EMBLEM™ Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD) System for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death specifically in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%, the most common population to be indicated for ICD therapy.1,2 The data were presented during a late-breaking clinical trial at Heart Rhythm 2019, the Heart Rhythm Society’s 40th Annual Scientific Sessions in San Francisco, and demonstrated S-ICD therapy had a complication-free rate of 95.8% at 30 days post-procedure and high conversion efficacy (99.2%) of induced ventricular fibrillation, rates comparable to those seen in previous S-ICD and transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (TV-ICD) studies. The analysis was also published online today in the Heart Rhythm Journal.
The UNTOUCHED study authors also reviewed procedure techniques and 30-day outcomes in patients implanted with the EMBLEM S-ICD System and found that the majority (69%) of procedures were performed using a two-incision technique. The two-incision technique data demonstrated a mean implant time of 55.8 minutes, which was 8 minutes faster than the mean 63.8 minutes for procedures that leveraged a three-incision implant technique, with comparable complication and conversion success rates.
“We found that the complication rate within this primary prevention population was as low as in prior S-ICD registries, despite the patients having much lower LVEF, more hypertension, and diabetes – underscoring that sicker patients do well with this device for the prevention of sudden death,” said Lucas V.A. Boersma, M.D., Ph.D., study principal investigator and electrophysiologist at St. Antonius Hospital, the Netherlands. “These acute outcomes also validate the advantages of the two-incision implant technique, which has continued to gain worldwide adoption in the last few years.”
The global, prospective, non-randomized study evaluated data from 1,116 patients with a low LVEF, the majority of whom (54%) had ischemic heart disease.
“The data presented today reiterate the value of the EMBLEM S-ICD System for a broad group of ICD-indicated patients, enabling them to avoid the long-term complications associated with TV-ICD leads,” said Kenneth Stein, M.D., senior vice president and chief medical officer, Global Health Policy and Rhythm Management, Boston Scientific. “We remain proud of the clinical success of the S-ICD System, which has now been implanted in nearly 60,000 patients worldwide, and we will continue to invest in clinical studies that advance our understanding of the role of the device in patients at risk of sudden cardiac death.”
The final results of the UNTOUCHED study, including an analysis comparing inappropriate shock rates of the S-ICD to rates found in previous TV-ICD studies, will be reported after 18-months of patient follow-up.

14395,The US FDA Issues Final Guidance on Interchangeable Biosimilars,"Statement from Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D., on policy advancements to help bring interchangeable biosimilars to market","The US FDA finalizes its guidance on interchangeability of a biosimilar with its reference biologic, which means it may be substituted without prescriber intervening
 The final guidance provides clarity to the developers that the proposed biological product should meet the interchangeability standard under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act)
 Till date, the US FDA has licensed 19 Biosimilars as a part of Biosimilars Action Plan, targeted for patients’ access to lower-cost options","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plays an important role in helping to address the high cost of medicines through the development of science-based policies that can improve competition and patient access to safe and effective, high-quality and lower cost generic drugs, biosimilars and interchangeable biologics.
Today, the FDA is taking a significant action that will help promote competition in the biologic market by providing final guidance on the pathway for “interchangeable” biologics, which may be substituted without the involvement of the prescriber, similar to how generic drugs are routinely substituted for brand name drugs when they are prescribed for patients. Biologics provide important treatment options for patients with serious diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The FDA’s final guidance on interchangeability will provide clarity for developers who want to demonstrate that their proposed biological product meets the statutory interchangeability standard under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).
In the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), Congress created an approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA approved biological brand (or reference) product. This pathway is intended to benefit patients by making more treatment options available through biosimilar and interchangeable products, by increasing access to life-saving medications and potentially lowering health care costs through competition. Because well-functioning biosimilar and interchangeable pathways are critical to the agency’s broader efforts to improve competition, the FDA has developed and is working to implement a Biosimilars Action Plan that includes a suite of ongoing efforts to encourage innovation and competition among biologics and the development of biosimilars.
Today’s final guidance gives an overview of important scientific considerations in demonstrating interchangeability with a reference product and explains the scientific recommendations for an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Once an application or supplement seeking licensure as an interchangeable product is submitted, the FDA will approve the biological product as interchangeable with the reference product if the information submitted in the application or the supplement is sufficient to meet the applicable statutory standard: among other things, that the biological product is biosimilar to the reference product and can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. The guidance also explains potential ways to address the BPCI Act requirement for interchangeability that, for a biological product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product will not be greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
The final interchangeability guidance is informed by the FDA’s cumulative experience providing development-stage advice to sponsors of proposed interchangeable products. The FDA meets regularly with sponsors of proposed interchangeable products through the agency’s Biosimilar Product Development Program. The agency also considered the numerous comments on the draft interchangeability guidance and made changes to provide increased clarity to stakeholders. Our rigorous scientific standards for approval will be maintained for interchangeable biologics and should serve as assurance to health care professionals and patients that they can be confident in the safety and effectiveness of both interchangeable products and biosimilar products, just as they would be for reference products.
Separately, and of particular importance to the millions of Americans with diabetes, the final interchangeability guidance will help enable biosimilar or interchangeable insulin products to come to market in the future. There are currently no approved insulin products that can be substituted at the pharmacy level. But, under the BPCI Act, on March 23, 2020, insulin and other biological products that were approved as drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will be deemed biological products licensed and regulated under the PHS Act. After this transition, the FDA will be able to license biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products that meet the requirements of the PHS Act, and today’s guidance will, among other things, help developers seek licensure for such products.
An interchangeable insulin product may be substituted at the pharmacy, potentially leading to increased access and lower costs for patients. For chronically used biologic medications patients get at the pharmacy, such as insulin, the ability to have a licensed interchangeable that can be substituted at the pharmacy without the intervention of the prescribing health care professional – much like how generic drugs are routinely substituted for brand name drugs – could be integral to the success of reducing drug prices for patients.
Next week, the agency will hear from patients, advocates and industry about what factors the agency should consider when evaluating data and other information submitted by an applicant, including from analytical and clinical studies, to determine whether an insulin product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product. We also expect to hear stakeholder feedback on whether certain insulin products – for example, those that use insulin pumps for continuous subcutaneous infusion among the approved uses – raise unique scientific considerations that we should be considering when evaluating biosimilar or interchangeable insulin products. And importantly, we’ll also be seeking input directly from patients about their experience with insulin products and this input will inform the FDA’s approach to implementing the regulatory pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products.
In advancing the broader policy efforts for biosimilar and interchangeable products, soon we will also be issuing additional guidance on the agency’s recommendations on the design and evaluation of comparative analytical studies and other important scientific considerations needed to support a demonstration that a biological product is biosimilar to a reference product. This data will help build the foundation for a development program for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product.
To date, the FDA has already licensed 19 biosimilar products, which should help strengthen competition in the biologic market. This, and other work we are undertaking as part of the Biosimilars Action Plan, is building a solid regulatory foundation for the review and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biologics designed to improve patient access to lower-cost options.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

 The cobas MTB test allows the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) DNA, cobas MAI test allows direct detection and differentiation of M.avium and M. intracellulare DNA in symptomatic patients from their raw sputum, sputum sediment and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sediment samples
 The cobas MTB-RIF/INH test is used for the detection of mutation associated with resistance to antibiotics rifampicin and isoniazid in tuberculosis","New tests on cobas 6800/8800 systems provide clinicians information to help speed treatment and reduce the spread of infection
Rising challenge of drug resistance compounds the tuberculosis global health crisis
Mycobacteria test menu allows detection of tuberculosis, drug resistant tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria infections from single patient sample
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the CE-IVD launch of the cobas® MTB-RIF/INH test to detect resistance to antibiotics within tuberculosis DNA. This assay is part of the mycobacteria test menu that includes the cobas® MTB and cobas® MAI tests for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems. This continues the expansion of the testing menu on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems, supporting true consolidation and efficient testing.
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide.1,2 The rising challenge of drug resistance compounds the tuberculosis global health crisis. The high sensitivity of the cobas MTB test enables increased detection of tuberculosis in challenging smear-negative samples. A complete mycobacteria test menu provides the flexibility to detect a combination of tuberculosis, drug resistant tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria infections from a single patient sample. This provides important information for patient care decisions.
“With the addition of cobas MTB-RIF/INH to the mycobacteria test menu, we are able to equip laboratories with flexible, sensitive solutions to best help them diagnose tuberculosis, which is difficult to detect,” said Michael Heuer, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “This menu approach not only aids healthcare providers in addressing the global health challenge that tuberculosis presents, but also provides clinicians the valuable information they need to properly diagnose these respiratory infections to speed treatment and reduce the spread of infection.”
The fully automated cobas 6800/8800 Systems offer the fastest time to results with the highest throughput and the longest walk-away time available among automated molecular platforms, providing laboratories with improved operating efficiency and the flexibility to adapt to changing testing demands.

About the Mycobacteria assay portfolio
The cobas MTB test enables the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) DNA, while the cobas MAI test enables the direct detection and differentiation of Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare DNA in symptomatic patients. The cobas MTB-RIF/INH test detects mutations associated with resistance to antibiotics rifampicin and isoniazid within tuberculosis DNA. All mycobacteria tests have been validated for use with raw sputum, sputum sediment and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sediment samples.

About Mycobacterium tuberculosis
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 1.7 billion people are infected with tuberculosis, with an estimated 10 million new active tuberculosis infections and 1.6 million deaths in 2017.1 This includes approximately 920,000 tuberculosis infections in people living with HIV/AIDS and 300,000 deaths in this population.1

About Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium avium
Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare are two closely related, distinct species of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which comprise the M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC), and may also be grouped together as M. avium intracellulare (MAI). Although NTM can colonize body surfaces and secretions without causing disease, they have been associated with four distinct clinical syndromes; progressive pulmonary disease, disseminated disease in severely immunocompromised patients, and skin and soft tissue infection usually as a consequence of direct inoculation.3

14411,ï»¿Regeneron's Eylea (aflibercept) Injection Receives FDA's Approval for Diabetic Retinopathy,FDA APPROVES EYLEA (AFLIBERCEPT) INJECTION FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY,"The approval is based on P-III PANORAMA study results assessing Eylea (q8w, q16w) vs sham in 402 patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) without diabetic macular edema (DME)
 The P-III PANORAMA study results: improvement on DRSS score by ≥2‑step (80%,65% vs 15%); @q16w & @q8w, reduction in risk (85% & 88%); @q8w, improvement in diabetic retinopathy (80%) respectively
 Eylea (aflibercept, q8w & q16w) injection is a VEGF inhibitor, blocking the growth of new blood vessels, reduces vascular permeability in the eye by targeting VEGF-A & PLGF and has received FDA’s approval for multiple indications including wet age-related macular degeneration and DR with DME","May 13, 2019 –
EYLEA improves diabetic retinopathy and prevents worsening disease that can lead to blindness
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among working-aged American adults
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection to treat all stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and thereby reduce the risk of blindness.
“Millions of people have been robbed of their vision due to the progression of diabetic retinopathy,” said David Brown, M.D., F.A.C.S., an investigator for the PANORAMA trial and Director of Research at Retina Consultants of Houston. “The prevention of worsening diabetic retinopathy with EYLEA provides a compelling rationale for early treatment of patients with this disease, particularly since eyes dosed with EYLEA as infrequently as every 16 weeks showed significant improvements in the pivotal PANORAMA trial.”
Approximately eight million people live with DR, a complication of diabetes characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the retina. The disease generally starts as non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and often has no warning signs or symptoms. Over time, NPDR often progresses to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a stage in which abnormal blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina and into the vitreous cavity, potentially causing severe vision loss.
“With today’s FDA approval, EYLEA has once again set a high bar for the treatment of diabetic eye diseases. The PANORAMA trial showed that by one year 20% of untreated patients developed proliferative diabetic eye disease, and EYLEA reduced this risk by 85% to 88% when administered using an every 16-week or eight-week dosing regimen, respectively,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “In fact, 80% of patients who received the EYLEA eight-week dosing regimen had significant improvement in their diabetic retinopathy.”
EYLEA is the only vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor approved with two dosing options for DR, allowing doctors to customize treatment to their patients’ needs. In DR, EYLEA may be dosed every eight weeks following five initial monthly injections, or every four weeks.
About the PANORAMA trial
The FDA approval of EYLEA as a treatment for DR was based on six-month and one-year results from PANORAMA, a randomized, multi-center, controlled Phase 3 trial that enrolled 402 patients and was designed to investigate EYLEA for the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR without diabetic macular edema (DME), compared to sham injection. PANORAMA is the first prospective trial to study whether an anti-VEGF can also help prevent worsening disease in patients with NPDR without DME.
Details on trial design included:

Three treatment arms – An observational sham injection group and two EYLEA treatment groups. EYLEA was dosed every eight weeks (following five initial monthly doses) or every 16 weeks (following three initial monthly doses and one eight-week interval).
Primary endpoint – The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a two-step or greater improvement in the diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS) from baseline for the combined EYLEA treatment groups at week 24, and for each EYLEA treatment group separately (every eight-week group and every 16-week group) at week 52. The DRSS is a systematic grading scale to assess DR severity based on photographs of the retina.
Secondary endpoints – These included assessment of whether EYLEA reduced the risk of worsening disease – specifically progression to PDR (including anterior segment neovascularization [ASNV]) or the development of center-involved DME – as well as change in visual acuity.
Key one-year results included:

(N=134) Sham
Control
(N=133)

d p<0.01 compared with Control
Safety data observed in 269 patients with NPDR through the first year were consistent with those seen in the Phase 3 VIVID and VISTA trials.
About EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection
EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection is a VEGF inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye. It is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels (vascular permeability) in the eye by blocking VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PLGF), two growth factors involved in angiogenesis. In the U.S., EYLEA is the market-leading, FDA-approved anti-VEGF treatment for its approved indications and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR EYLEA® (aflibercept) INJECTION

EYLEA®(aflibercept) Injection is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.
Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.
Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.
There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.
Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.
The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.
INDICATIONS
EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).

About MINNEBRO® (Esaxerenone) Tablets
MINNEBRO® (Esaxerenone) tablets (1.25 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg) are approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare as a treatment for patients with hypertension in Japan. The application for approval was submitted in Japan in February 2018on the basis of results that included data from a phase 3 clinical trial conducted in Japan(ESAX-HTN study) in patients with essential hypertension. Excessive mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation has been found to be involved in hypertension, and MINNEBRO is considered to exert an antihypertensive effect by blocking this receptor activation.
About Hypertension in Japan
According to the 2012 Japan National Health and Nutrition Survey, there are an estimated 43 million patients with hypertension in the country, which accounts for 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women over the age of 30 in the general Japanese population.1 Only approximately 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women with hypertension who are treated with antihypertensive medication typically achieve the goal of systolic and diastolic blood pressure lower than 140/90mm Hg.
Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as stroke and coronary heart disease, and the condition also raises the risk of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.1 Essential hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, affecting 90 percent of hypertensive patients, and is associated with heterogeneous contributory factors such as genetics and lifestyle habits, while secondary hypertension is associated with identified underlying disease factors.1

 Kardia 6-lead smartphone ECG tracings can diagnose heart rhythm and conduction abnormalities which are leading indicators of cardiovascular disease and is expected to be available in Jun’19
 The KardiaMobile six-lead device contains two electrodes on the top of the device & one on the bottom, placing their thumbs on two top electrodes with a bottom electrode is placed on left knee/ankle, forming Einthoven Triangle, providing better insights into electrical activity in the heart","MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., May 13, 2019 — AliveCor, the leader in FDA-cleared consumer electrocardiogram technology (ECG), today announced its third FDA clearance in three months, making KardiaMobile 6L the world’s first available six-lead personal ECG device. This highly anticipated clearance gives patients and their physicians an even more detailed view into patients’ hearts, including visibility into certain arrhythmias that are leading indicators of cardiovascular disease.
“KardiaMobile 6L is the most clinically valuable personal ECG ever created, and another significant step in AliveCor’s march to making heart care more convenient, more accessible, and less expensive than ever before” said AliveCor CEO Ira Bahr.
The KardiaMobile six-lead device is consistent in design with AliveCor’s existing KardiaMobile. But, in addition to the two electrodes on the top of the device, there is one additional electrode on the bottom. The user places her thumbs on each of the two top electrodes, and places the bottom electrode on her left knee or ankle. This formation, known in cardiology as the Einthoven Triangle, allows cardiologists to view electrical activity in the heart from six perspectives or “leads.” A six-lead ECG provides physicians with a far superior view of the heart than a single lead ECG, giving them ability to detect a far broader range of arrhythmias and other heart conditions, all without the hassle of gels or wires.
“I am impressed with the quality and simplicity of 6-lead smartphone ECG tracings which will unquestionably sharpen our ability to diagnose heart rhythm and conduction abnormalities. It’s a welcome and needed step forward for mobile heart diagnostics,” said Eric Topol, MD, cardiologist, Founder and Director or Scripps Research Translational Institute, and author of the new book “Deep Medicine.”
“I am as excited for patients as I am for doctors with this clearance. One more step toward providing patients with the tools they need to drive excellence in digital healthcare,” said Leslie Saxon MD, Professor of Medicine, Clinical Scholar Keck School of Medicine, USC and Executive Director, USC Center for Body Computing.
KardiaMobile 6L will be available in June and may be pre-ordered today at KardiaMobile6L.com

Onconova to Present Rigosertib Data and Pivotal Clinical Trials at Acute Leukemia Forum in Shanghai on May 31, 2019

NEWTOWN, Pa., May 13, 2019– Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONTX), a Phase 3-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel products to treat cancer, with an initial focus on myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), today announced that it has entered into a license agreement for the Greater China territory with HanX Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (HanX), a China-based pharmaceutical company focused on the development, registration, and commercialization of novel oncology products in China, to develop and commercialize rigosertib, a novel and targeted anti-cancer compound currently in a Phase 3 study for the treatment of higher-risk MDS (HR-MDS).

Under the terms of the agreement, Onconova has granted to HanX (i) an exclusive license to develop and commercialize rigosertib in Greater China and (ii) a non-exclusive license to manufacture rigosertib in Greater China. In exchange for these rights, HanX will make upfront payments totaling $6 million, $4 million of which are cash payments to Onconova, including a $2 million fee and an investment totaling $2 million in shares purchased at a premium to market. In addition, HanX will also place $2 million in escrow in local currency for rigosertib clinical development expenses in Greater China. Onconova could receive up to $45.5 million in regulatory, development. and sales-based milestone payments and tiered royalties up to double digits on net sales in Greater China. Onconova will initially supply the finished product for sale in the licensed territories. HanX will also support Onconova’s clinical trial initiatives in the territory

“We are excited about our expanded collaboration with HanX, which now includes our lead investigational drug candidate, rigosertib, currently being studied in higher-risk MDS patients,” said Steven M. Fruchtman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “We have now partnered with HanX for the development of rigosertib in Greater China, in addition to our continued collaboration on the development of ON 123300, our novel CDK4/6 and ARK5 inhibitor. We plan for patients from China to be included in Onconova’s INSPIRE trial, and this additional source will support the goal of completing accrual to INSPIRE in the second half of 2019. In addition, we expect this agreement will broaden the exploration of additional indications for rigosertib, such as lung cancer. We look forward to presenting our data on rigosertib for the first time in China at the Acute Leukemia Forum being held in Shanghai on May 31, 2019.”

Faming Zhang, Ph.D., Founder and Chairman of HanX, commented, “Our license agreement with Onconova for rigosertib is our second collaboration with Onconova following the IND enabling co-development of a novel CDK4/6 and ARK5 inhibitor program. Approximately 25-30 percent of all cancers involve a mutation of the Ras gene family. Rigosertib represents a novel mechanism of action to attenuate Ras signaling pathway and thus has the potential to affect a variety of cancers. Our pre-clinical testing shows that rigosertib acts synergistically in combination with HX-008, our PD-1 antibody which is now in phase II/III clinical trials in China, as well as being studied in solid tumor animal models. In collaboration with Onconova, our goal is to join the INSPIRE trial and the planned combination study of oral rigosertib with azacitidine for patients in Greater China with first line higher-risk MDS and also to initiate a proof-of-concept clinical study of the combination of rigosertib with our PD-1 inhibitor in NSCLC with Ras mutations.”

Rigosertib is currently being evaluated in the global, pivotal Phase 3 INSPIRE clinical trial in patients who have failed or relapsed after receiving currently approved therapeutic options, with a goal of full accrual in the second half of 2019. Rigosertib is also being evaluated in an expanded Phase 2 combination study with azacitidine in HR-MDS patients. Onconova has a research collaboration agreement with the National Cancer Institute to study rigosertib in rare pediatric Ras driven cancers. Rigosertib has been granted orphan drug designation for MDS in the United States and Europe. Onconova is partnered for rigosertib with SymBio Pharmaceuticals for Japan and Korea and with Pint Pharma for Latin America.

For more information, please visit http://www.onconova.com.

About Myelodysplastic Syndromes

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are conditions that can occur when the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow become dysfunctional and thus produce an inadequate number of circulating blood cells. It is frequently associated with the presence of blasts or leukemic cells in the marrow. This leads to low numbers of one or more types of circulating blood cells, and to the need for blood transfusions. In MDS, some of the cells in the bone marrow are abnormal (dysplastic) and may have genetic abnormalities associated with them. Different cell types can be affected, although the most common finding in MDS is a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Patients with higher-risk MDS may progress to the development of acute leukemia.

About Rigosertib

Rigosertib, Onconova’s lead candidate, is a proprietary Phase 3 small molecule. A key publication demonstrated rigosertib’s ability to block cellular signaling by targeting RAS effector pathways (Divakar, S.K., et al., 2016: “A Small Molecule RAS-Mimetic Disrupts RAS Association with Effector Proteins to Block Signaling.” Cell 165, 643). Onconova is currently in the clinic with oral and IV rigosertib, including single agent IV rigosertib in second-line high-risk MDS patients (pivotal Phase 3 INSPIRE trial) and oral rigosertib plus azacitidine in first-line high-risk MDS patients (Phase 2). Patents covering oral and injectable rigosertib have been issued in the U.S. and are expected to provide coverage until at least 2037.

About IV Rigosertib

The intravenous form of rigosertib has been studied in Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials involving more than 1000 patients, and is currently being evaluated in a randomized Phase 3 international INSPIRE trial for patients with high-risk MDS (HR-MDS), after failure of hypomethylating agent, or HMA, therapy.

About the INSPIRE Phase 3 Clinical Trial

The INternational Study of Phase 3 IV RigosErtib, or INSPIRE, was finalized following guidance received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency. INSPIRE is a global multi-center, randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of IV rigosertib in HR-MDS patients who had progressed on, failed to respond to, or relapsed after previous treatment with an HMA within nine cycles over the course of one year after initiation of HMA treatment. This time frame optimizes the opportunity to respond to treatment with an HMA prior to declaring treatment failure, as per NCCN Guidelines. An interim analysis in early 2018 demonstrated a promising survival signal in the intent-to-treat population as reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. The Committee recommended that the trial continue with an expansion in enrollment to 360 patients based on a pre-planned sample size re-estimation. Patients are randomized at a 2:1 ratio into two study arms: IV rigosertib plus Best Supportive Care versus Physician’s Choice plus Best Supportive Care. The primary endpoint of INSPIRE is overall survival. Full details of the INSPIRE trial, such as inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as secondary endpoints, can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02562443).

About Oral Rigosertib

The oral form of rigosertib was developed to provide more convenient dosing for use where the duration of treatment may extend to multiple years. This dosage form may also support combination therapy modalities. To date, over 400 patients have been studied with the oral formulation of rigosertib. Combination therapy of oral rigosertib with azacitidine, the standard of care in HR-MDS, has also been studied. Currently, oral rigosertib is being developed as a combination therapy together with azacitidine for patients with higher-risk MDS who require HMA therapy. A Phase 1/2 trial of the combination therapy has been fully enrolled, and the preliminary efficacy and safety data was presented at The American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2018. A pivotal Phase 3 study design is under review by the FDA, and the Special Protocol Assessment is expected to conclude in the 1H of 2019.

About CDK Inhibitors 

A key feature of cancer cells is their ability to rapidly multiply. CDK inhibitors are thought to disrupt this process by blocking the activity of enzymes known as CDKs. In particular, CDK4 and CDK6 are considered potential anticancer drug targets, due to their role regulating cell cycle progression at the G1 restriction point. CDK inhibitors have the potential and health authority approval in combination with an aromatase inhibitor to treat one of the most common types of breast cancer known as hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, in which the cancer cells express hormone receptors. ON 123300 was found to be as active as commercially approved CDK 4 and 6 inhibitors but with extra anti-tumor metastasis activity in a preclinical Rb + ve xenograft model. Moreover, the molecule may have the potential advantage of reduced neutropenia in preclinical models.

– Conference call and webcast to be held today at 8:30 a.m. EDT / 5:30 a.m. PDT
BASEL, Switzerland, May 14, 2019 — Myovant Sciences (NYSE: MYOV), a clinical-stage healthcare company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for women’s health and prostate cancer, today announced that LIBERTY 1, the first of two Phase 3 studies of once daily relugolix combination therapy met its primary efficacy endpoint and six key secondary endpoints in women with uterine fibroids. Relugolix combination therapy maintained bone mineral density at levels comparable to placebo over 24 weeks and was generally well tolerated.
In the primary endpoint analysis, 73.4% of women receiving once daily oral relugolix combination therapy achieved the responder criteria compared with 18.9% of women receiving placebo (p < 0.0001). A response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50 percent or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of the 24-week treatment period measured using the alkaline hematin method. On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy experienced an 84.3% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline, a clinically relevant key secondary endpoint.
Bone mineral density was comparable between the relugolix combination and placebo groups. The distribution of the change in bone mineral density, including outliers, was similar for the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups at 24 weeks, as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
“We are incredibly pleased with the positive results of this first Phase 3 study demonstrating a clinically meaningful response in a high proportion of women while maintaining bone health,” said Lynn Seely, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Myovant. “These results substantiate our once daily oral combination therapy approach. The improvements in symptoms most relevant to women, such as reduction in menstrual blood loss and pain, and improvement in quality of life are particularly exciting. We look forward to the possibility of bringing a new treatment option, suitable for long-term use, to the millions of women suffering from this debilitating disease.”
“Women with uterine fibroids have limited medical treatment options and suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, anemia, and other symptoms that can significantly decrease their quality of life,” said Ayman Al-Hendy, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Director, Translational Research, University of Illinois College of Medicine. “These results highlight the potential of a once daily oral medicine to become an important option to help women with uterine fibroids manage symptoms without invasive procedures or major surgery such as hysterectomy.”
The 24-week study achieved six key secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo including mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to week 24, reduction in pain in women with pain at baseline, improvement in quality of life, amenorrhea defined as no or negligible blood loss, improvement in anemia in those women with anemia at baseline, and reduction in uterine volume.
The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination and placebo groups was comparable (62% vs. 66%). In the relugolix combination therapy group 5% of women discontinued treatment early due to adverse events compared with 4% in the placebo group. The only adverse event in the relugolix combination arm occurring in at least 10% of women and more frequently than in the placebo arm was hot flush (11% versus 8%). There were no pregnancies in the relugolix combination group and one in the placebo group.
Myovant expects data from LIBERTY 2, the replicate Phase 3 study evaluating once daily relugolix combination therapy in women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding, in the third quarter of 2019 and, provided the LIBERTY 2 study is successful, plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Conference Call 
Myovant will hold a conference call today, Tuesday, May 14, 2019 beginning at 8:30 a.m. EDT / 5:30 a.m. PDT to discuss results of the clinical study. The dial in numbers are 1-866-807-9684 for domestic callers and 1-412-317-5415 for international callers. A live webcast of the conference call will also be available on the investor relations page of Myovant’s website at investors.myovant.com. After the live webcast, the event will remain archived on Myovant’s website for at least 30 days.
Phase 3 LIBERTY Program in Uterine Fibroids
Myovant’s ongoing Phase 3 clinical program for uterine fibroids consists of two multinational, replicate pivotal clinical studies (LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2) of relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding. Women in the LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies underwent a screening period requiring up to two menstrual cycles to document heavy menstrual bleeding and were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups. Women received treatment either with relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with 1.0 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate (relugolix combination therapy) for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix combination therapy once daily for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once daily for 24 weeks.
Myovant enrolled 388 women in LIBERTY 1 and 382 women in LIBERTY 2. To be enrolled, women must have had a monthly menstrual blood loss volume of at least 80 mL in two consecutive cycles or 160 mL in one cycle, measured by the alkaline hematin method, a quantitative measure of menstrual blood loss from an assessment of collected menstrual products.
Eligible women completing the LIBERTY 1 or LIBERTY 2 studies are offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment extension study in which all women receive relugolix combination therapy for an additional 28-week period for a total treatment period of 52 weeks, designed to evaluate the safety and sustained efficacy of longer-term treatment. Upon completion of this 52-week total treatment period, eligible women can elect to participate in a second 52-week randomized withdrawal study designed to provide two-year safety and efficacy data on relugolix combination therapy, to evaluate the need for maintenance therapy.
About Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in or on the muscular walls of the uterus and are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. In addition to an individual’s genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth.
Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they can cause debilitating symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, heavy or painful periods, anemia, abdominal pain, backache, increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation or painful defecation, pregnancy loss, painful intercourse and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment.
An estimated 5 million women in the U.S. suffer from symptoms of uterine fibroids, and an estimated 3 million of whom are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment.
About Relugolix
Relugolix is a once daily oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that reduces ovarian estradiol production, a hormone known to stimulate the growth of uterine fibroids.
Myovant is also studying relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus 1.0 mg estradiol with 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate) in two Phase 3 clinical studies (SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2) evaluating endometriosis-associated pain. Relugolix monotherapy, 120 mg once daily, is also being evaluated in a Phase 3 HERO study in men with advanced prostate cancer.

Darmstadt, Germany and New York, US, May 14, 2019 – Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which operates its biopharmaceutical business as EMD Serono in the US and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BAVENCIO® (avelumab) in combination with INLYTA® (axitinib) for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This is the first FDA approval for an anti-PD-L1 therapy as part of a combination regimen for patients with advanced RCC. The approval of BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA was based on positive results from the Phase III JAVELIN Renal 101 study (NCT02684006), in which the combination significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with sunitinib by more than five months in the intent-to-treat (ITT) patient population (HR: 0.69 [95% CI: 0.56–0.84]; 2-sided p-value=0.0002; median PFS for BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA: 13.8 months [95% CI: 11.1-NE]; sunitinib: 8.4 months [95% CI: 6.9-11.1]). The ITT population included patients regardless of PD-L1 expression and across IMDC (International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database) prognostic risk groups (favorable 21%, intermediate 62% and poor 16%).1
“As we look to continue to improve outcomes for people with advanced RCC, new treatment approaches have the potential to benefit patients,” said Robert J. Motzer, M.D., Jack and Dorothy Byrne Chair in Clinical Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, US, and principal investigator for JAVELIN Renal 101. “With today’s FDA approval of avelumab in combination with axitinib, we can now offer patients with advanced RCC a first-line treatment option that combines a PD-L1 immunotherapy with a well-known VEGFR TKI to provide a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death and doubling of the response rate compared with sunitinib.”
RCC is a type of cancer where PD-L1 expression may contribute to inhibition of the immune response against the tumor.2 It is also a highly vascular tumor, in which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role.3
“A kidney cancer diagnosis is life-changing for both patients and their loved ones, and having a treatment strategy for their disease quickly becomes a priority,” said Dena Battle, President, KCCure. “The approval of new treatments such as BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA gives patients with advanced RCC much-needed options.”
There is a significant unmet need for first-line treatments that delay progression and have an acceptable safety profile. Approximately 20% to 30% of patients are first diagnosed with RCC at the advanced stage, and 30% of patients treated for an earlier stage go on to develop metastases.4,5 About half of patients living with advanced RCC do not go on to receive additional treatment after first-line therapy,6,7 for reasons that may include poor performance status or adverse events from their initial treatment.6,8,9 
“Today’s approval of BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA builds on Pfizer’s long heritage in bringing innovation to the RCC community with the hopes of making a significant and meaningful impact on the lives of patients,” said Andy Schmeltz, Global President, Pfizer Oncology. “For more than 12 years, Pfizer has led the field in its commitment to developing new treatments for patients with advanced kidney cancer.”
“With today’s FDA approval of BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA, we feel privileged that we can offer patients with first-line advanced renal cell carcinoma a new treatment option,” said Rehan Verjee, President, EMD Serono, and Global Head of Innovative Medicine Franchises, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.
In JAVELIN Renal 101, the objective response rate (ORR) was doubled in the ITT population with BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA versus sunitinib (51.4% [95% CI: 46.6-56.1] vs. 25.7% [95% CI: 21.7-30.0]). With a median overall survival (OS) follow-up of 19 months, data for the trial’s other primary endpoint of OS were immature, with 27% of deaths in the ITT population, and the trial is continuing as planned. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, mucositis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, dysphonia, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism, rash, hepatotoxicity, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain and headache. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients receiving BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was higher with BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA versus sunitinib.1Findings from the study have been published in The New England Journal of Medicine.10
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated the Type II variation application for BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA in advanced RCC in March 2019, and a supplemental application for BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA in unresectable or metastatic RCC was submitted in Japan in January 2019.

Each program will independently conduct the access and reimbursement activities for the product for which it is responsible.
About Renal Cell Carcinoma
In 2019, an estimated 73,820 new cases of kidney cancer will be diagnosed in the US, and approximately 14,770 people will die from the disease.11 RCC is the most common form of kidney cancer, accounting for about 2% to 3% of all cancers in adults.12,13Approximately 20% to 30% of patients with kidney cancer are first diagnosed at the advanced stage.4 The five-year survival rate for patients with metastatic RCC is approximately 12%.14
About the JAVELIN Renal 101 study
The Phase III JAVELIN Renal 101 study is a randomized (1:1), multicenter, open-label study of BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA in 886 patients with untreated advanced RCC regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression [intent-to-treat (ITT) population]. Patients with autoimmune disease or conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded. The major efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1 and OS in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors using a clinical trial assay (PD-L1 expression level ≥1%). If PFS was statistically significant in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, it was then tested in the ITT population. The hazard ratio for PFS in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors was HR 0.61 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.79). PFS and OS in the ITT population, overall response and safety are included as secondary endpoints. The study is continuing for OS.
About the JAVELIN Clinical Development Program
The clinical development program for avelumab, known as JAVELIN, involves at least 30 clinical programs and about 10,000 patients evaluated across more than 15 different tumor types. In addition to RCC, these tumor types include gastric/gastro-esophageal junction cancer, head and neck cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and urothelial carcinoma.
About BAVENCIO® (avelumab)
BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.15-17 BAVENCIO has also been shown to induce NK cell-mediated direct tumor cell lysis via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro.17-19 In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.
BAVENCIO Approved Indication in the US
BAVENCIO® (avelumab) in combination with INLYTA® (axitinib) is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

 Abbott’s neuromodulation technologies determine the inner workings of the nervous system, allowing to explore the interaction of the brain with the human body in patients with neurological conditions","– Partnership with NIH aims to increase understanding and accelerate the application of neurostimulation therapies
– The BRAIN Initiative brings together the brightest minds across disciplines to improve the treatment and prevention of brain disorders
ABBOTT PARK, Ill., May 14, 2019 Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that it has partnered with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) initiative to accelerate advancements in neuroscience research. As part of the agreement, Abbott will provide the company’s neuromodulation technologies—including directional deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) therapy—for research related to these NIH initiatives to explore their application for chronic pain and progressive movement disorders, like Parkinson’s disease.
“The NIH is investigating the application of these devices for the treatment of a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions and chronic pain,” said Nick B. Langhals, Ph.D., Program Director for Neural Engineering within the Division of Translational Research at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “The neuromodulation technologies provided by Abbott will help us determine the inner workings of the nervous system to help fill gaps in our current knowledge of the brain and provide opportunities for exploring how the brain interacts with the human body in patients with neurological conditions.”
Abbott’s neuromodulation therapies have helped thousands of people with neurological conditions to continue living fuller lives while managing Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor and chronic pain. In addition to disrupting the marketplace with innovative therapies, Abbott continues to focus on enhancing the patient experience, such as integrating consumer-friendly technologies like mobile phones and tablets.
Neurological disorders and diseases present a significant burden to the United States healthcare system, with over 100 million people experiencing at least one of the known neurological disorders.1 With age being a contributing factor to many neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, this number is expected to increase by 2050.1,2
Launched in 2013, the BRAIN Initiative looks to understand the functions of the human brain by researching and developing new uses for innovative technologies. Recently, the BRAIN Initiative assembled participants from contributing federal agencies, non-federal organizations, as well as members of the media, public, and Congress at its 5th Annual Investigators Meeting in Washington, D.C. The meeting provided a forum for discussing recent scientific developments and potential new directions in brain research and identified areas for collaboration and research coordination.
“Researchers at Abbott are continuously striving to better understand how neuromodulation technology can benefit people living with chronic pain or movement disorders,” said Keith Boettiger, vice president, Neuromodulation, Abbott. “In addition to our own research efforts, including clinical and real-world studies, working together with world-class scientists at the NIH will help us further validate our neuromodulation therapies and explore new avenues where they may benefit patients affected by devastating neurological conditions.”

14466,ï»¿Progenics Signs an Exclusive Agreement with ROTOP Pharmaka to Develop and Commercialize Imaging Agent 1404 for Prostate Cancer in Europe,Progenics Pharmaceuticals and ROTOP Pharmaka GmbH Announce European Collaboration for Prostate Cancer Imaging Agent 1404,"Progenics to receive royalties on sales of 1404 in EU. ROTOP to get an exclusive license to develop & commercialize 1404 in EU and is also responsible for regulatory approvals
 The focus of the agreement is to expand ROTOP’s PSMA targeted prostate cancer portfolio and to accelerate the development of 1404 for treating prostate cancer in Europe
 Progenic’s 1404 is a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting SPECT/CT imaging agent labeled with technetium-99m, designed for the detection of primary and metastatic prostate cancer with its expected clinical trials onset in H1’20","Leading Radiopharmaceutical Company ROTOP to Develop and Commercialize Progenics’ PSMA-Targeted SPECT/CT Imaging Agent in Europe
NEW YORK & DRESDEN, Germany, May 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNX), an oncology company developing innovative targeted medicines and artificial intelligence to find, fight and follow cancer, and ROTOP Pharmaka GmbH, a leading radiopharmaceuticals company focused on diagnostics and therapeutics, today announced an exclusive agreement under which ROTOP agreed to develop and commercialize 1404 in Europe. 1404 is Progenics’ prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted small molecule SPECT/CT imaging agent labeled with technetium-99m that is designed to visualize prostate cancer.

“This European partnership with ROTOP further expands the global reach of our PSMA-targeted prostate cancer portfolio and establishes a development path forward for 1404 in this important market, where SPECT/CT is the standard nuclear imaging modality,” said Mark Baker, Chief Executive Officer of Progenics. “ROTOP has deep experience developing, producing and distributing radiopharmaceutical products, which makes them well suited to advance the development of 1404 in Europe, and ultimately improve physician treatment decisions of prostate cancer.”

Under the terms of the agreement, ROTOP will receive an exclusive license to and will be responsible for the development, regulatory approvals and commercialization of 1404 in the covered European territory. In exchange, Progenics is eligible for double-digit, tiered royalties based on future sales of 1404 in Europe.

In the coming months, ROTOP will hold an expert panel meeting with KOLs in the PSMA imaging field as well as regulatory experts to review existing data on 1404 and obtain guidance on the clinical development. Upon agreement on a path forward, ROTOP will request a meeting with European regulators and start a clinical trial in early 2020.

With the number of installed PET cameras in Europe being less than a third of the installed SPECT cameras and prostate cancer being the most frequent cancer in men, a capacity shortage is already being seen for PSMA PET imaging in Europe and this is expected to worsen once PSMA PET tracers are approved in Europe. 1404 will address this problem as the first-in-class PSMA tracer using SPECT scanners. A 1404-SPECT scan could be the key to change the management of a large number of patients who have limited access to PET.

“1404 is a complimentary fit to ROTOP’s growing product line of radiopharmaceuticals, particularly technetium-99m based imaging agents, for the diagnosis of a range of diseases, including cancers,” said Jens Junker, Chief Executive Officer of ROTOP. “Our collaboration with Progenics underscores our commitment to developing new nuclear medicine and molecular imaging products in parallel to our commercial operations, which distributes radiopharmaceutical products to more than 30 countries.”

About 1404, an Imaging Agent Targeting Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen

Progenics’ molecular imaging radiopharmaceutical product candidate 1404 targets the extracellular domain of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a protein amplified on the surface of > 95% of prostate cancer cells and a validated target for the detection of primary and metastatic prostate cancer. 1404 is labeled with Technetium-99m, a gamma-emitting isotope that is widely available, is easy to prepare, and is attractive for nuclear medicine imaging applications. The image created provides the opportunity to visualize cancer, potentially allowing for improved detection and staging, more precise biopsies, and a targeted treatment plan including active surveillance as a disease management tool.

14485,ï»¿Roche and AbbVie's Venclexta (venetoclax) + Gazyva (obinutuzumab) Receive FDA's Approval for Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Roche announces FDA approval for Venclexta plus Gazyva for people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"The approval is based on the P-III CLL14 study results assessing Venclexta + Gazyva vs Gazyva + chlorambucil in 432 patients with previously untreated CLL for 12mos.
 The P-IIICLL14 study results: rate of MRD-negativity in the bone marrow & peripheral blood (57% vs. 17% & 76% vs. 35%); reduction in PFS (67%); ORR (85% vs 71%); presented at ASCO in Jun’19
 Venclexta targets BCL-2 protein to restore the process of apoptosis, co-developed & co-commercialized by AbbVie and Roche and Gazyva is a mAb targeting CD20 to destroy B-cells both directly and together with the body’s immune system. The combination receives FDA’s BT designation for previously untreated CLL with co-existing medical conditions","Fixed 12-month treatment with Venclexta plus Gazyva significantly reduced risk of disease progression or death by 67% compared to a current standard-of-care
Approval for expanded use of Venclexta offers more adults with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia a new treatment option
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Venclexta® (venetoclax) in combination with Gazyva® (obinutuzumab) for the treatment of people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
“Venclexta plus Gazyva is the only chemotherapy-free option of fixed duration that provides durable responses to help people live longer without progression of their disease, compared to a standard-of-care,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Today’s approval represents our long-standing commitment to helping people with blood cancers throughout the course of their disease, and we are excited to provide this new option for untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.”
The approval is based on the results of the randomised phase III CLL14 study, which evaluated 12-month, fixed-duration treatment with Venclexta plus Gazyva compared to Gazyva plus chlorambucil. Results showed the combination of Venclexta plus Gazyva produced a durable and significant reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival [PFS], as assessed by Independent Review Committee) by 67% compared to Gazyva plus chlorambucil, a current standard-of-care (HR=0.33; 95% CI 0.22-0.51; p<0.0001). Venclexta plus Gazyva showed deep and clinically meaningful responses characterised by a higher rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity in the bone marrow compared to Gazyva plus chlorambucil (MRD-negativity of 57% vs. 17%) and peripheral blood (MRD-negativity of 76% vs. 35%). MRD-negativity means no cancer can be detected using a specific and highly sensitive test, defined as less than one CLL cell in 10,000 white blood cells.
Results of the study will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in June 2019. The CLL14 study is being conducted in cooperation with the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), headed by Michael Hallek, MD, University of Cologne.
The most common adverse reactions with Venclexta plus Gazyva were low white blood cell count, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, low red blood cell count, and upper respiratory tract infection.
The FDA rapidly reviewed and approved the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) and Assessment Aid pilot programmes. This is the second regimen of Roche medicines approved under the RTOR pilot programme, which is exploring a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. The sNDA was also granted Priority Review, a designation given to medicines that the FDA has determined to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease. The FDA previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Venclexta in combination with Gazyva for the treatment of previously untreated CLL with co-existing medical conditions. Additional submissions of the CLL14 data to health authorities around the world are ongoing.
Venclexta is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche group, in the US and commercialised by AbbVie outside of the US.

About the CLL14 Study
CLL14 (NCT02242942) is a randomised phase III study evaluating the combination of fixed-duration Venclexta plus Gazyva compared to Gazyva plus chlorambucil in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and co-existing medical conditions. 432 patients with previously untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive either a 12-month duration of Venclexta alongside six-month duration of Gazyva (Arm A) or six-month duration of Gazyva plus chlorambucil followed by an additional six-month duration of chlorambucil (Arm B). Arm A started with an initial cycle of Gazyva followed by a five-week Venclexta dose ramp-up to help reduce tumour burden. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee (IRC), minimal residual disease (MRD) status, overall response (OR), complete response (with or without complete blood count recovery, CR/CRi), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), time to next CLL treatment (TTNT) and safety. The CLL14 study is being conducted in cooperation with the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG), headed by Michael Hallek, MD, University of Cologne.


The most common adverse reactions with Venclexta plus Gazyva were low white blood cell count, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, low red blood cell count, and upper respiratory tract infection.

About Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax)
Venclexta/Venclyxto is a first-in-class targeted medicine designed to selectively bind and inhibit the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other tumours, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from dying or self-destructing, a process called apoptosis. Venclexta/Venclyxto blocks the BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.
Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the US and commercialised by AbbVie, under the brand name Venclyxto, outside of the US. Together, the companies are committed to research with Venclexta/Venclyxto, which is currently being studied in clinical trials across several types of blood and other cancers.
In the US, Venclexta has been granted five Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the US Food and Drug Administration: one for previously untreated CLL, two for relapsed or refractory CLL and two for previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia.

About Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab)
Gazyva/Gazyvaro is an engineered monoclonal antibody designed to attach to CD20, a protein expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells. Gazyva/Gazyvaro is designed to attack and destroy targeted B-cells both directly and together with the body’s immune system. Gazyva is marketed as Gazyvaro in the EU and Switzerland.
Gazyva/Gazyvaro is currently approved in more than 90 countries in combination with chlorambucil for people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in more than 80 countries in combination with bendamustine for people with certain types of previously treated follicular lymphoma and in more than 70 countries in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.
Additional combination studies investigating Gazyva/Gazyvaro with other approved or investigational medicines, including cancer immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors, are underway across a range of blood cancers.

About the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG)
Founded in 1996 and headed by Michael Hallek, MD, the GCLLSG has been running various phase III, phase II and phase I trials in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with the goal to provide optimal treatment to patients suffering from this disease. Among those were landmark trials like the CLL8 and the CLL11 trials which led to the current standard of care in CLL. For many years, GCLLSG has been aiming to improve not just the treatment of younger and physically fit patients, but also that of elderly and less fit patients. These patients are generally underrepresented in clinical trials although they constitute the majority of CLL patients treated by doctors in daily practice.

 Phathom to get rights to develop & exclusively commercialize Takeda’s Vonoprazan in the US, EU & Canada plus $90M funds & $50M as debt facility from Frazier & Silicon Valley Bank respectively. Takeda to get upfront as cash & equity, milestones, royalties on sales and will retain its right for Asia
 Takeda’s vonoprazan is an orally active potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), blocking the potassium binding site of ATPase indicated for acid-related disorders like GERD, co-promoted by Takeda & Otsuka under 2015 deal","New Company and Collaboration To Develop Novel Therapeutics Including Vonoprazan for the Treatment of Acid-Related Disorders in North America and Europe

May 15, 2019 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & MENLO PARK, Calif.-Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) and Frazier Healthcare Partners (“Frazier”) today announced a collaboration to launch Phathom Pharmaceuticals, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and disorders. Takeda has granted a license to Phathom for the development and exclusive commercialization rights to vonoprazan in the United States, Europe and Canada in exchange for upfront cash and equity, as well as future cash milestones and royalties on net sales. In connection with the license, Phathom has completed a $90 million crossover financing and $50 million debt facility.
Vonoprazan is a novel, orally active potassium competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) discovered and developed by Takeda. Takeda and Otsuka will continue to co-promote vonoprazan in Japan which they have done since 2015. Takeda will continue to market vonoprazan in several Asian markets where it is currently launched (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand). P-CABs are a class of drug that competitively block the potassium-binding site of gastric hydrogen potassium ATPase (also known as the proton pump), which is the enzyme primarily responsible for acidification of the stomach.
“Takeda embraces collaboration to further develop and create value around promising assets where partnership makes more sense for our business,” said Asit Parikh, M.D., Ph.D., Head, Gastroenterology Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. “Phathom’s skilled leadership, with deep expertise in acid-related disorders, positions them well to expand access to vonoprazan in North America and Europe while Takeda continues to leverage its presence in Japan and several Asian markets.”
Following a standard eight-week course of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, 30–40 percent of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continue to experience symptoms.1 PPIs in combination with antibiotics are also used for the eradication of H. pylori, which is associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. However, the eradication rate of standard PPI-based triple therapy is reported to be 70-80%.2,3
“We are excited to have the opportunity to develop vonoprazan for the United States, Europe and Canada to address this immense unmet need,” said Tachi Yamada, M.D., Chairman of Phathom and Venture Partner with Frazier. “Phathom represents a truly unique opportunity to launch a new company around a highly experienced, world-class team developing a late-stage product candidate supported by strong clinical data and commercial experience.”
Phathom has completed a $90 million private financing led by Frazier Healthcare Partners with investments from Medicxi, RA Capital Management, Abingworth, certain accounts managed by Janus Henderson Investors, BVF Partners LP, Greenspring Associates, Richard King Mellon Foundation, Sahsen Ventures and undisclosed institutional investors. The company also completed a $50 million term loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank.
“We are very pleased with the quality of the investor group participating in this oversubscribed crossover financing,” said David Socks, interim Chief Executive Officer of Phathom and Venture Partner with Frazier. “We welcome their support in our efforts to advance vonoprazan, a next generation therapeutic with the potential to make a profound impact on the lives of patients with acid-related gastrointestinal disorders.”
Joining Tachi Yamada and David Socks on the Phathom board of directors are James Topper, M.D., Ph.D., Managing General Partner of Frazier Healthcare Partners, and Jon Edwards, Ph.D., Partner of Medicxi.

About CSCC
CSCC is the second most common type of skin cancer in the world, accounting for approximately 20% of all skin cancers, and the number of newly diagnosed cases is expected to rise substantially in many countries. Although CSCC has a good prognosis when caught early, the cancer can prove especially difficult to treat effectively when it is advanced, and patients can experience reduced quality of life due to the impact of the disease as it progresses. Advanced CSCC is the deadliest non-melanoma skin cancer. While estimates vary, sources suggest that 7,000 people in the U.S. die annually of advanced CSCC.
About Libtayo
Libtayo is approved in the U.S., Canada and Brazil, and under review by the European Commission following a positive opinion for conditional approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). In the U.S., Libtayo is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation.

14559,ï»¿Pfizer's Fragmin (dalteparin sodium) Receives FDA's Approval for Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism in Pediatric Patients,FDA approves first anticoagulant (blood thinner) for pediatric patients to treat potentially life-threatening blood clots,"The approval is based on the single study results assessing Fragmin (dalteparin sodium) in 38 pediatric patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism aged ≥ 1mos. for up to 3mos.
 The study demonstrated that 21 patients achieved resolution of the qualifying VTE, 7 showed regression, 2 resulted in no changes, no experienced progression of VTE is observed
 Fragmin (dalteparin sodium, SC) is a low molecular weight heparin indicated to reduce the recurrence of VTE, approved for the same indication in adults in 1994 and has received FDA’s PR designation for treating VTE in children","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Fragmin (dalteparin sodium) injection, for subcutaneous use, to reduce the recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric patients one month of age and older. VTE can include deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins of the leg) and pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), which can lead to death.
“Most children who have VTE are fighting a serious underlying primary illness such as cancer or congenital heart disease. Not only are they fighting a serious illness, having a condition like VTE can then lead to significant complications and even death,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Prior to this approval, there had been no FDA-approved therapies to treat VTE in pediatric patients. Given the unmet need, we granted the Fragmin application priority review and today we are approving it as the first anticoagulant (blood thinner) indicated for pediatric patients. We remain committed to advancing treatments for children with unmet medical needs.”
VTE usually develops as a secondary complication of underlying clinical conditions such as a venous catheter, cancer, infection, congenital heart disease, and trauma or surgery. Pediatric VTE is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality, recurrent VTE and post-thrombotic syndrome (damage to vein).
Fragmin was initially approved by the FDA in 1994 for adults and is a type of heparin, which works as an anticoagulant. The efficacy of Fragmin in children was based on a single trial with 38 pediatric patientswith symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Patients were treated with Fragmin for up to three months, with starting doses by age and weight. At study completion, 21 patients achieved resolution of the qualifying VTE, seven patients showed regression, two patients showed no change, no patients experienced progression of the VTE and one patient experienced recurrence of VTE.
Common side effects of patients taking Fragmin are bleeding, including hemorrhage (heavy discharge of blood from a blood vessel), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), hematoma (collection of blood) or pain at the injection site and transient elevation of transaminases (elevated level of liver enzymes).
Health care professionals are advised to use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage and monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. Health care professionals are warned not to use benzyl alcohol preservative multiple-dose formulations in infants as they contain benzyl alcohol and should not be used. Patients are advised to have blood count laboratory tests periodically. Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients closely for bleeding when administering Fragmin to patients who currently take anticoagulants. Patients at risk for VTE may receive certain treatments or interventions to help reduce the likelihood of the formation of blood clots (known as thromboprophylaxis), including taking anticoagulants.
The label for Fragmin contains a boxed warning to alert health care professionals and patients that epidural or spinal hematomas (accumulation of blood that can mechanically compress the spinal cord) may occur in patients who are anticoagulated due to taking certain medications called low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or heparinoids and are receiving neuraxial anesthesia (injection near the spine) or undergoing spinal puncture (removing spinal fluid for testing). These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Health care professionals are advised to consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures as patients may be at a higher risk of developing VTE. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: use of indwelling epidural catheters, use of other drugs that affect hemostasis at the same time when using Fragmin, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors and other anticoagulants; history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures; and a history of spinal deformity or surgery. The optimal timing between the administration of Fragmin and neuraxial procedures is not known. Health care professionals are advised to monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Health care professionals are advised to consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.
The FDA granted this application Priority Review designation. Pfizer holds the application for Fragmin.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pfizer-2.jpg,Regulatory,Pfizer,Fragmin | Dalteparin Sodium,venous thromboembolism|regulatory|approval|FDA|pediatric patients|receives|symptomatic,publish,17/5/2019,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/fda-approves-first-anticoagulant-blood-thinner-for-pediatric-patients-to-treat-potentially-life-threatening-blood-clots/,https://pharmashots.com/14559/%ef%bb%bfpfizers-fragmin-dalteparin-sodium-receives-fdas-approval-for-symptomatic-venous-thromboembolism-in-pediatric-patients/

̶ Exelixis will make upfront payment and contribute research funding for option to in-license at Investigational New Drug (IND) filing ̶

ALAMEDA, Calif. & SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–May 16, 2019–Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) today announced that it has entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Iconic Therapeutics, Inc. (Iconic), a private biopharmaceutical company focused on cancer and retinal disease, to advance an innovative next-generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) program for cancer. This collaboration reflects Exelixis’ ongoing strategy to build a pipeline beyond its lead product, CABOMETYX, through both internal drug discovery and external business development. This agreement with Iconic is Exelixis’ second strategic collaboration focused on novel biologics, following the company’s collaboration with Invenra, Inc. announced in May 2018. This exclusive agreement is Iconic’s first strategic collaboration in oncology and leverages the company’s innovative Tissue Factor antibody expertise.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190516005474/en/

Under the terms of the agreement, Exelixis will gain an exclusive option to license ICON-2, Iconic’s lead oncology ADC program, in exchange for an upfront option payment to Iconic of $7.5 million and a commitment of preclinical development funding. Exelixis would exercise its option at the time of a potential IND application, and upon doing so would make an option exercise payment to Iconic and assume responsibilities for all subsequent clinical development and commercialization activities. Should Exelixis elect to exercise its option, Iconic will become eligible for future development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales.
“Iconic Therapeutics is pursuing an innovative approach to targeting Tissue Factor, a promising target with early clinical validation and potential applicability across a wide variety of cancers,” said Peter Lamb, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer ofExelixis. “This agreement provides Exelixis with an attractive entry into the antibody-drug conjugate space, and reflects our preference for success-based terms that reward our partners for long-term shared success. We’re looking forward to working with the Iconic team to advance this exciting program, which is complementary to Exelixis’ small molecule and emerging biologics capabilities.”
ICON-2 represents a potential best-in-class program targeting TF in solid tumors. TF is highly expressed on tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment. TF overexpression, while not oncogenic itself, facilitates angiogenesis, metastasis and other processes important to tumor development and progression. ICON-2 is a rationally designed second-generation ADC with potential for an improved therapeutic index and safety profile.
“We believe this partnership with a premier oncology company provides further validation of our novel approach,” said William L. Greene, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Iconic Therapeutics. “Exelixis’ clinical development and commercialization expertise, evidenced by the growing success of the cabozantinib franchise, make it the ideal partner as we advance this promising program towards the clinic. Iconic Therapeutics’ deep expertise in Tissue Factor biology and antibody-drug conjugate design sets the ICON-2 program apart from other approaches to this historically challenging target,” Dr. Greene added.

 Parvus’ Navacims are precision medicine platform for autoimmune diseases by inducing immune tolerance without generalized immune suppression and targets disease pertinent TCR which restores the immune system balance","Parvus Eligible to Receive Upfront and Milestone Payments Exceeding $800 Million Plus Royalties on Net Sales
BURLINGAME, Calif. & CALGARY, Alberta–– May 16, 2019 — Parvus Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of disease-specific immunoregulatory medicines to treat autoimmune diseases without impairing normal immunity, has entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize novel Navacim™ therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune liver diseases (ALD), and celiac disease (CD). Parvus will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and is eligible to receive research, development and commercialization milestone payments for each disease area within the collaboration, based on achievement of certain predetermined milestones. Parvus is also eligible to receive certain additional milestone payments in other disease areas, as well as royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration.
“Our collaboration with Genentech is now the second partnership that we’ve entered into with a major biopharmaceutical company, which we believe reinforces the potential of our Navacim immunoregulatory therapeutic platform,” said Curtis Ruegg, Ph.D., President & CEO of Parvus. “Partnering with Genentech will enable Parvus to expand the Navacim pipeline to address several debilitating autoimmune diseases in gastroenterology.”
Under the terms of the Agreement, Parvus will conduct pre-clinical development and clinical development activities through Phase I. Genentech will be responsible for clinical development from Phase II and beyond, including global regulatory submissions and worldwide commercialization of products.
“Parvus’ technology represents a potentially transformative approach for treating autoimmune diseases by inducing immune tolerance without causing generalized immune suppression,” said James Sabry, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Pharma Partnering, Roche. “In preclinical testing, Parvus’ platform has shown the ability to induce and expand disease-specific regulatory T cells, which restore immune system balance and halt the autoimmune disease process. We look forward to working with the Parvus team to hopefully bring this exciting advancement to patients.”
About Navacims™
Navacims are a precision medicine platform designed to trigger a naturally occurring immunoregulatory mechanism of the mammalian immune system which has evolved to protect against autoimmune disease. As selected for each disease, Navacims present a singular, peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) at supra-physiological density, targeting cognate T cell receptors (TCR) on disease relevant T cells. Navacim binding causes a sustained assembly of TCR microclusters and prolonged signaling leading to disease-specific type 1 regulatory T (TR1) cell differentiation. Because Navacim activity depends on the presence of disease-causing, autoimmune T cells, their action is self-limiting. In preclinical disease models, Navacims have demonstrated broad therapeutic activity and disease reversal across a range of autoimmune disorders including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, ALD and IBD while consistently preserving immunocompetence to resist viral, microbial, and tumor challenges.
About Parvus Therapeutics Inc.
Parvus Therapeutics Inc. is a privately-held biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of Navacim therapeutics targeting autoimmune diseases. Navacims were discovered by Pere Santamaria, M.D., Ph.D. Chief Scientific Officer and Founder of Parvus, Julia McFarlane/Diabetes Canada Professor of the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary.

 The P-III VARSITY study results: @52wks. clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%); mucosal healing (39.7% vs 27.7%); AEs (62.7% vs 69.2%); rate of infection (33.5% vs 43.5%); SAEs (11.0% vs. 13.7%) @14wks. greater clinical response than adalimumab
 Entyvio (vedolizumab, IV) is a gut-selective biologic targeting alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting its binding with MAdCAM-1, indicated to treat UC & CD. Humira (adalimumab) is an anti-TNF drug, is indicated as monothx. or in combination with methotrexate for RA, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis","May 19, 2019 Osaka, JAPAN
Exploratory data showed a greater proportion of patients receiving vedolizumab achieved clinical response at week 14 than adalimumab
Additional exploratory data on absence of active histologic disease showed vedolizumab was associated with a greater reduction of microscopic inflammation in the gut compared to adalimumab
Results provide additional information to the recent presentation of primary endpoint data from the VARSITY study, which demonstrated superiority of vedolizumab to adalimumab in achieving clinical remission at week 52
Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced further results from the Phase 3b head-to-head VARSITY study, which demonstrated that the gut-selective biologic vedolizumab (Entyvio®) was superior to the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNFα) biologic adalimumab (Humira®) in achieving clinical remission* at week 52 in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).1 New exploratory data showed that a greater proportion of patients receiving vedolizumab intravenous (IV) achieved clinical response** at week 14 compared to those treated with adalimumab subcutaneous (SC), 67.1% vs. 45.9% respectively. A separation between the treatment groups was seen as early as week 6, favoring vedolizumab. These results were announced in a Distinguished Abstract Plenary Lecture Presentation at the 2019 Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) annual scientific meeting (May 18-21 in San Diego, CA), one of 18 Takeda sponsored vedolizumab abstracts accepted for presentation.2

 
Additional exploratory data on absence of active histologic disease were also presented at the meeting. Histologic disease activity is an endpoint assessing the degree of microscopic inflammation in the gut. Absence of active histologic disease is achieved when inflammation is less than a pre-defined severity threshold.2,3,4 *** In the VARSITY study, consistent results were seen with vedolizumab treatment across both the Geboes Score (<3.2) and Robarts Histopathology Index (<5), with absence of active histologic disease achieved in 33.4% and 42.3% of patients treated with vedolizumab, respectively, compared with 13.7% and 25.6% of patients treated with adalimumab, respectively.2
 
“Exploratory data from the VARSITY study suggest that more patients experienced early symptomatic response and improvement of microscopic intestinal inflammation with vedolizumab as compared to adalimumab,” said Dr. Bruce E. Sands, primary investigator of the VARSITY study and Chief of the Dr. Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “In clinical practice there is a need to balance early symptomatic improvement alongside the longer-term treatment goal of helping patients to achieve clinical remission, making these findings important to physicians.”
 
“Patients benefit from clinical trials that advance our understanding of the disease. The VARSITY study, a first-of-its-kind comparison of two biologics in ulcerative colitis, provides valuable information that can help inform treatment decisions, while also increasing our understanding of how these treatments are working at a microscopic level,” said Jeff Bornstein, M.D., Executive Medical Director, Takeda. “Data from the VARSITY study show consistent results for vedolizumab, supporting the use of this treatment as a first-line biologic therapy in ulcerative colitis.”
 
About VARSITY
VARSITY is a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multi-center, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab intravenous (IV) compared to adalimumab subcutaneous (SC) at week 52 in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The study randomized 769 patients (vedolizumab n=383 or adalimumab n=386), all of whom had inadequate response with, loss of response to, or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or one tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist other than adalimumab prior to being enrolled. Patients were randomized into one of two treatment groups, vedolizumab IV 300 mg and placebo SC or adalimumab SC 160 mg and placebo IV. Dose escalation was not permitted in either treatment arm during the study.1,5

 
At week 52, 31.3% (n=120/383) of patients receiving vedolizumab IV achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission* compared to 22.5% (n=87/386) of patients treated with adalimumab SC, with the difference being statistically significant (p=0.0061). In addition, 39.7% of patients treated with vedolizumab achieved the secondary endpoint of mucosal healing± at week 52, compared to 27.7% receiving adalimumab (p=0.0005). A non-statistically significant difference in favor of adalimumab was seen in the percentage of patients using oral corticosteroids at baseline who discontinued corticosteroids and were in clinical remission† at week 52. While the study was not powered to compare the safety of the two biologics, patients treated with vedolizumab (62.7%) had a lower rate of overall adverse events than patients treated with adalimumab (69.2%), with a lower rate of infections reported in patients treated with vedolizumab (33.5%) as compared to adalimumab (43.5%). The rate of serious adverse events was also lower in vedolizumab-treated patients than adalimumab (11.0% vs. 13.7% respectively).1
 
* Primary endpoint: Clinical remission is defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no individual subscore ˃1 point.
** Exploratory endpoint: Clinical response is defined as a reduction in partial Mayo score of ≥2 points and ≥25% from baseline, with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point. Patients with missing clinical response status were considered non-responders.
*** Exploratory endpoint: Absence of active histologic disease is defined as a Geboes Score (<3.2) or Robarts Histopathology Index (<5).
± Secondary endpoint: Mucosal healing is defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore of ≤1 point. Mayo score: instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis.
† Secondary endpoint: Corticosteroid-free clinical remission is defined as patients using oral corticosteroids at baseline (week 0) who have discontinued oral corticosteroids and are in clinical remission at week 52.

About Ulcerative Colitis
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).6 UC is a chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract that is often progressive in nature, and involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.7,8 UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort and loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.8,9 The cause of UC is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to the condition.8,10,11

 

About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation.12 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).13 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.14 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.13 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).13,15,16 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.13
 
Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist.12 Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 260,000 patient years of exposure to date.17

 

Therapeutic Indications
 
Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
 
Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
 
Important Safety Information
 
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
 
Special warnings and special precautions for use
Vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.
 
Infusion-related reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.
 
Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.
 
Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.
 
Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.
 
Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
 
Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.

14643,ï»¿Ethicon (J&amp;J) Recalls Endo-Surgery Intraluminal Staplers Due to Complete Staple Line Failure,Ethicon Recalls Circular Staplers for Insufficient Firing and Failure to Completely Form Staples,"Ethicon recalls Endo-Surgery Curved Intraluminal Stapler & Endo-Surgery Endoscopic Curved Intraluminal Stapler with adjustable height staples manufactured from Mar’18 to Mar’19, categorized by FDA under Class I recall causing serious injuries or death
 The recall is due to defect in the washers of staplers resulting in insufficient firing and failure in complete 360-degree staple line integrity. Additionally, the company has advised returning the defected staplers to receive the replaced product by Jun 30, 2019
 Ethicon’s Endo-Surgery Intraluminal Staplers are used by doctors in gastrointestinal surgical procedures for creating a connection between structures (anastomoses)","The FDA has identified this as a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall. Use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death

Recalled Product
Recalled Product(s):
Endo-Surgery Curved Intraluminal Stapler with Adjustable Height Staples and
Endo-Surgery Endoscopic Curved Intraluminal Stapler with Adjustable Height Staples
Product Codes: CDH21A, CDH25A, CDH29A, CDH33A, ECS21A, ECS25A, ECS29A, ECS33A (Product codes are located on the front of the single unit carton.)
Manufacturing Dates: March 6, 2018 to March 6, 2019
Distribution Dates: March 15, 2018 to March 8, 2019
Devices Recalled in the U.S.: 92,496
Device Use
Surgeons use Ethicon Endo-Surgery Intraluminal Staplers in the gastrointestinal tract for creating connections between structures (anastomoses) in surgical procedures

Reason for Recall
Through investigation of complaints and returned products, Ethicon confirmed uncut washers in the stapler and malformed staples occur with their intraluminal circular staplers due to insufficient firing, which can compromise staple line integrity. When the washer is cut, confirming completion of the firing cycle, the surgeon experiences an audible and tactile crunch. Failure to cut the washer suggests complete 360-degree staple line failure.
In addition, an investigation of the manufacturing process detected a shift in a process, which occurred in March 2018 and continued through March 8, 2019, at which time the line was shut down.
The use of affected product may cause serious patient harm or death. Ethicon confirmed serious injuries to two patients. Misfiring of the stapler resulted in an additional resection — of the middle rectum in one patient and the lower rectum in another patient — during the planned resection of the upper rectum. Potential risks to patients include death, sepsis, bleeding, the need for permanent ostomy “bag,” life-long nutritional and digestive issues, leak in the closure (anastomotic leak), additional surgeries, need for additional closures (anastomoses), need for antibiotics, and the need for additional imaging studies.

Who May be Affected
Surgeons who have performed gastrointestinal surgeries
Patients who have had or may undergo gastrointestinal surgery, such as patients with colorectal cancer and bariatric patients
What to Do
The FDA’s recent letter to health care providers on surgical staplers and staples includes general recommendations for surgeons.
Surgeons who typically use these staplers have other options, including using:

Manual staplers from other manufacturers,
Powered staplers from Ethicon or other manufacturers,
Additionally, surgeons who typically use these staplers may consider performing an alternative approach to the surgery, such as:

Open surgery with an alternative of handsewn closure (anastomosis)
Delayed surgery
Minimally invasive surgery
On April 11, 2019, Ethicon notified customers who purchased the affected staplers (consignees) and provided instructions. Health care facilities, distributors, and other customers should:

14653,Takeda's Gattex (teduglutide) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Short Bowel Syndrome in Children,U.S. FDA Approves GATTEX (teduglutide) for Children 1 Year of Age and Older With Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS),"The approval follows 24 wks. a pediatric study assessing Gattex (teduglutide, 0.025/0.05 mg/kg/day) vs SOC in 68 patients with SBS aged ≥ 1 yrs. who are dependent on parenteral support (PS)
 The study resulted in 69% reduction in PS vol. by 20%+, 42% mean reduction in PS volume, 38% reduction in PS infusion by at least 1day/wk., reduction in PS infusion time by 3hrs., 12% completely weaned off PS
 Gattex (teduglutide, IV) is an approved GLP-2 analog, helping the intestine to absorb nutrients and reducing the dependency on PS and is indicated both in adults & pediatric patients for SBS","GATTEX is the only glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analog approved that improves intestinal absorption in patients with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support (PS)1
GATTEX has been shown to reduce PS volume and to help some children with SBS wean off of intravenous nutrition over time during clinical studies1
Lexington, MA, May 17, 2019 – Takeda Pharmaceuticals, U.S.A., Inc. (“Takeda”), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved extending the indication of GATTEX® (teduglutide) for injection to pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) who need additional nutrition or fluids from intravenous (IV) feeding (parenteral support).1
In children, SBS is a life-threatening, chronic, and rare malabsorption disorder resulting from surgical removal of a large portion of the intestine, which is typically due to congenital or acquired conditions of the newborn or trauma.2-4 Children with SBS are unable to absorb enough nutrients and fluids from what they eat and drink alone.2 A goal of SBS treatment is to restore the remaining intestine’s ability to absorb nutrients and reduce long-term dependence on parenteral support (PS).2
“As a pediatric gastroenterologist, one of my main treatment goals for children with SBS is to reduce their dependency on parenteral support,” said Beth Carter, MD, Medical Director of Intestinal Rehabilitation and Nutrition Support, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “I’m pleased that patients have access to a medication that may help them reach that goal.”
GATTEX is the first and only medicine that mimics naturally occurring glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), which helps the remaining intestine absorb more nutrients.1 In a pharmacodynamic study in adults, GATTEX was shown to improve the amount of fluids absorbed by the intestines.1
“Addressing high unmet needs of patients with complex and debilitating gastrointestinal (GI) conditions is a focus of Takeda’s work,” said Andrew Grimm, Global Clinical Development Lead, Takeda. “As the first U.S.-approved therapy in pediatric SBS patients dependent on PS that improves absorption, GATTEX offers these patients new hope to reduce PS requirements and the potential for PS independence. This approval underscores Takeda’s commitment to patients with rare and devastating GI conditions like SBS.”
In a 24-week pediatric study, GATTEX helped reduce the volume of daily PS required and time spent administering PS. Some children even achieved complete freedom from PS.1 Fifty- nine pediatric patients with SBS aged 1 year through 17 years chose whether to receive GATTEX or standard of care (SOC). Patients who chose to receive GATTEX treatment were subsequently randomized in a double-blind manner to 0.025 mg/kg/day (n=24) or 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=26), while 9 patients enrolled in the SOC arm. The recommended dosage of GATTEX is 0.05 mg/kg/day. Randomization to the GATTEX dose groups was stratified by age.1
At the end of the 24-week study, 69% of patients (18/26) who took GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg each day reduced PS volume by 20% or more. Based on patient-diary data, patients who received GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day experienced a 42% mean reduction in PS volume (mL/kg/day) from baseline (-23 mL/kg/day from baseline). At week 24, 38% of patients (10/26) were able to reduce PS infusion by at least 1 day per week.1 Patients reduced their PS infusion time by 3 hours per day on average compared to baseline.5 In addition, during this study 3 out of 26 (12%) children who received GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day completely weaned off PS.1
GATTEX has a demonstrated safety profile that is similar overall in pediatric and adult patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) seen in adult patients treated with GATTEX in clinical trials were abdominal pain, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal distension, injection site reaction, vomiting, fluid overload, and hypersensitivity.1
 
About Pediatric Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS)
Malabsorption of fluids and nutrients can place children with SBS at risk for diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and malnutrition.6 Parents and caregivers of children with SBS who are dependent on PS have reported in studies that they experience deterioration in their family life, social life, and work.4,7 PS reductions may represent a benefit to the lives of children with SBS, potentially giving them the freedom to do daily-life activities.8,9
 
About GATTEX® (teduglutide) for Injection
GATTEX® (teduglutide) is a recombinant analog of human glucagon-like peptide-2. In the U.S., GATTEX is indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with Short Bowel Syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support. The recommended dosage of GATTEX for both adults and pediatric patients is 0.05 mg/kg once daily by subcutaneous injection. Use of the GATTEX 5 mg kit is not recommended in pediatric patients weighing less than 10 kg. The recommended dosage in adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) is 0.025 mg/kg once daily.1

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Warnings and Precautions
Acceleration of Neoplastic growth
Colorectal polyps were identified during clinical trials. There is a risk for acceleration of neoplastic growth. In adults, within 6 months prior to starting treatment with GATTEX, colonoscopy of the entire colon with removal of polyps should be performed and follow-up colonoscopy (or alternate imaging) is recommended at the end of 1 year of GATTEX. Subsequent colonoscopies should be performed every 5 years or more often as needed.
In children and adolescents, perform fecal occult blood testing prior to initiating treatment with GATTEX. Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is required if there is unexplained blood in the stool. Perform subsequent fecal occult blood testing annually in children and adolescents while they are receiving GATTEX. Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is recommended for all children and adolescents after 1 year of treatment, every 5 years thereafter while on continuous treatment with GATTEX, and if they have new or unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding.
In case of intestinal malignancy (GI tract, hepatobiliary, pancreatic), discontinue GATTEX. The clinical decision to continue GATTEX in patients with non-gastrointestinal malignancy should be made based on benefit-risk considerations.
Intestinal obstruction
Intestinal obstruction has been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing. In patients who develop intestinal or stomal obstruction, GATTEX should be temporarily discontinued pending further clinical evaluation and management.
Biliary and pancreatic disease
Cholecystitis, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, and pancreatitis have been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing. Laboratory assessment (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase) should be obtained within 6 months prior to starting GATTEX. Subsequent laboratory tests should be done every 6 months or more often as needed. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation is recommended including imaging, and continued treatment with GATTEX should be reassessed.
Fluid imbalance and fluid overload
Fluid overload and congestive heart failure have been observed in clinical trials. If fluid overload occurs, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, parenteral support should be adjusted and GATTEX treatment reassessed. If significant cardiac deterioration develops while on GATTEX, continued GATTEX treatment should be reassessed.
Discontinuation of treatment with GATTEX may also result in fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Fluid and electrolyte status should be monitored in patients who discontinue treatment with GATTEX.
Increased absorption of concomitant oral medication
In clinical trials, one patient receiving prazepam concomitantly with GATTEX experienced dramatic deterioration in mental status progressing to coma during first week of GATTEX therapy. Patients receiving concomitant oral drugs requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored for adverse reactions due to potential increased absorption of the concomitant drug. The concomitant drug may require a reduction in dosage.
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) with GATTEX are abdominal pain, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal distension, injection site reaction, vomiting, fluid overload, and hypersensitivity.
Use in Specific Populations
Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with GATTEX.

NAYZILAM allows for administration by a non-healthcare professional in patients actively seizing when and where a seizure cluster occurs.
Approval of NAYZILAM adds to UCB’s already existing anti-epilepsy drug portfolio, reinforcing the company’s position as a global leader in epilepsy.
Brussels (Belgium) & Atlanta, Georgia (U.S.) – 0700 CEST May 20 2019: UCB announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a New Drug Application for the company’s newest anti-epileptic drug (AED) NAYZILAM® (midazolam) nasal spray CIV, a benzodiazepine indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older1. NAYZILAM now provides patients and caregivers with the first and only FDA-approved nasal option for treating seizure clusters.
It is estimated that more than 150,000 people in the U.S. with uncontrolled epilepsy also experience seizure clusters.2 Rescue treatment of seizure clusters is critical because when left untreated, seizure clusters can increase the risk of physical injury, neurological damage, prolonged seizures, and status epilepticus.3 Despite the impact of seizure clusters, many diagnosed patients may go untreated because currently available treatment options are not preferred.4, 5, 6, 7
NAYZILAM is a short-term treatment for seizure clusters in patients with epilepsy. The nasal spray is designed as a single-use treatment that can be carried with a patient. NAYZILAM allows for administration by a non-healthcare professional in patients actively seizing when and where a seizure cluster occurs. NAYZILAM can provide value to patients who are experiencing these disruptive seizures.
“As global leaders in epilepsy, the approval of NAYZILAM complements our already strong epilepsy portfolio, improving our ability to provide value to people living with poorly controlled seizures, and builds on our passion and expertise in this field. We are pleased to expand and diversify the solutions we can offer to the epilepsy community, providing an innovative and differentiated solution to help support management of seizure clusters,” said Jean-Christophe Tellier, Chief Executive Officer, UCB.
NAYZILAM is the first new medication approved to treat seizure clusters in more than 20 years in the U.S. Its nasal delivery could provide significant value to patients who currently have limited treatment options.
“When a patient experiences seizure clusters, there is often significant impact on their overall quality of life, in addition to posing greater risks for increased emergency department related hospitalizations and more serious seizure emergencies,” said Dr. Steven S. Chung, MD, Executive Director and Program Chair of the Neuroscience Institute and Director of the Epilepsy Program at Banner – University Medical Center. “Further, as a neurologist specializing in epilepsy, treating seizure clusters today presents a challenging barrier for many patients. The availability of a new treatment option, such as NAYZILAM, has potential to help improve the lives of patients and their families by providing another option for rescue care.”
UCB acquired NAYZILAM from Proximagen LLC in June 2018. UCB looks forward to NAYZILAM launching in the U.S. To learn more, go to www.Nayzilam.com.

About NAYZILAM1
NAYZILAM® (midazolam) nasal spray CIV is a benzodiazepine indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.
The effectiveness of NAYZILAM for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older was established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 1; NCT01390220)8.
Study 1 enrolled patients with epilepsy on a stable regimen of antiepileptic drugs who were identified by their physicians as having intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity that were distinct from the patient’s usual seizure pattern.
Study 1 was conducted in two phases: an open-label Test Dose Phase followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Comparative Phase. In the Test Dose Phase, tolerability was assessed in 292 patients who, in the absence of a seizure, received two 5 mg doses of NAYZILAM (10 mg total dosage) separated by 10 minutes. Patients were excluded from participation in the Comparative Phase if they failed to meet pre-defined blood pressure, heart rate, sedation, electrocardiogram, and peripheral oxygen saturation criteria.
In the Comparative Phase, 201 patients treated a single seizure cluster episode in an outpatient setting with either a blinded dose of NAYZILAM 5 mg (134 patients) or placebo (67 patients). If the seizure activity persisted or recurred, patients in both groups had the option to receive a subsequent unblinded dose of NAYZILAM 5 mg to be used between 10 minutes and 6 hours after administration of the initial blinded dose of study drug
The primary efficacy endpoint for Study 1 was treatment success, defined as the termination of seizures within 10 minutes after the initial blinded dose of study drug and the absence of a recurrence of seizures within 6 hours of the initial blinded dose of study drug. A statistically significantly higher percentage of NAYZILAM-treated patients met the primary efficacy endpoint.
Numerical differences in favor of NAYZILAM were observed on each of the components of the treatment success responder definition; termination of seizure(s) within 10 minutes after initial dose of study drug (80.6 versus 70.1%) and the absence of seizure recurrence between 10 minutes and 6 hours after the initial dose of study drug (58.2 versus 37.3%). The most common adverse reactions (≥5% in any NAYZILAM treatment group) were somnolence, headache, nasal discomfort, throat irritation, and rhinorrhea.
Study 1 also evaluated the occurrence and time to next seizure after the initial blinded dose of study drug. A smaller proportion of NAYZILAM-treated patients experienced the next seizure within 24 hours after the initial blinded dose of study drug (37.3% versus 46.3%). NAYZILAM-treated patients experienced a statistically longer time-to-next-seizure than the placebo group.
About Epilepsy9, 10, 11. 12
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder of the brain. It is the fourth most common neurological condition worldwide and affects approximately 65 million people. In the U.S. more than 3.4 million people have epilepsy. Anyone can develop epilepsy; it occurs across all ages, races and genders, and is defined as one or more unprovoked seizures with a risk of further seizures. Around one third of patients with epilepsy currently live with uncontrolled seizures.
About Seizure Clusters
Of the one third of patients living with uncontrolled epilepsy, it is estimated that more than 150,000 people in the U.S. with refractory epilepsy also experience seizure clusters.2 Seizure clusters are broadly defined as acute episodes of consecutive seizures that occur within a short period of time with a patient regaining consciousness during the interictal period. These clusters are also distinguishable from a person’s typical seizure pattern.2, 13, 14, 15, 16 Other names for seizure clusters include acute-repetitive seizures (ARS), serial seizures, crescendo seizures, and seizure flurries, which highlight the repetitive nature of the seizures.17 Seizure clusters are a form of seizure emergency that can evolve into prolonged seizures or status epilepticus.3

Important Safety Information for NAYZILAM1
NAYZILAM is indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
NAYZILAM is contraindicated in patients with acute narrow-angle glaucoma.
RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS
Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including NAYZILAM, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. 
Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.
Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.
RISKS OF CARDIORESPIRATORY ADVERSE REACTIONS
Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. Warn patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression, cardiac and respiratory arrest.
Respiratory depression was observed with the administration of NAYZILAM during clinical trials. The cardiac or respiratory arrest caused by NAYZILAM was not reported during clinical trials.
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OTHER CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS, OR MODERATE OR STRONG CYP3A4 INHIBITORS
Drug products containing midazolam, including NAYZILAM, have a central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect.
Risks from Concomitant Use with Other CNS Depressants
NAYZILAM may cause an increased CNS-depressant effect when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants (e.g., opioids). Warn patients and caregivers that the use of NAYZILAM in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect.
Risks from Concomitant Use with Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors
Concomitant use of NAYZILAM with moderate or strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors may result in prolonged sedation because of a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. Caution patients against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery, driving a motor vehicle or riding a bicycle until they have completely returned to their level of baseline functioning.
SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AND IDEATION
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including NAYZILAM, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Monitor patients treated with NAYZILAM for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Advise patients and caregivers to be alert for these behavioral changes and to immediately report them to the healthcare provider.
IMPAIRED COGNITIVE FUNCTION
Midazolam, including NAYZILAM, is associated with a high incidence of partial or complete impairment of recall for several hours following an administered dose. Counsel patients on when they can engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness, operate hazardous machinery, or drive a motor vehicle after taking NAYZILAM.
GLAUCOMA
Benzodiazepines, including NAYZILAM, can increase intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. NAYZILAM may be used in patients with open-angle glaucoma only if they are receiving appropriate therapy. NAYZILAM is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the most common adverse reactions (≥5% in any NAYZILAM treatment group) were somnolence, headache, nasal discomfort, throat irritation, and rhinorrhea.
NAYZILAM is a Schedule IV controlled substance.

 The focus of the collaboration is to foster Santhera’s neuromuscular pipeline and to utilize Biozentrum’s gene therapy in its Omigapil for improving its benefits in LAMA2 deficient MD
 Biozentrum’s gene therapy utilizes two linker proteins derived from agrin, laminin and nidogen leading to a restoration of muscle fiber, recovery of muscle force and size and increases body weight. Omigapil is a deprenyl-analog, exclusively licensed from Novartis by Santhera for CMD","Pratteln, Switzerland, May 21, 2019 – Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) announces its
collaboration with the Biozentrum of the University of Basel to advance gene therapy research for the
treatment of LAMA2-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD or MDC1A). The program is
supported by public funding for innovation in Switzerland through a grant from Innosuisse – the Suisse
Innovation Agency. Innosuisse and Santhera will jointly invest CHF 1.2 million into this preclinical
research collaboration.
Santhera has entered in a collaboration with Prof. Markus Rüegg from the Biozentrum, University of
Basel, who pioneered a novel gene therapy approach for the treatment of LAMA2 MD. The simultaneous
transgenic expression of specifically designed small protein domains, so-called linker proteins, helps to
overcome structural and functional loss of muscle fibers in a mouse model for LAMA2 MD,
demonstrating strong preclinical evidence for disease modifying potential. This novel gene therapy
strategy developed by Prof. Rüegg and coworkers will use two linker proteins that are composed of
domains derived from extracellular matrix proteins agrin, laminin and nidogen [1-4]. In animal models
for LAMA2 MD this approach has led to restoration of muscle fiber basement membranes, recovery of
muscle force and size, increased overall body weight and markedly prolonged survival [1]. The preclinical
research collaboration between Santhera and the University of Basel will explore the feasibility of gene
delivery by standard viral vectors as a basis for subsequent clinical work.
“LAMA2 MD is a severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which based on its molecular
pathology offers the possibility for gene replacement,” said Markus Rüegg, PhD, Professor for
Neurobiology at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel. “The approach we have optimized over the
past years relies on the simultaneous expression of two linker proteins engineered from extracellular
matrix proteins. We and others have shown that this approach has a profound beneficial effect in mouse
models of the disease. I am looking forward to collaborating with Santhera as our translational research
partner to advance our gene therapy approach towards clinical use.”
“Santhera is committed to advancing its neuromuscular pipeline and building on its leading expertise in
drug development for neuromuscular diseases, including CMD,” added Thomas Meier, PhD, CEO of
Santhera. “We are excited to collaborate with experts from the Biozentrum to advance this novel gene
therapy approach to the clinic for the benefit of patients with this devastating disease. We build on our
experience with omigapil, which we have recently studied in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with CMD
in a collaboration with experts at the National Institutes of Health (USA). From our previous work we
anticipate that this novel gene therapy approach and omigapil could act complementary. As before, we
will continue working closely with clinical experts and the patient community to establish the best way
forward.”

About LAMA2 MD (CMD Type 1A or MDC1A) and Emerging Therapy Approaches
Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are inherited neuromuscular diseases characterized by earlyonset weakness and hypotonia alongside associated dystrophic findings in muscle biopsy. Progressive
muscle weakness, joint contractures and respiratory insufficiency characterize most CMDs. Laminins are
proteins of the extracellular matrix that help maintain muscle fiber stability by binding to other proteins.
LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD, also called MDC1A), is one of the most common forms
of CMD. It is caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene encoding the alpha2 subunit of laminin-211. Most
LAMA2 MD patients show complete absence of laminin-alpha 2, are hypotonic (floppy) at birth, fail to
ambulate, and succumb to respiratory complications.
Previous work has demonstrated that two linker proteins, engineered with domains derived of the
extracellular matrix proteins agrin, laminin and nidogen, could compensate for the lack of laminin-alpha2
and restore the muscle basement membrane [1-4]. Through simultaneous expression of artificial linkers
(“SEAL”), this gene therapy approach aims to overcome the genetic defect by substituting laminin-alpha2
deficiency with small linker proteins containing necessary binding domains to re-establish muscle fiber
integrity. In a transgenic mouse model, the linker expression increased the lifespan of LAMA2-deficient
mice 5-fold to a median of 81 weeks compared to 15.5 weeks in the disease model without the
therapeutic linker expression [1]. Recently, it was demonstrated that such linker constructs could be
applied by standard adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors [5, 6].
Omigapil is a deprenyl-analog with anti-apoptotic properties. Previous work has demonstrated that
omigapil provides benefit to LAMA2-deficient mice [7] and has additive effects to gene therapy using
linker proteins [8]. Santhera obtained an exclusive license for omigapil from Novartis for the
development in CMDs. As previously reported, Santhera has completed an ascending multiple dose
cohort study (called CALLISTO) with omigapil in patients with two forms of CMD, including LAMA2 MD.
CALLISTO met its primary objective to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of omigapil, applied as liquid
formulation, and demonstrated that in this study the drug was safe and well tolerated in children and
adolescents with CMD. Furthermore, this trial also demonstrated that it is feasible to run clinical studies
in LAMA2 MD patients. Omigapil has orphan drug designations for CMD in the US and Europe and was
granted fast track designation by the FDA.

 The P-III KEYNOTE-119 study demonstrated that it did not meet its 1EPs of OS, safety profile of Keytruda is consistent as no new safety is observed
 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is mAb targeting PD-1, blocking the interaction b/w PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 thus activating T-lymphocytes affecting both tumor & healthy cells","MAY 20, 2019
KENILWORTH, N.J.– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-119 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the second- or third-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint of superior overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine). Other endpoints were not formally tested per the study protocol because the primary endpoint of OS was not met. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies involving patients treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy; no new safety concerns were identified. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
“Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive and challenging disease to treat, especially after progression on initial standard-of-care treatment,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “While we are disappointed by the outcome of this monotherapy trial, we are continuing to study KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of the disease and in combination with chemotherapy to address the unmet medical need of patients with triple negative breast cancer. We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this important study.”
The KEYTRUDA breast cancer clinical development program encompasses several internal and external collaborative studies, including three ongoing registration-enabling studies in TNBC (KEYNOTE-355, KEYNOTE-242, and KEYNOTE-522).
About KEYNOTE-119
KEYNOTE-119 is a Phase 3 randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02555657) evaluating KEYTRUDA monotherapy compared to single-agent physician’s choice chemotherapy in metastatic TNBC. The primary endpoint is OS and the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall response rate, disease control rate and duration of response. The study randomized 622 patients to receive either KEYTRUDA as monotherapy (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks for up to 24 months) or physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine) at a ratio of 1:1.
About Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
TNBC is an aggressive type of breast cancer that characteristically has a high recurrence rate within the first five years after diagnosis. While some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), TNBC tests negative for all three. As a result, TNBC does not respond to therapies targeting these markers, making it more difficult to treat. Approximately 10-20% of patients with breast cancer are diagnosed with TNBC.
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%).
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis, or Hepatoxicity (in Combination with Axitinib)
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Hepatotoxicity (in Combination With Axitinib)
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST were seen in 20% and 13% of patients, respectively. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used in monotherapy. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

14702,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Symbicort Turbuhaler (budesonide/formoterol) in Novel START Study for Mild Asthma,New data show Symbicort reduces attacks in mild asthma when used as an anti-inflammatory reliever,"The Novel START study results involve assessing of Symbicort Turbuhaler (prn) vs Albuterol (prn) or Budesonide (ICS maintenance treatment) + albuterol (prn) in 668 patients with mild asthma aged 18-75 yrs. across Australia, Italy, New Zealand and the UK
 The Novel START study results: 51% reduction in the rate of annual asthma exacerbation compared to albuterol (0.195 vs 0.400 /patient/year); asthma exacerbation compared to budesonide + albuterol (0.195 vs 0.175/patient/year)
 Albuterol is a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever while budesonide is a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) maintenance therapy. Symbicort is a combination therapy of budesonide and formoterol and its Turbuhaler device is approved as an anti-inflammatory reliever for mild asthma in Brazil & Russia","Trial reflecting real-world practice showed a reduction in the rate of asthma attacks compared to the most commonly used reliever therapy
New data from Novel START, an open-label trial designed to reflect real-world practice, has demonstrated the effectiveness of Symbicort Turbuhaler (budesonide/formoterol) as a potential anti-inflammatory reliever in mild asthma.1
These results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine and are being presented at the American Thoracic Society 2019 International Conference.1
The trial compared Symbicort Turbuhaler with two commonly used treatment regimens in mild asthma. In real-world practice, patients typically use a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever in response to symptoms or daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) maintenance therapy with a SABA reliever. In this trial, patients with mild asthma were randomised to receive either albuterol (a SABA reliever) taken as-needed, or budesonide (an ICS maintenance treatment) plus albuterol as-needed, or Symbicort Turbuhaler used as an anti-inflammatory reliever therapy taken as-needed.1
Symbicort Turbuhaler demonstrated a 51% reduction in the rate of annual asthma exacerbations compared to albuterol. There was no difference in the exacerbation rate between Symbicort Turbuhaler and twice-daily maintenance budesonide plus albuterol, despite a 52% reduction in the mean steroid dose with Symbicort Turbuhaler.1 These data support the findings of the SYGMA 1 and 2 trials published in May 2018.2,3
Alex de Giorgio-Miller, Therapy Area Vice President, Respiratory, Global Medical Affairs, said: “There are an estimated 176 million asthma attacks globally each year and all asthma patients, regardless of their disease severity, are at risk of severe attacks. The Novel START trial demonstrates the effectiveness of Symbicort as an anti-inflammatory reliever to reduce the risk of asthma attacks in patients with mild disease, compared with the most commonly used asthma reliever. In a trial that reflects real-world practice, these data reinforce evidence from the SYGMA trials and build on the established clinical profile of Symbicort in moderate-to-severe disease.”
Professor Richard Beasley, Director of the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand said: “Asthma attacks are a major burden in mild disease. SABA relievers do not address the underlying inflammation in asthma, and patients with mild disease who rely on SABA alone are at greater risk of asthma attacks than those taking an anti-inflammatory therapy. Novel START showed that Symbicort used as an anti-inflammatory reliever was superior to as-needed SABA for the prevention of asthma attacks in mild disease.”
Novel START was conducted by the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand and was funded by a research grant from AstraZeneca and core institutional funding from the Health Research Council of New Zealand.
Safety and tolerability data for Symbicort Turbuhaler as-needed were consistent with the known profile of the medicine. The most commonly reported adverse events in the Novel START trial were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and asthma.1
Symbicort Turbuhaler is approved as a maintenance and reliever therapy in many countries for moderate-to-severe asthma, and as an anti-inflammatory reliever as-needed in patients with mild asthma in Brazil and Russia. A regulatory submission to expand the indication for Symbicort Turbuhaler as an anti-inflammatory reliever in mild asthma has been accepted in Europe. In the US, Symbicort is approved for use in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler device, but not the Turbuhaler device.
About Novel START
Novel START (Novel Symbicort Turbuhaler Asthma Reliever Therapy) is Externally Sponsored Scientific Research (ESR). The primary objective of the trial was to assess the efficacy of Symbicort Turbuhaler given as an anti-inflammatory reliever as-needed in adults with mild asthma.
The 52-week pragmatic trial supports the findings of the double-blind, double-dummy SYGMA trials (also published in the New England Journal of Medicine), but in an open-label treatment regimen reflecting real-world practice in 668 patients aged 18-75 years in Australia, Italy, New Zealand and the UK with a self-reported doctor-diagnosis of asthma. Patients were enrolled if they had used a SABA inhaler as sole asthma therapy in the previous 3 months and required use of SABA on ≥2 occasions in the previous 4 weeks (but on average ≤2 occasions per day in the previous 4 weeks). In the trial, Symbicort Turbuhaler as-needed (200/6 µg; n=220) was compared to SABA treatment with albuterol (known as salbutamol in many countries) as-needed (100 μg; n=223), and maintenance ICS therapy with budesonide twice-daily plus albuterol as-needed (200 µg and 100 μg, respectively; n=225). These comparators reflect two of the treatment options most commonly used in clinical practice for the management of mild asthma.
The results of the primary outcome measurements are:
Symbicort Turbuhaler demonstrated a 51% reduction in the rate of annual asthma exacerbations versus SABA treatment with albuterol as-needed (absolute rate 0.195 vs 0.400 per patient per year, respectively; relative rate 0.49 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.72), P<0.001).
There was no difference in the exacerbation rate between Symbicort Turbuhaler as-needed and maintenance budesonide plus as-needed albuterol (absolute rate 0.195 and 0.175 per patient per year, respectively; relative rate 1.12 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.79), P=0.65). (The mean budesonide dose with Symbicort Turbuhaler as-needed and maintenance budesonide was 107 µg/day and 222 µg/day, respectively.)
About asthma
Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease, and it affects the health and day-to-day lives of as many as 339 million adults and children worldwide.4 It is characterised by recurrent breathlessness and wheezing which varies over time, and which varies in severity and frequency from person to person.5
All asthma patients are at risk of severe attacks, regardless of their disease severity, adherence to treatment or level of control.6,7,8 There are an estimated 176 million asthma attacks globally per year;9 these attacks are physically threatening and emotionally significant for many patients.10 However, despite the fact that asthma is a chronic, variable inflammatory disease, patients are either under-prescribed or under-use their anti-inflammatory ‘preventer’ therapy and over-rely on their SABA reliever, which can mask symptom worsening.11,12,13,14 Taking a SABA inhaler alone during or after a worsening of symptoms does not address the underlying inflammation, leaving patients at risk of asthma attack and potential exposure to frequent bursts of oral corticosteroids.15
About Symbicort
Symbicort is a combination formulation containing budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) that treats underlying inflammation, and formoterol, a long-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator (LABA) with a fast onset of action, in a single inhaler. Symbicort is approved as a treatment regimen for patients with moderate to severe disease. Symbicort was launched in 2000 and is approved in approximately 120 countries to treat asthma and/or COPD either as Symbicort Turbuhaler or Symbicort pMDI (pressurised metered-dose inhaler).

Data presented at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes (ISPOR) 2019 Annual Meeting

May 20, 2019 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time
BOULDER, Colo.-Clovis Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLVS) today announced data demonstrating that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who received Rubraca in the Phase 3 ARIEL3 study had longer periods of quality-adjusted time without clinically relevant symptoms as compared to patients who received placebo, and that Rubraca maintenance treatment continued to provide significant benefit in progression-free survival when weighted with patients’ perceptions of their wellbeing. The presentation today at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes (ISPOR) Annual Meeting in New Orleans highlights post-hoc evaluations of quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) and quality-adjusted PFS (QA-PFS) from the randomized, placebo-controlled study of Rubraca®▼(rucaparib) for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. To the company’s knowledge, this is the first time that Q-TWiST data will be presented in the maintenance therapy setting in recurrent ovarian cancer.
“The goal of maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer is to delay disease progression without compromising a patient’s quality of life,” said Robert L. Coleman, MD, professor of Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “The findings from QA-PFS and Q-TWiST analyses of ARIEL3 data demonstrate that the clinical benefits of rucaparib as maintenance therapy were retained across all trial populations. These results further support the positive benefit-risk profile of rucaparib in ARIEL3, including the absence of a detrimental effect on patient-centered outcomes across all treatment cohorts in the study.”
During the study, patients were asked to complete EuroQol’s five-dimension, three-level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire at screening, on day 1 of each treatment cycle, at the treatment discontinuation visit, and at the 28-day follow-up visit. QA-PFS and Q-TWiST analyses were calculated using EQ-5D-3L data as described in the poster. Patient-centered outcomes were examined in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients), in patients with a BRCA mutation, and in subgroups of patients with BRCA wild-type carcinomas based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) status (BRCA wild type/LOH high; BRCA wild type/LOH low; and BRCA wild type/LOH indeterminate).
Results from the study include:
Mean QA-PFS was significantly longer in the Rubraca arm than placebo arm (12.02 vs 5.74 months) for the ITT population and for patients with a BRCA mutation (15.28 vs. 5.92 months)
In patients with a BRCA wild-type carcinoma, mean QA-PFS was longer in the Rubraca arm than the placebo arm regardless of LOH status
Mean Q-TWiST analysis using all grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was significantly longer in the rucaparib arm than placebo for the ITT population (13.32 vs 6.44 months) and for patients with a BRCA mutation (16.42 vs 6.70 months)
In the analyses using TEAEs of interest (grade ≥2 TEAEs of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and asthenia), Q-TWiST was also longer in the rucaparib arm than placebo for the ITT population (13.16 vs 6.40 months) and for patients with BRCA mutation (16.24 vs 6.68 months)
In patients with BRCA wild-type carcinoma, longer Q-TWiST was also observed in the Rubraca treated arm, regardless of LOH status
“It is very important to evaluate patients’ perceptions of their well-being during any type of treatment, particularly in the maintenance therapy setting in which patients may be on therapy for an extended period of time,” said Professor Jonathan Ledermann, M.D., Professor of Medical Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute and UCL Hospitals, London. “These QA-PFS and Q-TWiST data from ARIEL3 integrate the patient perspective over the course of follow-up until progression to reflect their overall experience over time and suggests that the toxicity which may occur with rucaparib doesn’t outweigh its clinical benefit as maintenance treatment for women with recurrent ovarian cancer.”
The Rubraca ISPOR poster will be available online at http://clovisoncology.com/pipeline/scientific-presentations/ as of the time it is presented at the meeting.
About Quality-Adjusted PFS (QA-PFS) and Quality-Adjusted Time Without Symptoms or Toxicity (Q-TWiST)

QA-PFS represents the duration of survival without disease progression, adjusted for the value the patient placed on their health status – i.e. it is a survival measure that adjusts for patient perceptions of treatment toxicity and any associated detrimental effects.
Q-TWiST results were derived by subtracting from the survival endpoint all time in which patients experienced treatment toxicity or disease symptoms, and then multiplying this area under the curve by a patient-derived utility value. Q-TWiST therefore adds additional value not available in a traditional TWiST analysis because it reflects patients’ perceptions of the impact of toxicity on the survival endpoint.
About the ARIEL3 Clinical Trial
The ARIEL3 pivotal study of rucaparib is a confirmatory randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of rucaparib against placebo to evaluate whether rucaparib given as a maintenance treatment to platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients can extend the period of time for which the disease is controlled after a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The study enrolled 564 patients with high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. To be eligible for the study, participants had to have received at least two prior platinum-based treatment regimens, been sensitive to the penultimate platinum regimen, and achieved a complete or partial response to their most recent platinum-based regimen. There were no genomic selection criteria for this study. Trial participants were randomized 2:1 to receive 600 milligrams of rucaparib twice daily (BID) or placebo. The study achieved its primary endpoint of improved PFS by investigator review in each of three populations. PFS was also improved in the rucaparib group compared with placebo by independent review, a key secondary endpoint, in all three populations. In addition, rucaparib improved objective response rate vs placebo among evaluable trial participants in all three study populations.
About Rubraca (rucaparib)
Rucaparib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 being developed in multiple tumor types, including ovarian and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers, as monotherapy, and in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Exploratory studies in other tumor types are also underway.
Rubraca U.S. FDA Approved Indications
Rubraca is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
Rubraca is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA mutations (germline and/or somatic) associated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.
Select Important Safety Information
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) occur uncommonly in patients treated with Rubraca and are potentially fatal adverse reactions. In approximately 1100 treated patients, MDS/AML occurred in 12 patients (1.1%), including those in long-term follow-up. Of these, five occurred during treatment or during the 28-day safety follow-up (0.5%). The duration of Rubraca treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML ranged from 1 month to approximately 28 months. The cases were typical of secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML; in all cases, patients had received previous platinum-containing regimens and/or other DNA-damaging agents. Do not start Rubraca until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤ Grade 1).
Monitor complete blood counts for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities (> 4 weeks), interrupt Rubraca or reduce dose (see Dosage and Administration [2.2] in full Prescribing Information) and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, or if MDS/AML is suspected, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample cytogenetic analysis. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue Rubraca.
Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Rubraca.
Most common adverse reactions in ARIEL3 (≥ 20%; Grade 1–4) were nausea (76%), fatigue/asthenia (73%), abdominal pain/distention (46%), rash (43%), dysgeusia (40%), anemia (39%), AST/ALT elevation (38%), constipation (37%), vomiting (37%), diarrhea (32%), thrombocytopenia (29%), nasopharyngitis/upper respiratory tract infection (29%), stomatitis (28%), decreased appetite (23%) and neutropenia (20%).
Most common laboratory abnormalities in ARIEL3 (≥ 25%; Grade 1–4) were increase in creatinine (98%), decrease in hemoglobin (88%), increase in cholesterol (84%), increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (73%), increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (61%), decrease in platelets (44%), decrease in leukocytes (44%), decrease in neutrophils (38%), increase in alkaline phosphatase (37%) and decrease in lymphocytes (29%).
Most common adverse reactions in Study 10 and ARIEL2 (≥ 20%; Grade 1–4) were nausea (77%), asthenia/fatigue (77%), vomiting (46%), anemia (44%), constipation (40%), dysgeusia (39%), decreased appetite (39%), diarrhea (34%), abdominal pain (32%), dyspnea (21%) and thrombocytopenia (21%).
Most common laboratory abnormalities in Study 10 and ARIEL2 (≥ 35%; Grade 1–4) were increase in creatinine (92%), increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (74%), increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (73%), decrease in hemoglobin (67%), decrease in lymphocytes (45%), increase in cholesterol (40%), decrease in platelets (39%) and decrease in absolute neutrophil count (35%).
Co-administration of Rubraca can increase the systemic exposure of CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates, which may increase the risk of toxicities of these drugs. Adjust dosage of CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates, if clinically indicated. If co-administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) cannot be avoided, consider increasing frequency of international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed children from Rubraca, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with Rubraca and for 2 weeks after the last dose. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. You may also report side effects to Clovis Oncology, Inc. at 1-844-258-7662.

 Peloton’s PT2977 is an oral HIF-2α inhibitor, currently being evaluated in multiple studies as a monothx. or in combination with cabozantinib for multiple indications","Acquisition Includes Novel Late-Stage Renal Cell Carcinoma Candidate, PT2977

KENILWORTH, N.J. & DALLAS—- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Peloton Therapeutics, Inc. today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire privately held Peloton, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel small molecule therapeutic candidates targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) for the treatment of patients with cancer and other non-oncology diseases. Peloton’s lead candidate is PT2977, a novel oral HIF-2α inhibitor in late-stage development for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
“This acquisition exemplifies Merck’s strategy to pursue novel therapeutic candidates based on exceptionally promising and innovative research,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Peloton scientists have applied their unique expertise in HIF-2α biology to develop PT2977, which has already shown intriguing activity in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. We look forward to advancing this late-stage asset as part of our broad oncology R&D program.”
Under terms of the agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all outstanding shares of Peloton in exchange for an upfront payment of $1.05 billion in cash. In addition, Peloton shareholders will be eligible to receive a further $1.15 billion contingent upon successful achievement of future regulatory and sales milestones for certain candidates.
“Merck is recognized as a leader in cancer research and shares our commitment to accelerating the development of candidates targeting HIF-2α to help patients with advanced cancers and other diseases,” said John A. Josey, Ph.D., Peloton’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are proud to have advanced PT2977 to this stage of development and believe that Merck is well suited to build upon the progress our company has made.”

About PT2977
PT2977 is a potent, selective, investigational oral HIF-2α inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical studies. Specifically, PT2977 is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated RCC, a Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with cabozantinib, a VEGFR-targeting agent, in metastatic RCC, a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical trial in patients with metastatic RCC, and an expansion arm of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In cancer, HIF-2α is aberrantly activated in these diseases as a result of the inactivity of the VHL tumor suppressor. This inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor is observed in over 90% of clear cell RCC, the most common form of kidney cancer. Results from a Phase 1/2 study of PT2977 demonstrated favorable safety and early signs of anti-tumor activity as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic RCC.

and clinicians in research and speed evidence generation
South San Francisco, CA — May 21, 2019 — Verily, an Alphabet company, today announced
strategic alliances with Novartis (NYSE: NVS), Otsuka (NYSE: OTSKY), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:
PFE) and Sanofi (EURONEXT: SAN, NASDAQ: SNY) to develop digitally innovative,
patient-centered clinical research programs using Project Baseline’s evidence generation
platform and tools. The Baseline Platform is designed to engage more patients and clinicians in
research, increase the speed and ease of conducting studies and collect more comprehensive,
higher quality data, including outside the four walls of a clinic.
Across the United States, the number of people participating in clinical research — including
clinical trials and observational studies — is less than 10% of the population. In addition to low
participation, challenges in research include data fragmentation, inefficient operations and
limited value for patients.
Alongside academic research institutions, patient-advocacy groups and health systems, Verily
and its industry partners aim to implement a more patient-centric, technology-enabled approach
to research, and increase the number and diversity of clinical research participants. They will
also explore novel approaches to generating real-world evidence using the Baseline Platform to
collect, organize and activate health information from electronic health records, sensors and
other digital sources. Over the coming years, Novartis, Otsuka, Pfizer and Sanofi each plan to
launch clinical studies leveraging the platform across diverse therapeutic areas, such as
cardiovascular disease, oncology, mental health, dermatology and diabetes.
“Evidence generation through research is the backbone of improving health outcomes. We need
to be inclusive and encourage diversity in research to truly understand health and disease, and
to provide meaningful insights about new medicines, medical devices and digital health
solutions,” said Jessica Mega, M.D., chief medical and scientific officer, Verily. “Novartis,
Otsuka, Pfizer and Sanofi have been early adopters of advanced technology and digital tools to
improve clinical research operations, and together we’re taking another step towards making
research accessible and generating evidence to inform better treatments and care.”
The evolution of Project Baseline
Verily launched Project Baseline in 2017 with the Project Baseline Health Study to develop the
technology and tools to help researchers create a more comprehensive, precise map of human
health. The company’s interdisciplinary team of engineers, clinicians, scientists and partners
have since developed and continue to expand:

.pdf
● User-friendly devices, dashboards and analytical tools that create an engaging
experience for patients and provide research decision support to study coordinators and
researchers;
● An interoperable platform that provides access to timely, normalized data in order to
streamline enrollment and management of studies; and
● A robust infrastructure that enables collection of dynamic data, like electronic health
records, biometric or self-reported information, which may provide significantly more
context about the value of an intervention.
Verily’s Project Baseline has also built a connected ecosystem with the aim of linking patients
and advocacy groups with clinicians and health systems, integrating clinical research with
clinical practice and making the process engaging. It started with a community of researchers,
study sponsors and study volunteers, including Duke University School of Medicine, Stanford
Medicine, Google and the American Heart Association (AHA) who helped test tools and
technologies in the landmark Project Baseline Health Study. Next, Verily launched the Project
Baseline Advisory Board of luminaries spanning healthcare, technology, medicine and patient
advocacy. Then, in early 2019, Verily and the AHA announced Research Goes Red, which will
leverage the Baseline Platform to engage more women in research, and an ongoing
collaboration to connect patient communities with relevant research opportunities. Finally, this
month Verily launched the Baseline Health System Consortium with vanguard health systems in
the United States to explore the use of new tools and technology to improve research broadly
and help bridge the gap between clinical research and clinical care.
“If we are truly to achieve the realization of patient-centered care, we must advance innovative
research methodologies that focus on the patient and their needs, values and lifestyles,” said
Reed Tuckson, M.D., chairman, Project Baseline Advisory Board. “Project Baseline, in
collaboration with these innovative companies, is well positioned to achieve this vision and have
a transformative impact on research.”
Verily’s initial strategic alliances with Novartis, Otsuka, Pfizer and Sanofi strengthen the
innovative research ecosystem that will continue to expand and could help foster greater
scientific discovery through the creation of next-generation research and development
programs.

“At Novartis we are advancing treatments that stand to change the course of disease, or even
offer cures, but our ability to bring new medicines to patients quickly is often hampered by
inefficient or limited participation in clinical trials,” said Badhri Srinivasan, head, global
development operations, Novartis. “By combining our complementary sets of expertise, we have
the opportunity to develop a new trial recruitment model that gives patients and their physicians
greater insight into the process of finding treatments for their disease, and how they can
participate.”
“The clinical research process is antiquated in many ways. Our collaboration with Verily aims to
redefine and redesign this process to make clinical trials more accessible to patients, and
clinical research more precise and targeted so we can obtain results and seek approvals
sooner, which would put therapies into the hands of physicians and their patients earlier,” said
Debbie Profit, Ph.D., M.S., vice president, applied innovation and process improvement,
Otsuka. “As an early adopter of the Baseline Platform, we have the opportunity to leverage
real-world data, through sensors, EHR integrations and other tools to corroborate evidence
around the treatments and interventions we are studying – while reducing the burden on clinical
trial participants.”
“In clinical research, for several years now we have been pursuing game-changing possibilities
to deploy digital technology and data science to re-engineer how we operate,” said Rod
MacKenzie, chief development officer and executive vice president, Pfizer. “The science behind
our potential new medicines is cutting edge, yet many clinical trial processes have remained
relatively unchanged over decades. To bring scientific breakthroughs to patients more quickly
and increase the diversity of the patient population in our clinical trials, Pfizer is committed to
exploring new technologies and innovative ways to conduct clinical research, and we are proud
to partner with Verily in that effort.”
“Our scientific knowledge has exploded over the past generation, but efficiently bringing these
new breakthroughs from lab bench to patient requires us to greatly improve the way we conduct
these complex clinical trials,” said Lionel Bascles, global head of clinical sciences and
operations, Sanofi. “Project Baseline will allow us to better recruit appropriate patients and more
efficiently integrate data for a greater understanding of diseases, reconnecting trials to our
patients’ healthcare journeys.”

BOULDER, Colo., May 21, 2019 Array BioPharma Inc. (Nasdaq: ARRY) today announced positive results from the interim analysis of the Phase 3 BEACON CRC trial evaluating the combination of BRAFTOVI®(encorafenib), a BRAF inhibitor, MEKTOVI® (binimetinib), a MEK inhibitor, and ERBITUX® (cetuximab), an anti-EGFR antibody (BRAFTOVI Triplet), in patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), following one or two prior lines of therapy. The trial met both primary endpoints of confirmed objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), and overall survival (OS). Array intends to submit these results of the BEACON CRC trial for marketing approval in the second half of 2019.
Results from the trial showed that BRAF-mutant mCRC patients treated with the BRAFTOVI Triplet demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ORR (26.1% vs. 1.9%, p<0.0001, per BICR) and OS (median 9.0 months vs. 5.4 months, [HR 0.52, 95% CI (0.39-0.70), p<0.0001]) compared to cetuximab plus irinotecan-containing regimens (Control).
“The BEACON CRC trial is the first Phase 3 trial in patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC and these results show a significant improvement compared to available standard of care options for this patient population,” said Scott Kopetz, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Associate Professor, Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “Given that there are no therapies currently FDA-approved for this patient population, I believe the results of the BEACON CRC trial will be practice-changing.”
The analysis of ORR was based on the first 331 randomized patients, while the interim analysis of OS included all 665 randomized patients, and was based on a data cutoff date in February of 2019, approximately two weeks after the last patient was enrolled. Future analyses will assess ORR on the total population and OS with longer follow up.
Results from the secondary endpoint analysis showed that patients treated with the combination of BRAFTOVI and cetuximab (BRAFTOVI Doublet) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ORR (20.4% vs. 1.9%, p<0.0001, per BICR) and OS (median 8.4 months vs. 5.4 months, [HR 0.60, 95% CI (0.45-0.79), p=0.0003]) compared to Control.
A descriptive comparison of the BRAFTOVI Triplet to the BRAFTOVI Doublet demonstrated a positive trend across endpoints including ORR and OS [HR 0.79, 95% CI (0.59-1.06), nominal p=0.1164].
In patients receiving one prior line of therapy, ORR as assessed by BICR was 34.3% with the BRAFTOVI Triplet and 22.4% with the BRAFTOVI Doublet, while at this time the OS for both arms is consistent with that seen in the overall population.
“We are pleased to announce positive results from the BEACON CRC trial, including that the BRAFTOVI Triplet reduced the risk of death by 48% versus control,” said Ron Squarer, CEO, Array BioPharma. “We are deeply grateful to the patients and investigators whose participation has helped bring us one step closer to delivering a new standard of care for patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC. This has the potential to be the first chemotherapy-free, targeted regimen for mCRC patients, a population with a very high unmet need for effective treatments.”
As demonstrated in the control arm of the BEACON CRC trial and consistent with historical data, patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC generally have a poor prognosis with currently available treatments and currently there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated for this high unmet need population. [1-12,14] BRAF mutations are estimated to occur in up to 15% of patients with mCRC and V600E is the most common mutation. [1-3,12-14]
The BRAFTOVI Triplet and Doublet were generally well-tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. The safety profiles of the BRAFTOVI Triplet and Doublet were consistent with prior reported experience with each regimen and with effects of MEK, RAF and EGFR therapies.
In March 2019, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) updated their Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Colon and Rectal Cancer to include BRAFTOVI in combination with MEKTOVI and an anti-EGFR antibody as a Category 2A treatment for patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC, after failure of one or two prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease. The NCCN based their recommendation on data from the safety lead-in of the BEACON CRC trial.
On August 7, 2018, Array announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to BRAFTOVI, in combination with MEKTOVI and ERBITUX for the treatment of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC as detected by an FDA-approved test, after failure of one to two prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease.
The triplet combination of BRAFTOVI, MEKTOVI and ERBITUX for the treatment of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC is investigational and not approved by the FDA.

About Colorectal Cancer
Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and the second most common in women, with approximately 1.4 million new diagnoses in 2012. Globally in 2012, approximately 694,000 deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer. [15] In the U.S. alone, an estimated 140,250 patients were diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2018, and approximately 50,000 are estimated to die of their disease each year. [16] BRAF mutations are estimated to occur in up to 15% of patients with mCRC and represent a poor prognosis for these patients. [1-3,12,14] The V600 mutation is the most common BRAF mutation and the risk of mortality in CRC patients with the BRAFV600E mutation is more than two times higher than for those with wild-type BRAF. [12-13] Several irinotecan and cetuximab-containing regimens, similar to the BEACON CRC control arm, have established observed historical published benchmarks in BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC patients, whose disease has progressed after one or two prior lines of therapy. These benchmarks include ORR of 4% to 8%, mPFS of 2 to 3 months and median OS of 4 to 6 months. [1-8] BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC is an area of high unmet need as there are currently no FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated for patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC, and these patients derive limited benefit from available chemotherapy regimens. [9-11] For more information about BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC visit www.brafmcrc.com.
About BEACON CRC
BEACON CRC is a randomized, open-label, global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of BRAFTOVI, MEKTOVI and ERBITUX in patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC whose disease has progressed after one or two prior regimens. BEACON CRC is the first and only Phase 3 trial designed to test a BRAF/MEK combo targeted therapy in BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. Thirty patients were treated in the safety lead-in and received the triplet combination (BRAFTOVI 300 mg daily, MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily and ERBITUX per label). Of the 30 patients, 29 had a BRAFV600mutation. Microsatellite instability high, resulting from defective DNA mismatch repair, was detected in only 1 patient. As previously announced, the triplet combination demonstrated good tolerability, supporting initiation of the randomized portion of the trial. The randomized portion of the BEACON CRC trial is designed to assess the efficacy of BRAFTOVI in combination with ERBITUX with or without MEKTOVI compared to ERBITUX and irinotecan-based therapy. 665 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive the triplet combination, the doublet combination (BRAFTOVI and ERBITUX) or the control arm (irinotecan-based therapy and ERBITUX). The study has been amended to include an interim analysis of endpoints including ORR. The primary overall survival endpoint is a comparison of the triplet combination to the control arm. Secondary endpoints address efficacy of the doublet combination compared to the control arm, and the triplet combination compared to the doublet therapy. Other secondary endpoints include PFS, duration of response, safety and tolerability. Health related quality of life data will also be assessed. The trial is being conducted at over 200 investigational sites in North America, South America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. The BEACON CRC trial is being conducted with support from Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Pierre Fabre and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (support is for sites outside of North America).
The triplet combination of BRAFTOVI, MEKTOVI and ERBITUX for the treatment of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC is investigational and not approved by the FDA.
About BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI
BRAFTOVI is an oral small molecule BRAF kinase inhibitor and MEKTOVI is an oral small molecule MEK inhibitor which target key enzymes in the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK). Inappropriate activation of proteins in this pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers including melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and others. In the U.S., BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI are approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. BRAFTOVI is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma. In Europe, the combination is approved for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600mutation, as detected by a validated test. In Japan, the combination is approved for unresectable melanoma with a BRAF mutation.
Array has exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in the U.S. and Canada. Array has granted Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Japan and South Korea, Medison exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Israel and Pierre Fabre exclusive rights to commercialize both products in all other countries, including Europe, Latin American and Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea).
BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI have received regulatory approval in the United States, European Union, Australia and Japan. The Swiss Medicines Agency (Swissmedic) is currently reviewing the Marketing Authorization Applications for BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI submitted by Pierre Fabre.
Indications and Usage
BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib) and MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) are kinase inhibitors indicated for use in combination for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test.
Limitations of Use: BRAFTOVI is not indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma.
BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI Important Safety Information
The information below applies to the safety of the combination of BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI unless otherwise noted. See full Prescribing Information for BRAFTOVI and for MEKTOVI for dose modifications for adverse reactions.
Warnings and Precautions
New Primary Malignancies: Cutaneous and non-cutaneous malignancies can occur. In the COLUMBUS trial, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, including keratoacanthoma, occurred in 2.6% and basal cell carcinoma occurred in 1.6% of patients. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies.
Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors: Confirm evidence of BRAFV600E or V600Kmutation prior to initiating BRAFTOVI.
Cardiomyopathy, manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients. In the COLUMBUS trial, cardiomyopathy occurred in 7% and Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.6% of patients. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 87% of patients. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiogram or MUGA scan prior to initiating treatment, 1 month after initiating treatment, and then every 2 to 3 months during treatment. Safety has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely.
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): In the COLUMBUS trial, VTE occurred in 6% of patients, including 3.1% of patients who developed pulmonary embolism.
Hemorrhage: In the COLUMBUS trial, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients and ≥ Grade 3 hemorrhage occurred in 3.2% of patients. Fatal intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of new or progressive brain metastases occurred in 1.6% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were gastrointestinal, including rectal hemorrhage (4.2%), hematochezia (3.1%), and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage (1%).
Ocular Toxicities: In the COLUMBUS trial, serous retinopathy occurred in 20% of patients; 8% were retinal detachment and 6% were macular edema. Symptomatic serous retinopathy occurred in 8% of patients with no cases of blindness. RVO is a known class-related adverse reaction of MEK inhibitors and may occur in patients treated with MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib. In patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma across multiple clinical trials, 0.1% of patients experienced retinal vein occlusion (RVO). The safety of MEKTOVI has not been established in patients with a history of RVO or current risk factors for RVO including uncontrolled glaucoma or a history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes. Perform ophthalmological evaluation for patient-reported acute vision loss or other visual disturbance within 24 hours. Permanently discontinue MEKTOVI in patients with documented RVO. In COLUMBUS, uveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis was reported in 4% of patients. Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform ophthalmological evaluation at regular intervals and for any visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): ILD, including pneumonitis occurred in 0.3% of patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma across multiple clinical trials. Assess new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms or findings for possible ILD.
Hepatotoxicity: In the COLUMBUS trial, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests was 6% for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 0.5% for alkaline phosphatase. Monitor liver laboratory tests before and during treatment and as clinically indicated.
Rhabdomyolysis: In the COLUMBUS trial, elevation of laboratory values of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) occurred in 58% of patients. Rhabdomyolysis was reported in 0.1% of patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma across multiple clinical trials. Monitor CPK and creatinine levels prior to initiating MEKTOVI, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated.
QTc Prolongation: BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients. In the COLUMBUS trial, an increase in QTcF to > 500 ms was measured in 0.5% (1/192) of patients. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc > 500 ms.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: BRAFTOVI or MEKTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Non-hormonal contraceptives should be used during treatment and for at least 30 days after the final dose for patients taking BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI.
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%, all Grades, in the COLUMBUS trial): were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgia, myopathy, hyperkeratosis, rash, headache, constipation, visual impairment, serous retinopathy.
In the COLUMBUS trial, the most common laboratory abnormalities (≥20%, all Grades): included increased creatinine, increased CPK, increased gamma glutamyl transferase, anemia, increased ALT, hyperglycemia, increased AST, and increased alkaline phosphatase.
Drug Interactions

 The TRILUMINATE study results: reduction in tricuspid regurgitation (86.6%); improvement in KCCQ score (53.05 to 67.25), the study follows MitraClip, clip-based technology intended to treat leaky mitral valves
 Abbott’s transcatheter tricuspid valve repair is a device intended to treat tricuspid regurgitation caused by a leaky tricuspid heart valve","Late-breaking data for Abbott’s investigational clip-based tricuspid heart valve repair system presented at EuroPCR
– Data suggest the first-of-its-kind device reduces difficult-to-treat tricuspid regurgitation at 30 days
– Study builds upon Abbott’s success with its proven MitraClip™ clip-based technology in treating a similar disease on the left side of the heart
PARIS, May 21, 2019 /Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced positive late-breaking data from its TRILUMINATE study of the company’s minimally invasive tricuspid valve repair system. Results at 30 days demonstrated that the investigational device is associated with a reduction of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) symptoms – caused by a leaky tricuspid heart valve – suggesting a possible treatment option for people suffering from this difficult-to-manage structural heart disease. Abbott’s transcatheter tricuspid valve repair (TTVR) system builds on the continued advances of the company’s proven clip-based MitraClip technology, which treats people with leaky mitral valves.
Results from the TRILUMINATE study were presented in a late-breaking trial session at EuroPCR, the annual meeting of the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI).
“Treating a leaky tricuspid heart valve has long presented a significant challenge for cardiologists because it is an extremely complex and difficult heart valve to treat,” said Georg Nickenig, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chief, Department of Cardiology, University Hospital, Bonn, Germany, and lead investigator of the study. “These data are extremely encouraging, and I am excited about the potential of transcatheter tricuspid valve repair as a minimally invasive treatment option for these very ill patients who have no other options.”
Tricuspid regurgitation is a condition in which the valve between the two chambers on the right side of the heart does not close properly, resulting in a backward flow of blood into the right chamber of the heart, which can ultimately result in heart failure and death if left untreated.i.ii.iii Approximately one in 30 people over the age of 65 in the U.S. alone have moderate or severe TR.iv Surgery is the only definitive treatment but is rarely performed due to the high mortality and morbidity rates associated with the procedure. Currently, there are no approved non-surgical, minimally invasive treatments for people with moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation.
TRILUMINATE is a prospective, single arm, multi-center study at 21 sites in Europe and the United States evaluating the safety and performance of the tricuspid valve repair system in 85 patients with symptomatic moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation who were determined to be good candidates for percutaneous transcatheter intervention. Results show that at 30 days:

86.6% of patients saw a reduction in TR severity of at least one grade (p < 0.0001).
A significantly greater proportion of patients were categorized as NYHA class I or II (80.5% at 30 days, compared to 25.6% at baseline), an improvement that was statistically significant. Doctors use the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system (I-IV) to classify heart failure according to the severity of a person’s symptoms with class I causing little to no physical limitations and discomfort.
Patients also experienced a mean improvement in KCCQ score – a self-assessment of social abilities, symptoms, and quality-of-life – from 53.05 at baseline to 67.25 at 30 days, which was an increase of 14.20 points (a five-point increase is considered clinically significant).
Clinical follow-up will continue through six months and one, two and three years.
“Abbott’s experience in developing minimally invasive technologies to help people with heart valve diseases avoid surgery is unparalleled,” said Michael Dale, vice president of Abbott’s structural heart business. “These data show that our clip-based approach – for the first time ever – may offer a proven treatment for an extremely difficult-to-treat disease that is associated with high mortality.”
Abbott‘s transcatheter tricuspid valve repair system is an investigational device only.

14759,Medtronic Reports Results of Symplicity Renal Denervation System in Two Studies for Hypertensive Heart Diseases,Results Announced from Two Renal Denervation Studies at EuroPCR Show Positive Outcomes in High-Risk Hypertensive Patients,"The two studies include investigator-led study & Global SYMPLICITY Registry results involves the assessing of Symplicity renal denervation system vs sham in 80 & 2,600 patients with uncontrolled hypertension
 Collective results: atrial fibrillation (AF) occurrence (19% vs 47%); reductions in both office and ambulatory blood pressure (16.5 mm Hg OSBP and 8.9 mm Hg 24H systolic ABPM), sustained reduction in BP in diabetes, ISH, CKD; safe & effective, presented at EuroPCR, 2019
 Medtronic’s Symplicity is also evaluated 70-patient SYMPLICITY AF study assessing renal denervation system in patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation and is approved in 50+ countries","Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Results and Updated Global SYMPLICITY Registry Data Demonstrate Long-Term Results of RDN for Uncontrolled Hypertension

DUBLIN and PARIS – May 22, 2019 – Investigators today unveiled late-breaking clinical data from a first-of-its-kind physician sponsored clinical trial. The data indicate that renal denervation (RDN) with the Medtronic Symplicity(TM) renal denervation system was associated with reduced occurrence of subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) in a small subset of high-risk patients with hypertensive heart disease over a median follow-up period of more than two years. Results from the single-center, randomized, sham-controlled study were presented today during a Late-Breaking Clinical Trial session at the 2019 EuroPCR Annual Meeting in Paris.
The investigator-led study funded by Medtronic randomized 80 patients to either the renal denervation procedure with the Symplicity renal denervation system or a fake “sham” procedure. Renal denervation is a minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure intended to deliver energy to overactive nerves in the kidney, decreasing their activity which is thought to be a cause of both hypertension and arrhythmias. AF occurrence was monitored by Medtronic implantable diagnostic technology. The results from the study demonstrate subclinical AF developed at a lower rate in the group of patients who received RDN than those receiving the sham procedure (19 percent versus 47 percent).
“In this high-risk cohort of patients with hypertensive heart disease, who are at risk for atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular death, this study suggests there may be an important benefit provided by renal denervation,” said Marshall J Heradien, M.D., cardiologist and specialist physician at Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa, and principal investigator in the study. “Consistent with previous studies, these data show that the RDN procedure offers a lasting, positive effect that may translate into improved clinical outcomes.”
New Data from the Global SYMPLICITY Registry
Investigators also reported new, three-year data from the Global SYMPLICITY Registry (GSR), which is the largest registry documenting the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Medtronic renal denervation systems in a real-world setting in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. To date, the registry has enrolled more than 2,600 patients treated with RDN and includes three-year follow-up for more than 2,300 patients.
The latest outcomes from the Registry presented at EuroPCR showed renal denervation led to significant and clinically meaningful reductions in both office and ambulatory blood pressure that were sustained out to three years post-procedure (16.5 mm Hg OSBP and 8.9 mm Hg 24H systolic ABPM). The Registry findings showed blood pressure reductions were consistent and sustained across various high-risk patient subgroups, including those with diabetes, isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), chronic kidney disease (CKD), resistant hypertension and those aged 65 years and older.
“As demonstrated by these studies presented at EuroPCR, new data continue to demonstrate that renal denervation is a safe and useful complement to manage uncontrolled hypertension, with patients experiencing meaningful blood pressure reductions out to several years and in the setting of daily clinical practice,” said Dave Moeller, vice president and general manager of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “Results from these studies will add to the robust growing body of evidence supporting renal denervation and may be important for consideration with patients suffering from uncontrolled hypertension.”
Hypertension is the single largest contributor to cardiovascular death; it dramatically increases risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure. The annual direct costs of hypertension are estimated at $500 billion worldwide. It is estimated that almost 20 percent of patients are completely non-adherent to oral medications while nearly half are partially non-adherent, highlighting the need for alternative treatment options.
In addition to the Global SPYMPLICITY Registry, the Medtronic SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Program includes the SPYRAL HTN PIVOTAL and SPYRAL HTN-ON MED Trials, both prospectively powered, randomized, sham-controlled studies evaluating patients with uncontrolled blood pressure in the absence and presence of prescribed anti-hypertensive medications respectively. Medtronic is also conducting a 70-patient SYMPLICITY AF study, evaluating renal denervation in patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation. Approved for commercial use in more than 50 countries around the world, the Symplicity Spyral(TM) system is limited to investigational use in the United States, Japan, and Canada.

Osaka, Japan, May 22, 2019 — Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) (TSE: 4502/NYSE: TAK) today announced that it has obtained approval from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for an additional indication for Entyvio® (generic name: vedolizumab, development code: MLN0002) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) in Japan. Entyvio was also approved in Japan in July 2018 for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis with the medicine launched in November 2018.
The application filing submitted to the MHLW in July 2018 included data from Study CCT-001, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab induction and maintenance treatment involving 157 Japanese patients with moderately to severely active CD, in addition to data from the global GEMINI 2 and 3 trials involving 1,115 and 416 patients respectively.1,2,3
Dr. Takanori Kanai, Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Keio University said, “Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease along with ulcerative colitis. The number of patients with Crohn’s disease in Japan is rapidly increasing, and many patients experience difficulties in their daily lives from this chronic disease. Entyvio is a biologic medicine with a new mechanism of action that regulates the immune response selectively in the gut and was approved last year in Japan as a new treatment option for ulcerative colitis. This approval means there is now another option that can help contribute to the solution of unmet needs in the treatment of Crohn’s disease.”
Naoyoshi Hirota, Director of the Japan Development Center, said, “Entyvio has been approved in more than 60 countries worldwide and has been contributing to the induction and maintenance of clinical remission of patients with ulcerative colitis since last year in Japan. I am proud that we can now offer Entyvio as a treatment option for patients with Crohn’s disease in Japan. The addition of this indication is an important milestone for Takeda. We will continue our efforts to improve the lives of patients through innovative medicines.”
About Crohn’s Disease
It is estimated that there are currently over 40,000 patients suffering from Crohn’s disease (CD) in Japan.4CD is one of the most common inflammatory bowel diseases and is characterized by chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammation that may have skip lesions mainly in the small and large intestine.5,6 Common symptoms are diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, and malnutrition.6 Although the exact cause of CD remains unclear, recent research suggests that several factors may play a part, including genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and abnormal immune response to intestinal bacterial antigens.7,8,9
About the CCT-001 Trial
CCT-001 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial investigating the efficacy of vedolizumab induction and maintenance treatment involving 157 Japanese patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD).1
In the induction phase, which included a verification analysis, the double-blind method was used to randomly assign patients to a group receiving vedolizumab 300 mg at week 0, 2, and 6 or placebo. Patients who showed improvement (CDAI-70 improvement: CDAI score decreased by 70 points or more from baseline) following administration of vedolizumab at the week 10 evaluation of efficacy were included in the maintenance period at Week 14 and were randomly assigned to receive either vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo every 8 weeks until Week 54. The maintenance phase was not designed to examine statistical validity of efficacy, but to determine whether the results were similar to those obtained in previous studies conducted worldwide.
The vedolizumab group exceeded the placebo group (26.6% vs. 16.7%) in terms of the percentage of CDAI-100 improvement (≥100-point decrease in the CDAI score), which was a primary endpoint of the induction period, however the difference was not statistically significant [p = 0.1448; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.80; 95% CI, 0.816-3.958]. The proportion of patients in remission at Week 60 (CDAI score less than 150 points), which was a primary endpoint, were 41.7% in the vedolizumab group and 16.7% in the placebo group. Primary and secondary endpoint results in the induction and maintenance period showed broadly the same trends as seen in the GEMINI II and III trials.2,3 In addition, adverse events were generally mild to moderate, and there were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups regarding safety.10
About the GEMINI Studies
The safety and efficacy of vedolizumab is supported by the results of the GEMINI clinical trial program. These phase 3 studies involved 2,400 individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD) who were recruited from nearly 40 countries.11,12,13
The GEMINI program consists of four studies – a placebo-controlled study of vedolizumab induction and maintenance treatment in patients with moderately to severely active UC (GEMINI 1), a placebo-controlled study of vedolizumab induction and maintenance treatment in patients with moderately to severely active CD (GEMINI 2), a placebo-controlled study of vedolizumab induction in patients with moderately to severely active CD (GEMINI 3) and an open-label long-term safety study of vedolizumab in patients with either CD or UC (GEMINI long-term safety).11,12,13,14
About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation.15 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).16 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.17 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.16 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).16,18,19 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.16
Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist.15 Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 260,000 patient years of exposure to date.20

 Transaction allows Santhera to advance its long-term growth strategy by focusing on the
development of its clinical-stage neuromuscular and pulmonary programs
 Deal includes upfront cash payment of CHF 50 million (EUR 44 million) which is due after closing
of the transaction
Pratteln, Switzerland, May 23, 2019 – Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) announces that it has
entered into an exclusive license agreement with Chiesi Farmaceutici, an international research-focused healthcare group (Chiesi Group), under which Chiesi Group will in-license Raxone® for the
treatment of LHON for a total consideration of up to CHF 105 million (EUR 93 million), comprising an
upfront cash payment of CHF 50 million (EUR 44 million) and near- to mid-term sales milestone
payments of up to CHF 55 million (EUR 49 million).
Chiesi Group is in-licensing the rights to Raxone in LHON and all other ophthalmological indications
worldwide except the US and Canada, where Santhera retains rights. In a second step, following the
completion of certain reimbursement and post-regulatory commitments on the part of Santhera, Chiesi
Group has the option to fully acquire Santhera’s Raxone business. The transaction enables Santhera to
focus on the business areas core to its long-term growth strategy by advancing its clinical-stage
neuromuscular and pulmonary programs.
“Since the approval in 2015 we have successfully launched Raxone in Europe and reported strong yearon-year sales increases. In the past eighteen months we also strategically diversified our pipeline. This
license agreement for Raxone in LHON, our sole neuro-ophthalmology asset, will allow us to create
significant value for our shareholders as it provides financial resources enabling us to focus on delivering
innovation to patients with neuromuscular and pulmonary diseases of great unmet medical need,” said

“Chiesi Group has a strong commitment in the orphan diseases area, bringing innovative treatments
forward to patients affected by rare or ultra-rare disorders and improving the quality of life of people
with rare diseases is one of the most important goals. This strategic partnership reinforces this
commitment with a therapeutic offer for patients affected by LHON, a neurodegenerative disease
targeting the optic nerve and characterized by sudden vision loss”, commented Ugo Di Francesco, Chief
Executive Officer, Chiesi Group.
Santhera will license and transfer to Chiesi Group all of its rights for the development, commercialization
and distribution of Raxone for the treatment of LHON and any other potential ophthalmological
indications for all territories worldwide except the US and Canada.
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary approvals and is currently expected to occur in the
third quarter 2019. As of that date, the advance payment of CHF 50 million (EUR 44 million) will also
become due.
In an interim phase Santhera will continue to provide medical, technical, logistical and scientific support
with regard to ongoing market authorization activities and/or market access undertakings for several
months. In this context, the parties agreed that Santhera will continue to commercialize Raxone for LHON

About Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and the Therapeutic Use of Raxone
Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a heritable genetic disease causing profound vision loss
and blindness. The disease presents predominantly in young, otherwise healthy adult males as rapid,
painless loss of central vision, usually leading to permanent bilateral blindness within a few months of
the onset of symptoms. About 95% of patients harbor one of three pathogenic mutations of the
mitochondrial DNA, which cause a defect in the complex I subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
This defect leads to decreased cellular energy (ATP) production, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production and retinal ganglion cell dysfunction, which cause progressive loss of visual acuity and
blindness.
Raxone (idebenone), a synthetic short-chain benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), circumvents the complex I defect, reduces and scavenges
ROS, restores cellular energy levels in retinal ganglion cells and promotes recovery of visual acuity.
Current data demonstrate that up to 50% of patients benefit from treatment and are protected from
progression of visual acuity loss or experience a clinically relevant recovery of visual acuity.
Raxone for the treatment of LHON was granted orphan drug status in the EU, US, Switzerland and South
Korea.

SAN DIEGO and PENNINGTON, N.J., May 22, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — OncoSec Medical Incorporated (OncoSec) (NASDAQ:ONCS), a late-stage cancer biotechnology company developing gene-based intratumoral immunotherapies, today announces interim data from KEYNOTE-890, an ongoing Phase 2 study of TAVO™ (intratumoral IL-12) in combination with KEYTRUDA® in patients with heavily pretreated, metastatic, chemotherapy refractory triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Patients who previously failed an average of 3.5 prior lines of chemotherapy were enrolled in KEYNOTE-890 to evaluate if the addition of TAVO (IL-12) could provide meaningful clinical activity when combined with KEYTRUDA, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.
Heavily pretreated patients with refractory mTNBC (average of 3.5 prior lines of chemotherapy) showed a rapid tumor reduction of 20% or greater at the initial 3-month evaluation in the first five of 10 patients. Two patients had a partial response, one with a 66% tumor reduction, including a significant reduction of liver lesions, and four patients had stable disease, three of which reported a 20% or greater tumor reduction. These preliminary findings, when compared to the results of KEYNOTE-086, which demonstrated a 5.3% response rate in mTNBC patients treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy1, suggest TAVO’s ability to unlock KEYTRUDA’s potential anti-cancer efficacy in this very difficult to treat patient population. Four of the six patients who experienced tumor reductions have an ongoing response as of May 9, 2019.
“These interim data are impressive, especially when considering that all of the patients received numerous prior rounds of chemo/radiation with no success, and the safety profile associated with this platform continues to be unparalleled. Metastatic TNBC is a heterogeneous cancer with a poor prognosis where less than five percent of pre-treated patients achieve an objective response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint treatments,” explained Alain Algazi, M.D., Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at UCSF and Clinical Strategic Advisor to OncoSec. “Therefore, the marked synergy shown in these patients adds even more support for our earlier findings demonstrating that TAVO primes the tumor microenvironment, dramatically improving the clinical results that would have been anticipated with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint treatment alone. The combination of TAVO and KEYTRUDA represents a highly promising new therapeutic approach for TNBC and warrants expedited evaluation.”
Of the four patients who progressed following treatment, two received only one cycle of combination treatment prior to rapid clinical deterioration. Importantly, treatment was very well-tolerated, with only three patients reporting Grade 1 TAVO-related adverse events (AE’s). No TAVO-related Grade 2 or above AE’s/SAE’s were reported.
Patients demonstrated encouraging immunological responses in tumor and blood consistent with an IL-12-associated mechanism of action, including on-treatment reduction of the peripheral gMDSC suppressors, which aligns with observed clinical responses. Biomarker analysis of patient tumor and blood samples are ongoing.
The Company has enrolled over half of the targeted enrollment of 25 patients, and expects to complete enrollment and present the clinical data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium later this year.

About Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
TNBC is an aggressive type of breast cancer that characteristically has a high recurrence rate within the first five years after diagnosis. While some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), TNBC tests negative for all three. As a result, TNBC does not respond to therapies targeting these markers, making it more difficult to treat. Approximately 10-20% of patients with breast cancer are diagnosed with TNBC.
About KEYNOTE-890
KEYNOTE-890 is designed as a multicenter Phase 2 open-label trial focusing on patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and at least 1 prior line of approved systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 25 patients are expected to be enrolled. Each patient will undergo 3-week treatment cycles with pembrolizumab administered as a 30-minute IV infusion day 1 of every cycle (flat dose of 200 mg) and treated with TAVO on days 1, 5 and 8 every six weeks.
OncoSec Medical Incorporated
OncoSec is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing cytokine-based intratumoral immunotherapies to stimulate the body’s immune system to target and attack cancer. OncoSec’s lead immunotherapy platform – TAVO™ (tavokinogene telseplasmid) – enables the intratumoral delivery of DNA-based interleukin-12 (IL-12), a naturally occurring protein with immune-stimulating functions. The technology, which employs electroporation, is designed to produce a controlled, localized expression of IL-12 in the tumor microenvironment, enabling the immune system to target and attack tumors throughout the body. OncoSec has built a deep and diverse clinical pipeline utilizing TAVO™ as a potential treatment for multiple cancer indications either as a monotherapy or in combination with leading checkpoint inhibitors; with the latter potentially enabling OncoSec to address a great unmet medical need in oncology: anti-PD-1 non-responders. Results from recently completed clinical studies of TAVO™ have demonstrated a local immune response, and subsequently, a systemic effect as either a monotherapy or combination treatment approach. In addition to TAVO™, OncoSec is identifying and developing new DNA-encoded therapeutic candidates and tumor indications for use with its new Visceral Lesion Applicator (VLA), to target deep visceral lesions, such as liver, lung or pancreatic lesions.

 Synlogic plans to file an IND for SYNB1891 to the US FDA in H2’19 for the onset of P-I clinical studies evaluating SYNB1891 as monothx. and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab)
 SYNB1891 (administered intratumorally) is a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli, engineered to express a STING agonist & stimulating the innate immune system. Synlogic also developing it as a Synthetic Biotic therapy designed to act locally & providing a systemic effect in patients","CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–May 22, 2019– Synlogic, Inc., (Nasdaq: SYBX) a clinical stage company applying synthetic biology to beneficial microbes to develop novel, living medicines, today announced a new clinical collaboration with Roche (SIX:RO, ROG), to explore Synlogic’s Synthetic Biotic™ medicine, SYNB1891, a dual innate immune activator engineered to express a STING agonist, in combination with Roche’s PD-L1-blocking checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Synlogic expects to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2019 for SYNB1891 to enable the company to begin an open-label Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the candidate as a monotherapy and a combination treatment with atezolizumab.
“This collaboration is an important step in advancing SYNB1891 as a potential treatment for difficult to treat cancers as it provides us with access to an important checkpoint inhibitor, atezolizumab, while allowing us to maintain ownership of our novel development candidate,” said Aoife Brennan, M.B. Ch.B., Synlogic’s president and chief executive officer. “We believe that SYNB1891 has potential to offer a new and meaningful approach in the fight against cancer when used in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, by potentially enhancing their potency and effectiveness.”
Tumors have developed mechanisms to subvert natural processes to suppress and evade immune control. While the use of CPIs has greatly improved outcomes for patients with certain types of cancers, a percentage of patients still do not respond to these therapies. Engagement of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system has been shown to be critical in generating an efficacious antitumor immune response.
SYNB1891 is a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli that has been engineered to express a STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) agonist and stimulate the innate immune system. When the bacteria are engulfed by antigen presenting cells within the tumor, the STING pathway is activated within the cell resulting in a type I interferon (IFN) response and the initiation and propagation of tumor-specific T-cell responses. In addition, the bacterial chassis used in Synlogic’s Synthetic Biotic approach is believed to stimulate the innate immune system by several other mechanisms, including via Toll-like receptors, potentially adding to the magnitude of the overall immune response. In combination with atezolizumab, SYNB1891 has the potential to elicit both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system to drive tumor reduction.
With an active IND, Synlogic plans to initiate an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB1891 administered by intra-tumoral (i.t.) injection to patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SYNB1891 to determine the single-agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as monotherapy and the recommended Phase 2 dose in combination with atezolizumab. In addition, the study will explore immune biomarkers, objective response rates (ORR), and time to progression for evaluated tumors. Synlogic will be the sponsor of the study and Roche will provide clinical supply of atezolizumab.

14807,ï»¿Boston Scientific Initiates OPTION Study of Watchman FLX Device for Stroke Risk Reduction Post-AF Ablation,Boston Scientific Initiates Trial Comparing Left Atrial Appendage Closure to Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Stroke Risk Reduction Post-AFib Ablation,"The OPTION study involves assessing of Watchman FLX left atrial appendage closure vs oral anticoagulants (OAC) including direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) & warfarin in 1,600 patients with non-valvular AF who undergo a cardiac ablation across 130 sites globally
 The OPTION study will have its 1EPs as all cause death, stroke and systemic embolism with primary safety endpoint as non-procedural bleeding @ 36mos.
 The WATCHMAN FLX is a device, designed for simplified implantation, enhancing sealing within the left atrial appendage, and offer physicians to recapture and reposition the device during the procedure and has received CE Mark in Mar’19","Findings could expand number of patients who can receive alternative treatment to life-long use of blood thinners
May 22, 2019 /- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) has initiated the OPTION trial to compare safety and effectiveness of the next-generation WATCHMAN FLX™ left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) platform to first-line oral anticoagulants (OAC) – including direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and warfarin – for stroke risk reduction in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who undergo a cardiac ablation procedure.
Approximately 33 million patients worldwide have AF, a common heart rhythm disorder.1 In recent years, the number of U.S. patients who have undergone an in-hospital cardiac ablation procedure to prevent abnormal electrical signals from moving through the heart has grown tenfold.2 More than 50% of those patients become asymptomatic, making them less likely to adhere to current guidelines recommending the continuation of OAC post-procedure to reduce the risk of stroke.3,4 Stroke is five times more likely to occur in patients with AF than in someone with a normal heart rhythm.5
“Cardiac ablation is an effective way to treat an abnormal heart rhythm for many patients, though symptomatic relief can lead these patients to stop taking their blood thinners and unknowingly put themselves at an elevated risk for a stroke,” said Dr. Oussama Wazni, co-director of the Ventricular Arrhythmia Center, Center for Atrial Fibrillation and the Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Prevention Center at Cleveland Clinic and the principal investigator for the OPTION trial. “This first-of-its-kind trial will explore whether the one-time WATCHMAN FLX device could replace commonly used anticoagulants for long-term stroke risk reduction in this growing patient population.”
The randomized, controlled OPTION trial will enroll 1,600 patients with non-valvular AF who are suitable for OAC therapy and have recently had or will have an ablation. Patients at as many as 130 global sites will be randomized to receive the newest-generation WATCHMAN FLX device or an OAC, inclusive of commonly prescribed DOACs or warfarin. The primary effectiveness endpoint is all cause death, stroke and systemic embolism through 36 months, and the primary safety endpoint is non-procedural bleeding through 36 months.
“Beyond advancing the robust clinical literature supporting the WATCHMAN therapy, findings from the OPTION trial have the potential to expand the number of patients with atrial fibrillation who can receive an alternative to life-long anticoagulants and thus avoid their potential side effects,” said Dr. Ian Meredith, AM, executive vice president and global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific. “The unique study design encompasses patients who will receive a WATCHMAN FLX device either after or concurrent to an ablation procedure.”
The WATCHMAN device has been implanted in more than 80,000 patients worldwide and the latest-generation WATCHMAN FLX device received CE Mark in March 2019.
In the U.S., the WATCHMAN FLX device is an investigational device and not available for sale.

14817,ï»¿GSK's Shingrix Receives NMPA's Approval for the Prevention of Shingles in China,GSK announces approval of Shingrix in China for prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 and over,"The approval follows P-III ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 studies assessing Shingrix in 38,000 patients with shingles (herpes zoster) aged ≥ 50yrs.
 The P-III ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 studies demonstrated efficacy >90% in all age group and showed sustained efficacy over a follow period of 4yrs.
 Shingrix (IM) is a herpes zoster vaccine, administered in two doses and is a combination of an antigen, glycoprotein E, an adjuvant system, AS01B, currently available in the US, EU, Canada, Japan and Australia","GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved Shingrix for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster) in adults aged 50 years or older. Shingrix is a recombinant subunit adjuvanted vaccine given intramuscularly in two doses.
The approval is in response to last year’s inclusion of Shingrix on a list of 48 ‘clinically urgently needed new medicines’ in China designated for expedited review, reflecting the country’s prioritization of critical new prevention and treatment options.
Shingles is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Nearly all adults over 50 have the shingles virus dormant in their nervous system, waiting to reactivate with advancing age[i]. Shingles affects nearly three million adults in China annually[ii].
Dr. Thomas Breuer, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of GSK Vaccines said: “Today’s approval of Shingrix in China is recognition of the significant scientific advance this vaccine represents. In the pivotal studies the vaccine has shown over 90% efficacy across all age groups in the prevention of shingles, a disease that affects one in three people across the Asia-Pacific region[iii]. It can result in lasting pain and other complications which can severely impact the quality of people’s lives.”
“We welcome the Chinese government’s progress to enable faster entry of new products into China and we look forward to working with the relevant agencies to bring the benefits of this vaccine to local communities,” he said.
Introduction of the vaccine into China will be phased, starting in 2020, to ensure consistent and reliable supply of the vaccine to all countries in which the vaccine has been launched. Over the next several years, GSK expects to increase supply of Shingrix globally and is investing in significant capacity expansion.
Shingrix is currently licensed for use in the EU, US, Canada, Japan and Australia.
Approval of Shingrix follows a comprehensive Phase III clinical trial program evaluating its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in more than 38,000 people. In a pooled analysis of the pivotal efficacy studies, ZOE-50 and ZOE-70, Shingrix demonstrated efficacy against shingles greater than 90% across all age groups studied, as well as sustained efficacy over a follow-up period of 4 years[iv,v]. The most common local side effects reported in the clinical trials were pain, redness and swelling at the injection site. The majority were mild to moderate in intensity and transient, generally lasting less than three days [vi,vii].
About Shingles
Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Nearly all older adults have the VZV dormant in their nervous system, and it could reactivate with advancing age[viii]. As people age, the cells in the immune system lose the ability to maintain a strong and effective response to VZV reactivation[ix].
Shingles typically presents as a painful, itchy rash that develops on one side of the body and can last for two to four weeks. The pain associated with shingles is often described as burning, shooting or stabbing[x]. Even once the rash is gone, a person can experience post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), pain lasting from at least three months up to several years. PHN is the most common complication of shingles, occurring in up to 30 percent of all shingles cases[xi].
Older adults and those with conditions that compromise the immune system have the greatest risk for developing shingles. More than 99 percent of those over 50 years old are infected with VZV and, it is estimated that around one in three people will develop shingles in their lifetime[xii].
About Shingrix
Shingrix [Herpes Zoster vaccine (recombinant, AS01B[xiii]i adjuvanted)] is a non-live, recombinant subunit vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster) in adults 50 years of age and older. The vaccine combines an antigen, glycoprotein E, and an adjuvant system, AS01B, intended to generate a strong and long-lasting immune response that can help overcome the decline in immunity that occurs as people age[xiv].
Shingrix is to be given intramuscularly in two doses.
Important Safety Information for Shingrix
You should not receive Shingrix if you are allergic to any of its ingredients or had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of Shingrix.
The most common side effects are pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, muscle pain, tiredness, headache, shivering, fever, and upset stomach.
Vaccination with Shingrix may not protect all individuals.
Ask your healthcare professional about the risks and benefits of Shingrix. Only a healthcare professional can decide if Shingrix is right for you.
Shingrix is not indicated for the prevention of chickenpox.
GSK – one of the world’s leading research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies – is committed to improving the quality of human life by enabling people to do more, feel better and live longer. For further information please visit www.gsk.com/about-us/.

– Expanding biosimilar market by establishing stronghold in Brazil for further influence in Central-South American markets

INCHEON, South Korea – Celltrion announced the approval of Herzuma (project name: CT-P6, trastuzumab-pkrb), a mAb biosimilar for breast and gastric cancer, from the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, ANVISA (Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria) on May 20, 2019. The ANVISA has approved the use of 150mg and 440 mg of Herzuma for all indicated cases including early-stage breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer.
Herzuma’s reference biologic is ‘Herceptin’ developed by Genetech and commercialized by Roche, which makes up a KRW 300 billion market in Central and South Americas. Celltrion will schedule the launch of Herzuma with Celltrion Healthcare in consideration of global business circumstances.
Celltrion plans to make inroads into Brazil, which constitutes more than a half of KRW 520 billion Herceptin market in Central-South Americas and expand its presence in other nations in the region.
Celltrion’s advancement in Central-South Americas is expected to gain more momentum when the ANVISA finalize the approval of Truxima, another Celltrion biosimilar to Rituximab, a hematologic malignancy treatment which currently forms a KRW 250 billion market in the region. Celltrion believes that Truxima will effectively supplement Remsima and Herzuma in helping the firm secure a leading market position in the Central-South American biosimilar market.
The Brazilian government’s heath care system is burdened with the costs of importing 80% of the nation’s pharmaceuticals and spending 32% of its entire pharmaceutical budget on antibody pharmaceuticals. Brazil presents biosimilars with favorable opportunities because 80% of the pharmaceuticals are sourced through tenders by the federal and the local governments.
A Celltrion representative has said, “In Brazil, there is also a demand to substitute expensive original pharmaceuticals with biosimilar drugs with proven safety and efficacy to reduce health care costs just as in the Europe and other nations with well-developed health care systems. We will do our best to introduce Herzuma in Brazil and other Latin American markets as quickly as we can to replicate its fast success in the Europe.”",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/celltrion-1.jpg,Biosimilars|Regulatory,Celltrion,Herzuma | Trastuzumab,Breast and Gastric Cancer|Biosimilars|Regulatory|Anvisa|approval|Brazil|receives,publish,24/5/2019,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/celltrion-announces-approval-of-herzuma-trastuzumab-pkrb-in-brazil/,https://pharmashots.com/14825/%ef%bb%bfcelltrions-herzuma-trastuzumab-biosimilar-receives-anvisas-approval-for-breast-and-gastric-cancer-in-brazil/

 The study results demonstrated that Aptima Combo 2 Assay and the Xpert CT/NG for extragenital specimens are safe and effective for extragenital testing in chlamydia and gonorrhea via throat and rectum
 The Aptima Combo 2 Assay & Xpert CT/NG is a nucleic acid probe test & in vitro real-time PCR test used for qualitative detection and differentiation of rRNA & genomic DNA to diagnose CT & GC using Tigris DTS System/Panther system & GeneXpert Instrument Systems respectively","Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared for marketing two tests that can detect the presence of the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which cause the sexually-transmitted infections, respectively, chlamydia and gonorrhea, through diagnostic testing of extragenital specimens. The Aptima Combo 2 Assay and the Xpert CT/NG are the first devices cleared for extragenital diagnostic testing of these infections via the throat and rectum. These tests were previously only cleared for testing urine, vaginal and endocervical samples.
“Prior to today, there were no chlamydia or gonorrhea tests cleared for use on samples from the throat and rectum. The availability of these two tests will fill an unmet public health need, by allowing for more screening,” said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “It is best for patients if both of these sexually transmitted infections are caught and treated right away, as significant complications can occur if left untreated. Today’s clearances provide a mechanism for more easily diagnosing these infections.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance Report, the rate of sexually transmitted infections is steadily increasing, with an estimated 1.7 million cases of chlamydia and more than 500,000 cases of gonorrhea in the U.S. in 2017 alone. Both infections can be contracted through vaginal, anal or oral intercourse. Typically, both infections can be easily treated, but if left untreated, both infections can cause serious complications for patients, including infertility.
The Aptima Combo 2 Assay and Xpert CT/NG were reviewed through the premarket notification (510(k)) pathway. A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device.
In its evaluation of the devices, the FDA reviewed clinical data collected through a cross-sectional study coordinated by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group, which is funded and supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The study was a collaborative, multi-site clinical study of more than 2,500 patients that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of multiple commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests for detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis from throat and rectal sites. The results of this study, along with other information reviewed by the FDA, demonstrated that the Aptima Combo 2 Assay and the Xpert CT/NG for extragenital specimens are safe and effective for extragenital testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The FDA granted clearance of Aptima Combo 2 Assay to Hologic, Inc.
The FDA granted clearance of the Xpert CT/NG to Cepheid.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

 The addition of Cobas TV/MG test expands the testing menu on the Cobas 6800/8800 Systems and has been validated to use with multiple specimens including male/female urine, endocervical swabs and vaginal swabs
 The combination of Cobas TV/MG with Cobas Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)/ Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) based on PCR technology, used for the detection of CT & NG, providing high throughput solutions supporting the molecular testing needs","PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23, 2019– Roche (SIX: RO, ROG;OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the cobas® TV/MG test for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems for the detection of Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and/or Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) DNA in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Laboratories can now simultaneously process from a single patient sample a combination of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), which provides clinicians the information they need to screen and diagnose sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and improve patient care.
The addition of the cobas TV/MG test continues the expansion of the testing menu on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems, supporting true consolidation and testing efficiencies. The cobas TV/MG test has been validated for use with broad specimen types, including sample types comparable to those available for use with the cobas® CT/NG test: male/female urine; endocervical swabs and vaginal swabs (both clinician collected and patient collected in a clinical setting).1,2
“The launch of cobas TV/MG continues our expansion of our STI menu, giving healthcare providers and their patients greater access to more information from a single sample,” said Mario Torres, Head of Roche Molecular Diagnostics. “By coupling cobas TV/MG with the recently launched cobas CT/NG for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), laboratories have a highly flexible, moderate complexity, high throughput automated solution to support their testing needs.”
“The addition of Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) detection to the cobas 6800/8800 Systems is an important step forward in the ability to diagnose sexually transmitted infections,” said Barbara Van Der Pol, Associate Professor of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham. “These new analytes, in conjunction with the approved Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) molecular diagnostic assays, will support a more thorough assessment of the potential pathogens responsible for discharge-causing STI. As a result, clinicians can more easily identify co-infections and utilize appropriate treatment strategies earlier in the patient management process.”
The fully automated cobas 6800/8800 Systems offer the fastest time to results with the highest throughput and the longest walk-away time available among automated molecular platforms, providing laboratories with improved operating efficiency and the flexibility to adapt to changing testing demands.
About Trichomonas vaginalis 
Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world. About 70% of people infected with TV do not have any symptoms. Those with symptoms may experience itching, burning or irritation of the genital area, discharge of the penis for males and a change to vaginal discharge with an unusual fishy smell for females. Left untreated, TV can increase the risk of spreading or contracting other STIs such as HIV. Pregnant women with TV may experience complications such as preterm delivery and low infant birth weight.3
About Mycoplasma genitalium 
Mycoplasma genitalium is a fastidious bacterium first isolated in 1980 from the urethral swabs of two symptomatic men with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU).4 Mycoplasma genitalium infections are often asymptomatic. However, infections caused by this bacterium have been associated with male and female urethritis, balanoposthitis, prostatitis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease and male and female infertility.5 Additional complications, such as preterm delivery and extra-genital infections, have been reported. Prevalence has shown to be as high as ~40% when testing using various molecular assays in select patient populations.6,7

14872,ï»¿Novartis' Piqray (alpelisib) + Fulvestrant Receive FDA's Approval for Patients with a PIK3CA Mutation in HR+/HER2- Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer,FDA approves Novartis Piqray® – the first and only treatment specifically for patients with a PIK3CA mutation in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer,"The approval is based on P-III SOLAR-1 study result assessing Piqray (alpelisib) + Fulvestrant vs Fulvestrant in 572 postmenopausal women/men in ratio (1:1) with PIK3CA-mutated HR+/HER2- advanced/m-breast cancer, following aromatase inhibitor prior treated with/without CDK4/6 inhibitor
 The P-III SOLAR-1 study result: mPFS (11.0 mos. vs 5.7mos.); ORR (35.7% vs 16.2%). Piqray & its associated companion diagnostic test from QIAGEN is approved under FDA Oncology Center of Excellence RTOR pilot program
 Piqray (alpelisib) is a PI3K inhibitor, targeting the PI3K pathway thus inhibiting the effect of PIK3CA mutations and has received FDA’s PR designation for the same indication","Piqray (alpelisib, formerly BYL719) plus fulvestrant nearly doubled median PFS (11.0 vs 5.7 months) in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients with a PIK3CA mutation compared to fulvestrant alone in the SOLAR-1 clinical trial[1],[2],[3],[4]
~40% of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients may face worse disease prognosis due to presence of PIK3CA mutations in their tumors[5],[6],[7],[8],[9]
Piqray was the first new drug application approved under the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program
Basel, May 24, 2019 – Novartis today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Piqray® (alpelisib, formerly BYL719) in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-), PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as detected by an FDA-approved test following progression on or after an endocrine-based regimen[1].
PIK3CA is the most commonly mutated gene in HR+/HER2- breast cancer; approximately 40% of patients living with HR+/HER2- breast cancer have this mutation[8],[10]. PIK3CA mutations are associated with tumor growth, resistance to endocrine treatment and a poor overall prognosis[11],[12]. Piqray targets the effect of PIK3CA mutations and may help overcome endocrine resistance in HR+ advanced breast cancer.
“The FDA approval of Piqray, which was discovered at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, marks the first ever treatment specifically for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation. We are proud to offer a new treatment option that specifically addresses the needs of the patients living with this mutation,” said Susanne Schaffert, PhD, CEO, Novartis Oncology. “We are grateful to our researchers’ bold and unrelenting pursuit of a first-in-class treatment for this incurable disease, and to the patients, investigators and administrators who participated in the clinical trials leading to this remarkable milestone.”
FDA approval is based on results of the Phase III trial, SOLAR-1, that showed Piqray plus fulvestrant nearly doubled median progression-free survival (PFS) compared to fulvestrant alone in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients with a PIK3CA mutation (median PFS 11.0 months vs 5.7 months; HR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.85; p<0.001)[2]. Piqray provided consistent PFS results across pre-specified subgroups, including among patients previously treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor[2],[3].
Overall response rate (ORR), an indicator of the proportion of patients who experience at least a 30% reduction in overall tumor size (in patients with measurable disease), was more than doubled when Piqray was added to fulvestrant in patients with a PIK3CA mutation, (ORR= 35.7% vs 16.2% for fulvestrant alone, p=0.0002)[2]. Piqray and its associated companion diagnostic test from QIAGEN N.V. was the first combination product approved under the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program.
“Today’s approval is expected to change the way we practice medicine in advanced breast cancer. For the first time, physicians can test for PIK3CA biomarkers and develop a treatment plan based on the genomic profile of a patient’s cancer,” said Fabrice André, MD, PhD, research director and head of INSERM Unit U981, professor in the Department of Medical Oncology at Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France, and global SOLAR-1 principal investigator. “In the SOLAR-1 Phase III trial, alpelisib plus fulvestrant nearly doubled median PFS and more than doubled overall response rate in patients with a PIK3CA mutation, offering them new hope for longer life without progression.”
Patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer can be selected for treatment with Piqray based on the presence of PIK3CA mutations. Concurrent with the approval of Piqray, the therascreen®* PIK3CA companion diagnostic test from QIAGEN was also approved by the FDA and is now available for patient testing.
“If you are facing a complex disease like metastatic breast cancer, you want to follow a path that is specific to your type of disease,” said Shirley Mertz, President, Metastatic Breast Cancer Network. “Finding the right treatment team and getting the right tests, like testing for the PIK3CA mutation, will help your healthcare team identify accurate, precise treatment options for your disease.”
Novartis is committed to providing patients with access to medicines, as well as resources and support to address a range of needs. The Novartis Oncology Patient Support Program is available to help guide eligible patients through the various aspects of getting started on treatment, from providing educational information to helping them understand their insurance coverage and identify potential financial assistance options. For more information, patients and healthcare professionals can call 1-800-282-7630.

About Piqray® (alpelisib)
Piqray is a kinase inhibitor approved in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with HR+/HER2-, PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as detected by an FDA-approved test following progression on or after endocrine-based regimen[1].
Approximately 40% of HR+ advanced breast cancer patients have a mutation that may activate the PI3K-alpha isoform, called PIK3CA mutations[5],[6],[7],[8]. These mutations are associated with resistance to endocrine therapy, disease progression and a poor prognosis[11],[12]. Piqray works by inhibiting the PI3K pathway, predominantly the PI3K-alpha isoform, to address the effect of PIK3CA mutations.
About SOLAR-1
SOLAR-1 is a global, Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying Piqray in combination with fulvestrant for postmenopausal women, and men, with PIK3CA-mutated HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer that progressed on or following aromatase inhibitor treatment with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor[1],[2],[3]. SOLAR-1 is the pivotal Phase III trial that supported this approval.
The trial randomized 572 patients. Patients were allocated based on central tumor tissue assessment to either a PIK3CA-mutated cohort (n=341) or a PIK3CA non-mutated cohort (n=231). Within each cohort, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive continuous oral treatment with Piqray (300 mg once daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg every 28 days + Cycle 1 Day 15) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Stratification was based on visceral metastases and prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment[1],[2],[3]. Patients and investigators are blinded to PIK3CA mutation status and treatment.
The primary endpoint is local investigator assessed PFS using RECIST 1.1 for patients with a PIK3CA mutation. The key secondary endpoint is overall survival, and additional secondary endpoints include, but are not limited to, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, health-related quality of life, efficacy in PIK3CA non-mutated cohort, safety and tolerability[1],[2],[3]. SOLAR-1 is ongoing to assess overall survival and other secondary endpoints.

Indication
PIQRAY® (alpelisib) tablets is a prescription medicine used in combination with the medicine fulvestrant to treat women who have gone through menopause and men who have hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), with an abnormal phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) gene, and whose disease has progressed on or after endocrine therapy. Your health care provider will test your cancer for an abnormal “PIK3CA” gene to make sure that PIQRAY is right for you. It is not known if PIQRAY is safe and effective in children.
Important Safety Information
Patients should not take PIQRAY if they have had a severe allergic reaction to PIQRAY or are allergic to any of the ingredients in PIQRAY.
PIQRAY may cause serious side effects. PIQRAY can cause severe allergic reactions. Patients should tell their health care provider or get medical help right away if they have trouble breathing, flushing, rash, fever, or fast heart rate during treatment with PIQRAY. PIQRAY can cause severe skin reactions. Patients should tell their health care provider or get medical help right away if they get severe rash or rash that keeps getting worse, reddened skin, flu-like symptoms, blistering of the lips, eyes or mouth, blisters on the skin or skin peeling, with or without fever. PIQRAY can cause high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Hyperglycemia is common with PIQRAY and can be severe. Health care providers will monitor patients’ blood sugar levels before they start and during treatment with PIQRAY. Health care providers may monitor patients’ blood sugar levels more often if they have a history of Type 2 diabetes. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they develop symptoms of hyperglycemia, including excessive thirst, dry mouth, urinate more often than usual or have a higher amount of urine than normal, or increased appetite with weight loss. PIQRAY can cause lung problems (pneumonitis). Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they develop new or worsening symptoms of lung problems, including shortness of breath or trouble breathing, cough, or chest pain. Diarrhea is common with PIQRAY and can be severe. Severe diarrhea can lead to the loss of too much body water (dehydration) and kidney problems. Patients who develop diarrhea during treatment with PIQRAY should tell their health care provider right away.
Before taking PIQRAY, patients should tell their health care provider if they have a history of diabetes, skin rash, redness of skin, blistering of the lips, eyes or mouth, or skin peeling, are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as PIQRAY can harm their unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control during treatment with PIQRAY and for 1 week after the last dose. Do not breastfeed during treatment with PIQRAY and for 1 week after the last dose. Males with female partners who are able to become pregnant should use condoms and effective birth control during treatment with PIQRAY and for 1 week after the last dose. Patients should also read the Full Prescribing Information of fulvestrant for important pregnancy, contraception, infertility, and lactation information.
Patients should tell their health care provider all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. PIQRAY and other medicines may affect each other causing side effects. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your health care provider or pharmacist when you get a new medicine.
The most common side effects of PIQRAY when used with fulvestrant are rash, nausea, tiredness and weakness, decreased appetite, mouth sores, vomiting, weight loss, hair loss, and changes in certain blood tests.

14883,ï»¿Pfizer Reports Results of Lyrica (pregabalin) in P-III Study for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures,PFIZER ANNOUNCES TOP-LINE RESULTS FROM PHASE 3 TRIAL OF LYRICA® (PREGABALIN) IN PRIMARY GENERALIZED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES,"The P-III study involves assessing of Lyrica (pregabalin, bid, 5mg/10mg) vs PBO in 219 patients in a ratio (1:1:1) with PGTC seizures aged 5 to 65 yrs. across 21 countries for 12wks.
 The P-III study results demonstrated that it did not meet its 1EPs i.e, reduction in seizure frequency
 Lyrica (pregabalin) is a chemical analog of Gabapentin and is an approved therapy for multiple indications for both adults & pediatric patients across 130 countries including the US","NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that a Phase 3 study to assess the use of LYRICA® (pregabalin) as adjunctive therapy for epilepsy patients 5 to 65 years of age with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures did not meet its primary endpoint. Treatment with LYRICA did not result in a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency versus placebo. Lyrica is not indicated in any population for the treatment of PGTC seizures. The study was a post-marketing commitment to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“Pfizer is committed to the study of patient populations with unmet treatment needs, including pediatric and adult patients experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures,” said Juan Ovalle, M.D., Global Chief Medical Officer, R&D and Medical, Upjohn, a division of Pfizer. “These data contribute to our growing understanding of pediatric epilepsy and reflect our responsibility to advance scientific knowledge through post-marketing research.”
The LYRICA Pediatric Epilepsy Program is composed of six studies in patients with epilepsy evaluating LYRICA as adjunctive therapy, five of which have been completed. For more information, visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.
About the Study
This Phase 3 study was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy of two doses of LYRICA in patients 5 to 65 years of age with PGTC seizures. The study was conducted at 70 sites in 21 countries with 219 patients. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, or one of two fixed doses of LYRICA twice daily: LYRICA 5 mg/kg/day (7 mg/kg/day for subjects with body weight <30 kg, and 300 mg/day for those 17 years of age and older) or LYRICA 10 mg/kg/day (14 mg/kg/day for subjects with body weight <30 kg, and 600 mg/day for those 17 years of age and older).
The safety profile observed in this study was comparable to the known profile of LYRICA in prior epilepsy studies in pediatric and adult patients. The most common adverse events observed with LYRICA were dizziness, headache and somnolence.
About Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures and occurs in both adults and children. Sixty-five million people worldwide have epilepsy. In the U.S., more than three million people, including 470,000 children are living with epilepsy. Epilepsy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and can profoundly affect multiple daily life activities. Primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, formerly referred to as grand mal seizures, are the most common type of generalized seizures and involve loss of consciousness.
About LYRICA
LYRICA® is currently approved for various indications in more than 130 countries and regions globally.
In the U.S., LYRICA is indicated to treat fibromyalgia, diabetic nerve pain, spinal cord injury nerve pain and pain after shingles in adults.
In the U.S., LYRICA is approved as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients four years of age and older. LYRICA is also indicated to treat partial onset seizures in patients 4 years of age and older with epilepsy who take 1 or more other drugs for seizures.

Important Safety Information
LYRICA is not for everyone. LYRICA may cause serious, even life threatening, allergic reactions. Stop taking LYRICA and call your doctor right away if you have any signs of a serious allergic reaction. Some signs are swelling of your face, mouth, lips, gums, tongue, throat or neck or if you have any trouble breathing, or have a rash, hives or blisters.
Drugs used to treat seizures increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. LYRICA may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Patients, family members or caregivers should call the doctor right away if they notice suicidal thoughts or actions, thoughts of self harm, or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. These changes may include new or worsening depression, anxiety, restlessness, trouble sleeping, panic attacks, anger, irritability, agitation, aggression, dangerous impulses or violence, or extreme increases in activity or talking. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, do not stop LYRICA without first talking to your doctor.
LYRICA may cause swelling of your hands, legs and feet, which can be serious for people with heart problems. LYRICA may cause dizziness and sleepiness. You should not drive or work with machines until you know how LYRICA affects you. Also, tell your doctor right away about muscle pain or problems along with feeling sick and feverish, or any changes in your eyesight including blurry vision or if you have any kidney problems or get dialysis.
Some of the most common side effects of LYRICA are dizziness, blurry vision, weight gain, sleepiness, trouble concentrating, swelling of your hands and feet, dry mouth, and feeling “high.” If you have diabetes, tell your doctor about any skin sores.
You may have a higher chance for swelling and hives if you are also taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors so tell your doctor if you are taking these medications. You may have a higher chance of swelling of your hands or feet or gaining weight if you are also taking certain diabetes medicines. Do not drink alcohol while on LYRICA. You may have a higher chance for dizziness and sleepiness if you take LYRICA with alcohol, narcotic pain medicines, or medicines for anxiety.
Before you start LYRICA, tell your doctor if you are planning to father a child, or if you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking LYRICA. If you have had a drug or alcohol problem, you may be more likely to misuse LYRICA.
In studies, a specific type of blood vessel tumor was seen in mice, but not in rats. The meaning of these findings in humans is not known.
Do not stop taking LYRICA without talking to your doctor. If you stop suddenly you may have headaches, nausea, diarrhea, trouble sleeping, increased sweating, or you may feel anxious. If you have epilepsy, you may have seizures more often.

14891,ï»¿Novartis' Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) Receives FDA's Approval for Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Pediatric Patients,"AveXis receives FDA approval for Zolgensma®, the first and only gene therapy for pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)","The approval is based on ongoing P-III STR1VE & completed P-I START study result assessing Zolgensma (IV) in 21 & 15 patients with SMA and bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene aged <2yrs. respectively
 The collective results: EFS (19 patients survived); 13 reached 14mos. without permanent ventilation, 47.6% & 75.0% achieved the ability to sit without support for≥ 30sec.; 16.7% were able to stand/walk without assistance
 Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) is a gene therapy addressing the genetic root cause of SMA, providing a functional copy of SMN gene and has received PRIME designation & accelerated Sakigake designation with its expected approval in EU & Japan in H2’19 respectively","SMA is a rare genetic disease that leads to progressive muscle weakness, paralysis and, when left untreated in its most severe form, permanent ventilation or death for most patients by age 2[1],[2]
Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) is approved for the treatment of pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) including those who are pre-symptomatic at diagnosis
Zolgensma is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by replacing the defective or missing SMN1 gene to halt disease progression with a single, one-time infusion
Data from the Phase 3 STR1VE trial show prolonged event-free survival, increases in motor function and significant milestone achievement in patients with SMA Type 1, consistent with the Phase 1 START trial
In the START trial, patients treated with Zolgensma achieved motor milestones never seen in the natural history of the disease, including sitting, talking and some patients walking, with no waning of effect nearly four years post-dosing
Basel, May 24, 2019 – AveXis, a Novartis company, today announced the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Zolgensma®(onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) for the treatment of pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with bi-allelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Zolgensma is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time intravenous (IV) infusion. Zolgensma is the first and only gene therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of SMA, including those who are pre-symptomatic at diagnosis.
“A diagnosis of SMA is devastating, leaving untreated babies who have the most severe form with painfully short, highly medicalized lives, during which they are unable to lift their heads, sit or roll, have difficulty swallowing and breathing and need 24-hour care,” said Jerry Mendell, M.D., principal investigator at the Center for Gene Therapy at The Abigail Wexner Research Institute of Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, OH. “In the START clinical trial we conducted with Zolgensma, all children were alive at the conclusion of the study and many were able to sit, roll, crawl, play and some could walk. This level of efficacy, delivered as a single, one-time therapy, is truly remarkable and provides a level of unprecedented hope for families battling SMA Type 1. We now have data four years out from the trial, and we see the durability of this gene therapy.”
“The approval of Zolgensma is a testament to the transformational impact gene therapies can have in reimagining the treatment of life-threatening genetic diseases like spinal muscular atrophy,” said Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. “We believe Zolgensma could create a lifetime of possibilities for the children and families impacted by this devastating condition.”
SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a defective or missing SMN1 gene. Without a functional SMN1 gene, infants with SMA lose the motor neurons responsible for muscle functions such as breathing, swallowing, speaking and walking.[1] Left untreated, muscles become progressively weaker.[1],[2] In the most severe form, this eventually leads to paralysis and ultimately permanent ventilation or death by age 2 in more than 90% of cases.[3] SMA is the leading cause of genetic infant death.[4] Approximately 450 to 500 infants are born with SMA in the US annually.[5],[6] It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.[7] This is especially critical in the most severe form where degeneration starts shortly before birth and escalates quickly.[8] With states adding SMA to their genetic newborn screening panel, babies with SMA can begin to be widely identified at birth and the ability to have earlier intervention can be improved.[9]
“Zolgensma’s one-time dose of gene therapy has the potential to make a truly transformative impact on this life-threatening disease,” said Kenneth Hobby, president of Cure SMA, a patient advocacy organization dedicated to the care, treatment and cure of SMA. “Our organization is leading the way to a world without SMA and we are excited the FDA’s approval of Zolgensma brings patients and families a powerful new treatment which corrects the underlying cause of the disease.”
The approval of Zolgensma is based on data from the ongoing Phase 3 STR1VE trial and the completed Phase 1 START trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in patients with SMA Type 1 who showed symptoms of SMA at <6 months of age, with one or two copies in the STR1VE trial or two copies in the START trial of the SMN2 backup gene and who have bi-allelic SMN1 gene deletion or point mutations.These data show Zolgensma provides unprecedented rates of survival never seen in the natural history of the disease; rapid motor function improvement, often within one month of dosing; and, durable milestone achievement, including the ability to sit without support, a milestone never achieved in untreated patients. Safety observations in STR1VE were comparable to those seen in the START trial. The most commonly observed adverse events were elevated aminotransferases and vomiting.
“We are grateful to the tenacious researchers, partners and families who participated in the Zolgensma clinical trials that helped us achieve this incredible milestone,” said Dave Lennon, president of AveXis. “We are proud to bring this one-time gene therapy to pediatric patients with SMA and remain committed to advancing the science behind Zolgensma to transform SMA, as well as other rare genetic diseases.”
Zolgensma will be made available in the US and will be marketed by AveXis, a Novartis company. OneGene ProgramTM, AveXis’ comprehensive patient support program, provides a dedicated, personalized support team focused on the needs of each family throughout the Zolgensma treatment journey. This includes answering questions about Zolgensma, verifying reimbursement assistance and coordinating financial assistance programs for eligible patients. For more information, caregivers and healthcare professionals can call 1-855-441-GENE (1-855-441-4363).
Outside of the US, Zolgensma has PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation in Europe and is being reviewed under Accelerated Assessment Procedure, and also has accelerated Sakigake designation in Japan. In the interim, AveXis has arranged to make the product available for international markets, subject to local laws and regulations, as a part of its paid Managed Access Program via a collaboration with Durbin, a third-party provider. International inquiries regarding availability of Zolgensma outside of the US may be made by contacting Durbin at AveXisMAP@DurbinGlobal.com or +44-20-8869-6506.

About Zolgensma Clinical Data
The efficacy of Zolgensma in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with SMA with bi-allelic mutations in the SMN1 gene was evaluated in STR1VE, an open-label, single-arm clinical trial (ongoing), and in START, an open-label, single-arm, ascending-dose clinical trial (completed). Patients experienced onset of clinical symptoms consistent with SMA before 6 months of age. All patients had genetically confirmed bi-allelic SMN1 gene deletions, two copies of the SMN2 gene, and absence of the c.859G>C modification in exon 7 of SMN2 gene (which predicts a milder phenotype). All patients had baseline anti-AAV9 antibody titers of >= 1:50, measured by ELISA. In both trials, Zolgensma was delivered as a single-dose intravenous infusion.
Efficacy was established on the basis of survival, and achievement of developmental motor milestones such as sitting without support. Survival was defined as time from birth to either death or permanent ventilation. Permanent ventilation was defined as requiring invasive ventilation (tracheostomy), or respiratory assistance for 16 or more hours per day (including noninvasive ventilatory support) continuously for 14 or more days in the absence of an acute reversible illness, excluding perioperative ventilation. Efficacy was also supported by assessments of ventilator use, nutritional support and scores on the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND). CHOP-INTEND is an assessment of motor skills in patients with infantile-onset SMA.
The ongoing clinical trial, STR1VE, enrolled 21 patients (10 male and 11 female) with infantile-onset SMA. Before treatment with Zolgensma, none of the 21 patients required non-invasive ventilator (NIV) support, and all patients could exclusively feed orally (i.e., no need for non-oral nutrition). The mean CHOP-INTEND score at baseline was 31.0 (range 18 to 47). All the patients received 1.1 × 10[1][4] vg/kg of Zolgensma. The mean age of the 21 patients at the time of treatment was 3.9 months (range 0.5 to 5.9 months).
As of the March 2019 data cutoff, 19 patients were alive without permanent ventilation (i.e., event-free survival) and were continuing in the trial, while one patient died at age 7.8 months due to disease progression, and one patient withdrew from the study at age 11.9 months. The 19 surviving patients who were continuing in the trial ranged in age from 9.4 to 18.5 months. By the data cutoff, 13 of the 19 patients continuing in the trial reached 14 months of age without permanent ventilation, one of the study’s co-primary efficacy endpoints. In addition to survival, assessment of the other co-primary efficacy endpoint found that 10 of the 21 patients (47.6%) achieved the ability to sit without support for >= 30 seconds between 9.2 and 16.9 months of age (mean age was 12.1 months). Based on the natural history of the disease, patients who met the study entry criteria would not be expected to attain the ability to sit without support, and only approximately 25% of these patients would be expected to survive (i.e., being alive without permanent ventilation) beyond 14 months of age. In addition, 16 of the 19 patients had not required daily NIV use.
Comparison of the results of the ongoing clinical trial to available natural history data of patients with infantile-onset SMA provides primary evidence of the effectiveness of Zolgensma.
The completed clinical trial, START, enrolled 15 patients (6 male and 9 female) with infantile-onset SMA, 3 in a low-dose cohort and 12 in a high-dose cohort. At the time of treatment, the mean age of patients in the low-dose cohort was 6.3 months (range 5.9 to 7.2 months), and 3.4 months (range 0.9 to 7.9 months) in the high-dose cohort. The dosage received by patients in the low-dose cohort was approximately one-third of the dosage received by patients in the high-dose cohort. However, the precise dosages of Zolgensma received by patients in this completed clinical trial are unclear due to a change in the method of measuring Zolgensma concentration, and to decreases in the concentration of stored Zolgensma over time. The retrospectively-estimated dosage range in the high-dose cohort is approximately 1.1 × 10[1][4] to 1.4 × 10[1][4] vg/kg.
By 24 months following Zolgensma infusion, one patient in the low-dose cohort met the endpoint of permanent ventilation; all 12 patients in the high-dose cohort were alive without permanent ventilation. None of the patients in the low-dose cohort were able to sit without support, or to stand or walk; in the high-dose cohort, 9 of the 12 patients (75.0%) were able to sit without support for >= 30 seconds, and 2 patients (16.7%) were able to stand and walk without assistance. Comparison of the results of the low-dose cohort to the results of the high-dose cohort shows a dose-response relationship that supports the effectiveness of Zolgensma.
About Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi)
Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) is a proprietary gene therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with bi-allelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Zolgensma is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time intravenous (IV) infusion. Zolgensma represents the first approved therapeutic in a proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. The therapy is also under regulatory review and anticipated to receive approval in Japan and the European Union later this year.
About Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons.[1],[2] The incidence of SMA is approximately 1 in 10,000 live births and it is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality.[2],[4] The most severe form of SMA is Type 1, a lethal genetic disorder characterized by rapid motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, resulting in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support by 24 months of age for more than 90 percent of patients if left untreated.[3]
Indication
Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) is an adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy indicated for the treatment of pediatric patient less than 2 years of age with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with bi-allelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene.
Limitation of Use:
The safety and effectiveness of repeat administration of Zolgensma have not been evaluated.
The use of Zolgensma in patients with advanced SMA (e.g., complete paralysis of limbs, permanent ventilator dependence) has not been evaluated.
Important Safety Information
Acute Serious Liver Injury
Acute serious liver injury and elevated aminotransferases can occur with Zolgensma. Patients with pre-existing liver impairment may be at higher risk. Prior to infusion, assess liver function of all patients by clinical examination and laboratory testing (e.g., hepatic aminotransferases [aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase], total bilirubin and prothrombin time). Administer systemic corticosteroid to all patients before and after Zolgensma infusion. Continue to monitor liver function for at least 3 months after infusion.
Thrombocytopenia
Transient decreases in platelet counts, some of which met the criteria for thrombocytopenia, were observed at different time points after Zolgensma infusion. Monitor platelet counts before Zolgensma infusion and on a regular basis afterwards.
Elevated Troponin-I
Transient increases in cardiac troponin-I levels (up to 0.176 mcg/L) were observed following Zolgensma infusion in clinical trials. The clinical importance of these findings is not known. However, cardiac toxicity was observed in animal studies. Monitor troponin-I before Zolgensma infusion and on a regular basis for at least 3 months afterwards.
Adverse Reactions
The most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence >=5%) were elevated aminotransferases and vomiting.

submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) for Puldysa® (idebenone) for the treatment of
respiratory dysfunction in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to the European
Medicines Agency (EMA). Santhera is seeking conditional marketing authorization (CMA).
The indication for Puldysa sought under CMA is the treatment of respiratory dysfunction in patients with
DMD who are not using glucocorticoids. The MAA is supported by data from Santhera’s Phase II (DELPHI)
study, the long-term DELPHI-Extension study, the pivotal Phase III (DELOS) study [1-5] and the recently
completed SYROS study, a collection of long-term data from patients who completed the DELOS study
and continued to be treated with idebenone for up to six years [6].
“The new data included in this regulatory submission confirm clinically relevant patient benefits and
long-term therapeutic efficacy with idebenone in patients with DMD. Thereby, we have closed earlier
data gaps and respond to requirements from the regulatory authorities,” said Kristina Sjöblom Nygren,
MD, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Development at Santhera.
In line with previous communications, Santhera plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) with the
US FDA following the completion of the currently ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III
(SIDEROS) study that investigates the efficacy and safety of idebenone in delaying the loss of respiratory
function in patients with DMD taking glucocorticoid steroids over a period of 18 months
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02814019; www.siderosdmd.com). With 266 patients to be enrolled,
SIDEROS isthe largest actively recruiting clinical trial in DMD. To date, the study has 214 patients enrolled
at approximately 60 clinical trial sites in Europe, the US and Israel, with patient recruitment expected to
complete in 4Q 2019. Eligible patients who complete SIDEROS are offered to enroll in the open-label
SIDEROS-Extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03603288).
Idebenone for the treatment of DMD has been granted orphan drug designation by European, US, Swiss

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
DMD is one of the most common and devastating types of progressive muscle weakness and
degeneration starting at an early age and leading to early morbidity and mortality due to respiratory
failure. It is a genetic, degenerative disease that occurs almost exclusively in males with an incidence of
up to 1 in 3,500 live male births worldwide. DMD is characterized by a loss of the protein dystrophin,
leading to cell damage, impaired calcium homeostasis, elevated oxidative stress and reduced energy
production in muscle cells. With age, progressive respiratory muscle weakness affecting thoracic
accessory muscles and the diaphragm causes respiratory disease, impaired clearance of airway
secretions, recurrent pulmonary infections due to ineffective cough, and eventually respiratory failure.
There is currently no treatment approved for slowing loss of respiratory function in patients with DMD.
About Idebenone in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Idebenone is a synthetic short-chain benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase (NQO1) capable of stimulating mitochondrial electron transport, reducing and
scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and supplementing cellular energy levels.
DELOS was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study which randomized 64 patients,
not taking concomitant steroids, to receive either idebenone (900 mg/day) or matching placebo. The
study met its primary endpoint, the change from baseline in peak expiratory flow (PEF) expressed as
percent of predicted, which demonstrated that idebenone can slow the loss of respiratory function.
Supportive data for idebenone were shown in the Phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled DELPHI study
and its 2-year open-label extension study (DELPHI-E).
SYROS was a prospectively planned, retrospective collection of long-term respiratory function data from
18 patients who completed the DELOS study and subsequently received idebenone (900 mg/day) under
Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). The SYROS study showed that the previously observed beneficial
effect of idebenone in reducing the rate of respiratory function decline was maintained for up to six years
during treatment.

“Nilens Jord and Matas have had a close and fruitful collaboration through the past 27 years. When it became apparent that the founders were planning to hand the company on, we saw a chance to take our strategic work a big step forward by adding a very popular makeup brand to our private label portfolio. Together with the Kosmolet team, we can strengthen the position of Nilens Jord even further”, states Gregers Wedell-Wedellsborg. 
“We see Kosmolet A/S as an attractive investment in itself and are impressed with the profitable growth it has recorded over the past many years. With Matas as the new owners, we can grow the business even more and further improve profitability.”
Strategic rationale
With the acquisition of Kosmolet A/S, Matas achieves:

A stronger portfolio of private label brands
An increased share of revenue from private label brands with efficient operations and attractive margins

 Curadigm technology increases the efficacy at current doses, decreases toxicity & cost, allowing to utilize new approaches for drug designing and is presented at AACR 2019","Curadigm opens new growth pathways for Nanobiotix beyond oncology, built on the success and know-how established through the development of NBTXR3
Curadigm will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nanobiotix and the platform will be further developed through multiple anticipated partnerships
Curadigm “Nanoprimer” technology aims to prime the body to receive various therapeutics and could reshape the balance between efficacy and toxicity for patients
In vivo proof of concept data were presented during AACR 2019
 
“After achieving the milestone of our first European market approval for Nanobiotix’s lead oncology product candidate, NBTXR3, our business continues to build momentum. We are thrilled to announce the launch of our subsidiary, Curadigm—another disruptive technology platform we have built as a result of pioneering nanomedicine for more than 15 years. While Nanobiotix remains focused on continued development of NBTXR3, we are pleased to open new growth pathways for our business and shareholders.” – Laurent Levy, CEO of Nanobiotix

Paris, France and Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, May 28, 2019 – NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO – ISIN: FR0011341205), a clinical-stage nanomedicine company pioneering new approaches to the treatment of cancer, today announced the launch of new subsidiary Curadigm, dedicated to redefining the therapeutic balance between bioavailability, toxicity, and efficacy across the pharmaceutical industry. The company will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nanobiotix and operate in France and in the US with a dedicated team committed to growth and potential financing opportunities.

For most therapeutics today, only a small portion of the medicine administered is effective and the rest is cleared from the body without effect or may even be toxic. After injection, the dose moves through the circulatory system within the blood, and while a small portion reaches the targeted tissue the remainder is cleared or accumulates in organs such as the liver.

Curadigm technology aims to change this balance through proprietary “Nanoprimer” technology. Leveraging over 15 years of experience in the development of nanotechnology at Nanobiotix, the company has created nano-scale objects that prime the body for treatment. These nanoparticles, called nanoprimers, have been designed with specific physico-chemical properties that allow them to transiently occupy the liver cells responsible for therapeutic clearance. Injected prior to the therapeutic, the nanoprimer increases systemic bioavailability allowing for increased accrual in the target tissue and therapeutic action.

Curadigm technology shows potential to have broad implications across the healthcare system through its opportunity to increase the efficacy of therapeutics at their current dose, lower the necessary dose thereby decreasing toxicity and cost, and allow for novel therapeutic approaches (e.g. new approaches to drug design). In Vivo data proving the concept was published by Nanobiotix in Scientific Reports1 and presented at AACR2019.2

Curadigm will be led by Dr. Matthieu Germain, who holds deep expertise in the development of nanoparticles after more than 15 years with Nanobiotix, including initial development of the new technology. Dr. Kate Rochlin, leveraging her strong background in early stage company growth, will join the company as Director of Business Development. Under their leadership, Curadigm will maintain the same core values and spirit of its parent company—to significantly improve outcomes for millions of patients through a disruptive approach for therapeutics across healthcare.

 Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is gene therapy developed utilizing an AAV-factor VIII vector and has received FDA’s BT designation, EMA’s PRIME designation for hemophilia A with its expected FDA & EU regulatory submission in Q3’19","Timing of Regulatory Submissions to Be Determined in 3Q 2019
May 28, 2019 , BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) announced today that its investigational gene therapy, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, for adults with severe hemophilia A achieved pre-specified clinical criteria for regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe. As of May 28, 2019, eight patients in the 20-patient cohort of the Phase 3 GENEr8-1 study achieved Factor VIII levels of 40 international units per deciliter (IU/dL), or more, at 23 to 26 weeks, meeting the pre-specified criteria for Factor VIII activity levels. The company will meet with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) to review the phase 3 data and the other elements of a submission and intends to announce the timing for its planned marketing applications in 3Q 2019.
 
Topline Data Results
As of the April 30, 2019 data cutoff, between weeks 23 to 26, in a cohort of the Phase 3 GENEr8-1 study of valoctocogene roxaparvovec dosed at 6e13 vg/kg, seven of 16 study participants reached or exceeded the pre-specified Factor VIII levels of 40 international units per deciliter using the chromogenic substrate (CS) assay. Subsequent to the April 30 cutoff, one additional participant met that criteria, bringing the total to eight participants.
For the 16 patients who had reached week 26 by the April 30 cutoff since administration of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, the estimated median Annual Bleed Rate (ABR) was zero and the estimated mean ABR was 1.5, representing a reduction of 85% from baseline levels where all patients were on standard of care prophylaxis. In addition, there was an 84% reduction in median annualized Factor VIII usage and a 94% reduction in mean FVIII usage annualized between week 5 and 26. In the 23 to 26 week time period the mean Factor VIII level using the CS assay was 36 (SD=28) IU/dL and the median was 33 IU/dL.
“Reaching this pre-specified clinical endpoint is an important milestone that brings us one step closer to a potential regulatory submission in both the U.S. and Europe for valoctocogene roxaparvovec to treat adults with severe hemophilia A,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President of Worldwide Research and Development at BioMarin. “Our discussions with the FDA and EMA underscore the high level of unmet need in the hemophilia community, and we look forward to continuing our productive dialogue on the submissions.”
Regulatory Status
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted valoctocogene roxaparvovec Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation program is intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious condition. To qualify for Breakthrough Therapy Designation, preliminary clinical evidence must show that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted access to its Priority Medicines (PRIME) regulatory initiative for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. To be accepted for PRIME, an investigational therapy has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. PRIME focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no treatment options. These medicines are considered priority medicines within the European Union (EU).
BioMarin’s valoctocogene roxaparvovec has also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. The Orphan Drug Designation program is intended to advance the evaluation and development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions.

Registrational Studies Underway; GENEr8-1 to Evaluate Superiority
The global Phase 3 program includes two studies with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, one with the 6e13 vg/kg dose (GENEr8-1) and one with the 4e13 vg/kg dose (GENEr8-2). With the goal of evaluating superiority of valoctocogene roxaparvovec to the current standard of care, prophylactic therapy, the sample size of the GENEr8-1 study is approximately 130 total participants. The study is powered to evaluate superiority to the current standard of care. Enrollment completion in the newly amended GENEr8-1 study is expected in the third quarter of 2019.
GENEr8-2, the ongoing Phase 3 study with the 4e13 vg/kg dose, remains unchanged with an N=40. The GENEr8-2 study is expected to complete enrollment one to two quarters after GENEr8-1 in 2019.
BioMarin now has six clinical studies underway in its comprehensive gene therapy program for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. In addition to the two global Phase 3 studies GENEr8-1 and GENEr8-2, the Company recently began a Phase 1/2 Study with the 6E13kg/vg dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec in approximately 10 participants with pre-existing AAV5 antibodies. Two additional and separate studies, one to study seroprevalence in people with severe hemophilia A and one non-interventional study to determine baseline characteristics in people with hemophilia A, are ongoing around the world. Participants in the Phase 1/2 dose escalation study will continue to be monitored as part of the global program underway.
Valoctocogene roxaparvovec investigational product from BioMarin’s commercial scale manufacturing facility will be used in all BioMarin interventional studies going forward. Product to support the additional participants in the GENEr8-1 has been produced and is immediately available.
Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec Safety
Overall, valoctocogene roxaparvovec has been well-tolerated by the 22 participants in the Phase 3 cohort at the 6e13 vg/kg dose. No participants developed inhibitors to Factor VIII, and no participants withdrew from the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (17 participants, 77.3%), nausea (11 participants, 50%), headache (10 participants, 45.5%), fatigue (9 participants, 40.9%), arthralgia (8 participants, 36.4%), AST elevation (8 participants, 36.4%), nasopharyngitis (7 participants, 31.8%), back pain (6 participants, 27.3%), and oropharyngeal pain (5 participants, 22.7%). Three subjects experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) (13.6%); two SAEs were related to infusion reactions, one SAE of gastroenteritis was unrelated to treatment.
Gene Therapy Manufacturing
BioMarin has constructed one of the first gene therapy manufacturing facilities of its kind in the world, which is located in Novato, California. Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) production of valoctocogene roxaparvovec has commenced, and this manufacturing facility will support pivotal clinical development activities and anticipated commercial demand, if valoctocogene roxaparvovec is approved. This facility is capable of supporting approximately 4,000 doses per year, and the production process was developed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation guidance for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use facilitating worldwide registration with health authorities. In 2018, the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE) selected the Company’s gene therapy manufacturing facility as the Facility of the Year Category Winner for Project Execution.
About Hemophilia A
People living with hemophilia A lack enough FVIII protein to help their blood clot and are at risk for painful, potentially life-threatening bleeds from even modest injuries. Additionally, people with severe hemophilia A often experience painful, spontaneous bleeds into their muscles or joints. The standard of care for the 43 percent of individuals with hemophilia A who are severely affected is a prophylactic regimen of Factor VIII infusions administered intravenously two to three times per week. Despite these regimens, many people continue to experience bleeds, resulting in progressive and debilitating joint damage which can have a major impact on their quality of life.
Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is an x-linked genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. Although it is passed down from parents to children, about 1/3 of cases are caused by a spontaneous mutation, a new mutation that was not inherited. Approximately 1 in 10,000 people is born with Hemophilia A.

14944,ï»¿Celgene's Revlimid (Lenalidomide) + Rituximab Receive FDA's Approval for Previously Treated Follicular Lymphoma or Marginal Zone Lymphoma in Adults,FDA Approves REVLIMID (Lenalidomide) In Combination With Rituximab For the Treatment of Adult Patients with Previously Treated Follicular Lymphoma or Marginal Zone Lymphoma,"The approval is based on P-III AUGMENT study results assessing Revlimid + Rituximab (R2) vs rituximab + PBO in patients with previously treated FL & MZL, following its PR designation
 The P-III AUGMENT study results: mPFS (39.4 vs 14.1 mos.); improvement in OS; median follow-up time (28.3 mos.)
 Revlimid is a thalidomide analog and is indicated in combination with rituximab, currently under EMA regulatory review for r/r FL & MZL with its sNDA submission to PMDA of R2 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory indolent B-cell NHL in Japan","Approval marks the first chemotherapy-free combination regimen for patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous treatment

Approval based on Phase 3 AUGMENT study, which showed the combination significantly improved median progression-free survival versus rituximab monotherapy

SUMMIT, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) in combination with a rituximab product (R²) for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) following Priority Review designation. This is the first FDA-approved combination treatment regimen for patients with these indolent forms of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) that does not include chemotherapy.
“Nearly 15 years following the initial FDA approval, REVLIMID continues to demonstrate benefits for new patient populations,” said Jay Backstrom, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer for Celgene. “REVLIMID in combination with rituximab (R2) leads to immune-mediated treatment effects and represents a chemotherapy-free treatment option that can help patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma delay disease progression.”
Immune dysfunction (meaning the immune system is not functioning optimally) is a defining aspect of indolent forms of NHL, including FL and MZL.1,2 When this dysfunction occurs, lymphocytes in the immune system either fail to detect or target cancerous cells.1,2
“Chemotherapy continues to be a standard of care for indolent forms of NHL, but most patients will relapse or become refractory to their current treatment,” said Meghan Gutierrez, Chief Executive Officer for the Lymphoma Research Foundation. “This approval represents a new therapeutic option for previously treated patients with follicular and marginal zone lymphomas, including those who relapse or no longer respond to initial treatment. We commend the patients and scientists who participated in the clinical study for advancing lymphoma research and treatment.”
The approval of R2 is based primarily on results from the randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 AUGMENT study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of the R² combination versus rituximab plus placebo in patients with previously treated FL (n=295) and MZL (n=63).
In the AUGMENT study, treatment with R2 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), evaluated by an independent review committee, versus rituximab-placebo. The median PFS was 39.4 months for patients treated with R2 and 14.1 months for those treated with rituximab-placebo (HR: 0.46; 95% CI, 0.34-0.62; P<0.0001). Median follow-up time was 28.3 months (range, 0.1-51.3) in the intent to treat population (n=358). Although not statistically powered to detect a difference in overall survival, a numeric trend for improvement in overall survival (a secondary endpoint) was also seen with R2 versus rituximab-placebo (16 vs. 26 deaths) (HR: 0.61; 95% CI, 0.33-1.13).
REVLIMID is only available through a restricted distribution program called REVLIMID REMS® program. REVLIMID has a boxed warning for embryo-fetal toxicity, hematologic toxicity, and venous and arterial thromboembolism. Adverse reactions reported in ≥15% of patients with FL/MZL treated with R2 were: neutropenia (58%), diarrhea (31%), constipation (26%), cough (24%), fatigue (22%), rash (22%), pyrexia (21%), leukopenia (20%), pruritus (20%), upper respiratory tract infections (18%), abdominal pain (18%), anemia (16%), headache (15%), thrombocytopenia (15%).
A Marketing Authorization Application for R2 is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of relapsed/refractory FL and MZL. A supplemental new drug application was also submitted to the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for an additional indication as well as dosage and administration updates for lenalidomide in combination with rituximab for the treatment of relapsed/refractory indolent B-cell NHL.
About Indolent Lymphoma
Lymphoma is a blood cancer that develops in lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell in the immune system that helps protect the body from infection.3 There are two classes of lymphoma – Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) – each with specific subtypes that determine how the cancer behaves, spreads and should be treated.3,4,5
Indolent lymphomas are slow-growing forms of the disease, which can often be asymptomatic or have fewer symptoms upon diagnosis.6 Indolent lymphomas account for approximately 40% of all NHL cases.6 In patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma, the disease has either responded to treatment but then returned or has not responded to initial treatment.7
About AUGMENT
AUGMENT is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) in combination with rituximab (R²) versus rituximab plus placebo in patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. AUGMENT included patients diagnosed with Grade 1, 2 or 3a follicular lymphoma, who received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, were refractory or relapsed, not rituximab-refractory.
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, defined as the time from date of randomization to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included overall response rate, durable complete response rate, complete response rate, duration of response, duration of complete response, overall survival, event-free survival and time to next anti-lymphoma therapy.
About REVLIMID ®
REVLIMID ® (lenalidomide) in combination with dexamethasone (dex) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM)
REVLIMID is indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with MM following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT)
REVLIMID is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low-or intermediate-1–risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities
REVLIMID is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) whose disease has relapsed or progressed after two prior therapies, one of which included bortezomib
REVLIMID in combination with a rituximab product is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL)

Important Safety Information
WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY, HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, and VENOUS and ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Do not use REVLIMID during pregnancy. Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe life-threatening human birth defects. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo-fetal death. In females of reproductive potential, obtain 2 negative pregnancy tests before starting REVLIMID treatment. Females of reproductive potential must use 2 forms of contraception or continuously abstain from heterosexual sex during and for 4 weeks after REVLIMID treatment. To avoid embryo-fetal exposure to lenalidomide, REVLIMID is only available through a restricted distribution program, the REVLIMID REMS ® program.
Information about the REVLIMID REMS program is available at www.celgeneriskmanagement.com or by calling the manufacturer’s toll-free number 1-888-423-5436.
Hematologic Toxicity (Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia)
REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Eighty percent of patients with del 5q MDS had to have a dose delay/reduction during the major study. Thirty-four percent of patients had to have a second dose delay/reduction. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80% of patients enrolled in the study. Patients on therapy for del 5q MDS should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or reduction. Patients may require use of blood product support and/or growth factors.
Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism
REVLIMID has demonstrated a significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with MM who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy. Monitor for and advise patients about signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the choice of regimen should be based on an assessment of the patient’s underlying risks.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy: REVLIMID can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus
Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: REVLIMID is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to lenalidomide
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: See Boxed WARNINGS

Females of Reproductive Potential: See Boxed WARNINGS
Males: Lenalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking REVLIMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing REVLIMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking REVLIMID must not donate sperm
Blood Donation: Patients must not donate blood during treatment with REVLIMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to REVLIMID
REVLIMID REMS Program: See Boxed WARNINGS: Prescribers and pharmacies must be certified with the REVLIMID REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements; pharmacies must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive REVLIMID. Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with REMS requirements; female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements and males must comply with contraception requirements
Hematologic Toxicity: REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising, especially with use of concomitant medications that may increase risk of bleeding. Patients may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction. MM: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) in patients taking REVLIMID + dexamethasone or REVLIMID as maintenance therapy, every 7 days for the first 2 cycles, on days 1 and 15 of cycle 3, and every 28 days thereafter. MDS: Monitor CBC inpatients on therapy for del 5q MDS, weekly for the first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. See Boxed WARNINGS for further information. MCL: Monitor CBC in patients taking REVLIMID for MCL weekly for the first cycle (28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles 2-4, and then monthly thereafter. FL/MZL: Monitor CBC in patients taking REVLIMID for FL or MZL weekly for the first 3 weeks of Cycle 1 (28 days), every 2 weeks during Cycles 2-4, and then monthly thereafter
Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism: See Boxed WARNINGS: Venous thromboembolic events (DVT and PE) and arterial thromboses (MI and CVA) are increased in patients treated with REVLIMID. Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the regimen should be based on the patient’s underlying risks. ESAs and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their use should be based on a benefit-risk decision
Increased Mortality in Patients With CLL: In a clinical trial in the first-line treatment of patients with CLL, single-agent REVLIMID therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single-agent chlorambucil. Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure, occurred more frequently in the REVLIMID arm. REVLIMID is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials
Second Primary Malignancies (SPM): In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving REVLIMID and in patients with FL or MZLreceiving REVLIMID + rituximab therapy, an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor SPM, notably AML, have been observed. In MM patients, MDS was also observed. Monitor patients for the development of SPM. Take into account both the potential benefit of REVLIMID and risk of SPM when considering treatment
Increased Mortality with Pembrolizumab: In clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1-or PD-L1- blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials
Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with REVLIMID + dexamethasone. Pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may be risk factors. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop REVLIMID upon elevation of liver enzymes. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered
Severe Cutaneous Reactions Including Hypersensitivity Reactions: Angioedema and severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. These events can be fatal. Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive REVLIMID. REVLIMID interruption or discontinuation should be considered for
Grade 2-3 skin rash. REVLIMID must be discontinued for angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN, or DRESS is suspected and should not be resumed following discontinuation for these reactions
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Fatal instances of TLS have been reported during treatment with REVLIMID. The patients at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Closely monitor patients at risk and take appropriate preventive approaches
Tumor Flare Reaction (TFR): TFR has occurred during investigational use of REVLIMID for CLL and lymphoma. Monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended in patients with MCL, FL, or MZL.Tumor flare may mimic the progression of disease (PD). In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, it is recommended to withhold treatment with REVLIMID until TFR resolves to ≤Grade 1. REVLIMID may be continued in patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR without interruption or modification, at the physician’s discretion
Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization: A decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment (>4 cycles) with REVLIMID has been reported. Consider early referral to transplant center to optimize timing of the stem cell collection
Thyroid Disorders: Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported. Measure thyroid function before starting REVLIMID treatment and during therapy
Early Mortality in Patients With MCL: In another MCL study, there was an increase in early deaths (within 20 weeks); 12.9% in the REVLIMID arm versus 7.1% in the control arm. Risk factors for early deaths include high tumor burden, MIPI score at diagnosis, and high WBC at baseline (≥10 x 109/L)
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Multiple Myeloma

In newly diagnosed: The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, asthenia, fatigue, back pain, hypokalemia, rash, cataract, lymphopenia, dyspnea, DVT, hyperglycemia, and leukopenia. The highest frequency of infections occurred in Arm Rd Continuous (75%) compared to Arm MPT (56%). There were more Grade 3 and 4 and serious adverse reactions of infection in Arm Rd Continuous than either Arm MPT or Rd18

14969,ï»¿Arvinas' ARV-110 Receives the US FDA's Fast Track Designation for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer in Men,ARVINAS RECEIVES FAST TRACK DESIGNATION FOR ITS TARGETED PROTEIN DEGRADER ARV-110 AS A TREATMENT FOR MEN WITH METASTATIC CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER,"Arvinas’ ARV-110 is an orally available PROTAC protein degrader used for targeting androgen receptor (AR) protein and is currently evaluated in P-I for its safety, tolerability, and PK in men with 2L+ mCRPC
 In Q1’19, Arvinas initiated its P-I study of ARV-110 for mCRPC with its preliminary clinical data sharing in H2’19 and expected full disclosure of study in H1’20
 Arvinas’ PROTAC protein degraders (Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera) are used for harnessing body’s immune system to degrade disease-causing proteins with the help of E3 ligase for tagging the protein with ubiquitin, further leading to its degradation through proteasome","ARV-110 is Arvinas’ first clinical-stage drug in the innovative field of targeted protein degradation, and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial
NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Arvinas, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARVN), a biopharmaceutical company creating a new class of therapies that degrades disease-causing proteins, today announced that its lead PROTAC® protein degrader, ARV-110, has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) whose disease has progressed after treatment with two or more systemic therapies. ARV-110 is an orally bioavailable PROTAC® protein degrader designed to selectively target and degrade the androgen receptor (AR) protein. ARV-110 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ARV-110 in men with mCRPC whose disease has progressed after treatment with standard of care therapies.

“While great strides have been made in the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, current AR-targeted standard of care treatments are less effective in patients whose disease includes increased levels of androgen production or mutations in the androgen receptor,” said John Houston, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Arvinas. “We believe, due to its ability to iteratively degrade the AR protein, ARV-110 could represent a meaningful new therapy to improve the lives of patients battling mCRPC, and for whom current therapies are not effective. The Fast Track designation by the FDA recognizes the urgency for improved treatments for these patients.”
About Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
In the United States, prostate cancer is both the second most prevalent cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in men. The American Cancer Societypredicts that one in nine men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is defined by disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy and is often correlated with rising levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA).
Current AR-targeted standard of care treatments for mCRPC are less effective in patients whose disease has increased levels of androgen production, AR gene or gene enhancer amplification, or AR point mutations. Between 15-25% of patients do not respond to second-generation hormone therapies like abiraterone and enzalutamide, and the majority of responsive patients will ultimately become resistant, resulting in poor prognoses for men diagnosed with this devastating condition.
About PROTAC® Protein Degraders
Arvinas’ PROTAC® protein degraders harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to degrade disease-causing proteins. PROTAC® protein degraders recruit an E3 ligase to tag the target protein with ubiquitin, which directs its degradation through the proteasome, a large protein complex that breaks down the ubiquitinated target protein into small peptides and amino acids. As the target protein is degraded, the PROTAC® protein degrader is released and acts iteratively to destroy additional target protein.
PROTAC® protein degraders offer numerous potential therapeutic advantages, including broad tissue distribution, routes of administration that include oral delivery, and simpler manufacturing than other new modalities, such as cell-based therapies. Arvinas has developed and optimized a proprietary library of protein targeting ligands, E3 ligase ligands, and linkers, which allow the company to rapidly identify and optimize efficient protein degraders with favorable characteristics for successful drug development.
About ARV-110
ARV-110 is an orally bioavailable PROTAC® protein degrader designed to selectively target and degrade androgen receptor (AR) protein. ARV-110 is being developed as a potential treatment for men with mCRPC. ARV-110 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of AR mutation or overexpression, both common mechanisms of resistance to currently available AR-targeted therapies. Arvinas believes the differentiated pharmacology of ARV-110, including its iterative activity, has the potential to translate into improved clinical outcomes for patients.
The Phase 1 clinical trial of ARV-110, for men with mCRPC whose disease has progressed after treatment with standard of care therapies, began in 1Q2019. Preliminary clinical data for the trial will be shared in 2H2019, including safety, tolerability, and PK data. Full disclosure of trial information is expected in 1H2020, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) data and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) data.
About Arvinas
Arvinas is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapies to degrade disease-causing proteins. Arvinas uses its proprietary technology platform to engineer PROTAC® targeted protein degraders that are designed to harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to selectively and efficiently degrade and remove disease-causing proteins.

15002,ï»¿Novartis Reports Results of QMF149 (indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate) in P-III QUARTZ Study for Inadequately Controlled Asthma,Novartis' phase III QUARTZ study of new investigational inhaled combination treatment QMF149 meets primary and key secondary endpoints in patients with inadequately controlled asthma,"The P-III QUARTZ study results involves assessing of QMF149 (150/80 Mu g) vs mometasone furoate (200 Mu g) delivered via Breezhaler & Twisthaler in 802 adult and adolescent patients in a ratio (1:1) with inadequately controlled asthma respectively
 The P-III QUARTZ study results: @12wks. met its 1EPs & 2EPs; improvement in lung function; improvements in evening PEF (26.1 L/min); improvements in asthma control as measured by ACQ-7 (74.7% vs 64.9%); AEs (32.3% vs 38.3%)
 QMF149 (qd) is an inhaled fixed-dose combination therapy delivered with the dose-confirming Breezhaler device and is evaluated under Novartis’ P-III PLATINUM Program. Novartis enters into an exclusive license agreement with Merck for mometasone furoate to use in QMF149 candidate","Low dose QMF149 (indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate) demonstrated both statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function and asthma control compared to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy[1]
QUARTZ is the first completed study of the phase III PLATINUM clinical development program which evaluates both QMF149 (indacaterol and mometasone furoate) and QVM149 (indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate)
Novartis is aiming to reimagine inhaled asthma care by developing once daily fixed dose combination treatments, delivered with the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device, to help asthma patients achieve better control
Basel, May 30, 2019 – Novartis today announced the first study results from the phase III PLATINUM clinical development program assessing the safety and efficacy of QMF149, an investigational, once-daily, fixed dose combination asthma treatment containing indacaterol acetate (IND – a long acting beta agonist [LABA]) and mometasone furoate (MF – an anti-inflammatory [ICS]).
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase III QUARTZ study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02892344), once-daily, low dose IND/MF (QMF149) 150/80 Mu g met the primary and key secondary endpoints (trough FEV1 and ACQ-7 score at Week 12, respectively) when compared to once-daily mometasone furoate (MF), an ICS, delivered via the Twisthaler® device (200 Mu g) in both adult and adolescent patients with asthma[1].
Patients included in the QUARTZ study were inadequately controlled (symptomatic as defined by Asthma Control Questionnaire, ACQ-7>1.5) on low dose ICS (with or without an additional maintenance treatment)[1].
“Despite the number of available treatments, many patients’ lives remain impacted by their asthma,” said Linda Armstrong, MD, Respiratory Development Unit Head. “The QMF149 results of the QUARTZ study complement the recently presented phase II data of QVM149 at the 2019 American Thoracic Society Congress, showing superiority of QVM149 to the current standard of care. We look forward to seeing the rest of the data from the PLATINUM clinical trial program.”
IND/MF demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function as measured by trough FEV1 (volume of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath, which is measured approximately 24 hours after the last administration of study drug) compared to MF after 12 weeks of treatment in adult and adolescent patients with inadequately controlled asthma [Least squares (LS) mean treatment difference: 0.182 L, 95% CI: 0.148, 0.217; p < 0.001][1]. In addition, clinically meaningful lung function benefit for IND/MF is supported by improvements in evening PEF of 26.1 L/min compared to MF alone (95% CI, 21.0, 31.2).
IND/MF also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in asthma control compared with MF, as measured by ACQ-7 after 12 weeks of treatment (LS mean treatment difference: -0.218, 95% CI: -0.293, -0.143; p < 0.001)[1]. In addition, clinically meaningful improvement in ACQ-7 is supported by a responder analysis, in which the QMF149 group had a greater proportion of responders (improvement in ACQ-7 >=0.5) compared to the MF group (74.7% vs 64.9%, respectively (odd ratio: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.33).
Both treatments (IND/MF and MF) were generally well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was lower in the IND/MF group compared with the MF group (32.3% vs. 38.3%, respectively). The majority of AEs in both treatment groups were mild to moderate (>90% AEs) in severity, and were comparable between the treatment groups. The incidence of severe AEs was low and were reported in 7 (1.8%) patients in the QMF149 group compared with 14 (3.5%) patients in the MF group[1].
“I am very pleased with the results of the QUARTZ study looking at the efficacy and safety of the fixed dose combination of indacaterol and mometasone furoate,” Dr Oliver Kornmann, Pulmonary Department, Internal Medicine, University Hospital Mainz, Germany. “Fixed-dose combination inhalers may offer advantages to people with asthma by simplifying complex inhaler regimens, especially when they can be dosed once daily which can therefore further reduce the burden of the disease.”
Efficacy and safety data from this study have been submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. Study results of all primary and secondary endpoints can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02892344?term=NCT02892344&rank=1) and EUdraCT (Number: 2016-000472-22). The regulatory submissions for IND/MF and IND/GLY/MF have recently been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
About QMF149 (indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate,)
The combination of indacaterol acetate and mometasone furoate (IND/MF) is currently in development for the treatment of inadequately controlled asthma (who remain symptomatic despite current treatment) and the regulatory submission of this investigational once daily inhaled combination treatment has recently been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). It combines the bronchodilation of the ultra-LABA indacaterol acetate (a long acting beta agonist [LABA]) with the anti-inflammatory mometasone furoate (an ICS) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered with the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in QMF149.
About QVM149 (indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate)
The combination of indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate (IND/GLY/MF) is currently in development for the treatment of inadequately controlled asthma patients (who remain symptomatic despite current treatment with LABA/ICS) and the regulatory submission of this investigational once daily inhaled combination treatment has recently been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This formulation combines comprehensive bronchodilation of indacaterol acetate (a LABA [long-acting beta agonist]) and glycopyrronium bromide (a LAMA [long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists]) with mometasone furoate (high- or medium-dose ICS [inhaled corticosteroid]) in a precise once-daily formulation, delivered with the dose-confirming Breezhaler® device. Glycopyrronium bromide and certain use and formulation intellectual property were exclusively licensed to Novartis in April 2005 by Sosei Heptares and Vectura. Mometasone furoate is exclusively licensed to Novartis from a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA, for use in QVM149 (Worldwide excluding US).
About the QUARTZ Study[1]
The QUARTZ Study is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, 12-week treatment, double-blind study to assess the efficacy and safety of indacaterol acetate/mometasone furoate (QMF149) (150/80 Mu g) compared with mometasone furoate (MF) (200 Mu g) delivered via the Twisthaler® device in adult and adolescent patients with asthma.
All patients were required to be on a stable dose of low ICS (with or without LABA) for at least 1 month prior to entering into the run-in period. During the run-in period, all patients received open-label fluticasone propionate 100 Mu g twice-daily delivered via Accuhaler. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria at the end of the run-in period were equally randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment groups (IND/MF 150/80 Mu g once daily delivered via delivered with the dose-confirming Breezhaler® inhalation device, or MF 200 Mu g once daily, delivered via Twisthaler®.
802 male and female patients (including 64 adolescents, aged >= 12 to < 18 years old) were randomized to receive IND/MF (n=398) or MF (n=404). The mean age was 45.6 years with a mean duration of asthma of 14.0 years.
Mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (% predicted of normal) was 75.1% at baseline and the mean FEV1 reversibility after inhalation of short acting beta agonist was 20.7%. The majority of patients were treated with low dose ICS (42.9%) or low dose LABA/ICS (56.0%) prior to the study.
Spirometry was performed at the end of the treatment period. The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of IND/MF 150/80 Mu g once daily (in the evening) compared with MF 200 Mu g once daily in terms of trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment in adults and adolescents. The key secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of IND/MF 150/80 Mu g to MF 200 Mu g (once daily) in terms of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-7 after 12 weeks of treatment.

 The P-III IMpower150 study results: OS (19.2 vs 14.7 mos.); no new safety signals are observed
 Tecentriq is a mAb targeting PD-L1 expressing tumor cells when combined with bevacizumab + CT enhances its ability to restore anti-cancer immunity to combat 1L advanced NSCLC","Data show this new option can help some metastatic NSCLC patients live significantly longer1 

MISSISSAUGA, ON, May 29, 2019 /CNW/ – Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) announced today that Health Canada has approved TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab) in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumour aberrations, and no prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.2
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in Canada and remains one of the leading causes of death from cancer as it is often diagnosed in the most advanced and aggressive stages of the disease.3, 4 NSCLC accounts for approximately 80-85% of all lung cancer cases in Canada,5 and is comprised of squamous cell and non-squamous carcinomas. Non-squamous lung cancer includes lung adenocarcinoma and large cell lung cancer, and makes up around 55% of all NSCLCs.6 The estimated five-year survival rate for patients with metastatic NSCLC is 2-13%.7
“Immunotherapies like TECENTRIQ represent a cornerstone in lung cancer treatment, and are crucial to providing personalized treatment approaches for many patients,” says Dr. Mark Vincent, Medical Oncologist. “Clinical data support this combination as a first-line therapy that can extend survival for certain lung cancer patients.”
This approval is based on results from the Phase III IMpower150 study, which showed that TECENTRIQ in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) helped people live significantly longer, compared with bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone (median overall survival [OS] was 19.2 versus 14.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] was 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64–0.96; p=0.0164) in the intention-to-treat wild-type (ITT-WT) population.8
“There is a high unmet need in lung cancer. The Canadian Cancer Statistics indicate that approximately half are diagnosed at stage 4, a late stage,”9 says Shem Singh, Executive Director, Lung Cancer Canada. “With this approval, Canadians living with NSCLC now have another first-line treatment option to fight the disease. It is important we continue to push forward additional research in lung cancer to increase survivorship and improve quality of life for patients and their families.”
About the IMpower150 study10
IMpower150 is a multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TECENTRIQ in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) with or without bevacizumab in people with stage IV or recurrent metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who had not been treated with chemotherapy for their advanced disease. A total of 1,202 people were enrolled and randomized (1:1:1) to receive:

TECENTRIQ plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (Arm A), or 

TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (Arm B), or 

Bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (Arm C, control arm)
The co-primary endpoints comparing Arms B and C were investigator-assessed OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in the ITT-WT subpopulation. Key secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed PFS, OS and safety in the ITT population.
The safety profile of the TECENTRIQ combination therapy was consistent with that observed in previous studies.11 The most common adverse reactions in people receiving the TECENTRIQ combination therapy were: nausea (39.2%), fatigue (33.1%), diarrhea (32.1%), anemia (29.3%), constipation (29.8%), decreased appetite (28.8%), arthralgia (26.2%), neuropathy peripheral (23.7%), asthenia (20.6%), cough (19.6%), vomiting (18.6%), pyrexia (18.6%), neutropenia (18.6%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (16.5%), rash (16.5%), platelet count decreased (14.0%), dyspnea (13.5%), stomatitis (13.0%), hypomagnesemia (13.0%), pruritus (12.7%), neutrophil count decreased (12.2%), back pain (12.2%), hypothyroidism (11.5%), musculoskeletal pain (10.9%), and febrile neutropenia (10.2%).12
About the TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab combination
There is a strong scientific rationale to support the use of TECENTRIQ plus bevacizumab in combination. The TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab regimen may enhance the potential of the immune system to combat first-line advanced NSCLC.13 Bevacizumab, in addition to its established anti-angiogenic effects, may further enhance TECENTRIQ’s ability to restore anti-cancer immunity, by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) related immunosuppression, promoting T cell tumour infiltration and enabling priming and activation of T cell responses against tumour antigens.14
TECENTRIQ is a monoclonal antibody designed to directly bind to PD-L1 expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells.15 This blocks the interactions of PD-L1 with other cell-surface receptors which regulate the activation or suppression of T cells, a type of white blood cell that protects the body from infection and disease, including cancer.16, 17

 Stellarex .035 is a low-dose drug-coated balloon intended to restore and maintain blood flow in diseased femoral and popliteal arteries featuring EnduraCoat Technology and has received FDA’s approval in the US and CE marking in Europe","Stellarex is the only low-dose [1] drug-coated balloon (DCB) to demonstrate a significant treatment effect and high safety profile through 3 years 
ILLUMENATE Pivotal trial showcases durable primary patency (maintained blood flow) in the most complex patient pool studied in a DCB randomized clinical trial
No significant difference in mortality compared to standard of care through three years

Amsterdam, the Netherlands and New Orleans, U.S. – Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG; AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, today announced the three-year results from the ILLUMENATE Pivotal trial and the ILLUMENATE European randomized clinical trial (EU RCT).
These two trials are part of a series of five trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Stellarex .035″ low-dose [1] DCB to restore and maintain blood flow in the superficial femoral artery and popliteal arteries of patients with peripheral arterial disease. The results were evaluated compared to treatment with uncoated balloons, the current standard of care.
 
S. Jay Mathews, M.D., of Bradenton Cardiology Center in Bradenton, Florida, U.S., presented the data today as a late-breaking trial at the New Cardiovascular Horizons (NCVH19) Annual Conference, and highlighted the following results:
 
The ILLUMENATE Pivotal trial results show that at 36 months, 64.2% of the patients treated with Stellarex maintained blood flow through the treated segment of the diseased artery, compared to 51.0% of the patients treated with an uncoated balloon, demonstrating continued durability of the procedure.
The ILLUMENATE Pivotal patient pool was the most complex studied in a randomized clinical trial. The pool included patients with the highest rates of comorbidities, such as diabetes and renal insufficiency, while 43.9% also had severely calcified lesions.
The ILLUMENATE EU RCT results show that at 36 months, 67.5% of the patients treated with Stellarex maintained blood flow (assessed through blinded core-lab adjudicated patency), compared to 59.9% of the patients treated with an uncoated balloon.
Through three years, both studies showed no significant difference in mortality compared to treatment with uncoated balloons. The mortality rate of patients treated with Stellarex in the ILLUMENATE Pivotal trial was 10.1%, compared to the mortality rate of patients treated with an uncoated balloon of 11.0%. The EU RCT showed mortality rates of 9.4% for patients treated with Stellarex, compared to 8.5%for patients treated with an uncoated balloon.
 
“The three year data of the ILLUMENATE Pivotal trial and ILLUMENATE EU RCT add to the robust and consistent multi-year data of the Stellarex program,” said S. Jay Mathews, M.D. “The demonstrated durability of Stellarex in the complex patient pool of the ILLUMENATE Pivotal trial, which are patients that are at high risk for restenosis, a recurring blockage, is unique in the industry. Moreover, we continue to see no significant difference in mortality rates between patients treated with Stellarex and those treated with uncoated balloons, which confirms our confidence in the safety profile of Stellarex.”

Bert van Meurs

Chief Business Leader, Image Guided Therapy at Royal Philips


“We are committed to providing clinically proven image-guided therapy solutions that enhance the procedure and positively impact patient outcomes,” said Bert van Meurs, Chief Business Leader, Image Guided Therapy at Royal Philips. “Stellarex is the only low-dose drug-coated balloon with a proven treatment effect at three years compared to the existing standard-of-care in the U.S. and Europe. The combination with our interventional imaging systems, such as the successful Azurion platform, our recently-introduced IntraSight intravascular diagnostic application platform, and associated services, enables clinicians to decide, guide, treat and confirm the appropriate peripheral vascular treatment.”
 
The announcement of the three-year results from the ILLUMENATE Pivotal trial and the ILLUMENATE EU RCT follows the release in January 2019 of the most recent pooled analysis of patient-level data of over 2,300 patients treated with Philips’ Stellarex DCB in above-the-knee (ATK) studies, which reinforced the strong safety profile of Stellarex.
 
The Stellarex .035 DCB is designed to restore and maintain blood flow in diseased femoral and popliteal arteries, and is FDA approved in the US and CE marked in Europe. Stellarex is unlike any other drug coated balloon in the industry for the treatment of peripheral artery disease as it features the EnduraCoat Technology, a unique coating consisting of polyethylene glycol as the base material, the so-called ‘excipient’, and a combination of amorphous and crystalline paclitaxel particles dispersed in it. EnduraCoat provides efficient drug transfer, effective drug residency with high coating durability and minimal particulate loss, and therefore enables a low therapeutic drug dose.

 The SelectSite C304-HIS facilitates placement of the Medtronic’s SelectSecure MRI SureScan Model 3830 cardiac pacing lead, placed near/at the bundle of His using Purkinje conduction system of the heart to restore the heart’s normal rhythm","Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance and commercial launch for the SelectSite(TM) C304-HIS deflectable catheter system for use in procedures involving His-bundle pacing (HBP).
The SelectSite C304-HIS deflectable catheter system features a deflectable, out-of-plane curve to reach the bundle of His and is designed to enable enhanced range maneuverability, fixation and implant success for a wider range of patient anatomies. Its adjustable form helps accommodate and secure the pacing lead in more challenging anatomies, including patients with a large right atrium.
“Pacing at the bundle of His is a promising procedure with a growing body of clinical evidence,” said Pugazhendhi Vijayaraman, M.D., director of electrophysiology at Geisinger Heart Institute in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. “The C304-HIS catheter’s adjustable curve design should help implanters reach the His bundle fibers more easily and accommodate a variety of patient anatomies.”
The new catheter system facilitates placement of the Medtronic SelectSecure(TM) MRI SureScan(TM) Model 3830 cardiac pacing lead, the only pacing lead on the U.S. market approved for HBP. His-bundle pacing is a physiologic alternative to right ventricular pacing, in which a pacing lead is placed at or near the bundle of His, using the heart’s native His-Purkinje conduction system to restore the heart’s normal rhythm.
“There is a growing trend of physicians interested in His-bundle pacing for certain patients as it leverages the native conduction system,” said Rob Kowal, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer, vice president of medical affairs in the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “Medtronic is pleased to continue to lead the industry with product innovations and training to support this emerging therapy technique.”

15035,ï»¿Janssen Reports Results of Darzalex (daratumumab) in P-III MAIA Study for Patients with Multiple Myeloma Ineligible for ASCT,"DARZALEX® (daratumumab) Phase 3 MAIA Study Results, Published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Show Combination Therapy Increases Progression-Free Survival in Newly Diagnosed Patients with Multiple Myeloma Who are Transplant Ineligible","The P-III MAIA study results involve assessing of Darzalex + lenalidomide + dexamethasone (Rd) vs Rd in 737 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ineligible for high-dose CT & ASCT aged 45-90 yrs.
 The P-III MAIA study results: reduction in risk of disease progression (44%); ORR (92.9% vs 81.3%); CR (47.6% vs 24.9%); MRD-negative (24.2% vs 7.3%)
 Darzalex is an Ab targeting CD38, inhibiting the tumor cell growth and has received FDA’s approval in Nov’15 as monothx. & in combination with Rd in Nov’16 for multiple myeloma prior treated with 3L & 1L therapy respectively","ARITAN, N.J., May 29, 2019 — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced the publication of data from the randomized, open-label Phase 3 MAIA (MMY3008) study that showed DARZALEX® (daratumumab) plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) resulted in a significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).1 These data were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.
“We continue to see scientific evidence through Phase 3 studies that support the use of daratumumab in combination with standard of care regimens,” said Thierry Facon, M.D., Service des Maladies du Sang, Hôpital Claude Huriez, Lille, France, MAIA investigator and author of the study. “As multiple myeloma can become more complex at each relapse, it is important to select an optimal upfront therapy. Results from the MAIA study suggest that this daratumumab combination therapy should be considered for patients with multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible upon diagnosis.”
Results from the MAIA study demonstrated that at a median follow-up of 28 months, DARZALEX, in combination with Rd, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 44 percent in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for ASCT, compared to treatment with Rd alone (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-0.73; p<0.001).1 The median PFS for DARZALEX-Rd has not yet been reached, compared to 31.9 months for patients who received Rd alone.1 The overall response rate (ORR) was 92.9 percent in the DARZALEX-Rd arm versus 81.3 percent in the Rd arm (p<0.001).1 The addition of DARZALEX resulted in near-doubling of complete response (CR) or better (47.6 percent vs. 24.9 percent).1 In the MAIA study, treatment with DARZALEX-Rd resulted in a greater than threefold rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity compared to Rd alone (24.2 percent vs. 7.3 percent).1 All patients with MRD-negative status also had a response of CR or better.1 Patients who achieved MRD negativity demonstrated longer PFS than patients who remained MRD-positive, regardless of study treatment.1
The safety of DARZALEX in combination with Rd in this patient population was consistent with previously reported studies.1 The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) (>10 percent) in the DARZALEX-Rd arm compared to Rd alone were neutropenia (50.0 percent vs. 35.3 percent), lymphopenia (15.1 percent vs. 10.7 percent), pneumonia (13.7 percent vs. 7.9 percent), anemia (11.8 vs. 19.7 percent) and leukopenia (11.0 percent vs. 4.9 percent), respectively.1 AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were less frequent in the DARZALEX-Rd group than with Rd alone (7.1 percent vs. 15.9 percent, respectively), despite the higher rate of neutropenia and pneumonia in the DARZALEX-Rd arm.1 There were fewer patients who discontinued the study treatment due to infections in DARZALEX-Rd versus Rd alone (0.5 percent vs. 1.4 percent, respectively).1 DARZALEX-associated infusion-related reactions (IRR) were reported in 40.9 percent of patients (2.7 percent were Grade 3 or 4); there were no Grade 5 events.1 One patient discontinued treatment with DARZALEX after an IRR.1
“The MAIA study findings demonstrate a consistent and clinically meaningful treatment effect when DARZALEX is incorporated into standard backbone regimens, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, for the initial treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible,” said Craig Tendler, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We have submitted applications to global health authorities in support of the MAIA data and look forward to working with regulators in the hope of bringing a new combination regimen to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma.”
About the MAIA Trial1
The randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study included 737 newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT aged 45 – 90 years old (median age of 73). Patients were randomized to receive either DARZALEX-Rd or Rd alone in 28-day cycles. In the DARZALEX-Rd treatment arm, patients received DARZALEX 16 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) IV weekly for cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for cycles 3 – 6 and every 4 weeks for cycle 7 and thereafter. Patients in the DARZALEX-Rd and Rd treatment arms received 25 mg of lenalidomide on days 1 – 21 of each 28-day cycle, and dexamethasone at 40 mg once a week for each cycle. Patients in both treatment arms continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
About DARZALEX® (daratumumab) 
DARZALEX® (daratumumab), the first CD38-directed antibody approved anywhere in the world, is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma.2 CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.3 DARZALEX binds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth causing myeloma cell death.2 DARZALEX may also have an effect on normal cells.2 DARZALEX is being evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development program across a range of treatment settings in multiple myeloma, such as in frontline and relapsed settings.4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess its potential in other malignant and pre-malignant hematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as smoldering myeloma.12,13
In the U.S., DARZALEX received initial FDA approval in November 2015 as a monotherapy for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent, or who are double refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.14 DARZALEX received additional approvals in November 2016 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.15 In June 2017, DARZALEX received approval in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a PI.16 Most recently, in May 2018, DARZALEX received approval in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for ASCT, making it the first monoclonal antibody approved for newly diagnosed patients with this disease.17
In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. entered into a global license and development agreement with Genmab A/S, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize DARZALEX.18 For the full U.S. Prescribing Information, please visit www.DARZALEX.com.
About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.19,20 When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow.19,20 In 2019, it is estimated that 32,110 people will be diagnosed, and 12,960 will die from the disease, in the U.S.21 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.22
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION2
CONTRAINDICATIONS
DARZALEX® is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infusion Reactions – DARZALEX® can cause severe and/or serious infusion reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials, approximately half of all patients experienced an infusion reaction. Most infusion reactions occurred during the first infusion and were grade 1-2. Infusion reactions can also occur with subsequent infusions. Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4 hours of completing an infusion. Prior to the introduction of post-infusion medication in clinical trials, infusion reactions occurred up to 48 hours after infusion. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension.
Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion.
To reduce the risk of delayed infusion reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX® infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Interference with Serological Testing – Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion.
Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX®. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX®.
Neutropenia – DARZALEX® may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer’s prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. DARZALEX® dose delay may be required to allow recovery of neutrophils. No dose reduction of DARZALEX® is recommended. Consider supportive care with growth factors.
Thrombocytopenia – DARZALEX® may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer’s prescribing information for background therapies. DARZALEX® dose delay may be required to allow recovery of platelets. No dose reduction of DARZALEX® is recommended. Consider supportive care with transfusions.
Interference with Determination of Complete Response – Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
Adverse Reactions – The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) in clinical trials were: infusion reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, muscle spasms, arthralgia, back pain, pyrexia, chills, dizziness, insomnia, cough, dyspnea, peripheral edema, peripheral sensory neuropathy and upper respiratory tract infection.

 The focus of the collaboration is to expand Sumitomo’s diabetes portfolio in Japan and is expected to generate annual revenue of ~$1.8M
 Equa (50mg) is an oral DPP-4 inhibitor, inhibiting glucagon secretion by increasing the conc. of GLP-1. EquMet is a combination of DPP-4 inhibitor and biguanide, effectively lowers blood sugar level by stimulating insulin secretion & improving insulin resistance","Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Osaka, Japan; Representative Director, President and CEO: Hiroshi Nomura; hereinafter “Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma”) today signed a co-promotion and sales collaboration agreement with Novartis Pharma K.K. (Head Office: Tokyo, Japan; Representative Director, President and CEO: Kazunari Tunaba; hereinafter “NPKK”) for Equa® 50mg tablets (generic name: vildagliptin; hereinafter “Equa”), a selective DPP-4 inhibitor, and EquMet® combination LD/HD tablets (generic name: vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride combination tablets; hereinafter “EquMet”), a selective DPP-4 inhibitor/biguanide combination agent, both of which are currently indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan.
With the execution of this agreement, starting from July 1, 2019, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will jointly carry out activities to promote Equa and EquMet to healthcare professionals in Japan, in concert with NPKK. Additionally, from November 1, 2019, while the two companies will continue co-promotion, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will become the sole distributor of Equa and EquMet, receiving supplies of both products from NPKK.
Equa is a selective DPP-4 inhibitor that increases the concentration of active GLP-1, which enhances insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. EquMet was launched as the first selective DPP-4 inhibitor/biguanide combination tablets launched in the Japanese market. The combined sales of the two drugs were approximately ¥50.0 billion in fiscal 2018 (NHI price base).
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma positions diabetes as one of its focus areas in the Japanese market, and currently commercializes several drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, each with different mechanisms of action. Through the execution of this agreement, Equa and EquMet can now be added to its lineup, helping Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma strive contributing to the treatment of a greater number of diabetes patients in Japan. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will make upfront payment under the terms of the agreement. It will record payments received from NPKK for the promotion of these products as revenue from July 1, 2019, and the sales of these products as revenue from November 1, 2019.
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma is currently evaluating the potential impact of this agreement on business results for the fiscal year ending March 2020 and will promptly announce any material information requiring disclosure. Financial goals for fiscal 2022, which were announced in conjunction with the Mid- 2 term Business Plan in April 2019, include consideration of a certain amount of contribution from marketing alliances. In addition, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma expects that the agreement announced today will contribute to the attainment of the annual revenue goal of ¥200 billion during the period of the next Mid-term Business Plan (fiscal 2023—2027).
【About Equa】 Equa is a DPP-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (including any oral hypoglycemic or insulin preparation) that, by increasing the concentration of active GLP-1, stimulates the secretion of insulin and inhibits glucagon secretion to enable effective long-term control of blood sugar levels. The product was launched by NPKK in Japan on April 16, 2010 as Equa® 50mg tablets. On a drug price basis, sales in 2018 were ¥24.9 billion.
【About EquMet】 EquMet was the first DPP-4 inhibitor and biguanide combination agent launched in Japan that demonstrated effective lowering of blood sugar levels, combining a DPP-4 inhibitor to stimulate insulin secretion with biguanide to improve insulin resistance through separate mechanisms. The product was launched by NPKK in Japan in November 2015 as EquMet® compound tablets LD/HD. On a drug price basis, sales in 2018 were ¥25.1 billion.

15050,ï»¿Roche and GE Healthcare Launch NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0 for Personalized Treatment Decision in Cancer Care,Roche and GE Healthcare launch NAVIFY Tumor Board with medical imaging capabilities to enable more personalised treatment decisions in cancer care,"The NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0 with medical imaging capabilities brings a personalized treatment in patients with cancer with its initial availability in the US & Canada
 The tumor board enables radiologists to upload their patient records to the same dashboard where the patient’s previous treatment details are stored, helping the clinicians to have a quick review of all relevant files and to choose the best treatment for each cancer patient
 The NAVIFY tumor board is a web-based cancer care team workflow tool, presenting data in a dashboard and standardizes processes to encourage collaboration on patient treatment decisions","Radiologists can now upload their patient records to the same dashboard as patient files from other disciplines
First collaboration product enables tumour boards to have a more comprehensive view of each patient in one place
Important step in Roche’s personalised healthcare strategy to fit treatments to patients who can benefit most from a specific therapy
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today the release of NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0, the first collaboration product from our partnership with GE Healthcare. Incorporating medical image viewing and storage capabilities with other patient data, the product enables tumour boards – multi-disciplinary teams who determine treatment plans for cancer patients – to have a more comprehensive view of each patient in one place.
Bringing together patient medical records from various systems for review by tumour boards can be time-consuming and cumbersome. The integration of GE Healthcare’s medical image viewer into NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0 enables radiologists to upload their patient records to the same dashboard where patient files from other disciplines in the cancer care team are stored. Having complete patient diagnostic information in one location helps specialists use the limited time they have during tumour boards to review all relevant files quickly and align on the best possible treatment plan for each cancer patient.
“This new version of NAVIFY Tumor Board is the first product developed in partnership with GE Healthcare and demonstrates our shared vision of accelerating personalised healthcare,” said Michael Heuer, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Our mutual focus is on delivering clinical decision support solutions that enable healthcare professionals to make faster, more confident decisions, allowing more personalized treatment based on truly integrated diagnostics.”
“We are delighted to announce the first major milestone of our ongoing collaboration with Roche, as we work together to enable precision healthcare. Workflows around tumour boards can be inefficient, and we hope this single, holistic dashboard – including patient data and images – will enable oncology teams to align more quickly on the most optimal diagnosis and treatment plan for the benefit of each patient,” said Tom McGuinness, President and CEO, GE Healthcare Imaging.
The partnership combines Roche expertise in advanced lab testing and the GE Healthcare leadership in medical imaging and monitoring to provide an ecosystem of workflow solutions and apps on an industry-first shared integrated diagnostics platform. The companies are aiming to design products to enable seamless integration and analysis of comprehensive lab and medical imaging data, patient records, medical best practice, real time monitoring and the latest research outcomes. Clinicians will then have confidence that they are making the best possible treatment decision for each patient.
The new version of NAVIFY Tumor Board is initially available in the United States and Canada with additional markets to follow in the near future.

Survival Benefit Now Observed with KEYTRUDA in Combination with Chemotherapy in All Patient Populations (Regardless of PD-L1 Expression) and with KEYTRUDA Monotherapy in Patients Whose Tumors Expressed PD-L1 at CPS ≥1

Data Presented Today at 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of the final analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Abstract #6000). Data include the first-time presentation of certain overall survival (OS) hypotheses from the KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy study arm based on PD-L1 expression and the KEYTRUDA monotherapy study arm in the total patient population. Results of an interim analysis were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2018 Congress and demonstrated superior OS outcomes for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in the total population and KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥20 and CPS ≥1 compared with the EXTREME regimen, the current standard of care.
“It is exciting to see the full results from this trial, which is the first study to show superior overall survival over the current standard of care known as the EXTREME regimen,” said Dr. Danny Rischin, director of the department of medical oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia. “Patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer have a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. These findings underscore the potential of KEYTRUDA monotherapy and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy to become important new treatment options.”
The new findings presented today from the final analysis showed that KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin plus 5-FU) reduced the risk of death by 40% in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with CPS≥20, demonstrating significantly longer OS (14.7 months [95% CI, 10.3-19.3]) compared with the EXTREME regimen (cetuximab with carboplatin or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]), the current standard of care (11.0 months [95% CI, 9.2-13.0]) (HR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.45-0.82]; p=0.0004). For the dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), statistical significance was not achieved for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in the CPS≥20 population compared with the EXTREME regimen (HR=0.73 [95% CI, 0.55-.97]; p=0.0162). New findings for the CPS ≥1 population showed KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by 35% in these patients, with significantly longer OS (13.6 months [95% CI, 10.7-15.5]) compared with the EXTREME regimen (10.4 months [95% CI, 9.1-11.7]) (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.80]; p<0.0001). Per the sequential testing strategy, superiority for PFS was not tested in this population (HR=0.82 [95% CI, 0.67-1.00]). Results for OS with KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population were consistent with the previously presented interim analysis, where non-inferiority was demonstrated (HR=0.83 [95% CI, 0.70-0.99]; p=0.0199), with a median OS of 11.5 months (95% CI, 10.3-13.4) for KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population compared with 10.7 months (95% CI, 9.3-11.7) for the EXTREME regimen. There was no difference in PFS between KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population and the EXTREME regimen (HR=1.34 [95% CI, 1.13-1.59]).
“As a company, Merck is committed to advancing research in this challenging treatment setting through our expansive head and neck cancer clinical research program,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “The full data from KEYNOTE-048 illustrate the impact of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy as potential new first-line treatment options for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We would like to sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their involvement in KEYNOTE-048.”
As previously announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for a new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking approval for KEYTRUDA as monotherapy or in combination with platinum and 5-FU chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC based in part on data from the second interim analysis of KEYNOTE-048. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of June 10, 2019.
Study Design and Additional Data from KEYNOTE-048 (Abstract #6000)
KEYNOTE-048, a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02358031), evaluated KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy or KEYTRUDA monotherapy, compared with the EXTREME regimen, as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. The dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS. The secondary endpoints were PFS (at six months and 12 months), objective response rate (ORR) and time to deterioration in the Quality of Life Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scales of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire and Safety. Duration of response (DOR) was evaluated as part of a pre-specified exploratory analysis. The primary and secondary endpoints, as well as exploratory DOR analysis, were evaluated in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥20 and CPS ≥1) and in the total population, based on a fixed sequential testing strategy. Data cutoff for the final analysis was Feb. 25, 2019; data cutoff for the previously presented second interim analysis was June 13, 2018. Details of the OS benefit observed at the final analysis are below:

The median DOR was 7.1 months (range, 2.1+ to 39.0+) for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with CPS ≥20 compared with 4.2 months (range, 1.2+ to 31.5+) for the EXTREME regimen. The median DOR was 6.7 months (range, 1.6+ to 39.0+) for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with CPS ≥1 compared with 4.3 months (range, 1.2+ to 31.5+) for the EXTREME regimen.
In the KEYTRUDA monotherapy arm, an analysis of the total patient population showed an ORR of 16.9% compared with 36.0% for the EXTREME regimen; the median DOR was 22.6 months (range, 1.5+ to 43.0+) compared with 4.5 months (range, 1.2+ to 38.7+) for the EXTREME regimen.
As previously reported, there were no new safety concerns identified with the use of KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-048. Grade 3-5 all-cause adverse events occurred in 54.7%, 85.1% and 83.3% of patients in the KEYTRUDA monotherapy, KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and EXTREME regimen arms, respectively. Adverse events resulting in discontinuation occurred in 12.0%, 32.6% and 27.5% of patients in the KEYTRUDA monotherapy, KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and EXTREME regimen arms, respectively. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 1.0%, 4.0% and 2.8% of patients in the KEYTRUDA monotherapy, KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and EXTREME regimen arms, respectively. Grade 3-5 immune-mediated or infusion reactions occurred in 7.0%, 5.4% and 10.5% of patients in the KEYTRUDA monotherapy, KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and EXTREME regimen arms, respectively.

About Head and Neck Cancer
Head and neck cancer describes a number of different tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that begin in the flat, squamous cells that make up the thin surface layer of the structures in the head and neck. Two substances that greatly increase the risk of developing head and neck cancer are tobacco and alcohol. It is estimated that there were more than 887,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and over 453,000 deaths from the disease worldwide in 2018. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated that there will be more than 65,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and over 14,000 deaths from the disease in 2019.
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%).
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis, or Hepatoxicity (in Combination With Axitinib)
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Hepatotoxicity (in Combination With Axitinib)
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST were seen in 20% and 13% of patients, respectively. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used in monotherapy. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.
Adverse Reactions
In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).
In KEYNOTE-054, KEYTRUDA was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 509 patients; the most common (≥1%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse reaction (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA was diarrhea (28%).

U.S. FDA grants Priority Review for daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone as treatment for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplant
September 26, 2019 PDUFA date
Copenhagen, Denmark; May 30, 2019 – Genmab A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: GEN) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) granted a Priority Review for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the use of daratumumab (DARZALEX®) in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) as treatment for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). The sBLA was submitted by Genmab’s licensing partner, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), in March 2019. Priority Review is a U.S. FDA designation for drugs that treat a serious condition and may provide a significant improvement in safety or efficacy. The U.S. FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date of September 26, 2019 to take a decision on daratumumab in this indication. In August 2012, Genmab granted Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab.
The sBLA submission is based on data from the Phase III CASSIOPEIA study of daratumumab in combination with VTd as treatment for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are candidates for ASCT. The study is sponsored by the French Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) in collaboration with the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) and Janssen. Genmab announced topline results from the trial in October 2018 and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) accepted an abstract containing more complete data, submitted by Janssen, for oral presentation at the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting in June 2019.
“Thanks to the strong collaborative effort of IFM, HOVON and Janssen, should the U.S. FDA approve this sBLA, patients in the United States newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are eligible candidates for ASCT may one day also be able to include DARZALEX in combination with VTd in their treatment regimen,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.
About the CASSIOPEIA (MMY3006) study
This Phase III study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study, run by the French Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) in collaboration with the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) and Janssen, including 1,085 newly diagnosed patients with previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma who are eligible for high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. In the first part of the study, patients were randomized to receive induction and consolidation treatment with daratumumab combined with bortezomib, thalidomide (an immunomodulatory agent) and dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) or bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone alone. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that achieve a stringent Complete Response (sCR). In the second part of the study, patients that achieved a response will undergo a second randomization to either receive maintenance treatment of daratumumab 16 mg/kg every 8 weeks for up to 2 years versus no further treatment (observation). The primary endpoint of this part of the study is progression free survival (PFS).
About multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excess proliferation of plasma cells.1 Multiple myeloma is the third most common blood cancer in the U.S., after leukemia and lymphoma.2 Approximately 26,000 new patients were expected to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and approximately 13,650 people were expected to die from the disease in the U.S. in 2018.3 Globally, it was estimated that 160,000 people were diagnosed and 106,000 died from the disease in 2018.4 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms at all, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms which can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.5
About DARZALEX® (daratumumab)
DARZALEX® (daratumumab) intravenous infusion is indicated in the United States in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI); and as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent, or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.6 DARZALEX is the first monoclonal antibody (mAb) to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) approval to treat multiple myeloma. DARZALEX is indicated in Europe in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; and as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a PI and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. The option to split the first infusion of DARZALEX over two consecutive days has been approved in both Europe and the U.S. In Japan, DARZALEX is approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. DARZALEX is the first human CD38 monoclonal antibody to reach the market in the United Stated, Europe and Japan. For more information, visit www.DARZALEX.com.
Daratumumab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the CD38 molecule, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. Daratumumab triggers a person’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells, resulting in rapid tumor cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action and through immunomodulatory effects, in addition to direct tumor cell death, via apoptosis (programmed cell death).6,7,8,9,10
Daratumumab is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. under an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab from Genmab. A comprehensive clinical development program for daratumumab is ongoing, including multiple Phase III studies in smoldering, relapsed and frontline multiple myeloma settings and in amyloidosis. Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess the potential of daratumumab in other malignant and pre-malignant diseases, such as NKT-cell lymphoma, B and T-ALL. Daratumumab has received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations

15137,Novartis Reports Results of Xolair (omalizumab) in Two P-III Studies for Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps in Adults,Xolair (omalizumab) significantly reduced nasal polyps and congestion symptoms in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in two phase III studies,"The P-III POLYP 1 & POLYP 2 studies results involve assessing of Xolair (SC, q2w/q4w) vs PBO in 138 & 127 patients with CRSwNP with inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids respectively
 The P-III POLYP 1 & POLYP 2 studies resulted in meeting its 1EPs & 2EPs, i.e, change in Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) & Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) @24wks. and is well tolerated
 Xolair is a biologic targeting IgE resulted in reducing the amount of free IgE and is approved in 90+ countries including the US & EU for moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma, jointly developed & promoted by Novartis & Genentech in the US","In the phase III POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 studies, omalizumab met both co-primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) with inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids[1]
Omalizumab demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous research for approved conditions of chronic spontaneous urticaria and severe allergic asthma[1]
CRSwNP impacts up to 4 percent of people worldwide, and the prevalence increases with age[2]
 
Basel, June 3, 2019 – Novartis today announced positive topline data from two phase III, multicenter studies evaluating omalizumab (Xolair®) for the treatment of adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who have not adequately responded to standard-of-care (intranasal corticosteroids). Omalizumab, an injectable biologic treatment designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE), met both co-primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints across both POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 phase III trials[1].
CRSwNP is the inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with the presence of nasal polyps on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity[3],[4],[5].
The co-primary endpoints of POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 were change from baseline in Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) and change from baseline in average daily Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) over 24 weeks[6],[7]. Omalizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in both of these co-primary outcomes[1]. Key secondary endpoints met include Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) for health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) for sense of smell, posterior and anterior rhinorrhea scores for post-nasal drip and runny nose respectively[1].
“We are very pleased with the initial outcomes from the POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 trials. This is an important and exciting milestone for Xolair, which continues to help thousands of people around the world with severe allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria,” said John Tsai, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “The results from these pivotal studies provide further evidence of the role of IgE in several inflammatory and respiratory conditions. Xolair reduces the amount of free IgE and in this study substantially reduced the size of nasal polyps and associated symptoms that impact the quality of life for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.”
In the studies, omalizumab was generally well tolerated with overall adverse events rates comparable to those observed in previous phase III trials in patients with moderate and severe allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria[1].
“Although the disease is not visible, people with nasal polyps may have significantly impaired quality of life – especially those with asthma who have increased nasal obstruction and loss sense of smell, which can impact the them physically, socially and mentally,” said Professor Claus Bachert, Upper Airways Research Laboratory, Clinics ENT-Department, University Hospital Ghent, Belgium. “The results of these studies are an important step forward to improving the lives of these patients.”
Additional findings and detailed results of co-primary and secondary endpoints from these trials will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.
About Xolair® (omalizumab)
Xolair (omalizumab) is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimizes the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.
An injectable prescription medicine, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005. Xolair is approved for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair has over one million patient years of exposure. In addition, a liquid formulation of Xolair in pre-filled syringes has been approved in the EU and more than 10 countries outside of the EU, including Canada, the US, and Australia. The self-administration indication for Xolair in pre-filled syringes was also approved in the EU in 2018. In the US., Novartis and Genentech, Inc. work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Outside the US, Novartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs.
Xolair is being investigated for the treatment of adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) but is not approved in this indication anywhere in the world.
About POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 
POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 are replicate phase III studies designed to determine the efficacy and safety of omalizumab compared with placebo in adult patients with CRSwNP who have had an inadequate response to standard-of-care treatment. Both trials were randomized, multicenter, double-blind and placebo-controlled. POLYP 1 involved 138 patients and POLYP 2 involved 127 patients, with and without a history of surgery. The primary outcomes for both trials were change from baseline in average daily nasal congestion score at Week 24, and change from baseline in nasal polyp score to week 24. Patients in the studies were administered either omalizumab or placebo by subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks[6],[7].
About Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP)
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is the inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with the presence of noncancerous lesions (nasal polyps) on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity[3],[4],[5]. It is possible to have a single polyp or several and the size of the polyps can vary from microscopic to several centimeters[8],[9]. Symptoms can include nasal blockage/obstruction, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure and reduction in or loss of smell[4]. CRSwNP is diagnosed by physical examination with endoscopy. The condition can be associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis and aspirin sensitivity[10].

Paris – June 2, 2019 – Pivotal Phase 3 ICARIA-MM trial results demonstrated that
isatuximab added to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (isatuximab combination
therapy) showed statistically significant improvements compared to pomalidomide and
dexamethasone (pom-dex) alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
(RRMM).
These findings were presented today at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago. Isatuximab is an investigational monoclonal antibody
that targets a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor of a plasma cell.
“Isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in an
impressive 40% reduction in the risk of progression or death compared to
pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone,” said Paul Richardson, MD, principal
investigator and clinical program leader and director of clinical research at the
Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “This
outcome is noteworthy because this trial included a particularly difficult-to-treat,
relapsed and refractory patient population that was, in my view, highly reflective
of real-world practice.”
Isatuximab combination therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in
progression free survival (HR 0.596, 95% CI 0.44-0.81, p=0.001), and the median
progression free survival was longer in the isatuximab combination therapy arm (11.53
months, 95% CI: 8.936 to 13.897) than pom-dex alone (6.47 months, 95% CI: 4.468 to
8.279).
Also of note, isatuximab combination therapy demonstrated a significantly greater overall
response rate, compared to pom-dex alone (60% vs. 35%, p<0.0001). In additional
analyses, isatuximab combination therapy compared to pom-dex alone showed a
treatment benefit consistent across multiple subgroups, including patients 75 years and
older, patients with renal insufficiency, and patients who were refractory to lenalidomide.
The results presented above were based on an independent review committee
assessment.
In addition, the following results favored isatuximab combination therapy:
 Isatuximab combination therapy demonstrated significantly higher very good
partial response (VGPR) rate compared to pom-dex (31.8% vs. 8.5%,
respectively, p<0.0001) and a longer duration of response compared to pom-dex
alone (median 13.27 months vs. 11.07 months, respectively). Among patients who
achieved a response, isatuximab combination therapy demonstrated faster
median time to first response compared to pom-dex alone (35 days vs. 58 days,
respectively).
 Time to next treatment was longer with isatuximab combination therapy compared
to pom-dex alone (median not reached vs. 9.1 months, HR=0.538).
 Data at the time of analysis showed a trend towards an overall survival benefit
associated with isatuximab combination therapy. Final data on overall survival will
be reported when available.
Adverse events (AEs) of Grade ≥3 were observed in 86.8% of isatuximab combination
therapy patients vs. 70.5% of pom-dex patients. Additionally, isatuximab combination
therapy compared to pom-dex showed: 7.2% vs. 12.8% of patients discontinued due to
AEs, respectively; 7.9% vs. 9.4% patients died due to AEs, respectively; infections of
Grade ≥3 were seen in 42.8% vs. 30.2% of patients, respectively; and Grade ≥3
neutropenia was seen in 84.9% (febrile 11.8%) vs. 70.1% (febrile 2.0%) of patients,
respectively. Infusion reactions were reported in 38.2% (2.6% grade 3-4) of isatuximab
combination therapy patients.
First Positive Phase 3 Trial of a Monoclonal Antibody in Combination with PomDex
ICARIA-MM is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multi-center trial evaluating
isatuximab in combination with pom-dex versus pom-dex alone in patients with RRMM.
The study enrolled 307 patients with RRMM across 96 centers spanning 24 countries.
Overall, patients had received a median of three prior lines of anti-myeloma therapies,
including at least two consecutive cycles of lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor
given alone or in combination.
During the trial, isatuximab was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of
10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks, then every other week for 28-day cycles in
combination with standard doses of pom-dex for the duration of treatment.
Topline results from ICARIA-MM were previously announced in February 2019.
Developing Isatuximab, a Monoclonal Antibody
Isatuximab is an investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting a specific epitope
on the CD38 receptor. It is designed to trigger multiple, distinct mechanisms of action that
are believed to directly promote programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and
immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on multiple myeloma
cells and is a cell surface receptor target for antibody-based therapeutics in multiple
myeloma and other malignancies. The clinical significance of these findings is under
investigation.
Isatuximab is being developed by Sanofi and is currently being evaluated in multiple
ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with currently available treatments across
the multiple myeloma treatment continuum.
In the second quarter of 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for
review the Marketing Authorization Application and Sanofi filed a Biologics License
Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), both for use of isatuximab
in combination with pom-dex for the treatment of certain patients with RRMM.
Isatuximab is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic
malignancies and solid tumors. Isatuximab is an investigational agent and its safety and
efficacy have not been evaluated by the U.S. FDA, the EMA, or any other regulatory
authority.
Multiple Myeloma Leads to Significant Disease Burden
Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy1
, affecting more
than 138,0002 people worldwide. Multiple myeloma results in significant disease burden.
Patients with multiple myeloma continue to relapse over time making it a difficult to treat
and incurable malignancy.

15164,ï»¿Novartis Reports Result of Kisqali (ribociclib) + Endocrine Therapy in P-III MONALEESA-7 Study for HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer #ASCO2019,Novartis Kisqali significantly extends life in women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer in MONALEESA-7 trial,"The P-III MONALEESA-7 study results involves assessing of Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy (goserelin + aromatase inhibitor/tamoxifen) vs endocrine therapy as monothx. in pre- and perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer
 The P-III MONALEESA-7 study resulted in improving survival rate @42mos. (70.2% vs 46.0%), 30%/20.9% reduction in risk of death, no new safety signals were observed, presented at ASCO 2019 respectively
 Kisqali is the CDK4/6 inhibitor, currently evaluated in P-III NATALEE study with endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- early breast cancer and is approved in 75+ countries including the US & EU for the same indication","Kisqali is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to show superior overall survival in advanced breast cancer (HR=0.712; p=0.00973)[1]
After a median of 42 months follow-up, the survival rate was 70.2% for women who received Kisqali combination therapy compared to 46.0% for women who received endocrine therapy alone[1]
Advanced breast cancer in premenopausal women is the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59 years old[2],[3]
MONALEESA-7 overall survival results will be presented as a late-breaker at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting and will be published in The New England Journal of Medicine
Basel, June 1, 2019 – Novartis today announced statistically significant overall survival (OS) results for Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy[1]. The Phase 3 MONALEESA-7 trial evaluated Kisqali plus endocrine therapy (goserelin plus either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen) as initial treatment compared to endocrine therapy alone in pre- and perimenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer[1]. MONALEESA-7 overall survival results will be featured in a press briefing today, presented as a late-breaker at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Abstract# LBA1008), and will be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
 
The significant extension in survival met the early efficacy stopping criteria at a pre-specified interim analysis following 192 deaths (median OS, not reached vs. 40.9 [95% CI: 37.8-NE] months; HR=0.712 [0.535-0.948]; p=0.00973). Overall survival rates in the intent-to-treat population (n=672) at 42 months were 70.2% for Kisqali combination therapy compared to 46.0% for endocrine therapy alone. At the time of data cut-off, 35% of women taking Kisqali combination therapy were continuing the treatment. No new safety signals were observed[1]. Kisqali is not indicated for use with tamoxifen.
“Overall survival benefit is considered the ‘gold standard’ in cancer trials but is challenging to achieve in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. MONALEESA-7 reached this important endpoint earlier than anticipated,” said Sara Hurvitz, MD, Medical Director of the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Research Unit and Director of the Breast Cancer Clinical Trials Program at UCLA. “Impactful results like these ribociclib findings are what we wish for in every clinical trial, and to achieve overall survival improvement in an incurable disease, like metastatic breast cancer, is truly an outstanding advancement for patients.”
Susanne Schaffert, Ph.D., CEO, Novartis Oncology, added, “Kisqali is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to achieve statistically significant overall survival benefit in combination with endocrine therapy, and we are so proud to share these powerful data with the medical and patient community. These exciting results add to the proven efficacy and safety profile of Kisqali, solidify it as a standard of care for people living with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and inspire us to continue to reimagine medicine.”
Results from subgroup analyses showed that Kisqali plus an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated a 30.0% reduced risk of death compared to an aromatase inhibitor alone (median OS not reached vs. 40.7 months [37.4-NE]; HR=0.699 [0.501-0.976]), and Kisqali plus tamoxifen demonstrated a 20.9% reduced risk of death compared to tamoxifen alone (HR=0.791 [0.454-1.377])[1]. Kisqali is not indicated for use with tamoxifen. In the MONALEESA-7 primary analysis, increase in QTcF was on average greater and equal to 10 milliseconds in people taking tamoxifen plus placebo compared those taking aromatase inhibitor and placebo[4].
“Kisqali has characteristics that make it distinct from other CDK4/6 inhibitors. For one, Kisqali shows especially strong inhibition against CDK4. In pre-clinical data, Kisqali is four- to five-fold more potent against CDK4 compared to CDK6. CDK4 is likely the dominant CDK in breast cancer and a pivotal driver of disease progression,” said Jeff Engelman, MD, Global Head of Oncology Research, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research.
MJ DeCoteau, Executive Director of Rethink Breast Cancer, said, “Younger women living with advanced breast cancer encounter unique challenges as they face an incurable illness at the prime of their lives – they may be students, new moms or just embarking on their careers. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59, so knowing an approved treatment has been proven to help them live longer is an outstanding advancement and provides new hope for women with this devastating disease.”
About Kisqali® (ribociclib)
Kisqali® (ribociclib) is the CDK4/6 inhibitor with the largest body of first-line clinical trial evidence demonstrating consistent and sustained efficacy compared to endocrine therapy alone[5]. Kisqali is the only targeted therapy, including CDK4/6 inhibitors, in combination with endocrine therapy to demonstrate significantly longer overall survival compared to endocrine therapy alone as initial endocrine-based treatment for advanced breast cancer in the MONALEESA-7 trial[5]. Overall survival follow-up is ongoing for the Phase III MONALEESA-2 and MONALEESA-3 trials.
Novartis is continuing to reimagine cancer by investigating Kisqali in early breast cancer. The NATALEE study is a Phase III clinical trial of Kisqali with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- early breast cancer being conducted in collaboration with Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO)[5].
Kisqali is approved for use in more than 75 countries around the world, including the United States and European Union member states. Kisqali was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 and by the European Commission (EC) in August 2017, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor was approved for the treatment of pre-, peri- or postmenopausal women as initial endocrine based therapy, and also indicated for use in combination with fulvestrant as both first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal women by the FDA in July 2018 and by the EC in December 2018. Regulatory filings are underway with other health authorities worldwide[5].
Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals[5].

We’ve taken a bold approach to our research by including patient populations often neglected in clinical trials, identifying new pathways or mutations that may play a role in disease progression and developing therapies that not only maintain, but also improve, quality of life for patients. Our priority over the past 30 years and today is to deliver treatments proven to improve and extend lives for those diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.
Important Safety Information FROM THE KISQALI EU SmPC 
KISQALI® (ribociclib) is a prescription medicine approved in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine – based therapy in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer or fulvestrant as initial endocrine – based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It is not known if KISQALI is safe and effective in children or adolescents. KISQALI can cause a heart problem known as QT prolongation. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and may lead to death. KISQALI is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen due to an increased risk of QT prolongation. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a change in their heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if they feel dizzy or faint. KISQALI can cause serious liver problems. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they get any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen), and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking KISQALI and may result in infections that may be severe. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before taking KISQALI, patients should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as KISQALI can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant and who take KISQALI should use highly effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of KISQALI. Do not breastfeed during treatment with KISQALI and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of KISQALI. Patients should tell their health care provider about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements since they may interact with KISQALI. Patients should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking KISQALI. The most common side effects (incidence >=20%) include infections, white blood cell count decreases, headache, cough, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, hair loss and rash. The most common Grade 3/4 side effects (incidence >5%) were infections, low neutrophils, low leukocytes, low red blood cells, abnormal liver function tests, low lymphocytes, low phosphate levels and vomiting. Abnormalities were observed in hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests.

Additional Novartis lung cancer research presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2019 Annual Meeting include Phase III CANOPY clinical trial designs, evaluating canakinumab (ACZ885) monotherapy in patients with mid- to late-stage NSCLC 
Basel, June 3, 2019 – Novartis announced today new data and clinical trial updates in NSCLC at the ASCO 2019 Annual Meeting. This includes primary efficacy results from the GEOMETRY mono-1 Phase II clinical trial demonstrating that investigational MET inhibitor capmatinib (INC280) shows promise as a potential treatment option for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that harbor MET exon-14 skipping mutation. There are currently no approved targeted therapies to treat this particularly aggressive form of NSCLC. Results of the Phase II study will be presented at an oral session today at ASCO, June 3, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. CDT (Abstract #9004)[1].
GEOMETRY mono-1 is an international, prospective, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating 97 adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon-14 skipping mutation who received capmatinib tablets 400 mg orally twice daily. Primary efficacy results among treatment-naive patients (Cohort 5b: 28 patients) were a 68% overall response rate (ORR) based on the Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) assessment per RECIST v1.1 (95% CI: (47.6 – 84.1)). Forty-one percent of previously treated NSCLC patients (Cohort 4: 69 patients) also responded (95% CI: (28.9 – 53.1)). Data on median duration of response (DOR), a key secondary endpoint, was 11.14 months (95% CI: (5.55 – NE)) and 9.72 months (95% CI: (5.55 – 12.98)), respectively. Intracranial activity in 54% (n=7/13) of patients, including some cases of complete resolution of brain lesions, was also observed by ad hoc neuro-radiologist review in patients with brain lesions. All results were based on independent assessment by the BIRC, and all tumor CT scans were evaluated in parallel by two radiologists to confirm the response.
The most common treatment related adverse events (AE) (>=10% all grades) across all cohorts (n=334), were peripheral edema (42%), nausea (33%), creatinine increase (20%), vomiting (19%), fatigue (14%), decreased appetite (13%) and diarrhea (11%); the majority of the AEs were grades 1/2.
“New lung cancer treatment options are critical, as this deadly disease affects more than 2 million new patients around the world each year,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “The GEOMETRY mono-1 results are encouraging, and we look forward to discussing these results with health authorities with the hope of bringing this targeted treatment option to people with this aggressive type of lung cancer.”
Capmatinib Granted Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designation Status
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently granted capmatinib Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon-14 skipping mutation with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Previously, both the U.S. FDA and Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency recognized capmatinib with Orphan Drug status. It is estimated that 3% to 4% of all patients with NSCLC have an identified MET mutation[3].
“The efficacy observed with capmatinib in the GEOMETRY mono-1 trial is promising,” said Juergen Wolf, MD, University Hospital, Cologne. “In addition to positive overall response rate among first-line patients with the MET mutation, the duration for the responses, including the activity in the brain, and capmatinib’s safety profile are important milestones for this patient population. As a group, patients with MET mutated NSCLC often require special clinical considerations, as they are generally older and with poor prognosis further limiting their treatment options.”
About GEOMETRY mono-1 
GEOMETRY mono-1 is an international, prospective, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent capmatinib (INC280) in adult patients with EGFR wildtype, ALK-negative rearrangement, advanced NSCLC harboring MET amplification and/or mutations. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon-14 skipping mutation (centrally confirmed) were assigned to Cohorts 4 (previously treated patients) or 5B (treatment-naive), regardless of MET amplification/gene copy number, and received 400 mg capmatinib tablets orally twice daily. The primary endpoint was ORR based on the BIRC assessment per RECIST v1.1. The key secondary endpoint was duration of response (DOR) by the BIRC. The GEOMETRY mono-1 study found an ORR in the treatment-naive patients (n=28) of 67.9% (95% CI: 47.6 – 84.1) and an ORR of 40.6% (95% CI: 28.9 – 53.1) in the previously treated patients (n=69). Median DOR was 11.14 months (95% CI: 5.55-NE) in treatment-naive patients and 9.72 months (95% CI: 5.55-12.98) in previously treated patients[1].
The most common treatment-related AEs included peripheral edema, nausea, creatinine increase and vomiting. Of patients treated with capmatinib, 84% experienced an AE, with 36% having grade 3/4 AEs (only 4.5% were Grade 4)[1].
Capmatinib (INC280) is an investigational, oral and selective MET inhibitor licensed to Novartis by Incyte Corporation in 2009. Under the Agreement, Incyte granted Novartis worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications.
Studying Tumor-Promoting Inflammation in Lung Cancer – Ongoing CANOPY Trials
Trials in Progress (TiP) updates on the CANOPY clinical program were also included in the ASCO updates. CANOPY is made up of three randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase III trials evaluating canakinumab (ACZ885), a selective IL-1ß inhibitor (Abstract #TPS9124) [4],[5].

CANOPY-A is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of canakinumab as adjuvant therapy in adult subjects with stages II-IIIA and NSCLC following complete surgical resection. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (Abstract #7013).
CANOPY-1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study investigating canakinumab versus placebo in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (CTx) and pembrolizumab in previously untreated patients with stage IIIB/IIC-IV squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. The study will evaluate the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 42 days of treatment, as well as PFS and overall survival (OS).
CANOPY-2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study investigating canakinumab or placebo plus docetaxel in stage IIIB-IV NSCLC patients previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, as well as CTx. The primary endpoints are incidence of DLT in the first 42 days of treatment and OS.
Novartis Commitment to Lung Cancer
Worldwide, lung cancer causes more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined, and more than 2 million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year[2]. Despite treatment advances, patients with NSCLC still have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. This includes the nearly 70% of NSCLC patients who have a genomic mutation that may be targeted with available therapies[6]. To determine the most appropriate treatment, medical organizations recommend genomic testing for patients with lung cancer[7].
Novartis Oncology’s research has helped transform treatment approaches for patients living with NSCLC. Novartis continues its commitment to the global lung cancer community through ongoing studies, as well as the exploration of investigational compounds in NSCLC, including those that target genetic biomarkers and tumor promoting inflammation.

 The P-III SOLO3 study results: improvement in ORR (72.2% vs 51.4%); PFS (13.4 mos. vs 9.2mos.); safe & tolerable, presented at ASCO 2019
 Lynparza is a PARP inhibitor, targeted for DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, including BRCA mutations and has received approval in 64 & 38 countries as a maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer & 1L gBRCAm HER2- metastatic breast cancer respectively","In the phase III POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 studies, omalizumab met both co-primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) with inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids[1]
Omalizumab demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous research for approved conditions of chronic spontaneous urticaria and severe allergic asthma[1]
CRSwNP impacts up to 4 percent of people worldwide, and the prevalence increases with age[2]
 
Basel, June 3, 2019 – Novartis today announced positive topline data from two phase III, multicenter studies evaluating omalizumab (Xolair®) for the treatment of adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who have not adequately responded to standard-of-care (intranasal corticosteroids). Omalizumab, an injectable biologic treatment designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE), met both co-primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints across both POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 phase III trials[1].
CRSwNP is the inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with the presence of nasal polyps on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity[3],[4],[5].
The co-primary endpoints of POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 were change from baseline in Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) and change from baseline in average daily Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) over 24 weeks[6],[7]. Omalizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in both of these co-primary outcomes[1]. Key secondary endpoints met include Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) for health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) for sense of smell, posterior and anterior rhinorrhea scores for post-nasal drip and runny nose respectively[1].
“We are very pleased with the initial outcomes from the POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 trials. This is an important and exciting milestone for Xolair, which continues to help thousands of people around the world with severe allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria,” said John Tsai, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “The results from these pivotal studies provide further evidence of the role of IgE in several inflammatory and respiratory conditions. Xolair reduces the amount of free IgE and in this study substantially reduced the size of nasal polyps and associated symptoms that impact the quality of life for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.”
In the studies, omalizumab was generally well tolerated with overall adverse events rates comparable to those observed in previous phase III trials in patients with moderate and severe allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria[1].
“Although the disease is not visible, people with nasal polyps may have significantly impaired quality of life – especially those with asthma who have increased nasal obstruction and loss sense of smell, which can impact the them physically, socially and mentally,” said Professor Claus Bachert, Upper Airways Research Laboratory, Clinics ENT-Department, University Hospital Ghent, Belgium. “The results of these studies are an important step forward to improving the lives of these patients.”
Additional findings and detailed results of co-primary and secondary endpoints from these trials will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.
About Xolair® (omalizumab)
Xolair (omalizumab) is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimizes the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.
An injectable prescription medicine, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005. Xolair is approved for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair has over one million patient years of exposure. In addition, a liquid formulation of Xolair in pre-filled syringes has been approved in the EU and more than 10 countries outside of the EU, including Canada, the US, and Australia. The self-administration indication for Xolair in pre-filled syringes was also approved in the EU in 2018. In the US., Novartis and Genentech, Inc. work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Outside the US, Novartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs.
Xolair is being investigated for the treatment of adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) but is not approved in this indication anywhere in the world.
About POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 
POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 are replicate phase III studies designed to determine the efficacy and safety of omalizumab compared with placebo in adult patients with CRSwNP who have had an inadequate response to standard-of-care treatment. Both trials were randomized, multicenter, double-blind and placebo-controlled. POLYP 1 involved 138 patients and POLYP 2 involved 127 patients, with and without a history of surgery. The primary outcomes for both trials were change from baseline in average daily nasal congestion score at Week 24, and change from baseline in nasal polyp score to week 24. Patients in the studies were administered either omalizumab or placebo by subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks[6],[7].
About Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP)
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is the inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with the presence of noncancerous lesions (nasal polyps) on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity[3],[4],[5]. It is possible to have a single polyp or several and the size of the polyps can vary from microscopic to several centimeters[8],[9]. Symptoms can include nasal blockage/obstruction, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure and reduction in or loss of smell[4]. CRSwNP is diagnosed by physical examination with endoscopy. The condition can be associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis and aspirin sensitivity[10].

 The P-III ASPECT-NP study results demonstrated that Zerbaxa is superior to meropenem for 28-day all-cause mortality (24% vs 25.3%), clinical response at Test-of-Cure (54.4% vs 53.3%)
 Zerbaxa is a combination therapy of anti-bacterial & beta-lactamase inhibitor, act by reducing the development of drug-resistant bacteria and has received FDA’s Priority Review designation for preventing infection by susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms","Approval Based on Results of Phase 3 Trial Evaluating Critically Ill Patients with Pneumonia; 100% of Patients Were on Mechanical Ventilation

Monday, June 3, 2019 4:55 pm EDT
KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Merck’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of ZERBAXA® (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for the treatment of patients 18 years and older with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. The sNDA for ZERBAXA had previously been designated Priority Review status by the FDA. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.
This expanded use is based on results of the pivotal Phase 3 ASPECT-NP trial that compared ZERBAXA 3g (ceftolozane 2g and tazobactam 1g) intravenously every 8 hours to meropenem (1g intravenously every 8 hours) for 8 to 14 days for the treatment of adult patients with HABP/VABP.
ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to the components of ZERBAXA (ceftolozane/tazobactam), piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Additionally, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. See Important Safety Information below.
“Pneumonia in ventilated patients remains a significant clinical challenge and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality,” said Dr. Andrew Shorr, head of pulmonary, critical care and respiratory services, Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, D.C. “The need to cover diverse pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and certain Enterobacteriaceae adds to the challenge.”
According to a recent publication by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Consortium, ventilated patients with HABP have a higher rate of mortality (39%) than those with VABP (27%). In addition, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common Gram-negative pathogen in HABP/VABP and is becoming increasingly difficult to treat.
“We are grateful to all of the patients who participated in the studies which led to the approval of ZERBAXA for the treatment of HABP/VABP,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “This approval reflects Merck’s longstanding commitment to helping alleviate the burden of infectious diseases, including serious infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens.”
Clinical Data Supporting Use of ZERBAXA (Ceftolozane and Tazobactam) in HABP/VABP
A total of 726 adult patients hospitalized with HABP/VABP were enrolled in a multinational, double-blind study (NCT 02070757) comparing ZERBAXA 3g (ceftolozane 2g and tazobactam 1g) intravenously every 8 hours to meropenem (1g intravenously every 8 hours) for 8 to 14 days of therapy. All patients had to be intubated and on mechanical ventilation at randomization.
Efficacy was assessed based on all-cause mortality at Day 28 and clinical cure, defined as complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit which occurred 7 to 14 days after the end of treatment. The analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients.
Of the 726 patients in the ITT population, the median age was 62 years and 44% of the population was greater than or equal to 65 years of age, with 22% of the population greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The majority of patients were white (83%), male (71%) and were from Eastern Europe (64%). The median APACHE II score was 17 and 33% of patients had a baseline APACHE II score of greater than or equal to 20. All patients were on mechanical ventilation and 519 (71%) had VABP. At randomization, the majority of patients had been hospitalized for greater than or equal to 5 days (77%) and were in an ICU (92%), with 49% of patients ventilated for greater than or equal to 5 days. At baseline, 36% of patients had creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 80 mL/min. Of these, 14% had CrCl less than 50 mL/min.
Approximately 13% of patients were failing their current antibacterial drug therapy for HABP/VABP, and bacteremia was present at baseline in 15% of patients. Key comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at rates of 22%, 16% and 12%, respectively.
ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) was non-inferior to meropenem for 28-day all-cause mortality in the ITT population (all randomized patients), 24.0% (87/362) and 25.3% (92/364) respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 1.1 (stratified 95% CI: -5.13, 7.39; non-inferiority margin of 10%). In addition, ZERBAXA was non-inferior to meropenem for clinical response at Test-of-Cure (7-14 days after the end of therapy) in the ITT population, 54.4% (197/362) and 53.3% (194/364) respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 1.1 (stratified 95% CI: -6.17, 8.29; non-inferiority margin of 12.5%).
In the ventilated HABP sub-group, a favorable response for ZERBAXA in 28-day all-cause mortality was observed, 24.2% (24/99) for ZERBAXA and 37.0% (40/108) for meropenem, respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 12.8 (stratified 95% CI: 0.18, 24.75). In the VABP subgroup, 28-day all-cause mortality was 24.0% (63/263) for ZERBAXA and 20.3% (52/256) for meropenem, for a weighted proportion difference of -3.6 (stratified 95% CI: -10.74, 3.52).
Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or greater of patients receiving ZERBAXA in this study include hepatic transaminase increased 11.9% (43/361), renal impairment/renal failure 8.9% (32/361), diarrhea 6.4% (23/361), intracranial hemorrhage 4.4% (16/361), vomiting 3.3% (12/361), and Clostridium difficile colitis 2.8% (10/361). Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 1.1% (4/361) of patients receiving ZERBAXA and 1.4% (5/359) of patients receiving meropenem.
Additional Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam)
Patients with changing renal function: Dose adjustment is required for patients with CrCl 50 mL/min or less. All doses of ZERBAXA are administered over 1 hour. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly.
Hypersensitivity: ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to the components of ZERBAXA (ceftolozane/tazobactam), piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.
Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible.
Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Prescribing ZERBAXA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and risks the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients. in the HABP/VABP trial were increase in hepatic transaminases (11.9%), renal impairment/renal failure (8.9%) and diarrhea (6.4%).
About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam)
ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium.
ZERBAXA 3g dose (ceftolozane 2g and tazobactam 1g) is approved in the United States and is indicated for treatment of patients 18 years and older with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens.
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

15212,British Columbia Expands Use of Biosimilars to Explore Treatment Options,B.C. expands use of biosimilars to offer coverage for more treatment options,"BC decided to switch from reference product to biosimilars within 6 months, for patients suffering from diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis
 Post Nov 25,2019 PharmaCare, a publicly funded national drug coverage program will no longer be providing coverage for the biologic products excluding some exceptional cases and patients receiving Enbrel, Remicade and Lantus will switch to Eticovo, Renflexis and Basaglar respectively
 BC plans to save $96.6B in first three years and the decision is in practice with the listing of Jardiance and Taltz drug for diabetes and psoriatic arthritis respectively","British Columbia is improving the sustainability of its PharmaCare program by expanding the use of biosimilars, which will create opportunities for new drug listings and boost existing coverage for patients.
An immediate effect of this is the listing of Jardiance, a diabetes drug, as well as the psoriatic arthritis drug Taltz.
B.C. is following evidence-based results from a number of international jurisdictions that have over 10 years’ experience with these innovative drugs.
“B.C. is leading the country by promoting the widespread use of biosimilars, which have been proven to work just as safely and effectively as higher priced biologics. To date, Canada is far behind European jurisdictions,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Biosimilars are a necessary step to ensure PharmaCare provides existing coverage for more people and funds new drugs well into the future.”
Despite clear evidence to support the use of biosimilars – highly similar versions of biologics that cost anywhere from 25% to 50% less – Canada has a significantly lower use rate for biosimilars compared to other jurisdictions, at approximately 8%. Other nations have upwards of 50 to 95%.
Bioengineered drugs, known as biologics, collectively are the single biggest expense for public drug plans and their costs continue to climb. In 2018, B.C. spent $125 million on Lantus, Enbrel and Remicade, three biologic drugs that treat chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis and Crohn’s disease.
About 20,400 British Columbians living with either ankylosing spondylitis, diabetes, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis will have six months to work with their health-care team to transition their prescription from the biologic to the biosimilar drug by Nov. 25, 2019. After that time, PharmaCare will no longer provide coverage for the original biologic drug for these indications, except for exceptional cases.
“We know that our use rates can be much higher. For example, the biosimilars for infliximab (known as Inflectra and Remsima) have combined 5 to 10% use rate in Canada after four years on the market, compared to Norway (98%), United Kingdom (90%) and Scotland (85%). As a result, in 2017, Canada spent over $1.1 billion on the original biologic drug called Remicade,” added Dix.
B.C. consulted with a number of stakeholders on the transition to biosimilars and received support from prescribers and patient groups, such as the rheumatologists, the BC Society of Rheumatologists, endocrinologists, Doctors of BC, Arthritis Consumer Experts, Arthritis Society, BC Pharmacy Association, Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association, regional health authorities, Health Canada, CADTH, Patented Prices Medicine Review Board and the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance.
Roughly 2,700 Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis patients will also be transitioning to their biosimilar treatment option in the coming months. More information for gastroenterology patients will be available in summer 2019.
After the six-month transition period, PharmaCare will no longer provide coverage for the original biologic drug for these indications. By increasing the use of biosimilars, B.C. will save about $96.6 million over the first three years which will be redirected to support additional drug listings and improved patient coverage.
Effective May 27, Jardiance (empagliflozin) is now listed as a limited coverage benefit under PharmaCare. Jardiance is a type of drug known as an SGLT2 inhibitor and has been shown to be an effective treatment option to manage diabetes. Approximately 22,000 patients could stand to benefit from this listing, which will cost roughly $4.1 million this fiscal year and $18.9 million over three years.
The psoriatic arthritis drug Taltz (ixekizumab) is being added as a limited coverage benefit, and coverage criteria will be expanded for existing arthritis drugs to improve patient access. More information about improved coverage criteria is available on the PharmaCare website. These changes will help more British Columbians living with arthritis to find the treatment option that works best for them.
PharmaCare will also be broadening coverage for several drugs used for arthritis (i.e., DMARDs, certolizumab, leflunomide, rituximab, tocilizumab, and tofacitinib). These changes will improve patient access to these important medicines by, for example, reducing coverage pre-requirements and extending the coverage periods.
This is the latest major change to improve access to prescription drugs for British Columbians. In January 2019, B.C. made a $105-million investment over three years to reduce and/or eliminate deductibles and co-payments for lower-income British Columbians. This was the first change in the Fair Pharmacare deductible structure in 15 years.
As well, B.C. held a leading role in the national Generics 2.0 agreement to lower costs of the most commonly prescribed drugs, and actively participates in the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance to negotiate for lower drug costs for all Canadians. British Columbia will continue to work to make sure everyone can afford and receive the medication they need.
Quick Facts:

B.C.’s move to biosimilars will focus on patients in the following therapeutic areas:
Rheumatology patients will transition from the entanercept biologic Enbrel to the biosimilar Brenzys or Erelzi;
Dermatology and rheumatology patients will transition from the infliximab biologic Remicade to the biosimilar Inflectra or Renflexis;
Endocrinology patients will transition from insulin glargine biologic Lantus to the biosimilar Basaglar; and
Gastrointestinal patients will transition from the infliximab biologic Remicade to the biosimilar Inflectra or Renflexis, with more information to come in the coming months.
Exceptions may be granted for patients whose physicians determine they are medically unable to transition to the biosimilar drug. Exceptional coverage requests will be reviewed by PharmaCare’s Special Authority branch on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with physician-led advisory committees as needed.
First Nations Health Authority clients should consult with their health-care team, as PharmaCare coverage under the First Nations Health Benefits (Plan W) may differ.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BC.jpg,Biosimilars|Biotech,British Columbia,0,Biosimilars|Biotech|Expand|Explore|Options|Treatment|Use,publish,27/5/2019,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/b-c-expands-use-of-biosimilars-to-offer-coverage-for-more-treatment-options/,https://pharmashots.com/15212/british-columbia-to-expand-use-of-biosimilars-to-explore-treatment-options/

15243,Roche Reports Results of Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) in P-III BLOCKSTONE Study for the Prevention of Influenza,Phase III study showed Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) is effective at preventing influenza infection,"The P-III BLOCKSTONE study results involves assessing of Xofluza vs PBO in children & adults diagnosed with influenza, confirmed by rapid influenza diagnostic test in Japan
 The P-III BLOCKSTONE study results: household members infected with flu (1.9% vs 13.6%); well tolerated; no new signals are observed; conducted by Shionogi
 Xofluza is oral therapy to treat influenza in both healthy people with flu & at high risk of flu, evaluated in CAPSTONE-1 & 2 study respectively and is approved in Japan & US with its expected FDA’s approval for the treatment of flu in patients with asthma, chronic lung disease, morbid obesity and heart disease by Nov 04, 2019","Compared with placebo, Xofluza treatment significantly reduced the likelihood of people developing influenza (flu) after exposure to an infected household member
Data from the phase III BLOCKSTONE study will be submitted to health authorities globally
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the phase III BLOCKSTONE study, conducted by Shionogi & Co., Ltd., met its primary endpoint showing that people exposed to a household member with influenza (flu) and treated preventively with Xofluza™ (baloxavir marboxil) were significantly less likely to develop the disease compared to those treated with placebo (1.9% versus 13.6%, p<0.0001). Furthermore, Xofluza was well tolerated with no safety signals identified. Full results from the BLOCKSTONE study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
“This positive phase III study adds to robust existing clinical data for Xofluza, and is the first to show that a single treatment with Xofluza reduced the likelihood that people living with an infected household member would develop flu,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Preventing otherwise healthy people from developing the flu virus will reduce the overall societal burden of disease, and we look forward to sharing these data with health authorities around the world.”
Xofluza is the first and only one-dose oral medicine approved to treat flu, and the first new flu medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action in nearly 20 years. Xofluza is also the only flu treatment with a new mechanism of action shown to be efficacious in both otherwise healthy people with the flu (in the CAPSTONE-1 study), and people at high risk of flu complications (in the CAPSTONE-2 study).1,2
Xofluza is currently approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza types A and B in children, adolescents and adults, and in the United States (US) for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in people 12 years of age and older. In addition, the FDA recently accepted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Xofluza as a one-dose oral treatment for people at high risk of complications from the flu, which includes adults 65 years of age or older, or those who have conditions such as asthma, chronic lung disease, morbid obesity or heart disease – for these people the flu can be particularly serious or deadly. The FDA is expected to decide on whether to approve this additional indication by 4 November 2019.

About BLOCKSTONE
BLOCKSTONE is a phase III, randomised, placebo-controlled, post-exposure prophylaxis study that evaluated a single dose of Xofluza compared with placebo in household members (adults and children) in Japan who are living with someone with an influenza infection confirmed by a rapid influenza diagnostic test (the ‘index patient’). The study was conducted by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. during the 2018-2019 flu season in Japan.
Participants enrolled in the study were household members of someone who had been diagnosed with influenza. The participants were randomised to receive a single dose of Xofluza (dose according to body weight) or placebo as a preventive measure against developing influenza. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the proportion of participants who tested positive for the influenza virus and had fever, and one or more respiratory symptoms between day one and ten.
Xofluza showed a significant prophylactic effect on influenza infection after a single oral dose in people exposed to an infected family member. The proportion of household members who became infected with flu was significantly lower in those treated preventively with Xofluza compared to those treated with placebo (proportion of subjects with influenza virus infection, fever and other influenza symptoms in the 10-day observation period: 1.9% versus 13.6%, p<0.0001). The incidence of adverse events was 22.2% and 20.5% in Xofluza and placebo respectively. No serious adverse events were reported for Xofluza. Secondary objectives were clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety and tolerability.

About XofluzaTM (baloxavir marboxil)
Xofluza is a first-in-class, one-dose oral medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action that has demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of influenza viruses, including in vitro activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1) in non-clinical studies.3,4 Unlike other currently available antiviral treatments, Xofluza is the first in a new class of antivirals designed to inhibit the cap-dependent endonuclease protein, which is essential for viral replication.3
Xofluza is being further studied in a phase III development programme, including paediatric populations and severely ill, hospitalised people with influenza, as well as to assess the potential to reduce transmission in otherwise healthy people.
Xofluza was discovered by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and is being further developed and commercialised globally in collaboration with the Roche Group (which includes Genentech in the US) and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Under the terms of this agreement, Roche holds worldwide rights to Xofluza excluding Japan and Taiwan, where rights will be retained exclusively by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

About Roche in influenza
Influenza, or flu, is one of the most common, yet serious, infectious diseases, representing a significant threat to public health. Globally, annual epidemics result in 3 to 5 million cases of severe disease, millions of hospitalisations and up to 650,000 deaths worldwide.5,6,7,8,9 In the US alone, the total economic burden of the flu is estimated to be $11.2 billion annually through reduced productivity and healthcare costs.10 Roche has a long heritage in developing medicines that contribute to public health. We are committed to bringing innovation in the field of infectious diseases, including influenza. Tamiflu® (oseltamivir) has made a significant difference both to the treatment of seasonal influenza as well as in the management of recent pandemics, and we are proud to have brought this innovative medicine to patients. Although vaccines are an important first line of defence in preventing flu, there is a need for new medical options for prophylaxis and treatment. Current antiviral drugs have limitations with respect to efficacy, convenience of dosing, and resistance. Roche is committed to addressing the unmet need in this area through its agreement with Shionogi & Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialise Xofluza.

OSAKA, Japan, June 3, 2019 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced new data from an ad-hoc analysis of the Phase 3 HELP Study™, designed to evaluate the onset of action for TAKHZYRO® (lanadelumab) during days 0-69 of treatment. The analysis suggests that TAKHZYRO starts to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks during this early treatment phase, with patients experiencing an 80.1% decrease in mean monthly attack rate compared to placebo. The results were presented today (PD0369) during the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Congress in Lisbon, Portugal. HAE is a rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening disorder that can result in recurrent attacks of oedema (swelling) in various parts of the body.
“The unpredictable nature of HAE attacks makes living with the disease physically and emotionally challenging for patients,” said Professor Marcus Maurer, M.D., Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Allergie-Centrum-Charité, Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. “HAE requires an individualised approach to treatment, and it is important that a patient’s treatment plan helps reduce the frequency of attacks. These results are exciting as they suggest that lanadelumab begins to prevent HAE attacks during the initial phase of treatment.”
The ad-hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of TAKHZYRO compared with placebo during days 0-69 of treatment using the same approach that was used to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints during the complete study period (days 0-182). Results from the analysis showed that in patients receiving the recommended starting dose of TAKHZYRO 300 mg every two weeks, there was a significant reduction in mean monthly attack rate (80.1% decrease) compared to placebo (Adjusted P<0.001). During this initial treatment phase, patients treated with TAKHZYRO 300 mg every two weeks also experienced fewer severe attacks compared to placebo (7.4% vs. 22%) and were more likely to be HAE attack-free compared to those on placebo (48.1% vs. 7.3%).
“Original data from the HELP Study showed that TAKHZYRO was effective in preventing HAE attacks over the entire duration of the study and, according to an exploratory analysis, many patients remained attack-free during the 16-week steady state period,” said Donatello Crocetta, M.D., Franchise Global Medical Unit Head, Rare Immunology and HAE at Takeda. “This new analysis supports previous study findings and builds on our understanding of how quickly TAKHZYRO can begin to help prevent HAE attacks, further supporting its use for appropriate patients as a preventive therapy that can be administered subcutaneously and begins to work rapidly.”
Across all TAKHZYRO treatment arms, (300 mg every two weeks, 300 mg every four weeks, 150 mg every four weeks), there was an improvement in mean monthly attack rate, monthly rate of moderate to severe attacks, monthly rate of attacks requiring acute treatment and the number of attack-free days, versus placebo, during the entire study period.
The most commonly observed adverse reactions (52.4%) associated with TAKHZYRO were injection site reactions. Of these, 97% were of mild intensity. Hypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was observed (1.2%).1
TAKHZYRO 300 mg is approved in the European Union and Australia for the routine prevention of recurrent attacks of HAE in patients aged 12 years and older. TAKHZYRO 300 mg is approved as prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE in patients aged 12 years and older in the United States and for the routine prevention of attacks in patients aged 12 years and older in Canada.
The HELP Study™
The HELP (Hereditary Angioedema Long-term Prophylaxis) Study™ was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered TAKHZYRO vs. placebo over 26 weeks in 125 patients 12 years of age or older with HAE.
The primary endpoint of the HELP Study™ was the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks over the entire 26-week study duration. TAKHZYRO demonstrated that subcutaneous injections every two or four weeks reduced the mean monthly number of attacks across all three TAKHZYRO treatment arms studies: 300 mg every two weeks, 300 mg every four weeks and 150 mg of TAKHZYRO every four weeks. At 300 mg every two weeks, TAKHZYRO reduced the number of mean monthly HAE attacks by 87% vs. placebo (Adjusted P<0.001).
Secondary endpoints included: 1) number of attacks requiring acute treatment and 2) number of attacks assessed as moderate or severe. Overall, each TAKHZYRO treatment arm demonstrated statistically significant attack rate reductions compared with placebo for all secondary efficacy endpoints (Adjusted P<0.001 for all comparisons), including: attacks requiring acute treatment (74% to 87%) and moderate or severe attacks (70% to 83%).
Complete results from the Phase 3 HELP Study™ were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on 27 November 2018.2
About Hereditary Angioedema
HAE is a rare genetic disorder that results in recurring attacks of oedema – swelling – in various parts of the body, including the abdomen, face, feed, genitals, hands and throat. The swelling can be debilitating and painful.3,4,5 Attacks that obstruct the airways can cause asphyxiation and are potentially life-threatening.4,5 HAE affects an estimated 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. It is often under-recognised, under-diagnosed and under-treated.3,6
About TAKHZYRO® (lanadelumab)
TAKHZYRO (lanadelumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and decreases plasma kallikrein activity. TAKHZYRO is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.
TAKHZYRO is formulated for subcutaneous administration and has a half-life of approximately two weeks in patients with HAE. TAKHZYRO is intended for the self-administration or administration by a caregiver, only after training by a healthcare professional.
TAKHZYRO Safety Information for Europe
Please consult the TAKHZYRO Summary Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing.
TAKHZYRO treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). TAKHZYRO may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training on SC injection technique by a healthcare professional.
Contraindication
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Warnings and Precautions
Traceability: In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed. In case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, administration of TAKHZYRO must be stopped immediately and appropriate treatment must be initiated.
General: TAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks. In case of a breakthrough HAE attack, individualized treatment should be initiated with an approved rescue medication. There are no available clinical data on the use of lanadelumab in HAE patients with normal C1-INH activity.
Interference with coagulation test: Lanadelumab can increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of lanadelumab with the aPTT assay. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic coagulation through the activation of plasma kallikrein in the contact system. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein by lanadelumab can increase aPTT in this assay. None of the increases in aPTT in patients treated with TAKHZYRO were associated with abnormal bleeding adverse events. There were no differences in international normalised ratio (INR) between treatment groups.
Sodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
Interactions
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on the characteristics of lanadelumab, no pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered medicinal products is expected.
As expected, concomitant use of the rescue medication C1 esterase inhibitor results in an additive effect on lanadelumab-cHMWK response based on the mechanism of action (MOA) of lanadelumab and C1 esterase inhibitor.
Immunogenicity
Treatment with lanadelumab has been associated with development of treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in 11.9% (10/84) of subjects. All antibody titres were low. The ADA response was transient in 20% (2/10) of ADA positive subjects. 2.4% (2/84) of lanadelumab-treated subjects tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.
The development of ADA including neutralising antibodies against TAKHZYRO did not appear to adversely affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles or clinical response.
Adverse Reactions
The most commonly observed adverse reaction (52.4%) associated with TAKHZYRO was injection site reactions (ISR) including injection site pain, injection site erythema and injection site bruising. Of these ISRs, 97% were of mild intensity, 90% resolved within 1 day after onset with a median duration of 6 minutes.
Hypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was observed (1.2%)
Very common
(frequency ≥1/10): Injection site reactions*
Common
(≥1/100 to <1/10): Hypersensitivity**, dizziness, rash maclo-papular, myalgia, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased.
*Injection site reactions include: pain, erythema, bruising, discomfort, haematoma, haemorrhage, pruritus, swelling, induration, paraesthesia, reaction, warmth, oedema and rash.
** Hypersensitivity includes: pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue.

 P-II EV-201 results: ORR 44%; DOR 7.6 mos.; mOS 11.7 mos.; mPFS 5.8 mos.; CR 12%; presented at ASCO 2019
 Enfortumab vedotin is an investigational ADC candidate targeting Nectin-4 protein, currently evaluated in P-III EV-301 study for LA or metastatic urothelial cancer. In 2007, Seattle and Astellas entered a co-development deal for enfortumab vedotin, plans to submit BLA to FDA based on EV-201 results","First Investigational Therapy in a Pivotal Trial to Address Unmet Need for Patients with Advanced Urothelial Cancer After Treatment with Platinum Chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 Inhibitor-
-Data Featured in Official Press Program and Presented in Late-Breaking Oral Session Today at 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting-

TOKYO and BOTHELL, Wash., June 3, 2019 – Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced that data from the first cohort of a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial known as EV-201 demonstrated that the investigational agent enfortumab vedotin rapidly shrank tumors in most patients, resulting in an objective response rate (ORR) of 44 percent (55/125; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 35.1-53.2). Complete responses (CR) were observed in 12 percent of patients (15/125). The median duration of tumor response was 7.6 months (range 0.95-11.3+). This cohort was open to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who had received previous treatment with a platinum-containing chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor. Responses were similar in the subgroups of patients analyzed, including those who had the worst prognosis, such as patients who had three or more previous lines of therapy, patients with liver metastases, and those who had not responded to a PD-1/L1 inhibitor. Treatment-related adverse events that occurred in 40 percent or more of patients were fatigue, alopecia, rash, decreased appetite, taste distortion, and peripheral neuropathy.
The data will be featured today in the official press program of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and be presented as a Late-Breaking oral presentation (Abstract #LBA4505) and have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
Despite recent advances in treatment, approximately 80 percent of people do not respond to PD-1/L1 inhibitors, which are the standard of care after platinum-containing therapy has failed as an initial treatment for advanced disease. These patients have few treatment options and new therapies are urgently needed.
Enfortumab vedotin is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets Nectin-4, a protein that is highly expressed in urothelial cancers. Based on the results of the EV-201 trial, the companies plan to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) for enfortumab vedotin to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this year. Based on preliminary results from the phase 1 EV-101 trial, the FDA granted enfortumab vedotin Breakthrough Therapy designation for people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer whose disease has progressed during or following checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
“Outcomes for patients diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer are generally poor, and treatment options after initial chemotherapy and immunotherapy are very limited,” said Daniel P. Petrylak, M.D., Professor of Medicine and of Urology, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven. “These data have the potential to change the treatment course of advanced urothelial cancer, and it is gratifying to see these results for patients.”
“Even with the recent introduction of new therapies, there remains a need for continued innovation in the treatment of urothelial cancer, and if approved, we hope to bring this potential treatment to physicians and patients as quickly as possible,” said Andrew Krivoshik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Oncology Therapeutic Area Head at Astellas.
“We are encouraged that enfortumab vedotin is the first novel therapy to demonstrate substantial clinical activity in these difficult-to-treat patients who currently have limited treatment options,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Seattle Genetics.
A global, randomized phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial (EV-301) is ongoing and is intended to support global registrations. Another trial (EV-103) is underway to evaluate enfortumab vedotin in earlier lines of treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, including in combination with pembrolizumab and/or platinum chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients as well as patients who progressed from earlier-stage disease.
EV-201 Study Results
Efficacy
In the first cohort of the EV-201 study, 125 patients were treated with enfortumab vedotin. The primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 44 percent per blinded independent central review (BICR) [(55/125; 95% CI: 35.1-53.2)]. The overall duration of response (DoR), a key secondary endpoint, was 7.6 months (range 0.95-11.3+).
Most responses occurred within the first cycle of treatment, and were observed across all pre-specified patient subgroups irrespective of lines of therapy, response to prior PD-1/L1 inhibitor, or presence of liver metastases:
• Three or more prior therapies: 41 percent ORR (26/63)
• Non-responders to PD-1/L1 inhibitors: 41 percent ORR (41/100)
• Liver metastases: 38 percent ORR (19/50)
Median overall survival (OS) was 11.7 months (95% CI:9.1-not reached), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.8 months (95% CI:4.9-7.5).
Safety
• The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurring in more than 40 percent of patients were fatigue (50 percent (62/125)); alopecia (49 percent (61/125)); rash (48 percent (60/125)); decreased appetite (44 percent (55/125)); taste distortion (40 percent (50/125)); and peripheral neuropathy (50 percent (63/125)).
• Most peripheral neuropathy (94 percent) and rash (75 percent) were less than or equal to Grade 2 in severity. Hyperglycemia occurred in 11 percent of patients (14/125).
• The most common severe AEs (defined as greater than or equal to Grade 3) were: neutropenia – experienced by 8 percent of patients (10/125); anemia in 7 percent of patients (9/125); and fatigue in 6 percent of patients (7/125). One death due to interstitial lung disease occurred outside the safety-reporting period and was confounded by prolonged high-dose steroid use and suspected pneumonia.

“Episodic cluster headache can be devastating. The approval of Emgality for the treatment of episodic cluster headache is an important milestone as it provides a new treatment option, which has been long-awaited by those impacted by this disease,” said Christi Shaw, president, Lilly Bio-Medicines.
Cluster headache is characterized by the abrupt onset of severe to very severe pain on one side of the head. Pain is felt in the orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal regions (around or above the eye and/or temple) and can be accompanied by symptoms on the same side of the body: conjunctival injection (eye redness), lacrimation (tearing), nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (runny nose), forehead and facial sweating, miosis (constriction of the pupil), ptosis (drooping eyelid) and/or eyelid edema (swollen eyelid), and/or restlessness or agitation.2 Cluster headache, although severely crippling, is challenging to diagnose because of limited awareness and, for some, may take five years or more to diagnose on average.3 It has been historically challenging to conduct clinical trials that identify treatment options that help reduce the frequency of attacks for those with episodic cluster headache. During a cluster period, which usually spans two weeks to three months, attacks last 15 to 180 minutes and can occur from once every other day to eight times per day.2 People with episodic cluster headache represent 85 to 90 percent of cluster headache prevalence, with approximately 250,000 adults living with this disease in the U.S. 2,4
“As someone impacted by cluster headache and an advocate for others living with this disease, I know firsthand the desperation that we have felt for additional treatment options that can reduce the frequency of these attacks that have such a debilitating impact on our lives,” said Bob Wold, founder, Clusterbusters, Inc. “The approval of Emgality for the treatment of episodic cluster headache is a cause for celebration and hope. On behalf of this community, we thank the FDA, Lilly, the researchers and the patients who helped to usher forward this innovative treatment.”
The efficacy of Emgality was evaluated for the treatment of episodic cluster headache in a randomized, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.1 In the study, 106 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-monthly injections of Emgality 300 mg (N=49) or placebo (N=57), with a baseline number of weekly cluster headache attacks of 17.8 for Emgality and 17.3 for placebo. Patients on Emgality experienced an average of 8.7 fewer weekly cluster headache attacks over Weeks 1 to 3 vs. 5.2 fewer weekly attacks for patients on placebo (p=0.036).1 With Emgality, 71.4% of patients had their weekly cluster headache attacks cut in half or more from baseline at Week 3 vs. 52.6% of patients with placebo (p=0.046).1
Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with episodic cluster headache treated with Emgality 300 mg monthly is consistent with the safety profile in patients with migraine treated with Emgality 120 mg monthly.1 Two Emgality-treated patients discontinued double-blind treatment during the episodic cluster headache study because of adverse events.1
“For years, there have been few therapeutic options to offer patients for the treatment of episodic cluster headache. With today’s approval, physicians are now armed with an FDA-approved medication that has the potential to help patients living with this condition by reducing the frequency of cluster attacks,” said David Kudrow, M.D., director, California Medical Clinic for Headache.
For episodic cluster headache, the recommended dosage of Emgality is 300 mg (administered as three consecutive subcutaneous injections of 100 mg each) at the onset of the cluster period, and then monthly until the end of the cluster period.1
Emgality will be available to patients for pickup at retail pharmacies. The U.S. list price of Emgality for the treatment of episodic cluster headache is the same per milligram as the migraine indication.

About the Episodic Cluster Headache Study
The efficacy and safety of Emgality were evaluated for the treatment of episodic cluster headache in a randomized, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study included 106 adults who met the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (beta version) diagnostic criteria for episodic cluster headache and had a maximum of 8 attacks per day, a minimum of one attack every other day, and at least 4 attacks during the prospective 7-day baseline period. All patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-monthly subcutaneous injections of Emgality 300 mg or placebo. Patients were allowed to use certain specified acute/abortive cluster headache treatments, including triptans, oxygen, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the study. The study excluded patients on other treatments intended to reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks; patients with medication overuse headache; patients with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities compatible with an acute cardiovascular event or conduction delay; and patients with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of screening. In addition, patients with any history of stroke, intracranial or carotid aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, or vasospastic angina; clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease; or diagnosis of Raynaud’s disease were excluded. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in weekly cluster headache attack frequency across Weeks 1 to 3.1 A secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved a response (defined as a reduction from baseline of 50% or greater in the weekly cluster headache attack frequency) at Week 3.1

 Venclexta/Venclyxto is a drug targeted for binding & inhibiting BCL-2 protein, further leads to apoptosis and has received 5 times FDA’s BT designation in combination or monothx with approval in 50+ countries. Roche and AbbVie collaborated to develop Venclexta/Venclyxto","Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro showed improvements across multiple efficacy measures compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil, including progression-free survival and deep remissions as determined by minimal residual disease measurement
This 12-month, fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free combination was recently approved for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review pilot programme
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced results from the pivotal phase III CLL14 study in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) showing that Venclexta®/Venclyxto® (venetoclax) plus Gazyva®/Gazyvaro® (obinutuzumab) met its primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). The 12-month, fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free combination reduced the risk of disease worsening or death by 65% compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil (PFS, as assessed by investigator; HR=0.35; 95% CI 0.23-0.53; p<0.001), when given to people with previously untreated CLL who have co-existing medical conditions. The results were presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).1,2
At two years, one year after stopping treatment, nearly nine out of ten patients (88.2%) in the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro arm remained progression-free, compared to 64.1% in the Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm. Safety for Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro appeared consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines. Common Grade 3-4 adverse events with Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil, respectively, were low white blood cell count (52.8% vs. 48.1%) and infections (17.5% vs. 15.0%).
“The results of our phase III CLL14 trial, reported today at ASCO and in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent a major advance in improving outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are pleased this fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free regimen of Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro was approved by the FDA and look forward to providing an important treatment option to even more adults with the most common form of adult leukaemia.”
The treatment benefit demonstrated with the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro combination compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil was consistent across secondary endpoints, including:

Overall response (84.7% vs. 71.3%; p<0.001).
Complete response with at least partial blood count recovery (49.5% vs. 23.1%; p<0.001).
Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity in the bone marrow (56.9% vs. 17.1%; p<0.001) and peripheral blood (75.5% vs. 35.2%; p<0.001) three months after treatment. MRD-negativity means no cancer can be detected using a specific, highly sensitive test, and was defined as less than one CLL cell in 10,000 white blood cells.
These data were presented at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting on Tuesday 4 June 2019, at 10.09-10.21 CST (17.09-17.21, CET; abstract #7502), and simultaneously published in the NEJM.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination on 15 May 2019, under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review and Assessment Aid pilot programmes, for the treatment of people with previously untreated CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. This is the second regimen of Roche medicines approved under the RTOR pilot programme, which is exploring a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. Additional submissions of the CLL14 data to health authorities around the world are ongoing.

About the CLL14 study2
CLL14 (NCT02242942) is a randomised phase III study evaluating the combination of fixed-duration Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and co-existing medical conditions. Co-existing medical conditions included reduced kidney function or co-morbidities assessed by a standard scale (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale). 432 patients with previously untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive either a 12-month duration of Venclexta/Venclyxto alongside six-month duration of Gazyva/Gazyvaro (Arm A) or six-month duration of Gazyva/Gazyvaro alongside 12-month duration of chlorambucil (Arm B). Arm A started with an initial dosing of Gazyva/Gazyvaro followed by a five-week Venclexta/Venclyxto dose ramp-up to help reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee (IRC), minimal residual disease (MRD) status, overall response rate (ORR), complete response (with or without complete blood count recovery), overall survival, duration of response, event-free survival, time to next CLL treatment, and safety. The CLL14 study is being conducted in cooperation with the German CLL Study Group, headed by Michael Hallek, MD, University of Cologne.
After a median follow-up of 28 months, results showed:

Patients who received Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro lived significantly longer without their disease worsening (PFS, as assessed by investigator) compared to those who received Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23-0.53; p<0.001).
At two years, 88.2% of patients in the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro arm had not experienced disease progression, compared to 64.1% with Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil.
Median PFS reported by investigators was not yet reached in either arm. IRC assessment of PFS was consistent (HR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.22- 0.51; p<0.001).
Clinical benefit observed for Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil was consistent across secondary endpoints, including ORR (84.7% vs. 71.3%; p<0.001) and CR including incomplete marrow recovery (49.5% vs. 23.1%; p<0.001).
In addition, higher rates of MRD-negativity in the bone marrow (56.9% vs. 17.1%; p<0.001) and peripheral blood (75.5% vs. 35.2%; p<0.001) were observed three months after treatment with Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil. MRD-negativity was defined as less than one CLL cell in 10,000 leukocytes.
Safety for Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro appeared consistent with the known safety profile of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified with the combination. Common Grade 3-4 adverse events with Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil, respectively, were low white blood cell count (52.8% vs. 48.1%) and infections (17.5% vs. 15.0%).
About Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax)
Venclexta/Venclyxto is a first-in-class targeted medicine designed to selectively bind and inhibit the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other tumours, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from dying or self-destructing, a process called apoptosis. Venclexta/Venclyxto blocks the BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.
Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the US and by AbbVie outside of the US. Together, the companies are committed to research with Venclexta/Venclyxto, which is currently being studied in clinical trials across several types of blood and other cancers.
In the US, Venclexta has been granted five Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL); as a monotherapy for people with relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion; in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for people with untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) for people with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, and in combination with Gazyva in people with previously untreated CLL and co-existing medical conditions.
Venclexta/Venclyxto is approved in more than 50 countries. Roche and AbbVie are currently working with regulatory agencies around the world to bring this medicine to additional eligible patients in need.

About Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab)
Gazyva/Gazyvaro is an engineered monoclonal antibody designed to attach to CD20, a protein expressed on certain B-cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells. Gazyva/Gazyvaro is designed to attack and destroy targeted B-cells both directly and together with the body’s immune system. Gazyva is marketed as Gazyvaro in the EU and Switzerland.
Gazyva/Gazyvaro is currently approved in more than 90 countries in combination with chlorambucil for people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in more than 80 countries in combination with bendamustine for people with certain types of previously treated follicular lymphoma and in more than 70 countries in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.
Additional combination studies investigating Gazyva/Gazyvaro with other approved or investigational medicines, including cancer immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors, are underway across a range of blood cancers.

About the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG)
Founded in 1996 and headed by Michael Hallek, MD, the GCLLSG has been running various phase III, phase II and phase I trials in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with the goal to provide optimal treatment to patients suffering from this disease. Among those were landmark trials like the CLL8 and the CLL11 trials, which led to the current standard of care in CLL. For many years, GCLLSG has been aiming to improve not just the treatment of younger and physically fit patients, but also that of elderly and less fit patients. These patients are generally underrepresented in clinical trials although they constitute the majority of CLL patients treated by doctors in daily practice. The GCLLSG is an independent non-profit research organisation supported by the German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe). www.dcllsg.de

(Nasdaq: PBYI), a biopharmaceutical company, announced that results from the Phase III NALA trial of PB272 (neratinib) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior lines of HER2-directed treatments (third-line disease) in the setting of metastatic disease, were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2019 Annual Meeting in Chicago. “Neratinib + capecitabine versus lapatinib + capecitabine in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer previously treated with ≥ 2 HER2-directed regimens: Findings from the multinational, randomized, phase III NALA trial,” was presented as an oral presentation by Adam M. Brufsky, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Co-Director, Comprehensive Breast Cancer Center, Magee Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Slides from the presentation are available on the Puma Biotechnology website.
The Phase III NALA trial is a randomized controlled trial of neratinib plus capecitabine versus Tykerb® (lapatinib) plus capecitabine in patients with third-line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The trial enrolled 621 patients who were randomized (1:1) to receive either neratinib plus capecitabine or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The trial was conducted globally at sites in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. The co-primary endpoints of the trial are centrally confirmed progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). An alpha level of 1% was allocated to the PFS and 4% allocated to OS. The study was to be considered positive if either of the co-primary endpoints was positive. Puma reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the design of the Phase III clinical trial and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also provided follow-on scientific advice (SA) consistent with that of the FDA regarding the Company’s Phase III trial design and endpoints used in the trial.
For the primary analysis of centrally confirmed PFS, treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in a statistically significant improvement in centrally confirmed PFS (hazard ratio=0.76, p=0.0059) compared to treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine. Because the proportional hazard assumption did not hold, the statistical analysis plan for the NALA trial prespecified that a restricted means survival analysis at 24 months would be performed. In this prespecified analysis the mean PFS for the patients treated with neratinib plus capecitabine was 8.8 months and the mean PFS for the patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine was 6.6 months.
For the primary analyses of OS, neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in an improvement in OS that trended positively in favor of the neratinib plus capecitabine arm of the study (hazard ratio = 0.88, p=0.21). The median OS for the patients treated with neratinib plus capecitabine was 21.0 months and the median OS for the patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine was 18.7 months. In the prespecified restricted means analysis the mean OS at 48 months for the patients treated with neratinib plus capecitabine was 24.0 months and the mean OS for the patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine was 22.2 months.
For the secondary endpoint of time to intervention for symptomatic central nervous system disease (also referred to as brain metastases), the results of the trial showed that treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine led to an improvement over the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine. The overall cumulative incidence of CNS metastases was 22.8% for the neratinib plus capecitabine arm and 29.2% for the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm (p=0.043, descriptive). For the secondary enpoint of duration of response, neratinib plus capecitabine treatment resulted in a longer duration of response compared to lapatinib and capecitabine treatment, with a median response of 8.54 months compared to a median response of 5.55 months (HR = 0.495, p = 0.0004, descriptive).
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between arms: TEAEs leading to neratinib/lapatinib discontinuation were lower with neratinib (10.9%) than with lapatinib (14.5%). There was a higher rate of grade 3 diarrhea with neratinib plus capecitabine compared to lapatinib plus capecitabine (24.4% vs 12.5%); however, the discontinuations due to diarrhea (neratinib plus capecitabine: 2.6%, lapatinib plus capecitabine: 2.3%) were similar in both arms.
Puma plans to submit its New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on the Phase III NALA trial results in the second quarter/third quarter of 2019.
“Patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on two or more prior treatments continue to need additional treatment options,” said Adam M. Brufsky, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Co-Director, Comprehensive Breast Cancer Center, Magee Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “The results of the Phase III NALA trial are promising not only for a significant PFS improvement and a trend toward an OS improvement, but also for the potential to prevent progression of CNS metastases, which is a growing concern in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.”
Alan H. Auerbach, Chief Executive Officer and President of Puma Biotechnology, said, “We are highly encouraged by these results from the NALA trial with the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior lines of HER2-directed treatments. We look forward to working with the regulatory authorities in the hope of bringing another potential treatment option to patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer as soon as possible.”

15326,ï»¿BioMarin's Vimizim (elosulfase alfa) Receives NMPA's (CFDA) Approval for Treatment of Morquio A Syndrome,BioMarin Announces Approval of Vimizim (elosulfase alfa) in China for Treatment of Morquio A Syndrome,"Biomarin has received approval for its Vimizim, as a first approval by NMPA for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA), also known as Morquio A syndrome
 In May 2018, Chinese Drug Evaluation Center issued a list of rare diseases including MPS and in Aug 2018 is also released a list of 48 drugs which are eligible for Priority Review and already approved in the US, EU and Japan including Vimizim in China
 Vimizim is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) developed to target Morquio A Syndrome and is used to treat 1300+ patients in 50+ countries","First and Only Treatment in China Approved for Patients with This Ultra-Rare Genetic Condition
More than 1,300 Patients Treated with Vimizim in Over 50 Countries
SAN RAFAEL, Calif., June 4, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) announced today that Vimizim® (elosulfase alfa) has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the treatment of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA), also known as Morquio A syndrome. Vimizim is the first treatment in China approved for this condition.
In May 2018, the Chinese government issued the country’s first national list of rare diseases, which included MPS. The list also includes phenylketonuria (PKU), Tetrahydrobiopterin Deficiency, and hemophilia—diseases that BioMarin either has an approved therapy for or is developing one. The list gives priority to rare diseases with a relatively high prevalence, that pose a heavy burden and that are highly treatable. Also, in August 2018, the Chinese Drug Evaluation Center posted a list of 48 drugs already approved in the U.S., EU or Japan that could be eligible for Priority Review in China, which included Vimizim.
“Vimizim is the first, and currently only, disease-specific treatment option for this very rare, progressively degenerative, autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disorder,” said Luo Xiaoping, Vice Chairman of the Pediatrics society of the Chinese Medical Association and head of Endocrine Genetic Metabolism Group of Chinese Medical Association.
“Morquio A syndrome is an ultra-rare and difficult condition to treat. Vimizim is the only specific treatment available and offers improved endurance to these patients,” said Gu Xuefan, Deputy Director of Shanghai Institute of Pediatrics, Director of Pediatric Endocrinology and Inherited Metabolic Diseases Research Office of Xinhua Hospital, Director of Pediatric Genetic Diseases Diagnosis and Treatment Center, and Director of Pediatric Endocrinology and Inherited Metabolism Group of Shanghai Medical Association.
“Vimizim is approved for patients with mucupolysaccharidosis type IVA. It’s used to improve the patients’ pulmonary function, and significantly increase their walking distance in six minutes,” said Qiu Zhengqing, Member of the Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism Group of the Chinese Medical Association, communication reviewer of Chinese Journal of Pediatrics and the Chinese Medical Genetics Journal.
“We are pleased to be able to deliver the first drug therapy for Morquio A to patients in China and to build upon our efforts to serve patients with rare diseases in China,” said Jean-Jacques Bienaimé, Chairman and CEO of BioMarin. “We hope to continue to deliver therapies to treat patients who have rare genetic diseases with unmet medical needs.”
BioMarin will market Vimizim directly in China, building on its existing presence in the country with a team that has been marketing a BioMarin therapy, Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride), and that team is well-suited for serving ultra-rare disease populations. In the U.S., Kuvan is approved to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) due to tetrahydrobiopterin- (BH4-) responsive Phenylketonuria (PKU).
Morquio A syndrome is an ultra-rare, severely debilitating disease affecting an estimated 3,000 patients in the developed world. The disease occurs as a result of a deficiency of activity in an enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism. The pervasive and progressive accumulation of GAGs leads to significant morbidities and multisystemic clinical impairments resulting in diminished functional capacity, impaired quality-of-life and early mortality. The most common features of the disease are progressive skeletal dysplasia, the need for frequent surgical procedures related primarily to musculoskeletal or respiratory dysfunction, and significant limitations in mobility, endurance and breathing.
“The approval of Vimizim in China underscores our commitment to providing this much-needed therapy to patients with Morquio A syndrome across the globe,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President of Global Research and Development at BioMarin. “We will continue to seek approvals in other countries so that more patients within the MPS community have access to the treatments they deserve.”
About Morquio A Syndrome
Morquio A syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is a disease in which people are missing an enzyme essential in the breakdown and removal of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) called keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S). The incompletely broken-down GAGs remain stored in cells in the body causing progressive damage. This excessive storage causes systemic skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities, limiting mobility and endurance. Malformation of the chest impairs respiratory function, and looseness of joints in the neck causing spinal instability and potentially spinal cord compression. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, corneal clouding, and heart disease. Initial symptoms often become evident in the first five years of life. The disease substantially limits both the quality and length of life of those affected.
The rate of incidence of Morquio A syndrome is as yet unconfirmed and varies among different populations, and estimates vary between 1 in 200,000 live births and 1 in 450,000 live births.
About VIMIZIM
VIMIZIM® (elosulfase alfa) is a treatment for patients with Morquio A syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA). VIMIZIM is the first approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) designed to target the underlying cause of Morquio A Syndrome—a deficiency in the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6 sulfatase (GALNS). VIMIZIM is intended to provide the exogenous enzyme GALNS that will be taken up into the lysosomes and increase the catabolism of GAGs. Morquio A syndrome is a rare, severely debilitating and progressive disease that previously had no approved, standard-of-care treatment other than supportive care.
Important Safety Information from U.S. Prescribing Information
Life-threatening allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, can occur during VIMIZIM® (elosulfase alfa) infusions. Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when VIMIZIM is administered and for an appropriate period of time following administration.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed as early as 30 minutes from the start of infusion but as late as six days after infusion. Frequent symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions included anaphylactic reactions, urticaria, peripheral edema, cough, dyspnea, and flushing.
Because of the potential for hypersensitivity reactions, administer antihistamines with or without antipyretics prior to infusion. If severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion of VIMIZIM and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients with acute febrile or respiratory illness at the time of VIMIZIM infusion may be at higher risk of life-threatening complications from hypersensitivity reactions.
Sleep apnea is common in MPS IVA patients. Evaluation of airway patency should be considered prior to initiation of treatment with VIMIZIM. Patients using supplemental oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep should have these treatments readily available during infusion in the event of an acute reaction, or extreme drowsiness/sleep induced by antihistamine use.
Spinal or cervical cord compression (SCC) is a known and serious complication of MPS IVA and may occur as part of the natural history of the disease. In clinical trials, SCC was observed both in patients receiving VIMIZIM and patients receiving placebo. Patients with MPS IVA should be monitored for signs and symptoms of SCC (including back pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, urinary and fecal incontinence) and given appropriate clinical care.
All patients treated with VIMIZIM 2 mg/kg once per week in the placebo-controlled trial developed anti-drug antibodies.
VIMIZIM should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known if VIMIZIM is present in human milk.
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below 5 years of age have not been established.
In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (≥10%) occurring during infusion included pyrexia, vomiting, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, chills, and fatigue. The acute reactions requiring intervention were managed by either temporarily interrupting or discontinuing infusion, and administering additional antihistamine, antipyretics, or corticosteroids.

15340,ï»¿Bayer Signs a Research and Development Collaboration with Arvinas for its PROTAC Technology,"Bayer and Arvinas, Inc. to develop novel Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera candidates for humans and plants","Arvinas to get ~$60M including upfront, equity investments, R&D funds and $685M milestones and royalties on sales of products. Bayer to get rights for the therapies developed in collaboration using Arvinas’s PROTAC Technology
 The focus of the collaboration is to develop therapies using Arvinas’ PROTAC protein degrader technology in cardiovascular, oncology, and gynecological disorders
 Arvinas’ PROTAC (Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera) is a protein degrader technology used for harnessing body’s own natural protein disposal system and further degrades disease-causing proteins into amino acids","Agreement worth more than USD 110 million includes the first-ever research application of Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera (PROTAC®) technology in agriculture / Bayer and Arvinas to launch joint venture to develop targeted protein degraders for agriculture applications / Collaboration agreement and equity investment by Bayer to develop next-generation medicines for patients with cardiovascular, oncological and gynecological diseases
Berlin/Monheim, June 4, 2019 – Bayer today announced a collaboration with Arvinas, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in New Haven, Connecticut. The new life science research partnership uniquely leverages the full potential of Arvinas’ novel PROTAC® technology, coupled with Bayer’s leading expertise in health and agriculture to develop innovations for the benefit of patients and farmers.
Arvinas is a pioneer in Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera, also known as PROTACs. PROTAC® technology harnesses the naturally occurring protein degradation system of the cell to selectively remove target proteins by proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins into amino acids.
For Bayer, a company which is uniquely positioned in health and agriculture, the collaboration demonstrates the utilization of potential synergies of emerging and converging research across human and plant applications that is unprecedented in the life science sector.
Bayer will form an exclusive joint venture as the first company to explore the PROTAC® technology in agriculture for crop protection, and at the same time establish a target-based pharmaceutical research collaboration with Arvinas. In addition, Bayer will make an equity investment to sustain its commitment for the technology.
Agricultural joint venture
Within the framework of the joint venture the exploration of novel molecular target space to address weeds, insects and/or diseases that threaten crops worldwide will be pioneered. As the technology degrades targets rather than inhibiting them, it offers a completely new category of crop protection applications in agriculture. In addition, PROTACs have the potential to revive crop protection mechanisms that have become ineffective due to resistance.
“The goal is to utilize the complementary expertise of Bayer and Arvinas to develop novel research discoveries that ultimately deliver new crop protection products for farmers,” said Dr. Robert Reiter, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Crop Science Division and Head of Crop Science Research & Development. “With this cutting-edge science, we aim to deliver safe and effective solutions that will aid farmers in protecting and producing crops that help to feed a growing global population.”
Within the framework of the joint venture, Bayer has committed more than USD 55 million over six years to translate the new protein degradation technology in agro chemistry and to build an agro-specific PROTAC® IP portfolio.
Pharmaceutical collaboration and equity investment
Today, up to 80 percent of the human proteome is still considered undruggable by small molecule inhibitors, the mechanism underlying many therapeutic drugs currently available. By removing target proteins directly rather than blocking them, protein degraders like PROTACs may provide multiple advantages over small molecule inhibitors. In addition, no inhibitors have been identified for a majority of the targets of interest in drug development.
“In line with our strategy to adopt novel modalities in R&D, we are entering into a collaboration with Arvinas as we see the breakthrough innovation potential in this technology,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “Because PROTACs don’t inhibit the target protein’s enzymatic activity, but bind their targets with high selectivity, it may be possible to retool previously ineffective inhibitor molecules as PROTACs for next-generation medicines for patients.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Arvinas will receive an upfront payment and pharmaceutical R&D support over the next four years, as well as a direct equity investment. These investments combined will exceed USD 60 million. Bayer will own the rights to novel lead structures generated in the course of the collaboration. As programs progress through research, development, and commercialization, Arvinas might also be eligible to receive pre-defined development milestones of over USD 685 million and commercial royalties.
“As the first company founded to explore targeted protein degradation, we’ve been excited about the potential to improve the lives of patients since our inception,” said John Houston, Ph.D., President and CEO of Arvinas. “We’ve also anticipated the broad potential of our PROTAC® platform to move beyond treating human disease. This collaboration enables us not only to expand our platform into new therapeutic areas, but also begins a new journey in applying our approach to agriculture. We are thrilled to work with Bayer to begin developing solutions to efficiently support the needs of the world’s growing population and to improve human health.”
About PROTAC® (Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera) Protein Degraders
Arvinas’ PROTAC® protein degraders harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to degrade disease-causing proteins. PROTAC® protein degraders recruit an E3 ligase to tag the target protein with ubiquitin, which directs its degradation through the proteasome, a large protein complex that breaks down the ubiquitinated target protein into small peptides and amino acids. As the target protein is degraded, the PROTAC® protein degrader is released and acts iteratively to destroy additional target protein.
PROTAC® protein degraders offer numerous potential advantages as a therapeutic, including broad tissue distribution, routes of administration that include oral delivery, and simpler manufacturing than other new modalities, such as cell-based therapies. Arvinas has developed and optimized a proprietary library of protein targeting ligands, E3 ligase ligands, and linkers, which allow the company to rapidly identify and optimize efficient protein degraders with favorable characteristics for successful drug development.
About Arvinas
Arvinas is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapies that degrade disease-causing proteins. Arvinas uses its proprietary technology platform to engineer proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTAC® targeted protein degraders, that harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to selectively and efficiently degrade and remove disease-causing proteins. The company’s lead program, ARV-110 for the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, began clinical trials in 1Q2019. For more information, see www.arvinas.com.

 Additionally, IBM Watson reported to identify automatically, high-quality and relevant scientific publications with the help of machine learning on words from abstracts of papers cited at three expert resources: NCCN, NCI-PDQ, and Hemonc.org further resulting in 93% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, and 91% specificity of treatment","Watson for Oncology trained by Memorial Sloan Kettering shown to inform clinical decision changes in 13.6% of cases at a hospital in India
– Watson for Genomics found to identify clinically actionable genomic variants that had not been identified in manual interpretation in 33% of patients at a hospital in South Korea
– 22 new studies featuring IBM Watson Health’s AI technology to be presented at ASCO
CHICAGO, May 31, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — IBM Watson Health and its partners today unveiled 22 new scientific studies that demonstrate progress in providing clinical decision support for cancer care globally at the American Society for Clinical Oncology 2019 annual meeting.
“Artificial intelligence technology is helping to enhance the way clinicians treat cancer today, in the real world,” said Nathan Levitan, MD, MBA, Chief Medical Officer for Oncology and Genomics at IBM Watson Health. “AI is helping multidisciplinary tumor boards make more informed decisions based on curated scientific evidence; it is surfacing critical insights and information that is not identified manually; and it is helping to improve patient satisfaction by delivering a comprehensive view of treatment options.”
Watson Health’s studies show how Watson AI provides value in supporting evidence-informed treatment decisions, improving patient confidence in treatment plans, and annotating genomic variants and identifying clinical interventions. In total, more than 70 peer-reviewed studies, posters and abstracts support Watson Health offerings in oncology and genomics.
“In this early era of AI use in healthcare decision-making, the studies presented at ASCO this year offer compelling evidence of the important role this technology will play in helping oncologists improve cancer treatment for each individual patient,” Levitan continued.
Following are among the key study findings being presented at ASCO:
Watson for Oncology Informs Clinical Decision Changes in 13.6% of Cases Reviewed by Multidisciplinary Tumor Board: In a blinded evaluation of 1000 breast, lung and colorectal cancer patients in India, the multidisciplinary tumor board at Manipal Hospitals changed their treatment decisions in 13.6% of cases based on information provided by Watson for Oncology. Investigators reported that in these cases, decisions changed because Watson provided recent evidence for a newer treatment (55%), a more personalized alternative (30%), or new insights from genotypic and phenotypic data and evolving clinical experiences (15%). [Abstract link]”Building on previous studies, this evidence suggests that AI decision support holds substantial promise to reduce the cognitive burden on oncologists, which is a significant problem impacting physician burnout today,” said lead investigator SP Somashekhar, Chairman of Surgical Oncology, Manipal Hospitals. “We consider Watsonfor Oncology to be an important tool to support decision making, and this study suggests that AI could help reduce variability of care.”
Watson for Genomics Surfaces New Insights for Oncologists Treating Patients with Hematological Malignancies: In a study of 54 patients with hematological malignancies at Hallym University College of Medicine, Watson for Genomics annotations of sequencing results correlated well with manually curated expert opinion (90% in randomized subset), and identified clinically actionable insights that were not identified by manual interpretation in 33% of cases. This helps suggest that the labor-intensive manual curation of such results could be augmented with tools like Watson for Genomics. [Abstract link]
Watson for Oncology Improves Cancer Patient Confidence: Physicians from the Oncology Department at Beijing Chaoyang Integrative Medicine Emergency Medical Center report that incorporating Watson for Oncology into a 7-step patient engagement and consultation process helped patients to better understand their disease and treatment options. This resulted in stronger patient confidence in their care plans. [Abstract link]
IBM Watson Health Continues to Enhance Products
IBM Watson Health continuously seeks to enhance capabilities in its offerings to help physicians improve the efficacy and efficiency of cancer treatment. During ASCO, IBM Watson Health reported data on a new method to automatically identify clinically relevant, high-quality scientific publications by training machine learning on the text from abstracts of papers cited in three expert resources: NCCN, NCI-PDQ, and Hemonc.org. The model classified papers in the test set with 93% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, and 91% specificity, which suggests that machine learning can be used to automatically identify relevant clinical publications and may reduce the time clinicians spend finding pertinent evidence for their patients.
Additionally, IBM Watson Health is strategically focused on tailoring offerings to support the workflow experience of oncologists in key markets based on feedback from physicians and insight from scientific data. Watson Health oncology and genomics offerings are currently being used to support physicians and patients in their cancer care journeys in more than 15 markets around the world.
“With 18 million diagnoses globally each year, cancer is a devastating disease that has a heavy human toll, as well as a high health system cost,” said Dr. Levitan. “Patients often face grueling and confusing treatment regimens, while oncologists sift through reams of medical literature and genomic data to identify the best care plan for each individual patient. All the while, researchers are hamstrung by trials that too often fail due to low patient recruitment. IBM Watson Health was created to help address pressing health challenges through data, analytics and AI, and this is our focus in oncology.”

 The P-III TOURMALINE-AL1 study resulted in unmet 1EPs as well as demonstrated no improvement in overall hematologic response leading to its discontinuation
 Ninlaro (ixazomib) is an oral proteasome inhibitor currently evaluated in multiple myeloma and is approved in 60+ countries including the US, Japan and EU with 10+ regulatory filings under review","Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, Japan, June 5, 2019 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502/NYSE: TAK) today announced that the Phase 3 TOURMALINE-AL1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis did not meet the first of two primary endpoints. Treatment with NINLAROTM (ixazomib) in combination with dexamethasone did not demonstrate a significant improvement in overall hematologic response compared to physician’s choice of standard of care regimens. As a result of this analysis, Takeda has decided to discontinue the trial.
“While we are disappointed with this outcome, we aim to maximize our learnings from this trial and share findings with the community in hopes of helping to improve care for patients living with this devastating disease,” said Phil Rowlands, Ph.D., Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “This has been one of the largest studies ever conducted in systemic light-chain AL amyloidosis and we are proud to have led it. This study demonstrated our dedication to this rare and traditionally difficult-to-enroll patient population and we thank the patients and investigators for their engagement and participation. We remain optimistic about NINLARO and continue to investigate NINLARO in patient populations across the continuum of multiple myeloma care.”
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) did not raise any concerns about the safety profile of NINLARO in this setting. Patients are encouraged to consult their study investigators to address any questions.

About the TOURMALINE-AL1 Trial
TOURMALINE-AL1 (NCT01659658) is an international, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study, designed to determine whether NINLAROTM (ixazomib) in combination with dexamethasone improves hematologic response, 2-year vital organ (heart or kidney) deterioration and mortality rate versus a physician’s choice of a chemotherapy regimen in participants diagnosed with relapsed or refractory systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Patients were randomly selected to receive either NINLARO plus dexamethasone, or physician’s choice of dexamethasone plus melphalan; dexamethasone plus cyclophosphamide; dexamethasone plus thalidomide; dexamethasone plus lenalidomide; or dexamethasone alone. For more information, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01659658.

About AL Amyloidosis
Primary AL amyloidosis is a condition that falls under the umbrella of plasma cell dyscrasias. AL amyloidosis arises from a clonal plasma cell that produces abnormal immunoglobulin light-chain fragments. These misfolded light-chains form insoluble fibrils that aggregate as amyloid deposits in organs and tissues throughout the body, ultimately leading to organ dysfunction and death. The most common organs affected are the kidneys, heart, liver, and autonomic or peripheral nerves. There are currently no treatments approved for the treatment of AL amyloidosis.

About NINLARO™ (ixazomib) capsules
NINLARO™ (ixazomib) is an oral proteasome inhibitor which is being studied across the continuum of multiple myeloma treatment settings. NINLARO was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015 and is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. NINLARO is currently approved in more than 60 countries, including the United States, Japan and in the European Union, with more than 10 regulatory filings currently under review. It was the first oral proteasome inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials and to receive approval.
The comprehensive ixazomib clinical development program, TOURMALINE, includes four ongoing pivotal trials, which together are investigating major multiple myeloma patient populations.

TOURMALINE-MM1, investigating ixazomib vs. placebo in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma
TOURMALINE-MM2, investigating ixazomib vs. placebo in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
TOURMALINE-MM3, investigating ixazomib vs. placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma following induction therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)
TOURMALINE-MM4, investigating ixazomib vs. placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have not undergone ASCT; this study is currently enrolling
In addition to the TOURMALINE program, ixazomib is being evaluated in multiple therapeutic combinations for various patient populations in investigator initiated studies globally.

NINLARO™ (ixazomib) capsules: Global Important Safety Information
SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively) with platelet nadirs typically occurring between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle and recovery to baseline by the start of the next cycle. It did not result in an increase in hemorrhagic events or platelet transfusions. Monitor platelet counts at least monthly during treatment with NINLARO and consider more frequent monitoring during the first three cycles. Manage with dose modifications and platelet transfusions as per standard medical guidelines.
Gastrointestinal toxicities have been reported in the NINLARO and placebo regimens respectively, such as diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), and vomiting (22% vs. 11%), occasionally requiring use of antiemetic and anti-diarrheal medications, and supportive care.
Peripheral neuropathy was reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 21% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). The most commonly reported reaction was peripheral sensory neuropathy (19% and 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Peripheral motor neuropathy was not commonly reported in either regimen (< 1%). Monitor patients for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and adjust dosing as needed.
Peripheral edema was reported with NINLARO (25% vs. 18% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Evaluate patients for underlying causes and provide supportive care, as necessary. Adjust the dose of dexamethasone per its prescribing information or the dose of NINLARO for severe symptoms.
Cutaneous reactions occurred in 19% of patients in the NINLARO regimen compared to 11% of patients in the placebo regimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens was maculo-papular and macular rash. Manage rash with supportive care, dose modification or discontinuation.
Hepatotoxicity, drug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular injury, hepatic steatosis, and hepatitis cholestatic have been uncommonly reported with NINLARO. Monitor hepatic enzymes regularly and adjust dose for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms.
Pregnancy– NINLARO can cause fetal harm. Advise male and female patients of reproductive potential to use contraceptive measures during treatment and for an additional 90 days after the final dose of NINLARO. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while taking NINLARO due to potential hazard to the fetus. Women using hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of contraception.
Lactation– It is not known whether NINLARO or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There could be potential adverse events in nursing infants and therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued.
SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS
Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
Renal Impairment: Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. NINLARO is not dialyzable and, therefore, can be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers with NINLARO is not recommended.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in the NINLARO regimen, and greater than in the placebo regimen, were diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), thrombocytopenia (28% vs. 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 21%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), peripheral edema (25% vs. 18%), vomiting (22% vs. 11%), and back pain (21% vs. 16%). Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients included thrombocytopenia (2%) and diarrhea (2%). For each adverse reaction, one or more of the three drugs was discontinued in ≤ 1% of patients in the NINLARO regimen.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & BASEL, Switzerland–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Enzyvant, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing transformative therapies for patients with rare, often fatal conditions, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for filing its Biologics License Application (BLA) for RVT-802, a novel investigational tissue-based regenerative therapy designed to treat pediatric congenital athymia, and granted Priority Review. Congenital athymia is a rare and deadly condition associated with complete DiGeorge Anomaly (cDGA), CHARGE syndrome, and FOXN1 deficiency. At this time, the FDA is not planning to hold an Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the application, and Enzyvant anticipates a regulatory decision in December 2019.
“The long-term data for RVT-802 as a one-time treatment reinforces the potentially life-saving value and durable impact of this therapy. We are committed to working collaboratively with payers to establish a value-based reimbursement model that accelerates access for patients.”

Children with congenital athymia are born without a thymus, resulting in a severe immunodeficiency due to the inability to produce normally functioning T cells, which defend against infection and regulate essential processes in the immune system. Approximately 20 infants are born each year in the United States with congenital athymia, which is fatal if untreated. Death typically occurs in the first 24 months of life due to susceptibility to infection. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for this condition. RVT-802 stimulates and facilitates the body’s production of naive, immunocompetent T cells, with the goal of bolstering the immune system and restoring the body’s ability to fight infection. Investigational RVT-802 is designed to be administered as a single treatment.
“We are proud to be advancing RVT-802, a regenerative therapy that embodies bold, transformative science. The intense urgency to treat infants and young children who would otherwise succumb to congenital athymia drew us to forge a partnership with Duke University and continues to motivate us to advance toward a potential approval with focus and speed,” said Rachelle Jacques, Chief Executive Officer of Enzyvant. “The long-term data for RVT-802 as a one-time treatment reinforces the potentially life-saving value and durable impact of this therapy. We are committed to working collaboratively with payers to establish a value-based reimbursement model that accelerates access for patients.”
The BLA filing for RVT-802 included clinical data that demonstrated long-term durability of treatment with RVT-802. At the time of the BLA filing, a total of 93 patients received RVT-802 across multiple clinical studies, including 85 patients who met the criteria for inclusion in the efficacy analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival [95% confidence interval] at year one and year two post treatment were 76% [66 – 84] and 75% [66 – 83], respectively. For patients surviving 12 months post-treatment, there was a 93% probability of surviving 10 years post-treatment. During clinical development, the most commonly (≥ 5%) reported RVT-802 related adverse events included thrombocytopenia (11%), neutropenia (8%), pyrexia (5%), and proteinuria (5%).
“The journey of this therapy has involved the dedication and contributions of so many and, most notably, the bravery of patients and their families,” said Dr. Louise Markert, Professor of Pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine, whose pioneering work at Duke led to the development of RVT-802. “It is gratifying to see this therapy advance a significant step closer to a potential FDA approval. We are hopeful we can look to a future of continuing to save children’s lives.”
“We congratulate the Enzyvant team on this important milestone, as well as Dr. Markert and her colleagues at Duke for their remarkable scientific accomplishments and dedication to athymic patients and their families,” said Myrtle Potter, Vant Operating Chair at Roivant Pharma, and Chair of Enzyvant’s Board of Directors. “We look forward to the potential of RVT-802 becoming available as an approved regenerative medicine to all families and patients who could benefit from it.”
Ms. Jacques will be presenting at Roivant Pipeline Day in New York City tomorrow, June 6, at 4:20 p.m. ET. To request access to the webcast or to learn more about Roivant Pipeline Day, please email pipelineday@roivant.com.
About RVT-802
RVT-802 is a novel investigational tissue-based regenerative therapy designed to treat primary immune deficiency resulting from pediatric congenital athymia. In a healthy, functioning immune system, T cells that start as stem cells in bone marrow become fully developed in the thymus. RVT-802 is designed to replicate this process in the absence of a thymus.
Derived from infant thymus tissue, RVT-802 is processed and cultured prior to implantation into a patient’s quadricep muscle. The patient’s bone marrow stem cells migrate to the implanted tissue product, where they are trained to become naïve, immunocompetent T cells. With the renewed ability to generate T cells, immune system function can be restored.
RVT-802 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Rare Pediatric Disease, and Orphan Drug designations by the FDA.
In 2016, Enzyvant entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Duke University to develop RVT-802. M. Louise Markert, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine, has led research on the treatment of immunodeficiency in patients with congenital athymia. The findings of Dr. Markert and her research team have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine as well as numerous other peer-reviewed scientific journals and clinical publications.

*Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HR+ / HER2-) metastatic breast cancer and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for this use. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for HR+ / HER2- metastatic breast cancer by any health authority worldwide.
About avelumab
Avelumab is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. Avelumab has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, avelumab has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.3-5 Avelumab has also been shown to induce NK cell-mediated direct tumor cell lysis via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro.5-7 In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab.
Avelumab Approved Indications
Avelumab (BAVENCIO®) in combination with axitinib is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO©) for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in more than 45 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.
Avelumab Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label

15441,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Calquence (acalabrutinib) in P-III ELEVATE-TN Trial for Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Calquence Phase III ELEVATE-TN trial met primary endpoint at interim analysis in previously-untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"The P-III ELEVATE-TN trial involves assessing of Calquence (100 mg bid) as monothx and + obinutuzumab vs chlorambucil + obinutuzumab in 535 patients in ratio (1:1:1) with previously untreated CLL
 The study resulted in meeting 1EPs & 2EPs with improvement in PFS as monothx & combination and was safe & well-tolerated when compared with the CT-based combination of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab
 Calquence is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor has received the US FDA’s accelerated approval in Oct 2017 for patients with 1L MCL in adults and is currently evaluated in multiple P-III trials in CLL including ASCEND, ELEVATE-TN, ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006)","Calquence alone or in combination significantly increased the time patients lived without disease progression
 

AstraZeneca today announced positive results from the Phase III ELEVATE-TN trial of Calquence (acalabrutinib) in patients with previously-untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most common type of leukaemia in adults.1 This is the second Calquence pivotal trial in CLL to meet its primary endpoint early, following the positive results of the ASCEND trial, announced in May.
The trial met its primary endpoint; Calquence in combination with obinutuzumab demonstrated a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with the chemotherapy-based combination of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab.
The trial also met a key secondary endpoint showing Calquence monotherapy achieved a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in PFS compared to the chemotherapy and obinutuzumab regimen.
The safety and tolerability of Calquence was consistent with its established profile.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D said: “These findings confirm the superiority of Calquence as a monotherapy and also in combination over standard-of-care treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The positive results from both the ELEVATE-TN and ASCEND trials will serve as the foundation for regulatory submissions later this year.”
AstraZeneca plans to present detailed results from ELEVATE-TN at a forthcoming medical meeting. Additionally, AstraZeneca will present full results from the Phase III ASCEND clinical trial in relapsed or refractory CLL as a late-breaking abstract at the upcoming European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress on 16 June 2019 (Abstract #LB2606).
Calquence is currently approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the US, Brazil, the UAE, and Qatar and is being developed for the treatment of CLL and other blood cancers.
About ELEVATE-TN
ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) is a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Calquence alone or in combination with obinutuzumab vs. chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in previously-untreated patients with CLL. In the trial, 535 patients were randomised (1:1:1) into three arms. Patients in the first arm received chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the second arm received Calquence (100mg twice daily until disease progression) in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the third arm received Calquence monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression).2
The primary endpoint is PFS in the Calquence and obinutuzumab arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm, assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and a key secondary endpoint is IRC-assessed PFS in the Calquencemonotherapy arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm. Other secondary endpoints include objective response rate, time to next treatment and overall survival.2
About Calquence
Calquence (acalabrutinib) was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Calquence is an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.3In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.
As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating Calquencein 26 company-sponsored clinical trials. Calquence is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma, and multiple myeloma and other haematologic malignancies. Several Phase III clinical trials in CLL are ongoing, including ASCEND, ELEVATE-TN, ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006) evaluating acalabrutinib vs. ibrutinib in patients with previously-treated high-risk CLL, and ACE-CL-311 evaluating acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax and with/without obinutuzumab in patients with previously-untreated CLL without 17p deletion or TP53 mutation.
About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 191,000 new cases globally and 20,720 new cases in the US annually, and prevalence that is expected to grow with improved treatment.1,4,5,6 In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections.1 As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.1 This could result in anaemia, infection and bleeding.1 B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.

15516,GSK's Nucala (mepolizumab) Receives FDA's Approval for its Two New Self-Administered Methods for Patients with SEA and EGPA,Nucala (mepolizumab) gains FDA approval for two new self-administration options,"The approval is based on P-IIIa studies (NCT03099096 & NCT03021304) assessing Nucala in-clinic and at home for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). Additionally, a study (NCT03014674) evaluated Nucala’s PK and PD via auto-injector & pre-filled syringe was comparable with approved lyophilised formulation
 The study resulted in 89-95% and 100% successful self-administered treatment with autoinjector and pre-filled syringe respectively post training of patients
 Nucala is a mAb that targets interleukin-5 (IL-5) available as an autoinjector/pre-filled syringe administered q4w and is approved in EU for pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 yrs. for SAE and in the US, Japan & Canada as an add-on maintenance treatment for EGPA","First anti-IL5 biologic to give healthcare professionals choice of how and where their patients receive treatment.
GlaxoSmithKline (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two new methods for administering Nucala (mepolizumab), an autoinjector and a pre-filled safety syringe, for patients or caregivers to administer once every four weeks, after a healthcare professional decides it is appropriate. This is the first anti-IL5 biologic to be licensed in the US for at-home administration, and the first respiratory biologic to be approved for administration via an autoinjector.
This approval will give healthcare professionals and people living with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) or the rare disease eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) the option for Nucala to be administered outside of a clinical setting by a patient or caregiver after their healthcare professional agrees this approach is appropriate. The original lyophilised powder version remains available for administration by a healthcare professional.
Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&D, GSK, said: “Nucala’s efficacy is well-established and this approval means that, for the first time, we are able to provide patients living with these debilitating conditions the option of receiving this important medicine in their own home.”
Tonya Winders, President, Global Allergy and Asthma Patient Platform (GAAPP), added: “People living with conditions like severe asthma often struggle to control their day-to-day symptoms, making routine activities like attending healthcare appointments a challenge. Empowering patients to take their medicines at home is an approach that has been successful in other chronic diseases such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. GAAPP welcomes this approval for Nucala so it can be administered in a doctor’s office or in the convenience of a patient’s home.”
The approval is supported by positive patient experience data from two open-label, single-arm, phase IIIa studies (NCT03099096 & NCT03021304) evaluating the real-world use of Nucala administered via the new options in-clinic and at home by patients with SEA, or by their caregivers. Both studies showed patients were able to successfully self-administer treatment with both the autoinjector and pre-filled syringe after appropriate training (89-95% and 100% respectively). In addition, the majority of patients preferred at home self-administration options compared to in-clinic administration.
A further open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study (NCT03014674) confirmed that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Nucala administered via pre-filled syringe or autoinjector was comparable to the originally approved lyophilised formulation.
Following this approval, it is expected that the new administration options for Nucala will be available in the US shortly.

About severe asthma and eosinophilic inflammation
Severe asthma is defined as asthma which requires treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming ‘uncontrolled’ or which remains ‘uncontrolled’ despite this therapy. Severe asthma patients are also often categorised by long-term use of oral corticosteroids (OCS). In a sub-set of severe asthma patients, the over-production of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) is known to cause inflammation in the lungs. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. Studies suggest that approximately 60% of patients with severe asthma have eosinophilic airway inflammation.

About eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome, is a chronic rare disease that is caused by inflammation in the walls of small-to-medium sized blood vessels (vasculitis). Approximately five people out of every one million will be diagnosed with EGPA each year worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 14-45 per million. The mean age of diagnosis is 48 years, and the disease can be life-threatening for some patients. In EGPA, patients usually develop asthma initially, before the vasculitis extends to inflammation in the walls of small blood vessels that supply tissues in the lungs, sinuses, skin, nerves and other organs. EGPA can result in damage to multiple organs in the body.

About Nucala (mepolizumab)
First approved in 2015 for severe eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab is the first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets IL-5. It is believed to work by preventing IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils. Inhibiting IL-5 binding in this way reduces blood eosinophils.
Mepolizumab has been developed for the treatment of diseases that are driven by inflammation caused by eosinophils. It has been studied in over 3,000 patients in 21 clinical trials across a number of eosinophilic indications and has been approved (under the brand name Nucala) in the US, Europe and in over 20 other markets, as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. It is also the only anti-IL5 biologic therapy approved for paediatric use from aged six to 17 in Europe in severe eosinophilic asthma. In the US, Japan and Canada and a number of other markets, it is approved as add-on maintenance treatment for patients with EGPA. Mepolizumab is currently being investigated for severe hypereosinophilic syndrome, nasal polyposis and COPD.
In the US, Nucala (100mg fixed dose subcutaneous injection of mepolizumab) is licensed as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma aged 12 years and older, and with an eosinophilic phenotype. Nucala (3x 100mg subcutaneous injection of mepolizumab) is licensed for the treatment of adult patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Nucala is not approved for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Full US Prescribing Information is available at US Prescribing Information Nucala.
Nucala injection is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare provider. A patient may self-inject or the patient caregiver may administer Nucala injection subcutaneously after the healthcare provider determines it is appropriate. The healthcare provider should provide proper training in subcutaneous injection technique and on the preparation and administration of Nucala injection prior to use according to the “Instructions for Use”.

Important safety information for Nucala (mepolizumab)
The following information is based on the US Prescribing Information for Nucala. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labelled safety information for Nucala.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Nucala should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to mepolizumab or excipients in the formulation.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, rash) have occurred following administration of Nucala. These reactions generally occur within hours of administration but in some instances can have a delayed onset (i.e. days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, Nucala should be discontinued.
Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease
Nucala should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, or acute bronchospasm.
Opportunistic Infections: Herpes Zoster
In controlled clinical trials, 2 serious adverse reactions of herpes zoster occurred in subjects treated with Nucala compared to none in placebo. Consider varicella vaccination if medically appropriate prior to starting therapy with Nucala.
Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage
Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) abruptly upon initiation of therapy with Nucala. Decreases in corticosteroid doses, if appropriate, should be gradual and under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.
Parasitic (Helminth) Infection
It is unknown if Nucala will influence a patient’s response against parasites. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with Nucala. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with Nucala and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with Nucala until infection resolves.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (≥3% and more common than placebo) reported in the first 24 weeks of two clinical trials with Nucala (and placebo) were: headache, 19% (18%); injection site reaction, 8% (3%); back pain, 5% (4%); fatigue, 5% (4%); influenza, 3% (2%); urinary tract infection 3% (2%); abdominal pain upper, 3% (2%); pruritus, 3% (2%); eczema, 3% (<1%); and muscle spasm, 3% (<1%).
Systemic Reactions, including Hypersensitivity Reactions: In 3 clinical trials, 3% of subjects who received Nucala experienced systemic (allergic and nonallergic) reactions compared to 5% in the placebo group. Systemic allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 1% of subjects who received Nucala compared to 2% of subjects in the placebo group. Manifestations included rash, pruritus, headache, and myalgia. Systemic nonallergic reactions were reported by 2% of subjects who received Nucala and 3% of subjects in the placebo group. Manifestations included rash, flushing, and myalgia. A majority of the systemic reactions were experienced on the day of dosing. Reports of anaphylaxis have been received postmarketing.
Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, swelling, itching, burning sensation) occurred at a rate of 8% in subjects treated with Nucala compared with 3% in subjects treated with placebo.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
The data on pregnancy exposures from the clinical trials are insufficient to inform on drug-associated risk. Monoclonal antibodies, such as mepolizumab, are progressively transported across the placenta in a linear fashion as pregnancy progresses; therefore, potential effects on a foetus are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

15526,Novartis Reports Histology Data of CFZ533 (iscalimab) in Kidney Transplantation for Extended Survival of Transplanted Organs,Novartis presents first-of-its-kind histology data with iscalimab (CFZ533) suggesting the extended survival of transplanted organs may be possible,"The study involves assessing of calcineurin-free treatment with iscalimab vs tacrolimus to test the durability of transplanted kidney grafts and improve long-term outcomes for kidney transplant patients
 The study resulted in 60% normal kidney histology@1 year for iscalimab-treated transplant patients with lower chronic allograft damage index (CADI) scores, Presented at American Transplant Congress (ATC) 2019
 Iscalimab is a mAb that prevents CD40 pathway signaling, further activates CD40+ cell types and is currently evaluated in P-IIb trial (Cirrus I, NCT03663335)","Data show 60% of iscalimab-treated transplant patients have normal kidney histology at least 1 year after transplant vs 0% with tacrolimus (current standard of care)[1]
Less than half of donated kidneys last 10 years, so durability is a significant unmet need for patients who are living with or waiting for a transplant[2]. More than 100,000 patients are on the US transplant waiting list with a chronic shortfall of donors[3]
Data was presented at the American Transplant Congress (ATC), June 1-5, as a late-breaking abstract
 
Basel, June 6, 2019 – Novartis announced today new early stage histology data in kidney transplantation, suggesting that with investigational compound iscalimab (CFZ533) it may be possible to prolong the durability of transplanted kidneys as well as to potentially improve long-term outcomes for kidney transplant patients[1].
“Extending the life of transplanted kidneys would mean fewer patients going back on dialysis or needing a second transplant – relieving pressure on waiting lists that in the US are already three-to-five years long,” said Eric Hughes, Global Development Unit Head, Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology. “In our journey to reimagine care for patients, I’m excited about the potential of durable transplants becoming a reality.”
The data, presented at the American Transplant Congress (ATC) examines whether calcineurin-free treatment with iscalimab preserves the quality of transplanted kidney grafts. In this analysis, iscalimab demonstrated lower chronic allograft damage index (CADI) scores compared with tacrolimus (current standard-of-care), with normal renal histology seen in three of five patients (60%) on iscalimab vs none of seven on tacrolimus[1]. Low CADI scores have been associated with improved long-term outcomes[4]. The findings, although in a limited number of patients, are to be confirmed in an ongoing Phase IIb trial (Cirrus I, NCT03663335).
About iscalimab (CFZ533)
Iscalimab is a new, fully human, monoclonal antibody preventing cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) pathway signaling and activation of CD40+ cell types[1]. In a recent multicenter, randomized control trial (NCT02217410), with the primary endpoint of non-inferiority on the composite endpoint, iscalimab therapy showed non-inferiority on a composite clinical endpoint, improved renal function, reduced risk for new onset diabetes and similar safety compared with tacrolimus[5]. The analysis presented at the ATC included patients from this study that underwent either routine biopsies or biopsies as part of a follow-up protocol. The data was reviewed and scored by a blinded pathologist using the established Banff criteria and CADI. A CADI of 1 or less was considered as ‘normal renal histology’. The average CADI at final biopsy was 1.6 ±0.6 for iscalimab and 5.1 ±0.8 for tacrolimus[1].

15539,Novartis' LysaKare (arginine hydrochloride/lysine hydrochloride) Solution Receives CHMP's Positive Opinion for Reduction of Kidney Exposure to Radiation During PPRT with Lutathera,Advanced Accelerator Applications Receives Positive CHMP Opinion for LysaKare,"The positive opinion recommendation follows the study assessing arginine and lysine of same content as LysaKare, evaluating its safety and efficacy
 The EC will review CHMP’s opinion with its expected results within three months, if approved will be a novel solution of this concentration available in EU 
 LysaKare 25g/25g is a solution to reduce kidney exposure during PRRT with Lutathera (lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide) in adults. Lutathera is indicated to treat unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated (G1 and G2), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) in adults and is approved as PPRT in EU in Sep 2017","Advanced Accelerator Applications Receives Positive CHMP Opinion for LysaKare® for Reduction of Kidney Exposure to Radiation During Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with Lutetium (177Lu) Oxodotreotide (Lutathera®)

Saint-Genis-Pouilly, France, June 5, 2019 – Advanced Accelerator Applications S.A. (AAA), a Novartis company, today announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization of LysaKare®25g/25g (arginine hydrochloride/lysine hydrochloride) solution for reduction of renal (kidney) radiation exposure during peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide (Lutathera®) in adults. If approved by the European Commission, LysaKare would be the first commercially registered arginine hydrochloride/lysine hydrochloride amino acid solution of this concentration available in Europe.
Lutathera, indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated (G1 and G2), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) in adults, was the first PRRT ever approved by the European Commission in September 2017. Lutathera PRRT includes a targeting molecule attached to a radioactive component. The kidneys are the primary dose limiting organs for PRRT with Lutathera, and a lysine and arginine amino acid solution is co-administered to patients to reduce renal uptake and retention of Lutathera, thus reducing renal radiation exposure by approximately 50% and mitigating the risk for radiation-induced renal injury.
“LysaKare was developed to enhance patient safety and comfort during PRRT with Lutathera,” noted Germo Gericke, M.D., Head of Research and Development for Advanced Accelerator Applications. “This positive opinion by the CHMP supports our commitment to providing the best and most comprehensive care possible.”
Clinical efficacy and safety for arginine and lysine are based on published literature of studies using solutions with the same arginine and lysine content as LysaKare. There are limited data on the safety profile of arginine and lysine solution for infusion without concomitant administration of PRRT, which also includes the use of anti-emetics as pre-medication and often the concomitant use of short acting somatostatin analogues. The main adverse reactions which are related mainly to the amino acid solution are nausea (approximately 25%), vomiting (approximately 10%) and hyperkalaemia. These adverse reactions are mostly mild to moderate.
The European Commission (EC) takes binding decisions on the authorization of medicines valid throughout the EU. It bases its decisions on scientific assessments by the CHMP, ensuring that medicines comply with high quality, safety and efficacy standards. If approved by the EC, the centralized marketing authorization will be valid in the 28 countries that are members of the EU. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as members of the European Economic Area (EEA), will take corresponding decisions based on the EC’s recommendation.
The European Commission will review the CHMP opinion and is expected to deliver its final decision within three months. The decision will be applicable to all 28 European Union member states plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

 The P-III PRONTO-T1D & PRONTO-T2D studies resulted in meeting its 1EPs i.e, A1C reduction at mealtime @26wks., longer time in range(43.6+ mins), reduction in blood glucose spikes in both T1D and T2D followed by test meal @1hrs. & 2hrs. (-27.9 mg/dL and -11.8 mg/dL) & (-31.2 mg/dL and -17.4 mg/dL) respectively

Pivotal phase 3 data in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes presented at the American Diabetes Association’s<span>®</span> 79th Scientific Sessions<span>®</span>

INDIANAPOLIS, June 9, 2019 /- Two phase 3 studies show that Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) ultra rapid lispro (URLi) provided non-inferior A1C reductions compared to Humalog® (insulin lispro) at 26 weeks in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The data from these treat-to-target studies showed URLi also significantly reduced the rise in blood glucose one hour and two hours after a test meal compared to Humalog.1,2 Additional data from the study in people with type 1 diabetes demonstrated URLi significantly improved glucose time in range during the day.3 URLi is an investigational novel mealtime insulin formulation being developed to better manage blood glucose levels. These data and several other studies were presented at the American Diabetes Association’s® 79th Scientific Sessions®.
The two phase 3 studies, PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D, evaluated the safety and efficacy of URLi compared to Humalog in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Both studies met the primary endpoint of non-inferior A1C reduction from baseline compared to Humalog at 26 weeks, when the insulins were dosed at mealtime. Further, URLi demonstrated superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both one hour (-27.9 mg/dL [T1D], -11.8 mg/dL [T2D]) and two hours (-31.2 mg/dL [T1D] and -17.4 mg/dL [T2D]) after a test meal compared to Humalog.1,2
Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin. The studies showed no significant difference in severe, nocturnal or overall hypoglycemia rates reported by study participants.1,2
“Many people taking mealtime insulin are not meeting their A1C goals while also experiencing high blood glucose levels after eating. This may create worry about their ability to achieve good control,” said Bruce Bode, MD, FACE, diabetes specialist at Atlanta Diabetes Associates.4 “The results from these two studies suggest that URLi may help control blood glucose after meals, as well as help people reach A1C goals.”
The PRONTO studies were designed as treat-to-target, which enables clinicians to determine differences in other important treatment effects – such as rates of hypoglycemia, post-meal glucose control and glucose time in range – at the same level of glycemic control. A sub-set of participants in PRONTO-T1D were evaluated using blinded continuous glucose monitoring to provide more complete information on daily blood glucose patterns. At 26 weeks, URLi demonstrated a significantly better blood glucose profile up to four hours after breakfast compared to Humalog. The study further showed that URLi had significantly longer (+43.6 minutes) time in range (71-180 mg/dL) during the day and similar time in range during the night compared to Humalog.3
Data from a phase 1 clinical pharmacology study in people with type 1 diabetes also demonstrated URLi’s effect on post-meal blood glucose control. Results showed URLi was absorbed significantly faster into the blood stream compared to Humalog, insulin aspart and fast-acting insulin aspart. URLi also showed lower blood glucose spikes after a test meal compared to the insulins tested, which was significant compared to Humalog and insulin aspart. Additionally, the early blood glucose profile with URLi closely matched that of participants without diabetes.5
“We’re developing URLi to provide a mealtime insulin option that more closely mirrors the way insulin works in people without diabetes,” said Tom Hardy, MD, PhD, senior medical director at Lilly. “If approved, URLi will offer a new mealtime insulin option that, in clinical trials, showed similar A1C reductions to Humalog with significant improvements in post-meal blood glucose after a test meal.”
Lilly submitted applications for URLi with regulatory authorities in Europe and Japan and plans to submit in the U.S. later this year.
About the PRONTO Studies
PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D were randomized, double-blind, controlled, treat-to-target comparisons of ultra rapid lispro (URLi) and Humalog (insulin lispro), both in combination with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The primary objective of each study, conducted in 1,222 and 673 participants, respectively, was to evaluate whether URLi is non-inferior to Humalog in reducing A1C from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment. Key endpoints were adjusted for multiple testing, including the comparisons of one and two hour post-prandial glucose and A1C superiority.
Important Safety Information for Humalog
What is the most important information I should know about Humalog?
Do not share your Humalog KwikPen, Humalog Junior KwikPen, cartridges, reusable pen compatible with Lilly 3 mL cartridges, or syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them.
Do not change the insulin you use without talking to your healthcare provider. Changes may make you more likely to experience low or high blood glucose. Changes should be made cautiously under the supervision of your healthcare provider.
Test your blood glucose levels as your healthcare provider instructs.
Your insulin dose may need to change because of illness, stress, other medicines you take, change in diet, or change in physical activity or exercise.
When used in a pump, do not mix or dilute Humalog with any other insulin or liquid.
Who should not take Humalog?

Do not take Humalog if your blood glucose is too low (hypoglycemia) or if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the ingredients in Humalog.
Before using Humalog, what should I tell my healthcare providers?

About all of your medical conditions, including liver, kidney, or heart failure or other heart problems.
If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.
About all the medicines you take, including prescription (especially ones commonly called TZDs [thiazolidinediones]) and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
How should I use Humalog?

Humalog is a rapid-acting insulin. Take Humalog within fifteen minutes before eating or right after eating a meal.
Always make sure you receive the correct type of Humalog from the pharmacy.
Do not use Humalog if it is cloudy, colored, or has solid particles or clumps in it.
Inject Humalog under your skin (subcutaneously). Never inject into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) your injection site with each dose. Make sure you inject the correct insulin and dose.
Do not re-use needles. Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles can cause you to receive the wrong dose of Humalog and result in infection.
Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how Humalog affects you. Do not use alcohol while using Humalog.
What are the possible side effects of Humalog?

Severe low blood glucose can cause unconsciousness (passing out), seizures, and death. Low blood glucose is the most common side effect. There are many causes of low blood glucose, including taking too much Humalog. It is important to treat it quickly. You can treat mild to moderate low blood glucose by drinking or eating a quick source of glucose right away. Symptoms may be different for each person. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about low blood glucose symptoms and treatment.
Severe life-threatening allergic reactions (whole-body reactions) can happen. Get medical help right away if you develop a rash over your whole body, have trouble breathing, have a fast heartbeat, or are sweating.
Humalog can cause life-threatening low potassium in your blood (hypokalemia), which can cause severe breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and death.
Serious side effects can include swelling of your hands and feet and heart failure when taking certain pills called thiazolidinediones or “TZDs” with Humalog. This may occur in some people even if they have not had heart problems before. Tell your healthcare provider if you have shortness of breath, swelling of your ankles or feet, or sudden weight gain, which may be symptoms of heart failure. Your healthcare provider may need to adjust or stop your treatment with TZDs or Humalog.
Failure of your insulin pump or infusion set or degradation of the insulin in the pump can cause hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Always carry an alternate form of insulin administration in case of pump failure.
The most common side effects of Humalog include low blood glucose, allergic reactions, including reactions at your injection site, skin thickening or pits at the injection site (lipodystrophy), itching, and rash. These are not all of the possible side effects. Ask your healthcare provider for more information or for medical advice about side effects.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.
Humalog is available by prescription only.

 The focus of the acquisition is to strengthen Merck’s footprint with the addition of Tilos’ antibodies modulating TGFβ portfolio targeting cancer, fibrosis and autoimmune diseases
 TGFβ is a cytokine secreted as a complex with the protein, latency-associated peptide (LAP). Tilos Therapeutics was founded by the collaboration of BI Venture Fund and Partners Innovation Fund","KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tilos Therapeutics, a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics targeting the latent TGFβ complex for the treatment of cancer, fibrosis and autoimmune diseases.
“At Merck we continue to enhance our robust pipeline through active execution of our business development strategy,” said Dr. Dean Li, senior vice president, discovery and translational medicine, Merck Research Laboratories. “Tilos has developed a compelling portfolio of candidates that employ a novel approach to modulating the potent signaling molecule TGFβ by binding to latency-associated peptide, with potential applications across a range of disease indications.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all outstanding shares of Tilos for total potential consideration of up to $773 million, including an upfront payment as well as contingent milestone payments.
“We are proud that the Tilos team has advanced the discoveries of our scientific founders by developing a portfolio of anti-LAP antibodies designed to realize the full potential of TGFβ-modulating therapeutics,” said Dr. Barbara Fox, CEO, Tilos. “This agreement with Merck, an industry leader in biopharmaceutical research and development, provides meaningful validation for our therapeutic approach and best positions our pipeline for broad clinical and commercial success.”

About TGFβ and LAP
TGFβ is a potent cytokine believed to play an important role in the development of cancer and fibrotic diseases. TGFβ is secreted as a complex with the protein, latency-associated peptide (LAP). LAP forms a cage around TGFβ, holding the cytokine in an inactive state until it is deployed. Evidence has shown that anti-LAP antibodies block the release of TGFβ from the TGFβ-LAP complex with the potential to provide a novel therapeutic mechanism to reduce TGFβ activity.

 Loop is an automated insulin delivery app for iOS, connecting to an insulin pump and CGM using Bluetooth, adjusting a basal rate of user for next 30mins., thus avoiding high and low blood glucose levels and allowing a user to control their pump with smart devices","DUBLIN and PALO ALTO, Calif. – June 7, 2019 – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, services and solutions, and Tidepool, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to making diabetes data more accessible, actionable and meaningful, have agreed to work together to create an interoperable automated insulin pump system. Medtronic will develop a future Bluetooth-enabled MiniMed(TM) pump that would be compatible with Tidepool Loop, a future FDA-regulated, open source automated insulin delivery app for iPhone® and Apple Watch® currently in development.
“We think that Medtronic is making a very bold and important move here that shows tremendous courage and is the absolutely right thing for the diabetes community,” said Howard Look, founder and CEO of Tidepool. “Medtronic makes incredibly robust and reliable pump hardware, and they have extensive marketing, sales, and support organizations for people with diabetes and for healthcare providers. This network can help bring closed-loop systems to more people living with diabetes.”
As part of the agreement, Medtronic will contribute financial support to Tidepool for the integration development effort and develop a software development kit to enable iPhone to pump communication. Both companies will be working closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the regulatory process to garner approvals for both the Tidepool Loop app and the future Bluetooth-enabled MiniMed(TM) pump that will work with Tidepool Loop. This includes pursuing iCGM (Integrated Continuous Glucose Monitoring) classification for the Guardian(TM) Sensor 3 and ACE (Alternate Controller Enabled) pump classification for a future Bluetooth-enabled MiniMed pump. This would enable an FDA-cleared interoperable system – with ACE pump and iCGM sensor components – that may be mixed and matched with the Tidepool Loop app as the user chooses.
“We have been listening and engaging with the diabetes community to understand what is important to them. We recognize that collaboration with Tidepool is a way to further drive industry innovation,” said Ali Dianaty, vice president of research and development for the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. “Working with Tidepool and supporting interoperability, we can increase the options available for people with diabetes to manage their condition as they seek out solutions that help them achieve better health and improve quality of life.”
Tidepool Loop will be an automated insulin delivery app for iPhone and Apple Watch that connects to an insulin pump and CGM using Bluetooth LE. It runs an algorithm every five minutes to adjust a user’s basal rate for the next 30 minutes, with the goal to help reduce or avoid high and low blood glucose. Tidepool intends to deliver Tidepool Loop as an FDA-regulated product, broadly available via the iOS App Store, compatible with multiple, in-warranty pumps and CGMs.

 The P-Ib/II GO29365 study results: CRR (40% vs 18%); objective response (45% vs 18%); DOR lasting at least 6mos. (64% vs 30%); DOR lasting at least a year (48% vs 20%)
 Polivy is an anti-CD79b anti-body drug conjugate and has received FDA’s PR designation in Feb’19 with FDA’s BT & EMA’s PRIME designation in 2017 for r/r DLBCL","New targeted medicine shown to improve clinical outcomes in people with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma compared to a commonly used regimen
First-in-class antibody-drug conjugate that specifically targets CD79b, a protein expressed in the majority of B-cells
Ninth indication with Breakthrough Therapy Designation in Roche’s haematology portfolio to receive FDA approval
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to Polivy™ (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq) in combination with bendamustine plus Rituxan® (rituximab) (BR) for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have received at least two prior therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on complete response rates observed in a randomised, controlled clinical trial. The FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program allows conditional approval of a medicine that fills an unmet medical need for a serious condition. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
“Despite meaningful progress in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, treatment options are very limited when the disease is refractory to or recurrent after multiple regimens,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Today’s approval of this Polivy combination will provide a novel treatment that is both immediately available and very much needed for people with this aggressive disease.”
The accelerated approval of Polivy was based on the results from the phase Ib/II GO29365 study. This is the first and only randomised pivotal clinical trial to show higher response rates over BR, a commonly used regimen, in people with R/R DLBCL who are ineligible for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant. Results of the study showed that 40% of people treated with Polivy plus BR achieved a complete response (n=16/40; 95% CI: 25-57), meaning no cancer could be detected at the time of assessment, compared to 18% with BR alone (n=7/40; 95% CI: 7-33). Complete response rates were assessed by independent review committee. The study also showed that 45% of people on Polivy plus BR achieved an objective response at the end of treatment (n=18/40; 95% CI: 29-62), compared to 18% of people treated with BR alone (n=7/40; 95% CI: 7-33). Of the people treated with Polivy plus BR who achieved a complete or partial response, 64% (n=16/25) had a duration of response (DOR) lasting at least six months as compared to 30% (n=3/10) of people treated with BR alone. Additionally, 48% (n=12/25) of people treated with Polivy plus BR had a DOR lasting at least a year as compared to 20% (n=2/10) of people treated with BR alone. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of patients, and at least 5% more frequently in patients treated with Polivy plus BR compared to BR alone, included low white blood cell count, low platelet levels, low red blood cell count, numbness, tingling or pain in the hands and feet, diarrhoea, fever, decreased appetite and pneumonia.
The US FDA granted Priority Review for the company’s Biologics License Application for Polivy in February 2019. Priority Review designation is granted to medicines that the FDA considers to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. In addition, Polivy was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of people with R/R DLBCL in 2017. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines intended to treat a serious condition with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies.

About the GO29365 study
GO29365 is a global, phase Ib/II randomised study evaluating the safety, tolerability and activity of Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq) in combination with bendamustine and Rituxan (rituximab) (BR) or Gazyva (obinutuzumab) in relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Eligible patients were not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant at study entry. The phase II part of the study randomised 80 patients with heavily pre-treated R/R DLBCL to receive either BR, or BR in combination with Polivy for a fixed duration of six 21-day cycles. Patients enrolled had received a median of two prior therapies (a range of 1-7 prior therapies in the Polivy arm and range of 1-5 prior therapies in the BR alone arm). The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) at the end of treatment, as measured by positron emission tomography and assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR; CR and partial response) by investigator assessment and best ORR at the end of treatment by investigator and IRC assessment. Exploratory endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, event-free survival and overall survival.

About Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq)
Polivy is a first-in-class anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The CD79b protein is expressed specifically in the majority of B-cells (an immune cell impacted in some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)), making it a promising target for the development of new therapies.1,2 Polivy binds to CD79b and destroys these B-cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent, which is thought to minimise the effects on normal cells.3,4 Polivy is being developed by Roche using Seattle Genetics ADC technology and is currently being investigated for the treatment of several types of NHL.

About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about one in three cases of NHL.5 DLBCL is an aggressive (fast-growing) type of NHL, which is generally responsive to treatment in the frontline.6 However, as many as 40% of patients will relapse, at which time salvage therapy options are limited and survival is short.1,4 Approximately 150,000 people worldwide are estimated to be diagnosed with DLBCL each year.7

15662,Eli Lilly Reports Results of Taltz (ixekizumab) in 5 Years P-III Study for Plaque Psoriasis #WCD2019ï»¿,Present 5-Year Sustained Efficacy and Safety Results for Taltz (ixekizumab) in Patients with Plaque Psoriasis at the World Congress Lilly to of Dermatology,"The P-III study results involves assessing of Taltz in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for 5yrs.in addition to an extension study UNCOVER-1
 Collective results: 90%+ maintained skin clearance as measured by PASI 75; @264wks. PASI 75 (94.3); PASI 90 (81.8%); PASI 100 (46.6%), presented at WCD with additional data of UNCOVER-3 study
 Taltz (80mg/ml, pre-filled syringe) is a mAb act by targeting IL-17A, being studied in 13 clinical studies in 17,000+ patients under Taltz clinical study program and is an approved therapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy","INDIANAPOLIS, June 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today the company will present positive, five-year Phase 3 data for Taltz® (ixekizumab). Patients with moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis who continued to receive Taltz maintained high levels of skin clearance with no unexpected safety outcomes for up to five years of treatment. These data will be presented at the World Congress of Dermatology (WCD) in Milan, Italy on June 11.
“Of patients who continued to take Taltz through five years in the extension period of this study, more than 90 percent maintained significant skin clearance as measured by PASI 75 and almost half of patients maintained completely clear skin,” said Craig Leonardi, M.D., lead investigator of the study and adjunct professor of dermatology at St. Louis University School of Medicine. “These results demonstrate that patients taking Taltz can achieve sustained skin clearance over the five-year treatment period.”
Patients who were static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) 0/1 responders at Week 12 and who completed 60 weeks of treatment could enter the open-label extension period of UNCOVER-1 (n=110). In the extension period of the study, Taltz demonstrated sustained response from Week 60 through Week 264 in patients who continuously received on-label dosing (160 mg starting dose, 80 mg every two weeks [Q2W] through Week 12, and every four weeks [Q4W] thereafter). Response rates were maintained over the five-year period, with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 90 and 100 response rates of 94.3 percent, 81.8 percent and 46.6 percent, respectively at week 264.
“Lilly is committed to helping people living with immune-mediated diseases, including moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis,” said Rhonda Pacheco, Pharm.D., global brand development leader for immunology at Lilly. “These results reaffirm that the high levels of skin clearance Taltz can provide early in treatment may be sustained over a long period of time.”
During Weeks 60-264, treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with previous studies of Taltz from the UNCOVER program. Additionally, there were no new or unexpected safety findings during the extension period. Four-year data from UNCOVER-3 will also be presented at the WCD.
The Taltz safety profile has been studied in 13 clinical trials in moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis with a total exposure of more than 17,000 patient-years as part of the Taltz clinical trial program.
Later this year, Lilly plans to announce the results from IXORA-R, a clinical trial designed to evaluate superiority between Taltz and Tremfya® (guselkumab) in adult patients with moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR TALTZ
Taltz is approved for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. Taltz is also approved to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TALTZ
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections
Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.
Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis
Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
Hypersensitivity
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each ≤0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group (Crohn’s disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than in the placebo group (0%) during clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease.
Immunizations
Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions (>1%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis was consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis.

 The study results demonstrated 81% improvement in symptoms with no SAEs & minimal side effects. Additionally, it shows that 70% patients failed to improve with an average of four medications trialed, prior to IBM-Stim treatment
 The IB-Stim is a non-surgical device, works by sending electrical impulses into cranial nerve bundle in ear and targets brain areas associated with pain and aids in functional abdominal pain in IBS","Innovative Health Solution’s IB-Stim is first treatment indicated to reduce functional abdominal pain in children with IBS
 
INDIANAPOLIS – Innovative Health Solutions, Inc. (IHS) announced today FDA clearance for its new device – IB-Stim – to treat functional abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in patients ages 11-18. IBS is one of the leading causes of abdominal pain in children.
“This is a monumental day for the millions of children suffering from functional abdominal pain related to IBS, along with their parents and clinical providers,” said IHS Chief Executive Officer Brian Carrico. “We know how debilitating this condition can be, and we are proud to release IB-Stim as the first FDA indicated treatment option for this patient population.”
The IB-Stim is a non-surgical device that is placed behind the patient’s ear during an outpatient visit and works by sending gentle electrical impulses into cranial nerve bundles located in the ear. This stimulation targets brain areas involved in processing pain and aids in the reduction of functional abdominal pain associated with IBS.
The FDA based its decision on a double blind, randomized, controlled trial which was designed to measure the effects of IB-Stim compared to placebo on several aspects of pain including worst pain and the pain-frequency-severity-duration composite score. The study also measured patients’ overall symptom improvement based on the Symptom Response Scale. The study showed that prior to IB-Stim treatment, 70 percent of patients had failed to improve with an average of four medications trialed. Patients treated with IB-Stim demonstrated an 81 percent improvement in global symptoms with no serious adverse events, and minimal to no side effects.
“We are thrilled that the laboratory studies translated to the clinical side,” said Dr. Adrian Miranda, chief medical officer for IHS. “This is an example of true translational research. We are committed to improving the lives of children and their families and couldn’t be happier with the FDA’s decision.”
With FDA indication, IB-Stim is now available for medical providers. Click here for more information about IB-Stim.

 Skyrizi is an IgG1 mAb targeting IL-23, inhibiting its binding with p19 subunit and has received EU’s approval for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy","Longer-term results from IMMhance showed 73 percent and 72 percent of patients treated with continuous SKYRIZI™ (risankizumab) experienced complete skin clearance (defined as sPGA 0 and PASI 100, respectively) at week 94, among patients who achieved sPGA 0/1 at week 28 [1] 
– No new safety findings observed at two years (104 weeks) [1] 
– SKYRIZI, a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody designed to selectively inhibit IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit, is approved by the European Medicines Agency to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy [2,3]
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., June 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced new results showing a significant number of patients treated with SKYRIZI™ (risankizumab) experienced complete skin clearance at week 94.1 In the study, at week 28 patients who achieved a static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) were re-randomized to continue treatment with SKYRIZI or withdrawal.1 After 94 weeks of continuous treatment with SKYRIZI, 73 percent and 72 percent of these patients achieved a sPGA score of clear (sPGA 0) and a 100 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100), respectively, compared to 2 percent of patients re-randomized to withdrawal (p<0.001).1 These two-year results (up to 104 weeks) from the Phase 3 IMMhance study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of SKYRIZI in adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, will be presented today at the 24th World Congress of Dermatology (WCD) in Milan.
“Results show that SKYRIZI has the potential to provide long-term relief from the signs and symptoms of psoriasis,” said Marek Honczarenko, M.D., Ph. D., vice president, immunology development, AbbVie. “Our studies demonstrated that SKYRIZI can not only offer complete skin clearance at two years of treatment for the majority of patients, but re-treatment with SKYRIZI following a relapse can help patients regain skin clearance in just 16 weeks. We are pleased to add positive long-term data to the growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety profile of SKYRIZI for adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.”
SKYRIZI is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.
There were two phases in the IMMhance study.1 Results from the first phase were previously reported and showed that after 16 weeks of treatment, SKYRIZI (n=407) met the co-primary endpoints of PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 versus placebo (n=100) (p<0.001).1 The second phase (week 28 through week 104) evaluated the efficacy and safety of continuous therapy with SKYRIZI versus randomized withdrawal, as well as re-treatment.1 Patients who achieved sPGA 0/1 at week 28 with SKYRIZI were re-randomized to continue SKYRIZI (n=111) every 12 weeks or to withdrawal (n=225).1 The primary endpoint from the second phase of the study, sPGA 0/1, was also met at one year (52 weeks) (p<0.001).1
For those re-randomized to continue SKYRIZI, the last dose was given at week 88.1 Between one year (week 52) and week 94, the proportion of these patients who achieved complete skin clearance continued to increase.1 sPGA 0 and PASI 100 responses increased from 65 percent and 64 percent at week 52 to 73 percent and 72 percent at week 94, respectively (p<0.001).1 At two years, 81 percent and 78 percent of patients treated with continuous SKYRIZI maintained clear or almost clear skin (sPGA 0/1 or PASI 90) compared to 7 percent and 4 percent re-randomized to withdrawal, respectively (p<0.001).1
Among patients re-randomized to withdrawal who experienced a loss of response (defined as a sPGA score of moderate to severe [≥3]) on or after week 32 (n=153), 84 percent regained clear or almost clear skin (sPGA 0/1) after 16 weeks of re-treatment with SKYRIZI.1
“In the IMMhance study, SKYRIZI provided an increasing number of patients with complete skin clearance up to 94 weeks,” said Melinda Gooderham, M.D., dermatologist and medical director at the SKiN Centre for Dermatology in Peterborough, Ontario and a study investigator. “SKYRIZI not only offers relief from the signs and symptoms of psoriasis following a withdrawal from medication, but the study further demonstrates the significant rates of complete skin clearance that can be achieved with continuous treatment at the recommended dose. These data underscore the lasting impact this new treatment option could provide for people living with psoriasis.”
No new safety findings were observed in patients who continued with SKYRIZI for two years compared with those who withdrew to placebo at week 28.1 Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar to placebo at week 16 and remained stable over time in patients treated with SKYRIZI.1
About the Phase 3 IMMhance Study1
The IMMhance study is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SKYRIZI compared to placebo in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In the first phase, patients were randomized 4:1 to SKYRIZI (n=407)(150 mg), given as a subcutaneous injection at baseline, 4 weeks later and every 12 weeks thereafter, or placebo (n=100). In the second phase of this study (week 28 through week 104), patients originally randomized to SKYRIZI who achieved sPGA 0/1 at week 28 were re-randomized to SKYRIZI (maintenance, n=111) or placebo (withdrawal, n=225). Safety was assessed in all patients. Patients received their last dose of SKYRIZI at week 88 and follow up was conducted until week 104.
This Phase 3 study was conducted in cooperation between AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim. More information on this trial can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02672852).
About SKYRIZI (risankizumab) in the European Union3
SKYRIZI (risankizumab) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.
Important EU Safety Information3
SKYRIZI is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. SKYRIZI may increase the risk of infection. In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, SKYRIZI should be used with caution. Treatment with SKYRIZI should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.
Prior to initiating treatment with SKYRIZI, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving SKYRIZI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating SKYRIZI in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.
Prior to initiating therapy with SKYRIZI, completion of all appropriate immunizations should be considered according to current immunization guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with SKYRIZI. Patients treated with SKYRIZI should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections, which occurred in 13 percent of patients. Commonly (greater than or equal to 1/100 to less than 1/10) reported adverse reactions included tinea infections, headache, pruritus, fatigue and injection site reactions.

15688,Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim Report Cardiovascular Outcomes of Tradjenta (linagliptin) in CAROLINA Study for Type 2 Diabetes,Detailed findings from CAROLINA outcome trial support long-term cardiovascular safety profile of Tradjenta®,"(NCT01243424) study results involve assessing of Tradjenta (5mg, qd) vs glimepiride in patients with type2 diabetes across 43 countries for 6+years
 The CAROLINA study resulted in meeting its 1EPs i.e, occurrence of 3P-MACE (11.8% vs 12.0%), 3P-MACE + 4P-MACE (13.2% vs 13.3%), 2EPs (16.0% vs 10.2%), 77% reduction in risk of hypoglycemia; no new safety signals is observed
 Tradjenta is dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor indicated with diet and exercise to reduce blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes","– CAROLINA® demonstrated no increased cardiovascular risk for Tradjenta® (linagliptin) versus glimepiride in the only active-comparator cardiovascular outcome trial for a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor– Adults with diabetes treated with Tradjenta experienced fewer events of hypoglycemia and a modest weight reduction compared with glimepiride– Detailed results from CAROLINA were presented at the American Diabetes Association’s 79th Scientific Sessions

RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, June 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced detailed findings from the CAROLINA® trial demonstrating that Tradjenta® (linagliptin) did not increase cardiovascular risk compared with glimepiride in adults with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk. The findings were reported today at the American Diabetes Association’s79th Scientific Sessions® in San Francisco.
The trial met its primary endpoint, defined as non-inferiority for Tradjenta versus glimepiride in time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE), which occurred in 11.8% (356 people) of the Tradjenta group compared with 12.0% (362 people) of the glimepiride group. The overall safety profile of Tradjenta in CAROLINA was consistent with previous data, and no new safety signals were observed.
The study assessed Tradjenta safety over the longest period ever studied in a DPP-4 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trial, with a median follow-up of more than 6 years. Tradjenta was similar to glimepiride in the secondary endpoint of 3P-MACE plus hospitalization for unstable angina (4P-MACE) (13.2% for Tradjenta versus 13.3% for glimepiride).
“Millions of people living with type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease,” said Mohamed Eid, M.D., M.P.H., M.H.A., vice president, Clinical Development & Medical Affairs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “When treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor such as Tradjenta is appropriate, it is critical that physicians have therapeutic options with established long-term safety and tolerability. The findings from CAROLINA complement the results from CARMELINA®, which demonstrated similar long-term cardiovascular safety for Tradjenta compared with placebo, including no increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure, in adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease.”
In CAROLINA, a higher proportion of the Tradjenta group (16.0%) achieved the secondary composite efficacy endpoint of treatment sustainability compared with the glimepiride group (10.2%).* Compared with glimepiride, Tradjenta demonstrated similar overall effects on A1C, but reduced the relative risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) by 77% (10.6% of patients treated with Tradjenta experienced any hypoglycemic incident versus 37.7% for glimepiride). This risk reduction was consistent across all hypoglycemia categories, including severe hypoglycemia requiring hospitalization. Tradjenta was also associated with a modest weight reduction of 1.5 kg versus glimepiride.
“The American College of Cardiology and American Diabetes Association recommend type 2 diabetes treatments with proven cardiovascular benefits for patients with established cardiovascular disease,” said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly Diabetes. “But physicians considering additional therapies to lower blood glucose for their patients need a DPP-4 inhibitor with an established long-term safety profile. This new data from CAROLINA, along with data from the placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trial CARMELINA, expands the evidence and experience with Tradjenta, to provide healthcare professionals with confidence in the long-term safety profile across a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes.”
ABOUT CAROLINA (NCT01243424)
CAROLINA (CARdiovascular Outcome study of LINAgliptin versus glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes) is a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial that involved 6,033 adults with type 2 diabetes from 43 countries at more than 600 sites observed for a median duration of more than 6 years. The trial included adults with early type 2 diabetes: adults with a median disease duration of 6.2 years who either received no treatment or received one or two glucose-lowering agents (e.g., metformin). The study was designed to assess the effect of Tradjenta (5 mg once daily) compared with the sulfonylurea glimepiride (both added to stable background glucose-lowering medication and cardiovascular standard of care) on cardiovascular safety in adults with type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk or established cardiovascular disease. These patients reflect people that doctors typically see in their daily clinical practice.
CAROLINA was led by an academic trial steering committee and Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company. CAROLINA is the only DPP-4 inhibitor active-comparator cardiovascular outcome trial.
About our cardiovascular outcome trials
Cardiovascular outcome trials are highly relevant, as cardiovascular disease is a major complication and the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes. Worldwide, most people with type 2 diabetes die of a cardiovascular event. In 2015, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company announced results from the landmark cardiovascular outcome trial EMPA-REG OUTCOME® with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, which reduced the relative risk of cardiovascular death by 38% in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, on top of standard of care.†‡ As a result, empagliflozin was the first type 2 diabetes medicine approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death.
CAROLINA is one of two cardiovascular outcome trials with the DPP-4 inhibitor Tradjenta. CAROLINA and CARMELINA (CArdiovascular safety and Renal Microvascular outcomE with LINAgliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high vascular risk) provide one of the most comprehensive datasets on the long-term safety of a DPP-4-inhibitor across a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes.
CARMELINA is a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that involved 6,979 adults with type 2 diabetes from 27 countries at more than 600 sites observed for a median duration of 2.2 years. CARMELINA studied the impact of Tradjenta on cardiovascular and kidney safety in adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and/or kidney disease. The study met its primary endpoint,§ with Tradjenta demonstrating a similar cardiovascular safety profile compared with placebo when added to standard of care. CARMELINA also included a key secondary composite endpoint,** showing a similar kidney safety profile compared with placebo. The overall safety profile of Tradjenta in CARMELINA was consistent with previous data, and no new safety signals were observed. CARMELINA also showed a similar rate of hospitalization for heart failure for Tradjenta compared with placebo.

What is TRADJENTA?
TRADJENTA is a prescription medicine that is used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.
TRADJENTA is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).
If you have had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in the past, it is not known if you have a higher chance of getting pancreatitis while you take TRADJENTA.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
What is the most important information I should know about TRADJENTA?
Serious side effects can happen to people taking TRADJENTA, including inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which may be severe and lead to death. Before you start taking TRADJENTA, tell your doctor if you have ever had pancreatitis, gallstones, a history of alcoholism, or high triglyceride levels.
Stop taking TRADJENTA and call your doctor right away if you have pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe and will not go away. The pain may be felt going from your abdomen through to your back. The pain may happen with or without vomiting. These may be symptoms of pancreatitis.
Heart failure. Heart failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough. Before you start taking TRADJENTA, tell your doctor if you have ever had heart failure or have problems with your kidneys. Contact your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms: increasing shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially when you lie down; swelling or fluid retention, especially in the feet, ankles, or legs; an unusually fast increase in weight or unusual tiredness. These may be symptoms of heart failure.
Who should not take TRADJENTA?
Do not take TRADJENTA if you are allergic to linagliptin or any of the ingredients in TRADJENTA.

15696,ï»¿Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) Receives FDA's Approval for 1L Treatment of Metastatic or Unresectable Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,FDA Approves Two New Indications for Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab),"The approval is based on P-III KEYNOTE-048 study results assessing Keytruda as monothx. & in combination with platinum and fluorouracil (FU) vs EXTREME regimen in 882 patients in ratio (1:1:1) with metastatic or unresectable HNSCC with & without PD-L1 tumor expression respectively
 Results: monothx. and combination therapy, CPS ≥1 & CPS ≥20, OS (69% & 82% vs 81% & 78%) and (70% vs 80%); PFS (88% & 85% vs 91% & 91%) and (87% vs 91%); DOR (20.9 & 20.9 mos. vs 4.5 & 4.2mos.) and (6.7 vs 4.3) respectively
 Keytruda (100mg) is a mAb, blocking the interaction b/w PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes affecting both tumor cells and healthy cells","KEYTRUDA Now Approved for First-Line Treatment of Patients with Metastatic or with Unresectable, Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma as Monotherapy for Patients Whose Tumors Express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) or in Combination with Platinum and Fluorouracil (FU) Regardless of PD-L1 Expression

KENILWORTH, N.J.—Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1) or in combination with platinum and fluorouracil (FU), a commonly used chemotherapy regimen, for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial, where KEYTRUDA demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with the EXTREME regimen (cetuximab with carboplatin or cisplatin plus FU), a standard treatment, as monotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.64-0.96]; p=0.0171) and in combination with chemotherapy in the total study population (HR=0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.93]; p=0.0067). With these new indications, KEYTRUDA is the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the first-line setting as monotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) or in combination with chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 expression for patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC and the first anti-PD-1 therapy to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in OS in these patients.
“This approval is a very exciting milestone in the treatment of head and neck cancer and has the potential to transform the way we treat patients with this debilitating disease by offering important new therapeutic options,” said Dr. Barbara Burtness, professor of medicine, Yale School of Medicine and co-director, Development Therapeutics Research Program, Yale Cancer Center. “Metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer has been an area of significant unmet need, so it is encouraging to have immunotherapy regimens available for patients in the first-line setting.”
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.
“Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has historically presented many challenges to physicians and patients, including limited treatment options and physical and functional issues caused by the disease and its treatment,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “This approval is an important advance in the management of this devastating cancer. The results of KEYNOTE-048, which support this approval, demonstrated that KEYTRUDA monotherapy for patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 CPS greater than or equal to one and KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 expression significantly prolonged survival for patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the first-line setting.”
KEYTRUDA was initially approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy in 2016 under the FDA’s accelerated approval process based on objective response rate data from the Phase 1b KEYNOTE-012 trial. In accordance with the accelerated approval process, continued approval was contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit, which has now been demonstrated in KEYNOTE-048 and has resulted in the FDA converting the accelerated approval to a full (regular) approval.
Data Supporting the Approval
This approval is based on data from the pre-specified interim analysis of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial, a randomized, multi-center, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 882 patients with metastatic HNSCC who had not previously received systemic therapy and who were considered incurable by local therapies. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] ≥50% or <50%) according to the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit, HPV status according to p16 IHC (positive or negative), and ECOG Performance Status (PS) (0 vs. 1). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms:
KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks;
KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every three weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks and FU 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every three weeks (maximum of six cycles of platinum and FU);
Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 intravenously as the initial dose then 250 mg/m2 intravenously once weekly, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every three weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks and FU 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every three weeks (maximum of six cycles of platinum and FU).
Among the 882 patients, the study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range, 20 to 94), 36% age 65 or older; 83% male; 73% White, 20% Asian, and 2.4% Black; 61% had ECOG PS of 1; and 79% were former or current smokers. Twenty-two percent of patients’ tumors were HPV positive; 23% had PD-L1 TPS ≥50%; and 95% had stage IV disease (19% were stage IVA, 6% were stage IVB, and 70% were stage IVC). Eighty-five percent of patients’ tumors had PD-L1 expression of CPS ≥1, and 43% had CPS ≥20.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 24 months. A retrospective re-classification of patients’ tumor PD-L1 status according to CPS using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit was conducted using the tumor specimens used for randomization.
The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ) sequentially tested in the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥20, the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥1 and the overall population.

About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grade 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination with Axitinib)
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Hepatotoxicity in Combination with Axitinib
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%), receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality.

15708,Janssen Reports Cardiovascular Outcomes of Invokana (canagliflozin) in P-III CREDENCE Study for Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease,INVOKANA (canagliflozin) Significantly Reduced Major Cardiovascular Events and Kidney Failure in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease in New CREDENCE Analysis,"The P-III CREDENCE study results involves assessing of Invokana (100 mg, qd) vs PBO in patients 4,401 patients in ratio (1:1) with T2D and stage II &III CKD prior treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers
 The P-III CREDENCE study results: 20% reduction in risk of CV death, heart stroke & death (9.9% vs. 12.2%); 31% reduction in CV death & hospitalization (8.1% vs 11.5%); 39% reduction in hospitalization for heart (4.0% vs 6.4%); reduces the risk ESKD by 31% & 33% in primary and secondary prevention groups respectively
 Invokana is a therapy for lowering the blood glucose level in adults with T2D and has received FDA’s PR designation and approval for reducing the risk of CV events with T2D in Oct’18","Protective effect observed in patients with and without known cardiovascular disease

Analysis builds on primary CREDENCE results, which were recently added to the American Diabetes Association’s Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes

Primary results also served as the basis for a recent supplemental New Drug Application for INVOKANA®

SAN FRANCISCO, June 11, 2019 — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced results of a new subgroup analysis from the landmark phase 3 CREDENCE study, showing INVOKANA® (canagliflozin) significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events and kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These positive results were observed in patients taking INVOKANA®, including those with CV risk factors but no history of CV disease (primary prevention group) and patients with history of CV disease, defined as a history of coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease (secondary prevention group). Results were presented today at the American Diabetes Association’s 79th Scientific Sessions.

“The CREDENCE study demonstrates canagliflozin’s ability to manage some of the most common yet serious complications from T2D, including CV and kidney diseases,” said study investigator Kenneth W. Mahaffey, M.D., Professor and Vice Chair of Clinical Research, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, and Director, Stanford Center for Clinical Research (SCCR), Stanford, Calif.1 “We’re particularly excited about this new analysis because it’s the first time a type 2 diabetes medicine has shown a cardiovascular benefit in patients who did not have preexisting CV disease. This is an important, clinically meaningful finding as it uncovers the potential of canagliflozin to offer a protective effect in this patient population.”
Published in The New England Journal of Medicine this past April, the Phase 3 CREDENCE study evaluated CV and renal outcomes in patients with T2D and CKD taking either INVOKANA® or placebo, in addition to standard of care. Results from the CREDENCE study were also recently added to the American Diabetes Association’s Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, which gives healthcare professionals the latest evidence-based recommendations to treat people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

For the new subgroup analysis being presented at ADA, CREDENCE researchers specifically examined CV and renal outcomes in the primary prevention group (n=2,181; 49.6%) and secondary prevention group (n=2,220; 50.4%). Compared to secondary prevention participants, primary prevention participants were younger (61.4 vs. 64.6 years) and more often female (36.6% vs. 31.3%), but with similar T2D duration (15.2 vs. 16.4 years).

“About one in three people with type 2 diabetes have chronic kidney disease, which puts them at increased risk of kidney failure and negative cardiovascular outcomes,i like cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke, and heart failure,” said James List, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “With the results from our CREDENCE study, INVOKANA® is now poised to become the first therapy in nearly two decades for treating chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes, providing both kidney and cardiovascular protection.”
CV Outcomes 
The CV results from CREDENCE found INVOKANA® significantly reduced major CV events in the overall study population, with consistent results across all composite endpoints and individual components of the composite endpoints. Specifically, INVOKANA® reduced the risk of CV death, heart attack or stroke by 20 percent compared to placebo (9.9% vs. 12.2%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.95; P=0.01). INVOKANA® also reduced the risk of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure by 31 percent (8.1% vs. 11.5%; HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.83; P<0.001) and hospitalization for heart failure by 39 percent (4.0% vs. 6.4%; HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.80; P<0.001). For the subgroup analysis, researchers found:

CV results observed in the overall study population were consistent across the primary and secondary prevention groups, including all clinical subgroups and across groups defined by renal function.
For CV death, heart attack and stroke, there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the primary and secondary prevention groups (p-interaction=0.25). Specifically, INVOKANA® reduced the risk of the composite of CV death, heart attack and stroke by 32 percent in the primary prevention group (HR: 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.94) and 15 percent in the secondary prevention group (HR: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.06).
Renal and Safety Outcomes
The renal results from CREDENCE found INVOKANA® demonstrated a 30 percent reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint – comprised of progression to doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESKD), and renal or CV death (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.82; P<0.0001) – with consistent results across individual components of the primary composite endpoint, as well as across all 15 prespecified subgroups examined. For the subgroup analysis, researchers found:

Renal results observed in the overall study population were consistent across the primary and secondary prevention groups.
Specifically, INVOKANA® reduced the risk of ESKD by 31 percent (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.95; P-interaction: 0.89) and 33 percent (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.96; P-interaction: 0.89) in the primary and secondary prevention groups, respectively.
In addition, CREDENCE found the incidence rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were numerically lower for patients treated with INVOKANA® as compared to placebo. For the subgroup analysis, safety outcomes were similar in both primary and secondary prevention groups. Of note, there was no difference in fracture risk or incidence of amputations in the primary and secondary prevention groups.
About CREDENCE
The phase 3 CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation, NCT02065791) clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, event-driven, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-arm, multicenter study. It evaluated 4,401 patients from 34 countries with T2D and established stage 2 or 3 CKD who were receiving standard of care, which included a maximum tolerated labeled daily dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and received either INVOKANA® 100 mg daily or matching placebo, with a mean follow-up of 2.62 years.
In March 2019, Janssen submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for INVOKANA® to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, the doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death for adults with CKD and T2D, based on data from the CREDENCE study. The application was given a Priority Review, which FDA assigns to medicines that may offer significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition. If this new indication is approved, INVOKANA® would be the first T2D medication to treat CKD, one of the most common and potentially life-threatening comorbidities associated with T2D.i
The FDA most recently approved an indication for INVOKANA® in October 2018 to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events, including heart attack, stroke or death due to a CV cause in adults with T2D who have established CV disease. INVOKANA® is also indicated to lower blood sugar in adults with T2D. INVOKANA® is contraindicated for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), ESKD, or those on dialysis. In addition, INVOKANA® is not recommended when eGFR is persistently less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Please see the Important Safety Information below and the full Prescribing Information for additional details.
WHAT IS INVOKANA®? 
INVOKANA® is a prescription medicine used:

along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes
to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease. INVOKANA® is not for people with type 1 diabetes or with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in blood or urine). It is not known if INVOKANA® is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
INVOKANA® can cause important side effects, including:

Amputations. INVOKANA® may increase your risk of lower-limb amputations. Amputations mainly involve removal of the toe or part of the foot; however, amputations involving the leg, below and above the knee, have also occurred. Some people had more than one amputation, some on both sides of the body. You may be at a higher risk of lower-limb amputation if you: have a history of amputation, have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, have had blocked or narrowed blood vessels (usually in leg), have damage to the nerves (neuropathy) in the leg, or have had diabetic foot ulcers or sores. Call your doctor right away if you have new pain or tenderness, any sores, ulcers, or infections in your leg or foot. Your doctor may decide to stop your INVOKANA® for a while if you have any of these signs or symptoms. Talk to your doctor about proper foot care
Dehydration. INVOKANA® can cause some people to become dehydrated (the loss of too much body water), which may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, lightheaded, or weak, especially when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). You may be at higher risk of dehydration if you have low blood pressure, take medicines to lower your blood pressure (including diuretics [water pills]), are on a low sodium (salt) diet, have kidney problems, or are 65 years of age or older
Vaginal yeast infection. Women who take INVOKANA® may get vaginal yeast infections. Symptoms include: vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), or vaginal itching
Yeast infection of the penis (balanitis or balanoposthitis). Men who take INVOKANA® may get a yeast infection of the skin around the penis. Symptoms include: redness, itching, or swelling of the penis; rash of the penis; foul-smelling discharge from the penis; or pain in the skin around penis
Talk to your doctor about what to do if you get symptoms of a yeast infection of the vagina or penis.
Do not take INVOKANA® if you:

are allergic to canagliflozin or any of the ingredients in INVOKANA®. Symptoms of allergic reaction may include: rash; raised red patches on your skin (hives); or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing
have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis
Before you take INVOKANA®, tell your doctor if you have a history of amputation; heart disease or are at risk for heart disease; blocked or narrowed blood vessels (usually in leg); damage to the nerves (neuropathy) of your leg; diabetic foot ulcers or sores; kidney problems; liver problems; history of urinary tract infections or problems with urination; are on a low sodium (salt) diet; are going to have surgery; are eating less due to illness, surgery, or change in diet; pancreas problems; drink alcohol very often (or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term); ever had an allergic reaction to INVOKANA®; or have other medical conditions.
Tell your doctor if you are or plan to become pregnant, are breastfeeding, or plan to breastfeed. INVOKANA® may harm your unborn baby. If you become pregnant while taking INVOKANA®, tell your doctor right away. INVOKANA® may pass into your breast milk and may harm your baby. Do not breastfeed while taking INVOKANA®.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Especially tell your doctor if you take diuretics (water pills), rifampin (used to treat or prevent tuberculosis), phenytoin or phenobarbital (used to control seizures), ritonavir (Norvir®, Kaletra® – used to treat HIV infection), or digoxin (Lanoxin®– used to treat heart problems).
Possible Side Effects of INVOKANA®
INVOKANA® may cause serious side effects, including:

Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine). Ketoacidosis has happened in people who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, during treatment with INVOKANA®. Ketoacidosis is a serious condition, which may need to be treated in a hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. Ketoacidosis can happen with INVOKANA® even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL. Stop taking INVOKANA® and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, stomach-area pain, tiredness, or trouble breathing
Kidney problems. Sudden kidney injury has happened to people taking INVOKANA®. Talk to your doctor right away if you: 1) reduce the amount of food or liquid you drink, if you are sick, or cannot eat or 2) you start to lose liquids from your body from vomiting, diarrhea, or being in the sun too long
A high amount of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia)
Serious Urinary Tract Infections: may lead to hospitalization and have happened in people taking INVOKANA®. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as: burning feeling while urinating, need to urinate often or right away, pain in the lower part of your stomach (pelvis), or blood in the urine. Some people may also have high fever, back pain, nausea, or vomiting
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). If you take INVOKANA® with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin, your risk of getting low blood sugar is higher. The dose of your sulfonylurea medicine or insulin may need to be lowered while you take INVOKANA®
Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar may include: headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, confusion, irritability, hunger, fast heartbeat, sweating, shaking, or feeling jittery.

A rare but serious bacterial infection that destroys the tissue under the skin (necrotizing fasciitis) in the area between and around the anus and genitals (perineum). Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum has happened in women and men who take INVOKANA®. Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum may lead to hospitalization, may require multiple surgeries to remove affected tissues, and may lead to death. Seek medical attention immediately if you have fever or you are feeling very weak, tired, or uncomfortable (malaise) and you develop any of the following symptoms in the area between and around your anus and genitals: pain or tenderness, swelling, or redness of the skin (erythema).
Serious allergic reaction. If you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, stop taking INVOKANA® and call your doctor right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room.
Broken Bones (fractures): Bone fractures have been seen in patients taking INVOKANA®. Talk to your doctor about factors that may increase your risk of bone fracture.
The most common side effects of INVOKANA® include: vaginal yeast infections and yeast infections of the penis; changes in urination, including urgent need to urinate more often, in larger amounts, or at night.
Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC at 1-800-526-7736.

New agreement builds on Genmab’s successful DARZALEX® collaboration with Janssen
Next-generation HexaBody-CD38 could potentially add to the DARZALEX multiple myeloma franchise and expand the potential of CD38-targeted therapies in further indications
Copenhagen, Denmark; June 11, 2019 – Genmab A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: GEN) announced today it has entered into an exclusive worldwide license and option agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) to develop and commercialize HexaBody-CD38, a next-generation human CD38 monoclonal antibody product incorporating Genmab’s proprietary HexaBody technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Genmab will collaborate exclusively with Janssen on HexaBody-CD38, with Genmab funding research and development activities until completion of clinical proof of concept studies in multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on the data from these studies, Janssen may exercise its option and receive a worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize HexaBody-CD38. Should this occur, Janssen will pay Genmab a USD 150 million option exercise fee and up to USD 125 million in development milestones, as well as a flat royalty rate of 20% on sales of HexaBody-CD38 until a specified time in 2031, followed by 13-20% tiered royalties on sales thereafter. Should Janssen not exercise its option, the terms of the agreement allow Genmab to continue to develop and commercialize HexaBody-CD38 for DARZALEX-resistant patients, and in all other indications except those multiple myeloma or amyloidosis indications where DARZALEX is either approved or is being actively developed.
The agreement is the outcome of pre-clinical research on novel CD38 targeting concepts conducted by Genmab. For HexaBody-CD38, Genmab obtained promising pre-clinical data in a panel of multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia models.
“With this agreement, we hope to build upon the successful and productive relationship that we have established with Janssen. As a result of our collaboration, DARZALEX has dramatically improved outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma, yet there are still unmet needs for patients. We are excited that Genmab’s world-class antibody expertise and passion for innovation has led to the novel HexaBody-CD38 product concept. Encouraging pre-clinical data suggest that HexaBody-CD38 could be superior to daratumumab for certain tumor cell types and may expand and extend the promise of CD38-targeted therapies for more patients with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, and potentially beyond,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.
Additional details of the collaboration are not being disclosed and this news does not materially impact Genmab’s 2019 Financial Guidance.

15726,ï»¿Biogen To Report New Data of its Biosimilar Anti-TNF Portfolio at European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) 2019,BIOGEN TO PRESENT NEW SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA ON BIOSIMILARS AND ESTIMATES 1.8 BILLION EUROS IN SAVINGS FOR THE EUROPEAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN 2019,"Biogen to present data from BENEFIT study results assessing etanercept in 533 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. Additionally, it presents data from pooled analyses of etanercept, infliximab and imraldi in 1,461 patients showing similarity with its reference product @6mos. & @1yr. treatment
 Biogen’s three biosimilar, Benepali (etanercept), Flixabi (infliximab) and Imraldi (adalimumab) are expected to save $2.04B of European healthcare system in 2019. In Feb’12, Biogen & Samsung Biologics collaborates to develop & commercialize biosimilar
 Benepali (biosimilar of Enbrel), flixabi (biosimilar of Remicade), imraldi (biosimilar of Humira) received European Commission approval in Jan’16, May’16 and Aug’17 for multiple indication respectively","Data to be presented at the European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) 2019 highlight real-world evidence confirming the safety and efficacy of anti-TNF biosimilars and high adherence of patients to treatment 
Biogen’s three biosimilar treatments – BENEPALI™ (etanercept), FLIXABI™ (infliximab) and IMRALDI™ (adalimumab) – are estimated to save the European healthcare system 1.8 billion euros in 2019
Biogen and its collaboration partner Samsung Bioepis are the first companies in Europe to market biosimilars that reference the three most prescribed anti-TNF biologic treatments, with approximately 145,000 patients currently on treatment1
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 11, 2019 Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that it will present new data at the European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) 2019 in Madrid, Spain (June 12-15). The abstracts include real-world data from the company’s biosimilar anti-TNF portfolio, which includes BENEPALI™ (etanercept), FLIXABI™ (infliximab) and IMRALDI™ (adalimumab). Biosimilars are products that are demonstrated to be similar to or interchangeable with approved biological product and have the potential to lower drug costs. In Europe, approximately 145,000 patients have been treated with a Biogen biosimilar and the company expects the uptake of these products to generate 1.8 billion euros in healthcare cost savings in 2019.
“These new real-world data reinforce Biogen’s ongoing commitment to providing innovative and value-based therapeutic options to tens of thousands of patients with unmet medical need,” said Ian Henshaw, vice president and head of Biogen’s global biosimilars unit. “The cost savings we generate through our biosimilars business unit will help alleviate global healthcare system burden, which could enable governments to allow broader access to critical therapies.”
To compile real-world evidence, physicians ask patients open-ended questions about treatment experience. The real-world data to be presented at EULAR this year provide further insight into patient experience with anti-TNF biosimilars, including adherence data.
“Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases face the reality of a lifetime of ongoing disease management and now biosimilars enable more patients access to those life-changing medicines while providing our healthcare systems significant savings,” said Dr. Peter Taylor, Norman Collisson professor of musculoskeletal sciences, Nuffield department of orthopedics, rheumatology and musculoskeletal sciences at the University of Oxford, England. “The new real-world data to be presented at EULAR further establish the comparable safety and efficacy of biosimilars against their reference products.”
Biosimilars represent an important component of Biogen’s European portfolio. Biosimilar products benefit patients and are strategically important as Biogen works with payers and health systems globally with the goal of creating room in healthcare budgets to provide access for patients to innovative therapies.
Biogen and its collaboration partner Samsung Bioepis will present a total of nine abstracts at the congress. In February 2012 Biogen entered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung BioLogics, establishing an entity, Samsung Bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar products.
Data to be presented include results of the real-world data generating BENEFIT study, which evaluated the outcomes of transition from the reference product etanercept to its biosimilar in routine clinical practice. The study demonstrated no clinically significant difference in disease score from baseline to six months post transition in 533 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)2 (June 14, 11:45.-13:30 CET – FRI0103 – Hall 10).
Additionally, data from a pooled analysis of etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab biosimilars and reference products across 1,461 patients will be presented. The analysis demonstrated similar outcomes between biosimilars and their respective reference products in terms of disease fluctuation at six months and one year of treatment3(June 15, 10:30-12:00 CET – SAT0162 – Hall 10).

 Rituxan has also received Priority Review Designation in combination with glucocorticoids (GCC), for treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in children 2yrs. and older
 Rituxan (rituximab) is a mAb used to target cancer cells with CD20 marker and has received FDA’s approval for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 2006, for adults with GPA and MPA in 2011, for adults with pemphigus vulgaris in 2018","There are currently no FDA approved treatments for children living with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)
The PePRS study is the first global trial of Rituxan in pediatric patients with GPA or MPA
Rituxan in combination with glucocorticoids is the only FDA-approved therapy for adults with these two rare forms of vasculitis
If approved, this would be the first pediatric indication for Rituxan
South San Francisco, CA — June 11, 2019 —
Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and granted Priority Review for the use of Rituxan® (rituximab), in combination with glucocorticoids (GCC), for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in children two years of age and older. GPA and MPA are rare, potentially life-threatening diseases affecting small and medium sized blood vessels.1
“We are committed to delivering new treatment options for rare diseases, such as pediatric GPA and MPA, for which there are currently no approved medicines,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We will continue to work closely with the FDA to bring Rituxan to children with these two serious and potentially life-threatening diseases.”
Priority Review Designation is granted to medicines that, if approved, the FDA has determined to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment of a serious disease.
The sBLA was submitted based on data from the PePRS study, a Phase IIa, global, open-label, single-arm study investigating the safety, pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics and exploratory efficacy of intravenous Rituxan in 25 patients with severe GPA or MPA between six and 17 years of age.2 Treatment with four weekly infusions of Rituxan in combination with a tapering course of oral glucocorticoids was assessed in newly diagnosed or relapsing active GPA or MPA pediatric patients.
Rituxan is currently indicated for the treatment of four autoimmune indications. The FDA approved Rituxan for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 2006, for the treatment of adults with GPA and MPA in 2011, and for adults with pemphigus vulgaris in 2018. Since 2006, more than 900,000 patients have been treated with Rituxan for autoimmune conditions worldwide. If approved, this would be the first pediatric indication for Rituxan.
About Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis and Microscopic Polyangiitis 
Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (formerly known as Wegener’s Granulomatosis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) are two types of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).3AAV is a form of vasculitis, or blood vessel inflammation, that primarily affects small blood vessels.3 In general, GPA and MPA both affect the small blood vessels of the kidneys, lungs, sinuses, and a variety of other organs, but the diseases may affect each person differently.1,4 Both GPA and MPA are considered rare diseases, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of up to three cases per 100,000 people.1,4 Cases of pediatric onset GPA and MPA are even more rare and are associated with severe, potentially life-threatening symptoms.5
What autoimmune diseases does Rituxan treat?
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): with another prescription medicine called methotrexate, to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe active RA in adults, after treatment with at least one other medicine called a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist has been used and did not work well enough.
Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA): with glucocorticoids, to treat adults with GPA and MPA.
Pemphigus vulgaris (PV): to treat adults with moderate to severe PV.
It is not known if Rituxan is safe or effective in children.
Important Side Effect Information
What is the most important information patients should know about Rituxan?
Rituxan can cause serious side effects that can lead to death, including:

Infusion-Related Reactions: Infusion-related reactions are very common side effects of Rituxan treatment. Serious infusion-related reactions can happen during your infusion or within 24 hours after your infusion of Rituxan. Your healthcare provider should give you medicines before your infusion of Rituxan to decrease your chance of having a severe infusion-related reaction
Severe Skin and Mouth Reactions: Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you get any of these symptoms at any time during your treatment with Rituxan: painful sores or ulcers on your skin, lips, or in your mouth; blisters; peeling skin; rash; or pustules
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: If you have had hepatitis B or are a carrier of hepatitis B virus, receiving Rituxan could cause the virus to become an active infection again. Hepatitis B reactivation may cause serious liver problems, including liver failure and death. You should not receive Rituxan if you have active hepatitis B liver disease. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for hepatitis B infection during and for several months after you stop receiving Rituxan
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML is a rare, serious brain infection caused by a virus that can happen in people who receive Rituxan. People with weakened immune systems can get PML. PML can result in death or severe disability. There is no known treatment, prevention, or cure for PML
Before receiving Rituxan, patients should tell their healthcare provider if they:

have had a severe reaction to Rituxan or a rituximab product
currently have or have a history of other medical conditions, especially heart disease
have had a severe infection, currently have an infection, or have a weakened immune system
have had a recent vaccination or are scheduled to receive vaccinations
are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Females who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Rituxan and for 12 months after the last dose of Rituxan
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Rituxan
are taking any medications, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements
What are the possible side effects of Rituxan?
Rituxan can cause serious and life‐threatening side effects, including:

Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause you to have kidney failure and the need for dialysis treatment or may cause an abnormal heart rhythm. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms of TLS: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lack of energy
Serious Infections: Serious infections can happen during and after treatment with Rituxan and can lead to death. Rituxan can increase your risk of getting infections and can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. People with serious infections should not receive Rituxan
Heart Problems: Rituxan may cause chest pain, irregular heartbeats, and heart attack. Your healthcare provider may monitor your heart during and after treatment with Rituxan if you have symptoms of heart problems or have a history of heart problems
Kidney Problems: especially if you are receiving Rituxan for non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check how well your kidneys are working
Stomach and Serious Bowel Problems That Can Sometimes Lead to Death: Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any stomach-area pain during treatment with Rituxan
What are the most common side effects during treatment with Rituxan?
The most common side effects of Rituxan include:

infusion-related reactions
infections (may include fever, chills)
body aches
tiredness
nausea
In patients with GPA or MPA, the most common side effects of Rituxan also include:

low white and red blood cells
swelling
diarrhea
muscle spasms
Other side effects include:

aching joints during or within hours of receiving an infusion
more frequent upper respiratory tract infections
These are not all of the possible side effects with Rituxan. For more information, ask a doctor or pharmacist.

15742,ï»¿Novo Nordisk Reports Cardiovascular Outcomes of Oral Semaglutide in PIONEER 6 Study for Type 2 Diabetes,Oral semaglutide demonstrated cardiovascular safety in people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk in PIONEER 6 trial,"The PIONEER 6 study results involve assessing oral Semaglutide vs PBO in 3,183 patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events
 The PIONEER 6 study results: met its 1 EPs i.e non-inferiority for MACE; cardiovascular death events (0.9% vs 1.9%); non-fatal stroke (0.8% vs 1.0%); non-fatal myocardial infarctions (2.3% vs 1.9%); presented at ADA 79th Scientific Sessions and published in NEJM
 Semaglutide is an investigational oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of T2D, developed using Novo Nordisk’s protein-acylation technology, and is administered using an injection device","San Francisco, US, 11 June 2019 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the PIONEER 6 trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating non-inferiority of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with oral semaglutide compared with placebo, both in addition to standard of care. The primary endpoint was defined as the MACE composite outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke and non-inferiority for cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide versus placebo was confirmed with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.79 (p<0.001) in favour of oral semaglutide compared with placebo. The results are based on an accumulation of 137 first major adverse cardiovascular events and a median follow-up time of 16 months.
 
The main results from PIONEER 6 were presented today at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 79th Scientific Sessions and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)1,2. Oral semaglutide is an investigational glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue in a pill. 
The MACE results were driven by the individual components of cardiovascular death [15 (0.9%) events with oral semaglutide vs 30 (1.9%) events with placebo, HR 0.49, p=0.03] and non-fatal strokes [12 (0.8%) events with oral semaglutide vs 16 (1.0%) events with placebo, HR 0.74, non-significant]. The number of non-fatal myocardial infarctions with oral semaglutide was not significantly different than placebo [37 (2.3%) events with oral semaglutide vs 31 (1.9%) events with placebo, HR 1.18, non-significant]. Among the secondary endpoints, the number of all-cause deaths was significantly lower in people treated with oral semaglutide compared with placebo [23 (1.4%) events vs 45 (2.8%) events, HR 0.51, p=0.008].
 
“Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of disability and death in people with type 2 diabetes,” said Dr Mansoor Husain, PIONEER 6 investigator and lead author for the NEJM publication of PIONEER 6 and Director of the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research and Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, Canada. “The PIONEER 6 trial demonstrates that oral semaglutide does not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events while providing further evidence for the overall cardiovascular profile of semaglutide.” 
 
The safety profile of oral semaglutide was consistent with that of the GLP-1 receptor agonist class and similar to those seen with subcutaneous semaglutide. 
 
“The results of PIONEER 6 further strengthen the overall clinical evidence for oral semaglutide, building upon the strong clinical data reported throughout the PIONEER clinical trial programme,” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. “We are excited about the potential of oral semaglutide to become the first and only oral GLP-1 treatment for people with type 2 diabetes.” 
 
About PIONEER 6 and the PIONEER clinical trial programme
PIONEER 6 was an event-driven, pre-approval cardiovascular outcomes trial for oral semaglutide. It was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide vs placebo when added to standard of care in 3,183 people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events.
 
The PIONEER phase 3a clinical development program for oral semaglutide was a global development programme that enrolled 9,543 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials.

 The P-III SELECT EARLY & SELECT-COMPARE study results: @48wks. improvement in symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis measured by ACR20/50; maintain clinical remission based on (DAS28-CRP) <2.6; presented at EULAR
 Upadacitinib is JAK1-selective inhibitor, being evaluated in multiple P-III clinical studies for psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, atopic dermatitis, and ulcerative colitis and being investigated to treat ankylosing spondylitis and giant cell arteritis","Data from SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE show a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) maintaining clinical remission compared with MTX or adalimumab plus MTX, respectively, at 48 weeks1,2
– Findings from an integrated safety analysis across five studies in the SELECT Phase 3 clinical program support the well-characterized safety profile of upadacitinib in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis3
– Upadacitinib, an investigational oral agent engineered by AbbVie to selectively inhibit JAK1, is being studied as a once-daily therapy in moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and across multiple other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases4-17
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., June 12, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced new results from the Phase 3 clinical trials SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE showing that patients receiving upadacitinib once-daily (15 mg or 30 mg, SELECT-EARLY; 15 mg plus methotrexate (MTX), SELECT-COMPARE) through 48 weeks continue to demonstrate improved signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, as measured by ACR20/50, and clinical remission based on Disease Activity Score 28 C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP)<2.6.1,2 The studies evaluate upadacitinib, an investigational, once-daily JAK1-selective inhibitor, in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.1,2 Additionally, data from an integrated safety analysis across five Phase 3 SELECT clinical trials show that treatment with upadacitinib in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis demonstrates a consistent safety profile.3
These results are being presented at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Annual European Congress of Rheumatology, June 12-15, in Madrid.
“These data continue to support the potential of upadacitinib to help maintain consistent disease control for patients living with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis,” said Professor Ronald van Vollenhoven, M.D., Ph.D., Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. “While remission is the primary treatment goal, in accordance with the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommendations, a majority of patients do not achieve clinical remission today, despite currently available treatment options.”
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and debilitating disease that affects an estimated 23.7 million people worldwide.18 Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis still do not achieve clinical remission or low disease activity targets.19-21
“Over the past decade, important advances have been made in the understanding of rheumatoid arthritis and its management, looking beyond treating symptoms to achieving remission,” said Marek Honczarenko, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, immunology development, AbbVie. “As data continue to emerge from the SELECT program, we look forward to deepening our understanding of the benefits and risks of JAK inhibition on treatment outcomes in different patient populations with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.”
Upadacitinib is an investigational oral agent and has not been approved by any regulatory authorities.
About the SELECT Study Program4-9
 
 
The robust SELECT Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis program evaluates more than 4,900 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in six studies. The studies include assessments of safety, efficacy, and tolerability in rheumatoid arthritis patients across a broad spectrum of subjects including those who were naïve to MTX and those who had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more csDMARDs or bDMARDs. Key measures of efficacy evaluated include ACR responses, Disease Activity Score (DAS28-CRP) and inhibition of radiographic progression.

 The P-III PEMPHIX study met its 1EPs & 2EPs and further demonstrated superior results to MMF in regards to sustained complete remission
 Rituxan (rituximab) is a mAb used to target cancer cells with CD20 marker and is a novel therapy approved by the US FDA in June 2018 for pemphigus vulgaris on basis of Ritux 3 clinical trial","Rituxan met the primary and secondary endpoints in the Phase III PEMPHIX study
Rituxan was the first and only biologic therapy approved by the FDA in June 2018 for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris based on results from the Ritux 3 clinical trial
Results will be submitted to health authorities around the world, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
South San Francisco, CA — June 12, 2019 —
Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced positive top line results from the Roche-sponsored Phase III PEMPHIX study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Rituxan® (rituximab) compared to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in adults with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV). The study met the primary endpoint, and demonstrated that Rituxan is superior to MMF in achieving sustained complete remission.
“The PEMPHIX study provides additional clinical evidence for the use of Rituxan for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “These data also demonstrated that Rituxan may provide complete remission rates and successful tapering of corticosteroid therapy that is superior to MMF in adults with pemphigus vulgaris.”
The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants who achieved sustained complete remission off corticosteroid therapy (no disease activity, as evaluated by Pemphigus Disease Area Index, without the use of steroids for 16 consecutive weeks or more) at Week 52. Rituxan also met the secondary endpoints, including cumulative corticosteroid dose, number of flares, time to sustained remission and time to disease flare. Adverse events were generally consistent with those seen in previous Rituxan clinical studies for other autoimmune indications.
PV is a rare, serious and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by progressive painful blistering of the skin and mucous membranes.1 MMF is an unapproved treatment for PV that is accepted as standard of care. In June 2018, Rituxan became the first biologic therapy approved by the FDA for PV and the first major advancement in the treatment of the disease in more than 60 years. This approval was based on the Ritux 3 clinical trial.2This PEMPHIX trial provided additional clinical evidence on the effectiveness of Rituxan for PV. Complete data from the PEMPHIX study will be presented at an upcoming medical congress.
About the PEMPHIX study
PEMPHIX is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, parallel-arm multicenter study (NCT02383589) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Rituxan compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with moderate to severe active pemphigus vulgaris requiring 60-120 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent). Participants were randomly assigned to receive Rituxan plus MMF placebo or Rituxan placebo plus MMF. Rituxan was administered at a dose of 1000 mg via IV infusion on day 1 and 15, with a repeat administration on days 168 and 182. MMF was administered at a dose of 2 grams orally daily from day 1 to week 52. The primary endpoint is the percentage of participants who achieved sustained complete remission, evaluated by the Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) Activity Score, for at least 16 consecutive weeks at Week 52. Secondary endpoints include cumulative oral corticosteroid dose, number of disease flares, time to sustained complete remission, time to disease flare and health-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index.
About Pemphigus Vulgaris
Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease affecting the skin and mucous membranes.1 This rare, potentially life-threatening condition accounts for up to 80 percent of cases of pemphigus, a group of autoimmune disorders which affect 30,000 to 40,000 people in the United States. 3
What autoimmune diseases does Rituxan treat?
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): with another prescription medicine called methotrexate, to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe active RA in adults, after treatment with at least one other medicine called a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist has been used and did not work well enough.
Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA): with glucocorticoids, to treat GPA and MPA.
Pemphigus vulgaris (PV): to treat adults with moderate to severe PV.
It is not known if Rituxan is safe or effective in children.
Important Side Effect Information
What is the most important information patients should know about Rituxan?
Rituxan can cause serious side effects that can lead to death, including:

Infusion-Related Reactions: Infusion-related reactions are very common side effects of Rituxan treatment. Serious infusion-related reactions can happen during your infusion or within 24 hours after your infusion of Rituxan. Your healthcare provider should give you medicines before your infusion of Rituxan to decrease your chance of having a severe infusion-related reaction
Severe Skin and Mouth Reactions : Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you get any of these symptoms at any time during your treatment with Rituxan: painful sores or ulcers on your skin, lips, or in your mouth; blisters; peeling skin; rash; or pustules
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation : If you have had hepatitis B or are a carrier of hepatitis B virus, receiving Rituxan could cause the virus to become an active infection again. Hepatitis B reactivation may cause serious liver problems, including liver failure and death. You should not receive Rituxan if you have active hepatitis B liver disease. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for hepatitis B infection during and for several months after you stop receiving Rituxan
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML is a rare, serious brain infection caused by a virus that can happen in people who receive Rituxan. People with weakened immune systems can get PML. PML can result in death or severe disability. There is no known treatment, prevention, or cure for PML
Before receiving Rituxan, patients should tell their healthcare provider if they:

have had a severe reaction to Rituxan or a rituximab product
currently have or have a history of other medical conditions, especially heart disease
have had a severe infection, currently have an infection, or have a weakened immune system
have had a recent vaccination or are scheduled to receive vaccinations
are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Females who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Rituxan and for 12 months after the last dose of Rituxan
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Rituxan
are taking any medications, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements
What are the possible side effects of Rituxan?
Rituxan can cause serious and life‐threatening side effects, including:

Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause you to have kidney failure and the need for dialysis treatment or may cause an abnormal heart rhythm. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms of TLS: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lack of energy
Serious Infections: Serious infections can happen during and after treatment with Rituxan and can lead to death. Rituxan can increase your risk of getting infections and can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. People with serious infections should not receive Rituxan
Heart Problems: Rituxan may cause chest pain, irregular heartbeats, and heart attack. Your healthcare provider may monitor your heart during and after treatment with Rituxan if you have symptoms of heart problems or have a history of heart problems
Kidney Problems: especially if you are receiving Rituxan for non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check how well your kidneys are working
Stomach and Serious Bowel Problems That Can Sometimes Lead to Death: Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any stomach-area pain during treatment with Rituxan
What are the most common side effects during treatment with Rituxan?
The most common side effects of Rituxan include:

infusion-related reactions
infections (may include fever, chills)
body aches
tiredness
nausea
In patients with GPA or MPA, the most common side effects of Rituxan also include:

low white and red blood cells
swelling
diarrhea
muscle spasms
Other side effects include:

aching joints during or within hours of receiving an infusion
more frequent upper respiratory tract infections
These are not all of the possible side effects with Rituxan. For more information, ask a doctor or pharmacist.

EDT
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today positive results from ORAL Shift, a Phase 3b/4 study in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients who achieved low disease activity (LDA) with XELJANZ® (tofacitinib) extended release (XR) 11 mg once daily (QD) plus methotrexate (MTX) after a 24-week open-label run-in period, were randomized to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XELJANZ XR 11 mg QD as monotherapy after MTX withdrawal compared with XELJANZ XR with continued MTX. The study demonstrated non-inferiority of MTX withdrawal with XELJANZ XR 11 mg QD compared to XELJANZ XR 11 mg QD plus MTX at week 48 as measured by the primary endpoint, the change in the Disease Activity Score (DAS28-4[ESR]) from randomization at week 24 to the end of the double-blind MTX withdrawal phase at week 48. The study results will be presented during a late-breaking oral session at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2019) in Madrid, Spain (15 June).
“The results of ORAL Shift provide important information on the use of XELJANZ XR as monotherapy after methotrexate withdrawal, which is significant as some people living with rheumatoid arthritis are unable or unwilling to use methotrexate,” said Stanley Cohen, MD, Metroplex Clinical Research Center, Dallas, TX. “From a clinical perspective, these results give physicians data to help inform the decision to take appropriate patients off methotrexate.”
Efficacy Results
For the primary efficacy analysis, patients who achieved Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) low disease activity at week 24 were randomized into the MTX withdrawal phase resulting in least squares (LS) mean changes in DAS28-4(ESR) from weeks 24 to 48 of 0.33 and 0.03 in the XELJANZ XR monotherapy and XELJANZ XR plus MTX groups, respectively [LS mean difference = 0.3; 95% CI, 0.12-0.48; non-inferiority p
“ORAL Shift exemplifies Pfizer’s commitment to ongoing JAK research with the goal of meeting the evolving needs of patients living with this chronic inflammatory condition,” said Michael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We are extremely pleased with the findings from ORAL Shift, which to date is the only non-inferiority study to evaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of a JAK inhibitor after methotrexate withdrawal in adults with moderately to severely active RA who achieved low disease activity after combination therapy.”
Safety Results
The safety findings in ORAL Shift include the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) for each study group in the double-blind treatment period of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and bronchitis. Rates of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and discontinuations due to AEs were generally comparable between treatment arms. In the XELJANZ XR monotherapy group, there were 10 SAEs and 5 discontinuations due to AEs. In the XELJANZ XR plus MTX group, there were 5 SAEs and 5 discontinuations due to AEs. During the double-blind withdrawal phase of the study, AEs were reported in 40.5% of patients (n=107) in the XELJANZ XR monotherapy treatment group and 41.0% of patients (n=109) in the XELJANZ XR plus MTX treatment group. In addition, SAEs were reported in 3.8% of patients (n=10) in the XELJANZ XR monotherapy treatment group and 1.9% of patients (n=5) in the XELJANZ XR plus MTX treatment group. In the double-blind treatment period, there were two deaths reported in the XELJANZ XR plus MTX treatment group. The full Prescribing Information for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR includes a BOXED WARNING for serious infection and malignancy.
About the Study
ORAL Shift was a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority, methotrexate (MTX) withdrawal study in subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were also inadequate responders to treatment with MTX alone. The study included 694 patients with moderate to severe RA. During the run-in phase, all patients received open-label XELJANZ XR 11 mg QD plus MTX using their previously stabilized MTX dose. At week 24, patients who achieved low disease activity (LDA) as assessed by CDAI (n=530) were randomized into the 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled MTX withdrawal phase, for a total of 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference between the two treatment groups in change in DAS28-4(ESR). Change was measured from the time of randomization, at Week 24, to the end of the double-blind MTX withdrawal phase at Week 48. In the double-blind phase, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either continue on XELJANZ XR plus MTX (n=266) or to receive XELJANZ XR monotherapy plus blinded matching placebo for MTX (n=264).
About XELJANZ® (tofacitinib)
XELJANZ® (tofacitinib) is approved in the U.S. for adult patients in three indications: moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Globally, XELJANZ is approved in more than 130 countries for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA and has been prescribed to an estimated 205,000 patients.
As the developer of tofacitinib, Pfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of tofacitinib through robust clinical development programs in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions.
INDICATIONS
Rheumatoid Arthritis
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
Limitations of Use: Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
Psoriatic Arthritis

XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
Limitations of Use: Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
Ulcerative Colitis

XELJANZ (tofacitinib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).
Limitations of Use: Use of XELJANZ in combination with biologic therapies for UC or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
SERIOUS INFECTIONS
Patients treated with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.
If a serious infection develops, interrupt XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR until the infection is controlled.
Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR use.
Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
The most common serious infections reported with XELJANZ included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Avoid use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections, or with chronic or recurrent infection.
In the UC population, XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of serious infections compared to 5 mg twice daily. Opportunistic herpes zoster infections (including meningoencephalitis, ophthalmologic, and disseminated cutaneous) were seen in patients who were treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily.
The risks and benefits of treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection, or those who have lived or traveled in areas of endemic TB or mycoses. Viral reactivation including herpes virus and Hepatitis B reactivation have been reported. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy.
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.
Caution is also recommended in patients with a history of chronic lung disease, or in those who develop interstitial lung disease, as they may be more prone to infection.
MALIGNANCIES
Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with XELJANZ. Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder has been observed at an increased rate in renal transplant patients treated with XELJANZ and concomitant immunosuppressive medications.
Consider the risks and benefits of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients who develop a malignancy.
Malignancies (including solid cancers and lymphomas) were observed more often in patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily dosing in the UC long-term extension study.
Other malignancies were observed in clinical studies and the post-marketing setting including, but not limited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. In the UC population, treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of NMSC. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS
Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in XELJANZ clinical trials, although the role of JAK inhibition is not known. In these studies, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis were receiving background therapy with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). There was no discernable difference in frequency of gastrointestinal perforation between the placebo and the XELJANZ arms in clinical trials of patients with UC, and many of them were receiving background corticosteroids. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis or taking NSAIDs).
HYPERSENSITIVITY
Angioedema and urticaria that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR some events were serious. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue tofacitinib while evaluating the potential cause or causes of the reaction.
LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES
Lymphocyte Abnormalities: Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial lymphocytosis at one month of exposure followed by a gradual decrease in mean lymphocyte counts. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment in patients with a count less than 500 cells/mm3. In patients who develop a confirmed absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm3, treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not recommended. Risk of infection may be higher with increasing degrees of lymphopenia and consideration should be given to lymphocyte counts when assessing individual patient risk of infection. Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter.
Neutropenia: Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment in patients with an ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3. For patients who develop a persistent ANC of 500-1000 cells/mm3, interrupt XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm3. In patients who develop an ANC less than 500 cells/mm3, treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not recommended. Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.
Anemia: Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment in patients with a hemoglobin level less than 9 g/dL. Treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be interrupted in patients who develop hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL or whose hemoglobin level drops greater than 2 g/dL on treatment. Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.
Liver Enzyme Elevations: Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded. Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of liver enzyme elevations is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury.
Lipid Elevations: Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. There were no clinically relevant changes in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios. Manage patients with hyperlipidemia according to clinical guidelines. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4-8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy.
VACCINATIONS
Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of tofacitinib therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy.
PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL NARROWING
Caution should be used when administering XELJANZ XR to patients with pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing. There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs utilizing a non-deformable extended release formulation.
HEPATIC and RENAL IMPAIRMENT
Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.
For patients with moderate hepatic impairment or with moderate or severe renal impairment taking XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, reduce to XELJANZ 5 mg once daily.
For UC patients with moderate hepatic impairment or with moderate or severe renal impairment taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, reduce to XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections. The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and placebo, respectively, (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with XELJANZ with or without DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, and hypertension. The safety profile observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with XELJANZ was consistent with the safety profile observed in RA patients.
Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients treated with either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and ≥1% greater than reported in patients receiving placebo in either the induction or maintenance clinical trials for ulcerative colitis were: nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, rash, diarrhea, and herpes zoster.
USE IN PREGNANCY
Available data with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with rheumatoid arthritis and UC in pregnancy. In animal studies, tofacitinib at 6.3 times the maximum recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily demonstrated adverse embryo-fetal findings. The relevance of these findings to women of childbearing potential is uncertain. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential.

15789,"ï»¿Celltrion Reports Results of CT-P13 SC (biosimilar, infliximab) in a Clinical Study for Rheumatoid Arthritis #EULAR2019",New Subcutaneous Formulation of Celltrion Healthcare’s CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab) Shows Positive Results for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) In Data Presented at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2019),"The study results involves assessing of CT-P13 SC (90mg/120mg/180mg) vs CT-P13 IV (3mg/kg) in 50 patients in ratio (1:1:1:1) with RA, followed by a P-I/III study assessing CT-P13 SC (120mg, q2w) vs CT-P13 IV in 362 patients in ratio (1:1) with RA for 30wks.
 Collective results: @54wks. efficacy is comparable; DAS28 (CRP) and ACR20 are comparable in all cohorts; CT-P13 SC is non-inferior to CT-P13 IV, @22wks. similar ACR response, @6wk. SC 120mg safety is comparable to IV dose
 CT-P13 is a mAb, currently being evaluated in an additional 5yrs. study for RA and ankylosing spondylitis and has received approval in the US (marketed as Inflectra) in Apr’16, in Europe (marketed as Remsima) in Sept’13, additionally in other 89+ countries","Data at 54 weeks showed that the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of CT-P13 was comparable in terms of the efficacy and safety when investigated against intravenous (IV) formulation of CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
The novel SC formulation of CT-P13 may enhance treatment options for the use of infliximab biosimilar by providing high consistency in drug exposure and a convenient method of administration.
In a separate study, a five-year analysis of medical records showed that long-term treatment with CT-P13 was safe and efficacious based on drug survival, disease activity measurements and adverse events.
June 11, 2019 06:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time
MADRID-Celltrion Healthcare today presented new findings at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2019) from a two-part study investigating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and overall safety of CT-P13 SC in patients with RA during the treatment period of one year. The second part of the study demonstrated the non-inferiority of the efficacy and compared safety profiles of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV in people with RA over 30 weeks.
Part one of the study enrolled 50 patients of which 48 patients were randomly assigned at week six into four cohorts in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The IV cohort received CT-P13 IV 3mg/kg every eight weeks and the SC cohorts received CT-P13 SC 90mg, 120mg or 180mg, respectively, every two weeks up to week 54. Overall, the efficacy results of CT-P13 SC up to week 54 were comparable to those of CT-P13 IV. Disease improvement was assessed using the DAS28 (CRP), a disease activity score, and ACR20 score for RA. Results demonstrated that DAS28 (CRP) and ACR20 were comparable across all four cohorts, regardless of the route of administration or dosage of CT-P13. The safety profiles at week six in CT-P13 SC were comparable to CT-P13 IV and were similar to those previously reported for IV infliximab.1
This study was followed by a phase I/III randomised controlled trial. A total of 362 RA patients were enrolled, of whom 348 were randomised at week six into two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio (169 and 179 patients in SC 120mg bi-weekly or IV 3mg/kg arms every 8 weeks, respectively). The aim of the study was to compare the safety profiles and demonstrate the non-inferiority of efficacy of CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV in people with RA over 30 weeks. The trial showed that the mean change of DAS28 (CRP) from baseline to week 22 was similar between the two arms. The lower limit of the 95% CI (0.03) for the treatment difference in the change of DAS28 (CRP) from baseline was greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin (-0.6) indicating non-inferiority of CT-P13 SC compared to CT-P13 IV. ACR responses were also similar between the two treatment arms up to week 22. The safety profile at week six in the SC 120mg arm was comparable to the IV 3mg/kg arm.2
Professor Rieke Alten, Head of the Department of Internal Medicine, Rheumatology, Clinical Immunology and Osteology at Schlosspark-Klinik, Teaching Hospital of Charité, Berlin, Germany said, “Despite improvements in treating RA, there is still a significant way to go to help patients and reduce the burden of the disease. Today, pain, fatigue and the psychological issues connected with RA really impact patients on a daily basis, and with frequent visits to hospitals, it is crucial that we find an effective treatment option for patients. The SC formulation of biosimilar inﬂiximab, CT-P13, could address unmet needs in maintenance therapy and provide an affordable, convenient, and personalised treatment option. The results seen to-date demonstrate CT-P13 SC has the potential to be an innovative biosimilar treatment – improving convenience and allowing patients to have more control of their treatment and enjoy life again.”
In a separate study, Celltrion investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of CT-P13 up to five years in people with RA and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), including patients who switched from reference infliximab to CT-P13. The study collected and analysed data from 491 patients (154 RA and 337 AS), including 19 and 118 switched patients with RA and AS, respectively. The probability of drug survival at year five for patients with RA was 0.42 and 0.53, respectively for naïve and switched patients. The probability of drug survival at year five for patients with AS was 0.64 and 0.72, respectively for naïve and switched patients. This five-year analysis of medical records showed that long term treatment with CT-P13 was safe and efficacious based on drug survival, disease activity measurements and adverse events. Drug survival was similar between patients who were naïve at the start of CT-P13 treatment and switched from reference to CT-P13.
Mr Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare said, “We at Celltrion Healthcare are proud to be leading in the biosimilar space, providing physicians with accessible treatment options that suit the individual needs and preferences of their patients, whether that is intravenous or subcutaneous, is important to us. Such innovations in drug administration are shown to really benefit patients and so, being able to offer CT-P13 SC, with the new pharmaco-economic value expected with dual formulation of infliximab, could offer patients a more convenient treatment option reducing the time spent in hospitals.”

 Sobi has also received the US FDA’s PR voucher for emapalumab with an expected completion of the acquisition in Q3’19 and plans to establish a center of excellence in Sweden and Switzerland for hematology & immunology respectively
 Emapalumab is a mAb, binding to & neutralizing interferon gamma (IFNγ), indicated for HLH in pediatric & adults. In Jul’18, Novimmune grants exclusive global rights of emapalumab to Sobi which is now replaced with the acquisition","Intended reorganisation of R&D to increase focus and investment in late-stage development
Plans to establish centres of excellence in Sweden and Switzerland
The new focus of the R&D organisation would lead to annual savings of SEK 200–300 M in 2020 to be reallocated to late-stage development. Costs of around SEK 100–200 M relating to the reorganisation and redundancies will be charged in 2019.
Following today’s announcement of the acquisition of emapalumab and related assets, Sobi™ (Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ)(STO:SOBI) intends to carry out a reorganisation to increase the focus of research & development resources to support its two core therapeutic areas: Haematology and Immunology.
Sobi’s focus for the future is on building its pipeline through the continued development of core assets in late stage and the acquisition of promising late-stage candidates. To this end, Sobi intends to establish two centres of excellence, for Haematology in Sweden and for Immunology in Switzerland.
Guido Oelkers, Sobi President and CEO, says: “This planned structural alignment will sharpen the focus of the company on our two main areas: Haematology and Immunology. The integration of the emapalumab organisation makes this alignment possible.
“We will continue to increase our R&D spend in late-stage development, demonstrating our commitment to making a significant difference for people with rare diseases by providing access to innovative treatments within the rare disease space.”
Sobi also intends to discontinue discovery/early research and partner R&D programmes outside its core focus areas. This includes the intention to divest the SOBI006 project and the SOBI003 project.
The new focus of the R&D organisation is expected to lead to annual savings of SEK 200–300 M on a full-year basis in 2020, which will increase the company’s financial flexibility to reallocate future investments into late-stage development projects. In 2019 restructuring costs of around
SEK 100–200 M relating to the reorganisation and redundancies corresponding to approximately 90 positions will be charged. Guidance for the full year 2019, excluding restructuring costs, remains unchanged.

Pulmonary Toxicity

Trastuzumab products can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity, which includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions
Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity
Discontinue KANJINTI™ in patients experiencing pulmonary toxicity
Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia

In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3-4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements 
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.
Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’s research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’sefforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies Amgen has acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen’s systems and Amgen’s data. Amgen’s stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

15833,ï»¿BMS Reports Results of Orencia (abatacept) in P-IV Early AMPLE Study for Moderate-to-Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis #EULAR2019,New Mechanistic Study Explores the Relationship Between a Key Genetic Marker and Clinical Efficacy of ORENCIA (abatacept) or adalimumab in Moderate-to-Severe Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients,"The P-IV Early AMPLE mechanistic study results involve assessing of Orencia (125 mg, SC) vs adalimumab (40mg, SC) on a background of MTX in 80 patients in a ratio (1:1) with moderate-to-severe RA seropositive for anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF)
 The P-IV Early AMPLE study results: @24wks. ACR 20/50/70 responses (83/70/48 vs 63/45/30); ACR 20/50/70 with Shared Epitope positive (SE+) (28.6/31.5/27.6); DAS28-CRP remission <2.6 (27.4), no new safety signals are observed
 Orencia is an immunomodulator act by disrupting the continuous cycle of T-cell activation that characterizes RA and indicated for RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis & adult psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the US","Findings from head-to-head Early AMPLE study are consistent with earlier studies, adding to body of research showing differences between mechanisms of biologic therapies
Results suggest that a genetic marker linked to autoantibody production and a more severe RA disease course – “Shared Epitope” – can help identify patients who may receive enhanced benefit from treatment with ORENCIA
Late-breaking oral presentation is one of 27 Bristol-Myers Squibb sponsored abstracts featured at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2019)
THURSDAY, JUNE 13, 2019 4:30 PM EDT
PRINCETON, N.J.—Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today announced data from a Phase IV mechanistic study exploring differences in the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ORENCIA® (abatacept) and another treatment, adalimumab, interfere with disease progression in moderate-to-severe early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients seropositive for certain autoantibodies. These results, which are from a prospective analysis of the Early AMPLE head–to–head trial, are featured in a late–breaking oral presentation at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2019), June 12–15 in Madrid.
Among 80 adult patients with early (≤ 12 months from symptom onset) moderate-to-severe RA who had never been treated with a biologic medication and tested positive for autoantibodies called anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF), numerically higher efficacy responses were seen with ORENCIA at week 24. ACR 20/50/70 responses with ORENCIA were 83, 70 and 48 respectively; ACR 20/50/70 scores for adalimumab were 63, 45 and 30, respectively. Higher responses were observed in patients with a well–known genetic marker of RA prognosis called the “Shared Epitope” (SE). In SE+ patients, numerically greater efficacy was observed with ORENCIA [estimate of difference in the SE+ group for ACR 20 was 28.6 (95% CI 4.6, 51.7); for ACR 50 was 31.5 (95% CI 6.8, 54.5); for ACR 70, 27.6 (95% CI 1.4, 50.5); for DAS28-CRP remission (<2.6), 27.4 (95% CI 1.2, 49.8)]. Patients in both arms of the study were also treated with stable, oral methotrexate (MTX) weekly.
Rheumatoid factor and ACPA are biomarkers associated with a more severe disease course in RA. The HLA-DRB1 allele, which codes for SE, provides instructions for making a protein that plays a key role in helping the immune system distinguish one’s own proteins from those of harmful invaders, such as bacteria and viruses. Shared Epitope has been shown to be strongly associated with RA, and is thought to be involved with the continuous activation of immune cells, called T cells, that characterizes RA. Shared Epitope is present in 70-80 percent of RA patients positive for ACPA.
“The Early AMPLE results are consistent with previous abatacept research in patients who test positive for anti–citrullinated protein antibody, and offer important insights into the underlying genetic mechanisms at work in these patients,” said Vivian P. Bykerk, BSc, MD, FRCPC, rheumatologist at Hospital for Special Surgery. “This research advances our understanding of these mechanisms and the value of the applicability of precision medicine for patients with highly active, progressive rheumatoid arthritis.”
Similar numbers of related adverse events (ORENCIA: 12 [30%]; adalimumab: 11 [27.5%]) and related serious adverse events (ORENCIA: 0; adalimumab: 1 [2.5%]) were observed in the two treatment arms. The overall safety profile of ORENCIA was consistent with prior studies, with no new safety signals identified.
“Investigating the impact of biomarkers is central to our goal of informing better, more personalized approaches in immune–mediated diseases where treatment options are limited or improvements are needed,” said Dr. Brian Gavin, development lead, ORENCIA, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “The results from Early AMPLE are exciting because they support the clinical profile of ORENCIA as a first–line treatment option for patients with moderate–to–severe RA, and further our understanding of which patients may benefit most from ORENCIA therapy.”
At the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2019), Bristol–Myers Squibb sponsored a total of 27 abstracts. These include clinical and real–world results on ORENCIA that support our focuses on furthering precision medicine in RA and addressing unmet patient needs in moderate-to-severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Findings on new modes of action being explored as part of Bristol–Myers Squibb’s early Immunoscience program also will be shared. A full list of abstract titles and authors can be accessed online here.
About the Early AMPLE Study
Early AMPLE, a phase IV randomized, head-to-head, single-blinded study of 24 weeks duration with multiple exploratory endpoints (changes to autoantibody levels, changes to cytokines, changes to percentages of immune cell subsets, and changes to activation states of immune cell subsets), compared the efficacy of the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of ORENCIA versus adalimumab on a background of MTX in adult, biologic-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe RA.
In this prospective analysis, adults with early (≤ 12 months from symptom onset), moderate–to–severe RA (ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria) seropositive for ACPA and RF, were randomized 1:1 to SC ORENCIA 125 mg weekly or SC adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks (both with stable, oral MTX weekly) for 24 weeks. Patients were grouped by SE status (+/−) based on HLA-DRB1 genotype (−: no SE allele; +: ≥ 1 SE allele). Safety was analyzed throughout the trial and up to 8 weeks post last study drug dose. Clinical efficacy was assessed at week 24 to determine the proportion of ACR20/50/70 responders in the ORENCIA versus adalimumab arms, and the adjusted mean changes from baseline in DAS28 (CRP), SDAI and CDAI. Treatment differences between ORENCIA and adalimumab in SE+ and SE– pts were assessed for ACR20/50/70 responders and DAS28 (CRP) remission at week 24.
Eighty patients were treated: 40 ORENCIA (9 SE−, 30 SE+, 1 SE unknown) and 40 adalimumab (9 SE−, 31 SE+). Baseline characteristics were balanced. Mean (SD) age, disease duration and DAS28 (CRP) were 46.0 (14.4) years, 5.5 (2.6) months and 5.2 (1.1), respectively; 75% were female.
About Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a destructive autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation in the lining of joints (or synovium), causing joint damage with chronic pain, stiffness, and swelling. Rheumatoid arthritis causes limited range of motion and decreased joint function. The condition is more common in women than in men, who account for 75 percent of patients diagnosed with RA.
About ORENCIA
ORENCIA® is an immunomodulator that disrupts the continuous cycle of T–cell activation that characterizes RA.
U.S. Indications/Usage and Important Safety Information for ORENCIA® (abatacept)
Indication and Usage
Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): ORENCIA® (abatacept) is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA. ORENCIA may be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA): ORENCIA® (abatacept) is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in patients 2 years of age and older with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. ORENCIA may be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with methotrexate (MTX).
Adult Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): ORENCIA® (abatacept) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active PsA.
Important Limitations of Use: ORENCIA should not be administered concomitantly with TNF antagonists, and is not recommended for use concomitantly with other biologic RA therapy, such as anakinra.
Important Safety Information for ORENCIA ® (abatacept)
Concomitant Use with TNF Antagonists: Concurrent therapy with ORENCIA and a TNF antagonist is not recommended. In controlled clinical trials, adult RA patients receiving concomitant intravenous ORENCIA and TNF antagonist therapy experienced more infections (63%) and serious infections (4.4%) compared to patients treated with only TNF antagonists (43% and 0.8%, respectively), without an important enhancement of efficacy.
Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions can occur during or after an infusion and can be life-threatening. There were 2 cases (<0.1%; n=2688) of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions in clinical trials with adult RA patients treated with intravenous ORENCIA. Other reactions potentially associated with drug hypersensitivity, such as hypotension, urticaria, and dyspnea, each occurred in <0.9% of patients. There was one case of a hypersensitivity reaction with ORENCIA in JIA clinical trials (0.5%; n=190). In postmarketing experience, a case of fatal anaphylaxis following the first infusion of ORENCIA was reported. Appropriate medical support measures for treating hypersensitivity reactions should be available for immediate use. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of ORENCIA should be stopped immediately and permanently discontinued, with appropriate therapy instituted.
Infections: Serious infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, have been reported in patients receiving ORENCIA. Some of these infections have been fatal. Many of the serious infections have occurred in patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which, in addition to their underlying disease, could further predispose them to infection. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of infection or underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections. Treatment with ORENCIA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Patients should be screened for tuberculosis and viral hepatitis in accordance with published guidelines, and if positive, treated according to standard medical practice prior to therapy with ORENCIA.
Immunizations: Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ORENCIA or within 3 months of its discontinuation. The efficacy of vaccination in patients receiving ORENCIA is not known. ORENCIA may blunt the effectiveness of some immunizations. It is recommended that JIA patients be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating therapy with ORENCIA.
Use in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Adult COPD patients treated with ORENCIA developed adverse events more frequently than those treated with placebo, including COPD exacerbations, cough, rhonchi, and dyspnea. In adult RA studies, 97% of COPD patients treated with ORENCIA developed adverse reactions versus 88% treated with placebo and respiratory disorders occurred more frequently in patients treated with ORENCIA compared to those on placebo (43% vs 24%, respectively), including COPD exacerbation, cough, rhonchi, and dyspnea. A greater percentage of adult RA patients treated with ORENCIA developed a serious adverse event compared to those on placebo (27% vs 6%), including COPD exacerbation [3 of 37 patients (8%)] and pneumonia [1 of 37 patients (3%)]. Use of ORENCIA in patients with RA and COPD should be undertaken with caution, and such patients monitored for worsening of their respiratory status.
Blood Glucose Testing: ORENCIA for intravenous administration contains maltose, which may result in falsely elevated blood glucose readings on the day of infusion when using blood glucose monitors with test strips utilizing glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline quinone (GDH-PQQ). Consider using monitors and advising patients to use monitors that do not react with maltose, such as those based on glucose dehydrogenase nicotine adenine dinucleotide (GDH-NAD), glucose oxidase or glucose hexokinase test methods. ORENCIA for subcutaneous (SC) administration does not contain maltose; therefore, patients do not need to alter their glucose monitoring.
Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ORENCIA use in pregnant women and the data with ORENCIA use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform on drug-associated risk. A pregnancy registry has been established to monitor pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ORENCIA during pregnancy. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-877-311-8972.
Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of abatacept in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, abatacept was present in the milk of lactating rats dosed with abatacept.
Most Serious Adverse Reactions: Serious infections (3% ORENCIA vs 1.9% placebo) and malignancies (1.3% ORENCIA vs 1.1% placebo).
Malignancies: The overall frequency of malignancies was similar between adult RA patients treated with ORENCIA or placebo. However, more cases of lung cancer were observed in RA patients treated with ORENCIA (0.2%) than those on placebo (0%). A higher rate of lymphoma was seen compared to the general population; however, patients with RA, particularly those with highly active disease, are at a higher risk for the development of lymphoma. The potential role of ORENCIA in the development of malignancies in humans is unknown.
Most Frequent Adverse Events (≥10%): Headache, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and nausea were the most commonly reported adverse events in the adult RA clinical studies. Other events reported in ≥5% of JIA patients were diarrhea, cough, pyrexia, and abdominal pain. In general, the adverse events in JIA and adult PsA patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult RA patients.
Note concerning ORENCIA administration options: Intravenous dosing has not been studied in patients younger than 6 years of age. The safety and efficacy of ORENCIA ClickJect™ Autoinjector for subcutaneous injection has not been studied in patients under 18 years of age.

“Tislelizumab demonstrated high anti-tumor activity in patients with R/R cHL – evidenced by an overall response rate of 87% and a complete response rate of 63%, and was generally well tolerated in these patients,” said Yuqin Song, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Medical Oncology, Deputy Director of the Lymphoma Department at Peking University Cancer Hospitalin China, and the presenting author of the study.

Summary of Clinical Results

Abstract Number: PF469

This single-arm, multi-center, pivotal Phase 2 study of tislelizumab as a monotherapy in Chinese patients with R/R cHL (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03209973) enrolled 70 patients who were either R/R to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), or received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy for cHL and were not candidates for ASCT. Patients were treated with tislelizumab, dosed at 200 mg intravenously every three weeks. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall response rate (ORR) assessed by independent review committee (IRC) according to the Lugano Classification 2014.

As of November 26, 2018, 70 patients with R/R cHL were evaluable for efficacy. Thirteen patients received prior ASCT, and the remaining 57 patients were ineligible for ASCT. Patients had a median of three prior lines of systemic therapy (2-11). Results included:

With a minimum of 23.8 weeks of follow-up and a median follow-up time of 13.9 months at the data cutoff, the ORR by IRC was 87.1% (61/70); 44 patients (62.9%) achieved a complete response (CR), and 17 patients (24.3%) achieved a partial response (PR);
The median duration of response (DOR) has not been reached;
Twelve-month progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated at 73.8% and median PFS has not been reached;
The majority of adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade include pyrexia (57.1%), weight increase (34.3%), upper respiratory tract infection and hypothyroidism (32.9% each), pruritus, white blood cell (WBC) count decreased, and cough (18.6%, each);
Grade ≧3 TEAEs occurred in 30% of patients, with the most frequently reported being hypertension, pneumonitis, neutrophil count decrease, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight increase (2.9%, each); only 2.9% of patients reported grade 4 TEAEs and there were no fatal TEAEs.
Four patients (5.7%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs, including pneumonitis (n=2), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (n=1), and organizing pneumonia (n=1); and
Immune-related (ir) TEAEs reported in more than 5% of patients included thyroid disorder (22.9%), skin adverse reactions (8.6%)*, and pneumonitis (7.1%).

About Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma

Hodgkin’s lymphoma is one of the two major types of lymphoma that begin in the lymph nodes and tissues of the lymphatic system. All other lymphomas are classified as non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the most common form representing about 95% of patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, is characterized by the presence of very large cells called Reed-Sternberg cells. There were approximately 2,100 diagnosed cases of Hodgkin’s lymphoma in China in 2012.i Although the cancer can occur in both children and adults, it is most commonly diagnosed in young adults between the ages of 15 and 35 and in older adults over age 50.

About Tislelizumab

Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is an investigational humanized IgG4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to FcγR on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug candidate produced from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologic program, and is being developed as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.
Tislelizumab is being studied in a broad clinical program. BeiGene has completed a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL). Ongoing clinical trials of tislelizumab include a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with second-line or third-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in second-line patients with esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with gastric cancer (GC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with ESCC; a Phase 3 trial in patients with Stage III NSCLC; a Phase 2 clinical trial in second- or third-line patients with HCC; and a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with R/R NK/T-cell lymphomas. The aforementioned studies are enrolling patients in multiple countries, including the U.S., Europe, and China.
Additionally, BeiGene is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with non-squamous NSCLC; a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with squamous NSCLC; a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC); a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC; and a pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors. These studies are enrolling patients in China.

New drug applications (NDA) for tislelizumab in patients with R/R cHL and in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic UC have been accepted by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, formerly known as CFDA) and the R/R cHL filing has been granted priority review. BeiGene and Celgene Corporation have a global strategic collaboration for the development of tislelizumab in solid tumor cancers outside of Asia (except Japan).

 The P-IIIb/IV SPIRIT-H2H study results: met its 1EPs & 2Eps i.e, @24wks. reduction by 50% in disease activity as defined by ACR50; PASI100 (36% vs 28%) & superior to Humira, ACR50 (51% vs 47%); PASI100 (60% vs 47%) respectively, will be presented at EULAR
 Taltz is a mAb targeting IL-17A cytokine, act by inhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor which is involved in inflammatory and immune responses and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines","INDIANAPOLIS, June 14, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today that the company will present positive findings from the Phase 3b/4 SPIRIT-Head-to-Head (H2H) study in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) as a late-breaking abstract at the European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) in Madrid, Spain on June 15.
The assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial is the first and only H2H study that utilizes on-label dosing for both Taltz® (ixekizumab) and Humira® (adalimumab) and allows inclusion of concomitant conventional DMARDs. Topline results from the study, which demonstrated Taltz met the primary and all major secondary endpoints, were announced in December 2018.
“In the SPIRIT-H2H trial, Taltz demonstrated effectiveness in improving the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis,” said Philip Mease, M.D., Swedish Medical Center/Providence St. Joseph Health and University of Washington. “Head-to-head data like these are significant and help inform treatment decisions. This study underscores that Taltz is an important option for healthcare providers to consider for their patients.”
The primary endpoint of the study was superiority for Taltz compared to Humira in the proportion of patients who simultaneously achieved a reduction by at least 50 percent in disease activity as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR50) and complete skin clearance as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100). Key secondary endpoints included non-inferiority in the proportion of patients who achieved ACR50 and superiority in the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 100.
“For patients with active psoriatic arthritis, it’s important to find a treatment that is effective and consistent in alleviating the debilitating joint symptoms, while also improving skin clearance,” said Christi Shaw, president, Lilly Bio-Medicines. “We’re pleased to share the full results of SPIRIT-H2H, which demonstrate that Taltz was more effective than Humira in simultaneously achieving both joint and skin responses after 24 weeks of treatment.”
A total of 566 patients with active PsA were enrolled in the SPIRIT-H2H study. Patients were randomized to receive Taltz (n=234) or Humira (n=231) at the approved dose for PsA for a total of 52 weeks, with the primary analysis conducted at 24 weeks. PsA patients who also met the study criteria for moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis received Taltz (n=49) or Humira (n=52) at the approved dose for psoriasis.
At 24 weeks, the proportion of patients achieving both a reduction by at least 50 percent in disease activity as defined by ACR50 as well as complete skin clearance as measured by PASI 100, was significantly higher for Taltz (36 percent) than for Humira (28 percent) (P<.05).
Taltz also met the key secondary endpoints, including non-inferiority compared to Humira for the percentage of patients achieving ACR50 (51% vs. 47%) (95% CI [-4.3% , 12.1%]) (for noninferiority with -12.0% margin) and superiority compared to Humira for the percentage of patients achieving PASI 100 (60% vs. 47%) (P=.001).
In SPIRIT-H2H, the safety profile of Taltz was consistent with previously reported results. The most common adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity, and included infections (36.0% for Taltz vs. 30.7% for Humira), injection site reactions (9.5% for Taltz vs. 3.2% for Humira), allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (2.5% for Taltz vs. 3.9% for Humira) and cerebrocardiovascular events (1.1% for Taltz vs. 1.8% for Humira). No new safety signals were detected.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR TALTZ
Taltz is approved for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. Taltz is also approved to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TALTZ
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections
Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.
Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis
Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
Hypersensitivity
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each ≤0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group (Crohn’s disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than in the placebo group (0%) during clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease.
Immunizations
Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions (>1%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis was consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis.

IX HCP ISI 01DEC2017
About Taltz®
Taltz (ixekizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with interleukin 17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor.1 IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Taltz inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.1
About Psoriatic Arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, progressive form of inflammatory arthritis that can cause swelling, stiffness and pain in and around the joints and impaired physical function.2 It occurs when an overactive immune system sends out faulty signals that cause inflammation, leading to swollen and painful joints and tendons.2 PsA can affect peripheral joints in the arms and legs (elbows, wrists, hands and feet).2 If left untreated, PsA can cause permanent joint damage. Up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop PsA.2
About the SPIRIT-H2H Study
SPIRIT H2H study is a Phase 3b/4, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study with blinded outcomes assessments evaluating the efficacy and safety of Taltz versus Humira in patients with PsA who are biologic DMARD-naive during a 52-week treatment period. The primary endpoint of the study was the simultaneous achievement of ACR50 and PASI100 response at Week 24. This primary endpoint is an innovative approach that comprehensively measures clinically meaningful improvements across multiple domains of PsA. The major secondary endpoints were the demonstration of non-inferiority in ACR50 and superiority in PASI100 in Taltz compared to Humira. Patients with active PsA and plaque psoriasis with a body surface area involvement of at least three percent, who had inadequate response to at least one conventional DMARD, were enrolled in the study.

 The P-IIIb DIALIZE study resulted in maintaining normal potassium level (4-5 mmol/L) in 41.2% patients receiving Lokelma vs 1% receiving PBO, presented at ERA-EDTA
 Lokelma is an oral, formulated as suspension and commercially available in the US & EU for the treatment of hyperkalemia in adults","In Phase IIIb DIALIZE trial, 41.2% of Lokelma patients maintained normal potassium levels pre-dialysis compared to 1% receiving placebo
 

AstraZeneca today presented positive results from the Phase IIIb DIALIZE trial which investigated the efficacy and safety of Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis.
Hyperkalaemia is a serious condition characterised by elevated potassium levels in the blood.
In the trial, 41.2% of patients with hyperkalaemia on stable haemodialysis receiving Lokelma maintained pre-dialysis normal potassium levels (4-5 mmol/L) on at least three out of four dialysis treatments after the long interdialytic interval and did not require urgent rescue therapy, compared to 1.0% of patients receiving placebo. This was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement.
The safety profile of Lokelma observed in DIALIZE was consistent with previous trials.
The results were presented as a late-breaking abstract at the 56th European Renal Association – European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Congress in Budapest, Hungary and were published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.
Elisabeth Björk, Senior Vice President, Head of Late-stage Development, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “These positive results show that Lokelma can normalize potassium levels in between dialysis sessions for patients with hyperkalaemia who have end-stage renal disease. There is a high unmet treatment need that affects a large patient population and we believe Lokelma can play a critical role.”
Steven Fishbane, MD, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Great Neck, NY, and primary investigator in the DIALIZE trial, said: “An estimated two million people worldwide have end-stage renal disease, placing them at a higher risk for hyperkalaemia. Despite being on dialysis, many still have high potassium levels, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. These results provide important insights for the clinical community and patients, and have the potential to transform the treatment paradigm.”
Hyperkalaemia can be a result of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases, and use of certain medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors.1,2,3,4 Many patients with ESRD have hyperkalaemia despite being on haemodialysis.5,6 Prevalence and severity of hyperkalaemia is highest after the long interdialytic interval, the longest number of days between dialysis sessions.
Lokelma is a highly-selective, oral potassium-removing agent currently approved and available in the US and EU for the treatment of adults with hyperkalaemia. Data from the DIALIZE trial will support label updates in the US and EU as the dosing regimen used in the trial is not currently approved.
About hyperkalaemia
The risk of hyperkalaemia is associated with common comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF) and diabetes, and these are the same conditions in which renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are recommended in guidelines. To help prevent the recurrence of hyperkalaemia, important guideline-recommended RAAS inhibitor therapy is often modified or discontinued. Hyperkalaemia occurs in 23% to 47% of patients with CKD and/or HF, with an estimated 200 million and 64 million people, respectively, living with each condition worldwide.
About DIALIZE
DIALIZE is the first ever randomised, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate a potassium binder in patients on stable haemodialysis. The Phase IIIb, multicentre, double-blind trial investigated the efficacy of Lokelma versus placebo in 196 patients on haemodialysis with hyperkalaemia. Patients were randomised to receive Lokelma or placebo once daily on non-dialysis days for a treatment period of 8 weeks. This included a 4 week dose adjustment phase (starting at 5 g and titrated weekly in 5 g increments up to a maximum of 15 g) and a 4 week evaluation phase on stable dose.
About Lokelma
Lokelma is an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension, that acts as a highly-selective potassium-removing agent. It is administered orally, is odourless, tasteless and stable at room temperature. It has been studied in three double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials and in one 12-month open label clinical trial in patients with hyperkalaemia.

 The P-III DISCOVER 1 & 2 studies resulted in meeting its 1 EPs @24wks. i.e, improvement in ACR20, no new safety signals are observed
 Tremfya is a mAb selectively targeting p19 subunit of IL-23 and has received approval in multiple countries including the US, EU, Japan for moderate to severe PsA prior treated with systemic therapies or phototherapy","Data are part of the DISCOVER 1 and 2 program, the first Phase 3 studies to evaluate a selective IL-23 p19 inhibitor in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis
HORSHAM, Pa., June 14, 2019 — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced top-line results from the Phase 3 DISCOVER 1 and 2 studies, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab compared to placebo in adult patients with active moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Both studies met their primary endpoints of American College of Rheumatology 20 percent improvement (ACR20), and the safety profiles observed for guselkumab in the DISCOVER program were consistent with previous studies of guselkumab and TREMFYA® current prescribing information.
The DISCOVER program comprises the first-ever Phase 3 studies evaluating an IL-23 p19 inhibitor for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, and data will be presented at upcoming scientific medical meetings. Data from the two DISCOVER studies will serve as the basis of submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency seeking approval of guselkumab as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis, which are anticipated for later this year.
The DISCOVER program consists of DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2, two randomized, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of subcutaneous guselkumab in patients with active PsA compared to placebo. In addition to the primary endpoint of ACR20 response at week 24, multiple secondary endpoints were assessed that included ACR50/70, resolution of soft tissue inflammation (enthesitis and dactylitis), disease activity (DAS-28 CRP), improvement in physical function (HAQ-DI), skin clearance (IGA), and quality of life (SF-36 PCS and MCS). DISCOVER-2 also assessed effect on structural damage (vdH-S) as a key secondary endpoint.
DISCOVER-1 included 381 participants, including participants previously treated with anti-TNF biologics. The study continued through 52 weeks. DISCOVER-2 included 739 bio-naive participants and continued through 100 weeks.
About Psoriatic Arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by joint inflammation, enthesitis, dactylitis and the skin lesions associated with psoriasis.1 It is estimated that at least one million Americans are living with PsA, and up to 30 percent of patients living with psoriasis can develop PsA.2 The disease causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints and commonly appears between the ages of 30 and 50, but can develop at any time.1 Though the exact cause of PsA is unknown, genes, the immune system and environmental factors are all believed to play a role in the onset of the disease.1
About TREMFYA® (guselkumab)
TREMFYA® is a human monoclonal antibody developed by Janssen that selectively blocks the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23 and is approved in the U.S., Canada, European Union, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet or UV light). Ongoing trials include: two Phase 3 programs evaluating TREMFYA® in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis, a Phase 2b program in Crohn’s disease, and two Phase 2 programs – one for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis and the other for the treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa.

About Immunophotonics
Immunophotonics, Inc., a private biotechnology company focused on the burgeoning field of Interventional Immuno-Oncology™, is developing drugs to improve outcomes of interventional oncology procedures, such as tumor ablation and ablative radiation. Their lead compound, a polymer (IP-001), is designed to be injected intratumorally immediately after an interventional procedure, such as tumor ablation, which in turn may induce a polyclonal T cell response against the cancer. The approach is an attractive way for the surgeon or interventional radiologist to potentially both gain better control of tumor margins (and local recurrence) in locally ablated tumors, as well as to elevate an otherwise-local interventional procedure into an immunotherapy for cancer. This, in turn, may act synergistically with traditional immunotherapies administered by the medical oncologist. For more info, visit: www.immunophotonics.com.

The TRANBERG®|Thermal Therapy System has not yet received market clearance for immune stimulating interstitial laser thermotherapy (imILT®) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States of America (USA).

Monday, June 17, 2019 – 6:45am
EDT
NEW YORK & BOULDER, Colo.- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Array BioPharma Inc. (NASDAQ: ARRY) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need. Pfizer has agreed to acquire Array for $48 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $11.4 billion. The Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the merger.
Array’s portfolio includes the approved combined use of BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib) and MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) for the treatment of BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The combination therapy has significant potential for long-term growth via expansion into additional areas of unmet need and is currently being investigated in over 30 clinical trials across several solid tumor indications, including the Phase 3 BEACON trial in BRAF-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
In the U.S., colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and women. An estimated 140,250 patients were diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2018, and approximately 50,000 are estimated to die of their disease each year.1BRAFmutations are estimated to occur in up to 15% of colorectal cancer cases and represent a poor prognosis for these patients.
“Today’s announcement reinforces our commitment to deploy our capital to bring breakthroughs that change patients’ lives while creating shareholder value,” said Albert Bourla, chief executive officer of Pfizer. “The proposed acquisition of Array strengthens our innovative biopharmaceutical business, is expected to enhance its long-term growth trajectory, and sets the stage to create a potentially industry-leading franchise for colorectal cancer alongside Pfizer’s existing expertise in breast and prostate cancers.”
In addition to the combination therapy for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma, Array brings a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in development, as well as a portfolio of out-licensed potentially best-in-class and/or first-in-class medicines, which are expected to generate significant royalties over time.
“We are incredibly proud that Pfizer has recognized the value Array has brought to patients and our remarkable legacy discovering and advancing molecules with great potential to impact and extend the lives of patients in critical need,” said Ron Squarer, Array chief executive officer. “Pfizer shares our commitment to patients and a passion for advancing science to develop even more options for individuals with unmet needs. We’re excited our team will have access to world-class resources and a broader research platform to continue this critical work.”
In May 2019, Array announced results from the interim analysis of the Phase 3 BEACON mCRC trial: The second-or-third-line treatment with the BRAFTOVI triplet combination (BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI + cetuximab) showed statistically significant improvement in overall response rate and overall survival compared to the control group, reducing the risk of death by 48%. The triplet combination could be the first chemotherapy-free, targeted regimen for patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC. Array intends to submit these data for regulatory review in the United States in the second half of 2019.
“We are very excited by Array’s impressive track record of successfully discovering and developing innovative small-molecules and targeted cancer therapies,” said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer chief scientific officer and president, Worldwide Research, Development and Medical. “With Array’s exceptional scientific talent and innovative pipeline, combined with Pfizer’s leading research and development capabilities, we reinforce our commitment to advancing the most promising science, regardless of whether it is found inside or outside of our labs.”
Upon the close of the transaction, Array’s employees will join Pfizer and continue to be located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Morrisville, North Carolina, as well as Boulder, Colorado, which becomes part of Pfizer’s Oncology Research & Development network in addition to La Jolla, California and Pearl River, New York.
Pfizer expects to finance the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to Pfizer’s Adjusted Diluted EPS by $0.04 -$0.05 in 2019, $0.04 -$0.05 in 2020, neutral in 2021, and accretive beginning in 2022, with additional accretion and growth anticipated thereafter. Pfizer will provide any appropriate updates to its current 2019 guidance in conjunction with its third quarter 2019 earnings release.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Pfizer will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Array common stock for $48 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $11.4 billion. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Array common stock (on a fully-diluted basis). The merger agreement contemplates that Pfizer will acquire any shares of Array that are not tendered into the offer through a second-step merger, which will be completed promptly following the closing of the tender offer. Pfizer expects to complete the acquisition in the second half of 2019.
Pfizer’s financial advisors for the transaction were Guggenheim Securities, LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acting as its legal advisor. Centerview Partners served as Array’s exclusive financial advisor, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as its legal advisor.

A further description of risks and uncertainties relating to Pfizer and Array can be found in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and in Array’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and in their subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and available at www.sec.gov.
Pfizer calculates projections regarding the expected dilutive and accretive impact of the potential acquisition based on internal forecasts of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted Diluted EPS), which forecasts are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures derived by excluding certain amounts that would be included in GAAP calculations. These dilution/accretion projections should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures. The determinations of the amounts that are excluded from the dilution/accretion calculations are a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Pfizer is unable to present quantitative reconciliations because management cannot reasonably predict with reasonable certainty all of the necessary components of the comparable GAAP measure (such as the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, unusual or significant gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on investments in equity securities and potential future asset impairments) without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the relevant periods. Pfizer has excluded from the dilution/accretion calculations the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Such items can have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of financial performance. For more information on the Adjusted Diluted EPS measure see Pfizer’s 2018 Financial Report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and Pfizer’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2019.

15952,ï»¿AstraZeneca Reports Results of Calquence (acalabrutinib) in P-III ASCEND Study for R/R Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia #EHA2019,Calquence significantly prolonged the time patients lived without disease progression in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"The P-III ASCEND study results involve assessing of Calquence as monothx. (100mg, bid) vs Rituximab + Idelalisib (IdR) or Bendamustine (BR) in 310 patients in a ratio (1:1) with CLL prior treated with 1L therapy
 The P-III ASCEND study results: @16.1mos. improvement in PFS; reduction in risk of disease progression by 69%; @12mos. no diseases progression (88% vs 68%), no news safety signals are observed
 Calquence is a BTK inhibitor, covalently binding with BTK, inhibiting its activity in B-cell and has received FDA’s accelerated approval in Oct’17 for MCL, prior treated with 1L therapy with its expected regulatory submission in H2’19","An encouraging 88% of patients on Calquence remained free of disease progression after 12 months, vs. 68% of patients on rituximab combined with idelalisib or bendamustine
 

AstraZeneca today announced detailed results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ASCEND trial at the European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress in Amsterdam, showing Calquence (acalabrutinib) significantly prolonged the time patients live without disease progression in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
The ASCEND trial compared Calquence with the physician’s choice of rituximab combined with idelalisib (IdR) or bendamustine (BR) in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL.
At a median follow-up of 16.1 months, results from the trial showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with Calquence vs. IdR or BR, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 69% (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20-0.49, p<0.0001). The median time without disease progression for patients treated with Calquence has not yet been reached vs. 16.5 months in the control arm. At 12 months, 88% of patients on Calquence showed no disease progression compared to 68% for the control arm. The safety and tolerability of Calquencewas consistent with its established profile.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D said: “These data add to the growing body of evidence to support the profile of Calquence as a selective BTK inhibitor that offers a chemotherapy-free treatment option with a favourable safety profile in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a life-threatening disease. These data, along with our recent positive results from the Phase III ELEVATE-TN trial in previously-untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, will serve as the foundation for regulatory submissions later this year.”
Paolo Ghia, MD, Professor, Medical Oncology, Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, and investigator of the ASCEND trial, said: “This is the first randomised trial to directly compare a BTK inhibitor as monotherapy with standard chemoimmunotherapy or idelalisib and rituximab combinations. With a significant improvement in progression-free survival and a favourable safety profile, acalabrutinib may become an important choice for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.”

*Secondary primary malignancy **Non-melanoma skin cancer.
AstraZeneca recently announced that the Phase III ELEVATE-TN trial met its primary endpoint at interim analysis in patients with previously-untreated CLL and that full results will be reported at a forthcoming medical meeting. Calquence is currently approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the US, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar and is being developed for the treatment of CLL and other blood cancers.
About ASCEND
ASCEND (ACE-CL-309) is a global, randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of Calquence in previously-treated patients with CLL.2 In the trial, 310 patients were randomised (1:1) into two arms. Patients in the first arm received Calquence monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression). Patients in the second arm received physician’s choice of either rituximab in combination with idelalisib or rituximab in combination with bendamustine.1,2
The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and key secondary endpoints include physician-assessed PFS, IRC- and physician-assessed overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), as well as overall survival (OS), patient reported outcomes (PROs) and time to next treatment (TTNT).1,2
About Calquence
Calquence (acalabrutinib) was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Calquence is an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.3In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.
As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating Calquencein 26 company-sponsored clinical trials. Calquence is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma, and multiple myeloma and other haematologic malignancies. Beyond the positive Phase III trials ASCEND and ELEVATE-TN, other Phase III trials in CLL are ongoing, including ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006) evaluating acalabrutinib vs. ibrutinib in patients with previously-treated high-risk CLL, and ACE-CL-311 evaluating acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax and with/without obinutuzumab in patients with previously-untreated CLL without 17p deletion or TP53 mutation.
About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 191,000 new cases globally and 20,720 new cases in the US annually, and prevalence that is expected to grow with improved treatment.4-7 In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections.4 As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.4 This could result in anaemia, infection and bleeding.4 B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.
About AstraZeneca in haematology

15967,ï»¿Novo Nordisk's Victoza (liraglutide) Receives FDA's Approval for Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents,FDA approves Victoza for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents aged 10-17 years,"The approval is based on P-III ELLIPSE study results assessing Victoza (liraglutide, 1.8 mg/day) injection vs PBO + metformin with/without basal insulin in 135 children & adolescents in a ratio (1:1) with T2d aged 10-17yrs.
 Victoza is providing a new treatment option beyond metformin & insulin for the first time in the last 19 yrs. to lower blood sugar level along with diet & exercise
 Victoza is GLP-1 receptor agonist and has received the US FDA’s approval as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D and reduces the risk of CV events in T2D patients with heart disease","PLAINSBORO, N.J., June 17, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Novo Nordisk today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded indication for Victoza® (liraglutide) injection to lower blood sugar along with diet and exercise in children and adolescents aged 10-17 years with type 2 diabetes. As the first glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, Victoza® provides this population with a new treatment option beyond metformin and insulin for the first time in 19 years. Victoza® was first approved in the U.S. in 2010 as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.
The update is based on results from the global ELLIPSE trial, the first phase 3 trial completed in over a decade in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. In this study, patients aged 10 to 17 were randomized to receive liraglutide up to 1.8 mg/day or placebo, in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin over a 26-week double-blinded period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period.1
“We are delighted with the label expansion for Victoza®, which now includes an indication for use in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. – this is a landmark approval as the first-ever GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for this population,” commented Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. “The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the U.S. is ever increasing and we are seeing a higher number of diagnoses in children and adolescents, for whom there are limited treatment choices. Victoza® will provide a new option for clinicians treating this challenging disease, helping to address the growing need for this population.”
According to the World Health Organization, type 2 diabetes is becoming increasingly more common in children and young adults. However, because the disease often goes undiagnosed and studies to assess the number of newly occurring cases are complicated, there is very little data on its true incidence.2 In the U.S., it is estimated that type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately half of all new cases of diabetes in adolescents and a third of these cases are undiagnosed.3
Indications and Usage
What is Victoza®?
Victoza® (liraglutide) injection 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg is an injectable prescription medicine used:

along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar (glucose) in adults and children who are 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus
to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke or death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with known heart disease.
Victoza® is not for use in people with type 1 diabetes or people with diabetic ketoacidosis. 
It is not known if Victoza® can be used with mealtime insulin. 
It is not known if Victoza® is safe and effective to lower blood sugar in children under 10 years of age.
Important Safety Information
What is the most important information I should know about Victoza®?
Victoza® may cause serious side effects, including:

Possible thyroid tumors, including cancer. Tell your health care provider if you get a lump or swelling in your neck, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of thyroid cancer. In studies with rats and mice, Victoza® and medicines that work like Victoza® caused thyroid tumors, including thyroid cancer. It is not known if Victoza® will cause thyroid tumors or a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in people.
Who should not use Victoza®?
Do not use Victoza® if:

you or any of your family have ever had MTC or if you have an endocrine system condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).
you are allergic to liraglutide or any of the ingredients in Victoza®.
What should I tell my health care provider before using Victoza®?
Before using Victoza®, tell your health care provider if you:

have or have had problems with your pancreas, kidneys, or liver.
have any other medical conditions or severe problems with your stomach, such as slowed emptying of your stomach (gastroparesis) or problems with digesting food.
are pregnant or breastfeeding or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed.
Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbal supplements, and other medicines to treat diabetes, including insulin or sulfonylureas.
How should I use Victoza®?

Do not mix insulin and Victoza® together in the same injection.
You may give an injection of Victoza® and insulin in the same body area (such as your stomach area), but not right next to each other.
Do not share your Victoza® pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them.
What are the possible side effects of Victoza®?

15974,BeiGene Terminates its Worldwide Development and Commercialization Agreement with Celgene for Tislelizumab,BeiGene Regains Full Global Rights to Its Investigational Anti-PD-1 Antibody Tislelizumab,"BeiGene to receive $150M and regains WW rights for tislelizumab with their mutual termination of WW development & commercialization agreement with Celgene, following the pending acquisition of Celgene by BMS
 In Jul’17, BeiGene granted exclusive WW rights (Ex- Asia) of tislelizumab for solid tumor and retained global rights for hematology & solid tumor in Asia. Additionally, BeiGene got exclusive commercialization rights for Celgene’s Abraxane, Revlimid, Vidaza in China which is unaffected with the termination deal of tislelizumab
 Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is an anti-PD-1 antibody, targeting IgG4, minimizing the binding of FcγR on macrophages. NMPA has accepted its NDA for tislelizumab in patients with R/R cHL & LA or metastatic UC and has received PR for R/R cHL filing","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and BEIJING, China, June 17, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — BeiGene, Ltd.(NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative molecularly-targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer, today announced that it has entered into a mutual agreement with Celgene Corporation to terminate the parties’ global collaboration for tislelizumab, BeiGene’s investigational anti-PD-1 antibody, in advance of the pending acquisition of Celgene by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In connection with the termination, Celgene has agreed to pay $150 million to BeiGene.

“Our collaboration with Celgene was instrumental for the late-stage clinical development of tislelizumab and has provided us with significant resources to continue our broad clinical program,” said John V. Oyler, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of BeiGene. “As we have been leading most of the ongoing Phase 3 or potentially registration-enabling trials with a global development organization of over 800 people, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue the development of tislelizumab. I am proud of the work that we have accomplished in collaboration with Celgene and am excited by the tremendous opportunity that we have ahead now that we’ve regained full global rights to tislelizumab.”

Tislelizumab has been dosed in over 2,950 patients globally. With two new drug applications under review in China, BeiGene expects tislelizumab to receive its first regulatory approval later this year.

In July 2017, BeiGene and Celgene announced a global strategic collaboration in which Celgeneobtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize tislelizumab in solid tumor cancers in the United States, Europe, Japan and the rest of world outside of Asia. BeiGene retained rights in hematology indications globally and in solid tumor cancers in Asia (ex-Japan). In connection with that agreement, BeiGene also acquired Celgene’s commercial operations in China and an exclusive license to Celgene’s cancer commercial portfolio in China (ABRAXANE®, REVLIMID®, VIDAZA®). BeiGene’s commercial license from Celgene is not affected by the termination of the tislelizumab agreement. In the almost two years since the transaction, BeiGene has grown its commercial organization in China to more than 600 people.

About Tislelizumab

Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) is an investigational humanized IgG4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody specifically designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages. In pre-clinical studies, binding to FcγR on macrophages has been shown to compromise the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 antibodies through activation of antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated killing of T effector cells. Tislelizumab is the first drug candidate produced from BeiGene’s immuno-oncology biologic program, and is being developed as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a broad array of both solid tumor and hematologic cancers.
Tislelizumab is being studied in a broad clinical program. BeiGene has completed a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL). Ongoing clinical trials of tislelizumab include a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with second-line or third-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in second-line patients with esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with gastric cancer (GC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with ESCC; a Phase 2 clinical trial in second- or third-line patients with HCC; and a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with R/R NK/T-cell lymphomas. The aforementioned studies are enrolling patients in multiple countries, including the U.S., Europe, and China.
Additionally, BeiGene is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with non-squamous NSCLC; a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with squamous NSCLC; a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC); a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC); a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer; and a pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors. These studies are enrolling patients in China.

New drug applications (NDA) for tislelizumab in patients with R/R cHL and in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC have been accepted by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, formerly known as CFDA) and the R/R cHL filing has been granted priority review.

15981,ï»¿Roche's Rozlytrek (entrectinib) Receives MHLW's Approval for NTRK Fusion-Positive Advanced Recurrent Solid Tumors in Adult and Pediatric Patients in Japan,Japan becomes the first country to approve Roche’s personalised medicine Rozlytrek,"The approval is based on P-II STARTRK-2, P-I STARTRK-1, P-I ALKA-372-001 & P-I/II STARTRK-NG studies results assessing Rozlytrek in adults & pediatric patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, across 10 different tumor types, including CNS metastases solid tumors across 15 countries in 150+ clinical studies respectively 
 The P-II STARTRK-2 study demonstrated that Rozlytrek shrank tumors in 50%+ patients, ORR (56.9%), mDOR (10.4 mos.), intracranial response (IC ORR) (50%). P-I/II STARTRK-NG resulted in shrinking tumors in children and adolescent
 Rozlytrek (RXDX-101) is a personalized oral therapy indicated for NTRK 1/2/3 LA/m-solid tumors, inhibits the kinase activity of TRK A/B/C and ROS1 protein with its expected MHLW’s approval for ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC in Japan","First tumour-agnostic medicine approved in Japan for adult and paediatric patients with NTRK fusion-positive advanced recurrent solid tumours
Approval supported by the data mainly from the pivotal Phase II STARTRK-2 study showing that Rozlytrek shrank tumours in more than half of people with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours, across 10 different tumour types, including those with central nervous system metastases
Rozlytrek is also undergoing review in Japan for the treatment of ROS1 fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved Rozlytrek® (entrectinib) for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive, advanced recurrent solid tumours. Rozlytrek is the first tumour-agnostic medicine to be approved in Japan that targets NTRK gene fusions, which have been identified in a range of hard-to-treat solid tumour types, including pancreatic, thyroid, salivary gland, breast, colorectal, and lung.1 It has been granted Sakigake designation and orphan drug designation by the MHLW.2
Rozlytrek is also undergoing regulatory review in Japan for the treatment of people with ROS1 fusion-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).2
“Today’s approval of Rozlytrek represents a new chapter in personalised healthcare, applying advanced diagnostics to deliver precision medicines that target cancers based on their molecular drivers instead of their location in the body,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are proud to be at the forefront of personalised medicine with this novel treatment approach, and we look forward to working with regulatory agencies around the world to bring Rozlytrek to more patients with NTRK fusion-positive cancer, as well as to those with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC, as soon as possible.”
The data package for this first approval of Rozlytrek includes the pivotal Phase II STARTRK-2, Phase I STARTRK-1 and Phase I ALKA-372-001 trials, as well as data from the Phase I/II STARTRK-NG study in paediatric patients. Results showed:

In the pivotal Phase II STARTRK-2 study, Rozlytrek shrank tumours in more than half (objective response rate [ORR] = 56.9 percent) of people with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours. Objective responses to Rozlytrek were seen across 10 different solid tumour types (median duration of response [DoR] = 10.4 months), including in people with and without CNS metastases at baseline.
Importantly, Rozlytrek also shrank tumours that had spread to the brain in more than half of people (intracranial response [IC] ORR = 50.0 percent).2
In the STARTRK-NG study, Rozlytrek shrank tumours also in children and adolescents who had NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours including the patients with primary CNS tumours.3
The most commonly reported adverse reactions include constipation, altered sense of taste (dysgeusia), diarrhoea, dizziness, fatigue, swelling (oedema), weight increase, anaemia, blood creatinine increase, shortness of breath (dyspnea), and nausea.2
Biomarker testing for NTRK gene fusions is the only way to identify people who may be eligible for treatment with Rozlytrek. Roche is leveraging its expertise in developing personalised medicines and advanced diagnostics, in conjunction with Foundation Medicine, to help identify people with NTRK gene fusions using a companion diagnostic that is undergoing review.

About the supporting data
The data package for this approval includes the pivotal Phase II STARTRK-2, Phase I STARTRK-1 and Phase I ALKA-372-001 trials. In addition, data from the Phase I/II STARTRK-NG study in paediatric patients were also included in the submission. The studies enrolled people across 15 countries and more than 150 clinical trial sites. Tumour types evaluated in the studies included breast, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, gynaecological, neuroendocrine, non-small cell lung, salivary gland, pancreatic, sarcoma and thyroid cancers.1,2

STARTRK-2 is a Phase II, global, multicentre, open-label basket study in people with solid tumours that harbour an NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK-positive gene fusion. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR) is a secondary endpoint. Other secondary outcome measures include time to response, clinical benefit rate, intracranial tumour response, progression-free survival (PFS), central nervous system (CNS) PFS and overall survival (OS).4
STARTRK-1 is a Phase I, multicentre, open-label dose escalation study of a daily continuous dosing schedule in people with solid tumours with NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK gene fusions in the US and South Korea. The trial assessed the safety and tolerability of Rozlytrek via a standard dose escalation scheme and determined the recommended Phase II dose.5
ALKA-372-001 is Phase I, multicentre, open-label dose escalation study of an intermittent and continuous Rozlytrek dosing schedule in people with advanced or metastatic solid tumours with TRKA/B/C, ROS1 or ALK gene fusions in Italy.2
STARTRK-NG is a Phase I/II dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Rozlytrek in children and adolescent patients with no curative first-line treatment option, recurrent or refractory extracranial solid tumours or primary CNS tumours, with or without TRK, ROS1 or ALK fusions.3
About NTRK fusion-positive cancer
Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive cancer occurs when the NTRK1/2/3 genes fuse with other genes, resulting in altered TRK proteins (TRKA/TRKB/TRKC) that can activate signaling pathways involved in proliferation of certain types of cancer. NTRK gene fusions are tumour-agnostic, meaning they are present in tumours irrespective of site of origin. These fusions have been identified in a broad range of solid tumour types, including breast, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, gynaecological, neuroendocrine, non-small cell lung, salivary gland, pancreatic, sarcoma and thyroid cancers.1

About Rozlytrek
Rozlytrek (RXDX-101) is an oral medicine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours that harbour NTRK1/2/3, as well as in development for the treatment of ROS1 gene fusions. It is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit the kinase activity of the TRK A/B/C and ROS1 proteins, whose activating fusions drive proliferation in certain types of cancer.6,7 Rozlytrek can block ROS1 and NTRK kinase activity and may result in the death of cancer cells with ROS1 or NTRK gene fusions.6,7
Rozlytrek has been granted Priority Review by the FDA for the treatment of NTRK fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours in adult and paediatric patients who have either progressed following prior therapies or as an initial therapy when there are no acceptable standard therapies, and for the treatment of people with metastatic, ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC. It has also been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Sakigake designation and orphan drug designation by MHLW.2

 Lynparza is a PARP inhibitor, act by blocking DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumors and has received approval in 60+ countries including the US, EU as 1L maintenance treatment for BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer and in 40+ countries for germline BRCAm HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer","60% of patients receiving Lynparza remained free of disease progression
after three years vs. 27% on placebo in pivotal Phase III SOLO-1 trial
AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza is the only PARP
inhibitor approved in the EU for this indication
 

AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Lynparza (olaparib) as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for women with BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer.
The licensed indication is as a maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) BRCA1/2-mutated (germline and/or somatic) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “This approval sets the stage for a new standard of care in the EU for women with ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation. The goals of front-line therapy have always been long-term remission and even cure, yet currently 70% of patients relapse within three years of initial treatment. The progression-free survival benefit of Lynparza observed in SOLO-1 represents a major step forward in our ambition to help transform patient outcomes.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “In SOLO-1, Lynparza demonstrated clinically-meaningful results with a 70% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the first-line maintenance treatment of patients with BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer. Merck and AstraZeneca are committed to improving outcomes for people with cancer and we will work to bring this new option to women in the EU, many of whom have historically poor outcomes, as quickly as possible.”
The EC approval was based on data from the pivotal Phase III SOLO-1 trial which tested Lynparza as maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo in patients with BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Results announced in October 2018 at 40.7 months of follow-up showed the median time of progression for patients treated with Lynparza had not yet been reached vs. 13.8 months for those on placebo (HR 0.30 [95% CI, 0.23-0.41], p<0.001).
This is the third indication for Lynparza in the EU. AstraZeneca and MSD are exploring additional trials in ovarian cancer, including the ongoing Phase III PAOLA-1 trial, which is testing Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for women with newly-diagnosed, advanced, stage IIIB-IV high grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer, regardless of BRCA status.
About SOLO-1
SOLO-1 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lynparza tablets (300mg twice daily) as a maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo in patients with BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The trial randomised 391 patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who were in clinical complete or partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy.
Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive Lynparza or placebo for up to two years or until disease progression. Patients who had a partial response at two years were permitted to stay on therapy at the investigator’s discretion. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and key secondary endpoints included time to second disease progression or death, time to first subsequent treatment and overall survival.
The data were presented on 21 October 2018, at the Presidential Symposium of the ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) 2018 Congress in Munich, Germany and published simultaneously online in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Financial considerations
Under the oncology collaboration with MSD and following this new approval for Lynparza, AstraZeneca will receive $30m as Ongoing Collaboration Revenue, anticipated to be booked by the Company during the second quarter of 2019.
About ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide, with a five-year survival rate of 19%.1 In 2018, there were nearly 300,000 new cases diagnosed and around 185,000 deaths.2 For newly-diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, the primary aim of treatment is to delay progression of the disease for as long as possible and maintain the patient’s quality of life with the intent of achieving complete remission or cure.3,4,5,6
About BRCA mutations
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role in maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.
About Lynparza
Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.
Lynparza is currently approved in over 60 countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA status. It is approved in the US, Canada, Brazil and now the EU as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in nearly 40 countries for germline BRCAm HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy. Regulatory reviews are underway in other jurisdictions for both ovarian cancer and breast cancer.
Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
About the AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

 The test is designed to determine glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level in blood in three minutes, allowing clinicians to diagnose patients and formulating individualized care plans during patient consultation and has received FDA clearance for use on the Afinion AS100 Analyzer in May’18
 The Afinion 2 Analyzer is a platform, simplifying the delivery of actionable, accurate measurements of HbA1c and ACR (albumin-to-creatinine ratio) results at the point of care, offering clinicians to make fast & accurate medical decisions","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., June 17, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced that its Afinion™ HbA1c Dx assay is now available for use on the Afinion 2 Analyzer, as well as the Afinion AS100 Analyzer. The Afinion HbA1c Dx assay is the first and only rapid point-of-care test cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to aid healthcare professionals in the diagnosis of diabetes and the assessment of patients’ risk of developing the condition.
The Afinion HbA1c Dx meets FDA’s stringent requirements for performance testing for diagnostic use claims. The test delivers accurate and precise1,2 glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) results in only three minutes, enabling clinicians to diagnose patients and help them formulate individualized care plans during a single doctor’s office visit. The Afinion HbA1c Dx assay (approved for monitoring and diagnosis) complements the Afinion HbA1c assay (approved for monitoring only), the number one point-of-care HbA1c test in the U.S. for monitoring long-term glycemic control in diabetes.3
“As diagnostics continue to move to point-of-care settings such as physician office labs, the Afinion HbA1c Dx rapid assay shows how Abbott is once again setting new standards for innovation in the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes,” said Elizabeth Balthrop, divisional vice president, Cardiometabolic and Informatics, Rapid Diagnostics, Abbott. “In addition to giving physicians the certainty of diagnosis they need to make informed decisions during a patient visit, the HbA1c Dx assay gives people living with diabetes near real-time results, so that in consultation with their doctor they can make adjustments to their lifestyle and better manage their condition.”
“Rapid, reliable diabetes screening at the point of care enables healthcare providers to immediately link patients to comprehensive care that can help prevent the serious consequences of the disease,” said Richard Kahn, Ph.D., former chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association. “In addition, point-of-care diagnosis can enhance clinical efficiencies for busy practices and, at a population level, help stem the massive economic and societal impacts of diabetes in the U.S.”
ABOUT DIABETES
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition that occurs when the body cannot produce insulin or use it efficiently, causing sugar (glucose) to build up in the bloodstream. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 7.2 million people in the United States have diabetes but are as yet unaware of this diagnosis. Another 84.1 million have prediabetes.4 Diabetes can cause serious consequences, including problems with blood vessels, heart, nerves, kidneys, mouth, eyes and feet.5
ABOUT THE AFINION HbA1c Dx ASSAY 
The Afinion HbA1c Dx assay is FDA-cleared as a moderate complexity test for quantitative determination of HbA1c in human whole blood, used to aid in the diagnosis of diabetes and assessment of patients’ risk of developing the disease. It is also cleared for use in monitoring long-term glycemic control. The assay received FDA clearance for use on the Afinion AS100 Analyzer in May 2018.
ABOUT THE AFINION 2 ANALYZER 
The Afinion 2 Analyzer is a state-of-the-art multi-assay platform that streamlines and simplifies the delivery of actionable, accurate measurements of HbA1c and ACR (albumin-to-creatinine ratio) results at the point of care. The system arms healthcare professionals with the information needed to make fast and accurate medical decisions. The Afinion 2 platform, which offers all-in-one connectivity to LIS/HIS (laboratory and hospital information systems) and a sleeker, quieter experience for clinicians and patients, was launched in May 2018 for patient management of diabetes through whole blood HbA1c testing and ACR testing in urine.

16030,ï»¿Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) Receives FDA's Accelerated Approval as a Monotherapy for Metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer,FDA Approves Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) as Monotherapy for Patients with Metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) with Disease Progression on or After Platinum-Based Chemotherapy and at Least One Other Prior Line of Therapy,"The approval is based on KEYNOTE-158 & KEYNOTE-028 studies result assessing Keytruda (200mg, IV) in patients with SCLC with disease progression on/after platinum-based CT, prior treated with 1L+ therapy
 Collective results: ORR (19%); CRR (2%); PRR (17%); DOR @6mos. (94%); DOR @12mos. (63%); DOR @18mos. (56%)
 Keytruda is an anti-PD-1 therapy, blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 thereby activating T lymphocytes, affecting both tumor & healthy cells, being evaluated in 1000+ studies for multiple cancer","KENILWORTH, N.J.Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy. This accelerated approval is based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. This marks the first indication for KEYTRUDA in SCLC.
“KEYTRUDA is already an established treatment option for non-small cell lung cancer, and today’s approval in small cell lung cancer demonstrates our commitment to bringing forward new treatment options for patients with advanced, difficult-to-treat cancers,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to continuing to advance important clinical research in small cell lung cancer.”
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered, if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.
“Small cell lung cancer, which accounts for 10 to 15% of all lung cancers, is often diagnosed at an advanced stage where the prognosis is very poor and there have historically been limited treatment options,” said Dr. Patrick Ott, MD, PhD, clinical director, Center for Immuno-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “The approval of KEYTRUDA in small cell lung cancer provides an additional treatment option for patients based on the clinical response rates from KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-028.”
About KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-028
The approval was based on pooled data from KEYNOTE-158 (cohort G) and KEYNOTE-028 (cohort C1), two multicenter, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label trials evaluating KEYTRUDA in patients with SCLC who had disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy. The trials excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Among the 83 patients enrolled in the trials and who were evaluated for efficacy, 64% received two prior lines of therapy and 36% received three or more lines of therapy; 60% received prior thoracic radiation therapy; 51% received prior radiation therapy to the brain.
Patients evaluated for efficacy received either KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks (n=64) or 10 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks (n=19). Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 24 months. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of KEYTRUDA during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention or occurred with a decline in performance status. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by BICR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ.
KEYTRUDA demonstrated an ORR of 19% (95% CI, 11-29), with a complete response rate of 2% and a partial response rate of 17%. Among the 16 responding patients, 94% had a DOR of six months or longer, 63% had a DOR of 12 months or longer and 56% had a DOR of 18 months or longer. Responses ranged from 4.1 to 35.8+ months.
Among the patients with SCLC enrolled in KEYNOTE-158 (cohort G) (n=107) and KEYNOTE-028 (cohort C1) (n=24) who were included in the safety analysis, the adverse reactions that occurred were similar to those occurring in patients with other solid tumors who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent.
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefiting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grade 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination with Axitinib)
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Hepatotoxicity in Combination with Axitinib
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%), receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) and Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) today announced positive topline data from a Phase IIIb clinical trial evaluating LINZESS (linaclotide) 290 mcg on multiple abdominal symptoms in adult patients with IBS-C. The trial met its primary multi-component endpoint and demonstrated that linaclotide improved the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort in adult IBS-C patients compared to placebo. The trial also met both secondary endpoints. This trial was designed to highlight the impact of LINZESS on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort, which are part of patients’ reported real-world experience, thereby enabling better communication about these symptoms.
LINZESS is marketed by Ironwood and Allergan in the United States and is indicated for the treatment of adults with IBS-C or chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Research has shown that approximately 95 percent of adults with IBS-C experience bothersome abdominal bloating, pain, and/or discomfort, with the majority experiencing these symptoms once a week or more. There are an estimated 13 million adults in the U.S. with IBS-C.1,2
“While research clearly suggests that the symptoms of abdominal bloating, pain, and discomfort have a considerable impact on adults suffering from IBS-C, in the clinical setting patients often use the word ‘constipation’ as a general term to represent their abdominal and bowel symptoms. This can lead to a less precise communication regarding their symptoms between patient and physician and can impact management,” said Lin Chang, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the Vatche and Tamar Manoukian Division of Digestive Diseases at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). “I believe the data from this LINZESS Phase IIIb trial will be very important in helping patients and physicians have a more comprehensive dialogue about the multiple symptoms associated with IBS-C.”
Topline data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIIb trial showed that linaclotide 290 mcg administered orally once daily demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall abdominal symptoms compared to placebo across the primary and both secondary endpoints. In the multi-component primary endpoint, linaclotide-treated patients showed a 29.7% mean decrease from baseline in their weekly abdominal score (bloating, pain and discomfort) through the 12-week treatment period, compared to 18.3% for the placebo-treated patients (p<0.0001). In the secondary endpoints, 40.5% of patients treated with linaclotide 290 mcg demonstrated a clinically meaningful response, as defined by the abdominal symptom score responder, compared to 23.4% of placebo-treated patients (p<0.0001). An abdominal symptom score responder was defined as a patient who experienced an improvement of at least two-points from baseline in their weekly abdominal score for at least six of 12 weeks of treatment period. These findings add to the significant body of data supporting the impact of linaclotide on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort in adult IBS-C patients.
Linaclotide was well-tolerated in this Phase IIIb study, with the most commonly reported adverse event being diarrhea. During the treatment period, diarrhea was reported in 4.6% of patients on linaclotide 290 mcg as compared to 1.6% of patients on placebo. Study discontinuation resulting from diarrhea occurred in 1.6% of linaclotide 290 mcg patients compared to none of the placebo-treated patients.
“These topline results demonstrated that LINZESS can help provide overall relief of some of the multiple abdominal symptoms that IBS-C patients identify as among the most bothersome,” said Mike Shetzline, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer, senior vice president and head of drug development at Ironwood. “As the 10th Phase III trial of linaclotide to meet its primary endpoint, this study further contributes to the robust body of evidence supporting the use of LINZESS in adults with IBS-C and further strengthens its clinical profile.”
“IBS-C is a frustrating and uncomfortable condition, but it can be treated. We expect that communicating the full clinical profile of LINZESS on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain, and discomfort will broaden physicians’ understanding of the appropriate patient and may help those who need to find relief,” said David Nicholson, chief research & development officer at Allergan.
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LINZESS 290 mcg on multiple abdominal symptoms in adult patients with IBS-C. 614 patients were randomized to placebo or LINZESS 290 mcg once daily for 12 weeks, followed by a four-week randomized withdrawal period. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in abdominal score based on daily patient assessments of abdominal bloating, pain and discomfort at their worst, as reported on an 11-point numerical rating scale. Additional endpoints included change from baseline in spontaneous bowel movement frequency, complete spontaneous bowel movement frequency, stool consistency, and straining.
Additional data from this Phase IIIb trial are expected to be shared at upcoming scientific meetings and via peer-reviewed publications.
About Linaclotide
Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist that is thought to work in two ways based on nonclinical studies. Linaclotide binds to the GC-C receptor locally, within the intestinal epithelium. Activation of GC-C results in increased intestinal fluid secretion and accelerated transit and a decrease in the activity of pain-sensing nerves in the intestine. The clinical relevance of the effect on pain fibers, which is based on nonclinical studies, has not been established. Linaclotide is marketed by Ironwood and Allergan plc in the United States as LINZESS® and is indicated for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) or chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Linaclotide is marketed by Allergan for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe IBS-C in Europe under the brand name CONSTELLA®. Ironwood is partnered with AstraZeneca for development and commercialization of linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau. Astellas has the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. Allergan has rights to develop and market in the remaining rest of world countries.
Important Safety Information
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
LINZESS (linaclotide) is indicated in adults for the treatment of both irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC).

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS DEHYDRATION IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS

LINZESS is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age. In nonclinical studies in neonatal mice, administration of a single, clinically relevant adult oral dose of linaclotide caused deaths due to dehydration. Use of LINZESS should be avoided in patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS have not been established in patients less than 18 years of age.

Contraindications

LINZESS is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to the risk of serious dehydration.
LINZESS is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction.
Warnings and Precautions
Pediatric Risk

LINZESS is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. In neonatal mice, linaclotide increased fluid secretion as a consequence of GC-C agonism resulting in mortality within the first 24 hours due to dehydration. Due to increased intestinal expression of GC-C, patients less than 6 years of age may be more likely than patients 6 years of age and older to develop severe diarrhea and its potentially serious consequences.
Use of LINZESS should be avoided in pediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age. Although there were no deaths in older juvenile mice, given the deaths in young juvenile mice and the lack of clinical safety and efficacy data in pediatric patients, use of LINZESS should be avoided in pediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age.
Diarrhea

Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction in LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled IBS-C and CIC double-blind placebo-controlled trials. The incidence of diarrhea was similar in the IBS-C and CIC populations. Severe diarrhea was reported in 2% of 145 mcg and 290 mcg LINZESS-treated patients, and in <1% of 72 mcg LINZESS-treated CIC patients. If severe diarrhea occurs, dosing should be suspended and the patient rehydrated.
Common Adverse Reactions (incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo)

In IBS-C clinical trials: diarrhea (20% vs 3% placebo), abdominal pain (7% vs 5%), flatulence (4% vs 2%), headache (4% vs 3%), viral gastroenteritis (3% vs 1%) and abdominal distension (2% vs 1%).
In CIC trials of a 145 mcg dose: diarrhea (16% vs 5% placebo), abdominal pain (7% vs 6%), flatulence (6% vs 5%), upper respiratory tract infection (5% vs 4%), sinusitis (3% vs 2%) and abdominal distension (3% vs 2%). In a CIC trial of a 72 mcg dose: diarrhea (19% vs 7% placebo) and abdominal distension (2% vs <1%).

16062,ï»¿AstraZeneca's Breztri Aerosphere (PT010) and Bevespi Aerosphere Receive MHLW's Approval for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Japan,Breztri Aerosphere (PT010) approved in Japan for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"The approval of Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/ formoterol fumarate) is based on P-III KRONOS study results assessing PT010 vs Bevespi Aerosphere & PT009 in patients with COPD, resulted in improvement in trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
 The approval of Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) is based on P-III PINNACLE 4 study results assessing Bevespi Aerosphere in 1,756 patients with moderate to severe COPD and is an approved therapy in the multiple countries including the US & EU
 Breztri Aerosphere & Bevespi Aerosphere are triple & dual bronchodilator combination therapies, available as a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) utilizing Aerosphere delivery technology respectively. PT009 is expecting its NMPA’s approval in H2’19 with anticipated EU & the US regulatory approval in 2020","First global approval and only triple-combination therapy in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler device in Japan
AstraZeneca today announced that Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/ formoterol fumarate), formerly PT010, has been approved in Japan as a triple-combination therapy to relieve symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
This is the first global regulatory approval for Breztri Aerosphere and is the first approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for a triple-combination therapy in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI), which uses the innovative Aerosphere delivery technology.
The approval was based on positive results from the Phase III KRONOS trial in which Breztri Aerosphere demonstrated a statistically-significant improvement in trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), the primary endpoint for Japan, compared with the dual comparators Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate).
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects more than five million people in Japan, and Breztri Aerosphere offers these patients a new, powerful triple-combination therapy in a pressurised metered-dose inhaler. This first approval of Breztri Aerosphere is a significant step towards providing a new treatment choice to people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease globally.”
Klaus Rabe, Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at the University of Kiel, Director of the Department of Pneumology at Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, and National Co-ordinating Investigator of the KRONOS trial, said: “The KRONOS trial demonstrated that Breztri Aerosphere provides rapid and sustained, clinically-relevant lung function improvements in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Triple-combination therapy is an increasingly important treatment option and will play a central role in helping patients manage their disease.”
Data from the Phase III KRONOS trial has previously been published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.
The Chinese National Medical Products Administration has granted a priority review to Breztri Aerosphere, with an expected regulatory decision in the second half of 2019. The medicine is also under regulatory review in the US and EU with anticipated regulatory decisions in 2020.
About Breztri Aerosphere
Breztri Aerosphere (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate), formerly known as PT010, is a single-inhaler, fixed-dose triple combination of budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, glycopyrronium, a long-acting muscarinic agonist, and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Under the terms of the agreement to acquire Pearl Therapeutics Inc., AstraZeneca anticipates making a $150m milestone payment upon US regulatory approval of Breztri for COPD. This payment would be the final development and regulatory milestone under that agreement.
About KRONOS and the ATHENA clinical trial programme
KRONOS is a Phase III randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, 24-week, chronic-dosing, multi-centre trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of Breztri Aerosphere. The trial compared Breztri Aerosphere with Bevespi Aerosphere(glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate 14.4/9.6mcg pMDI), Symbicort Turbuhaler (budesonide/formoterol fumarate 400/12mcg) and PT009 (budesonide/formoterol fumarate 320/9.6mcg) using Aerosphere delivery technology in a pMDI. Patients were given two inhalations twice a day of Breztri Aerosphere, Bevespi Aerosphere, Symbicort Turbuhaler or PT009. KRONOS involved approximately 1,900 patients with moderate to very severe COPD.
In the trial, Breztri Aerosphere met six of seven primary endpoints versus dual comparators and PT009 met two non-inferiority endpoints to support the qualification of PT009 as an active comparator. As published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, in a key secondary endpoint, Breztri Aerosphere showed a statistically-significant 52% reduction in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared with Bevespi Aerosphere in a patient population that was not required to have had an exacerbation in the previous 12 months. Breztri Aerosphere also demonstrated reductions in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations versus PT009 and Symbicort (18% and 17% respectively), which were numerically but not statistically significant improvements. The incidence of adjudicated pneumonia was low and comparable in all treatment arms.1 The primary and secondary endpoints and treatment comparisons in the KRONOS trial differed according to regional regulatory requirements.1
The Phase III ATHENA clinical trial programme for Breztri Aerosphere includes more than 15,500 patients globally across 11 trials.1,2,3,4 The four key trials are KRONOS, TELOS, SOPHOS and ETHOS.1,2,3,4 The Phase III ETHOS trial is the last trial in the programme and data readout is anticipated in the second half of 2019.
About COPD
COPD is a progressive disease which can cause obstruction of airflow in the lungs resulting in debilitating bouts of breathlessness.5 It affects an estimated 384 million people worldwide and is predicted to be the third leading cause of death by 2020.5,6 Improving lung function, reducing exacerbations and managing daily symptoms such as breathlessness are important treatment goals in the management of COPD.5

16091,Roche's Hemlibra (emicizumab injection) Receives Health Canada Approval for Patients with Hemophilia A Without Factor VIII Inhibitors ï»¿,Health Canada Approves Hemlibra for Hemophilia A Patients Without Factor VIII Inhibitors,"The approval is based on HAVEN 3 & 4 studies. The P-III HAVEN 3 study results assessing Hemlibra (qw/q2w) vs episodic FVIII & no prophylaxis in 152 patients with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors prior treated with episodic/prophylactic treatment with FVIII, resulted in reduction in treated bleeds (96%/97%); zero treated bleeds (55.6% / 60% vs 0%); zero treated target joint bleed (69.4%/ 77.1% vs 27.8%)
 The HAVEN IV study results involves assessing of Hemlibra in 41 patients with hemophilia A with/out FVIII inhibitors, prior treated with episodic/prophylactic treatment with FVIII or bypassing agents/FVIII, resulted in 52.8%, 27.8%, 83.3%, 69.4% & 83.3% experiencing zero bleeds including all treated bleed, all bleed, treated spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds & treated joint bleeds respectively
 Hemlibra (SC) is mAb targeting IgG4, being co-developed by Chugai & Roche and has received approval in the US, EU for hemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors","Hemlibra is the only treatment that can be self-injected subcutaneously once weekly for patients with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors1

MISSISSAUGA, ON, June 18, 2019 /CNW/ – Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) announced today that Health Canada has approved Hemlibra® (emicizumab injection) for hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) patients without factor VIII inhibitors as routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.2 Limited data exists for patients suffering from mild and moderate hemophilia A. (Please see Hemlibra product monograph for full prescribing information). The announcement follows last year’s approval of Hemlibra for hemophilia A patients with factor VIII inhibitors.
The efficacy and safety of Hemlibra has been demonstrated by one of the largest clinical trial programmes ever conducted in hemophilia A patients, with and without factor VIII inhibitors, in four pivotal HAVEN studies (HAVEN 1, HAVEN 2, HAVEN 3, HAVEN 4).3 Health Canada’s approval of Hemlibra for hemophilia A patients without inhibitors is primarily based on positive results from two clinical studies, HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4. HAVEN 3 demonstrated that Hemlibra substantially reduced bleeds in adults and adolescents compared to prior episodic (on demand) or prophylactic treatment with factor VIII.4,5 Health Canada also approved Hemlibra for use at multiple dosing options – once weekly, bi-weekly and, for adults and adolescents only, four-week dosing – for people with hemophilia A, including those with and without factor VIII inhibitors based on evidence from HAVEN 3 and 4.6
“Hemlibra represents an exciting new option for all patients with Hemophilia A,” said Dr. Jayson Stoffman, Medical Director, Manitoba Bleeding Disorders Program. “I look forward to the opportunity to offer my patients something that could have an important impact on their quality of life and hemophilia management.”
Hemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder affecting approximately 3,000 Canadians,7 predominantly male, causing significantly lower than normal levels of the protein factor VIII in the blood, in turn lowering the ability of the blood to clot.8 Approximately 95 per cent of hemophilia A patients do not have factor VIII inhibitors.9
“It is great news that Hemlibra has now received an indication for people with hemophilia A without inhibitors,” said Paul Wilton, President of the Canadian Hemophilia Society. “Based on the research we have seen, we are convinced that a number of Canadians may benefit from this new treatment option.”
About the Health Canada Approval
HAVEN 3 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase III clinical study in 152 adolescent and adult males over the age of 12 with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors who had previously received either episodic (on-demand) or prophylactic treatment with factor VIII. In the study, patients received subcutaneous Hemlibra, 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first four weeks, followed by either 1.5 mg/kg once weekly (Arms A and D) or 3 mg/kg every two weeks (Arm B) after that, or no prophylaxis (Arm C).10
HAVEN 3 met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. Data from the study showed:11

Hemlibra prophylaxis once weekly or every two weeks resulted in a 96% (95% CI: 92.5; 98.0, p<0.0001) and 97% (95% CI: 93.4; 98.3, p<0.0001) reduction in treated bleeds, respectively, compared to episodic factor VIII.
55.6% (95% CI: 38.1; 72.1) of people treated with Hemlibra once weekly and 60% (95% CI: 42.1; 76.1) of people treated with Hemlibra every two weeks experienced zero treated bleeds, compared to 0% (95% CI: 0.0; 18.5) of people treated with episodic factor VIII.
Patients treated with Hemlibra experienced less treated target joint bleeds, compared to the no prophylaxis arm. The ABR (95% CI) was 0.6 (0.3; 1.4), 0.7 (0.3; 1.6) and 13.0 (5.2; 32.3) for Arm A (Hemlibra 1.5 mg/kg QW), Arm B (Hemlibra 3 mg/kg Q2W) and Arm C (no prophylaxis), respectively.
Patients with zero treated target joint bleeds (95% CI) comprised 69.4% (51.9; 83.7), 77.1% (59.9; 89.6) and 27.8% (9.7; 53.5) of the patients in Arm A (Hemlibra 1.5 mg/kg QW), Arm B (Hemlibra 3 mg/kg Q2W) and Arm C (no prophylaxis), respectively.
Hemlibra prophylaxis once weekly or every two weeks resulted in a 95% (95% CI: 90.1; 97.0, p<0.0001) and 94% (95% CI: 89.7; 97.0, p<0.0001) reduction in all bleeds, respectively, compared to episodic factor VIII.
In HAVEN 3, the Hemlibra regimen demonstrated a statistically significant (p<0.0001) reduction in treated bleeds compared with previous FVIII prophylaxis collected in the non-interventional study before enrollment.
The mean (NBR model) ABR for patients on Hemlibra and FVIII prophylaxis were 1.5 (95% CI: 1, 2.3) and 4.8 (95% CI: 3.2, 7.1), respectively.
The median (IQR) ABR for patients on Hemlibra and FVIII prophylaxis were 0 (95% CI: 0, 2.1) and 1.8 (95% CI: 0, 7.6), respectively.
The percentage of patients with zero bleeds on Hemlibra and FVIII prophylaxis were 54.2 (95% CI: 39.2; 68.6) and 39.6 (95% CI: 25.8; 54.7), respectively.
HAVEN 4 was a single arm, multicenter clinical study in 41 adult and adolescent males (aged ≥ 12 years and ≥ 40 kg) with hemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic (“on demand”) or prophylactic treatment with FVIII or bypassing agents or FVIII.12
HAVEN 4 is the first study to have demonstrated that Hemlibra effectively reduces bleeds based on a four-week dosing schedule, in both adult and adolescent patients with or without factor VIII inhibitors.

In HAVEN 4, after a median observation time of 25.6 weeks, efficacy results in patients without factor VIII inhibitors were as follows:13
 52.8% (95% CI: 35.5; 69.6) experienced zero bleeds overall, which includes all treated bleeds.
27.8% (95% CI: 14.2; 45.2) experienced zero bleeds overall, which consists of all bleeds
83.3% (95% CI: 67.2; 93.6) experienced zero treated spontaneous bleeds
69.4% (95% CI: 51.9; 83.7) experienced zero treated joint bleeds
83.3% (95% CI: 67.2; 93.6) experienced zero treated target joint bleeds. 

The efficacy of Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors was evaluated at a median observation time of 26.1 weeks in a subgroup of 5 hemophilia A patients with FVIII inhibitors based on the bleed rate for bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation factors.
Hemlibra prophylaxis resulted in an ABR (95% CI) for treated bleeds of 1.2 (0.1, 14.8) based on negative binomial regression.
On Hemlibra prophylaxis with 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks, 4 patients with FVIII inhibitors had zero treated bleeds.
Athough limited by small patient numbers, the efficacy of the 6 mg/kg every 4-week maintenance dose is consistent with the results observed for this dosing regimen in hemophilia A patients without inhibitors.
The most common adverse reactions reported in more than or equal to 1% of patients from pooled clinical trials with Hemlibra were injection site reactions, arthralgia, headache, pyrexia, diarrhea and myalgia. 14
About Hemophilia A
Hemophilia A is an inherited, serious disorder in which a person’s blood does not clot properly, leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding. Hemophilia A affects around 3,000 Canadians,15, predominantly male, approximately 40 per cent of whom have a severe form of the disorder.16 Approximately 95 per cent of hemophilia A patients do not have inhibitors to factor VIII.17
People with hemophilia A either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. Depending on the severity of their disorder, people with hemophilia A can bleed frequently, especially into their joints or muscles.18 These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility, and long-term joint damage.19 A serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor VIII replacement therapies.20 Inhibitors are antibodies developed by the body’s immune system that bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor VIII,21 making it difficult, if not impossible to obtain a level of factor VIII sufficient to control bleeding.
About Hemlibra® (emicizumab injection)
Hemlibra is an engineered humanized monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody that bridges activated factor IX and factor X to restore the natural function of missing activated factor VIII that is needed for effective blood clotting. It has no structural relationship to FVIII and, as such, does not induce or enhance the development of direct inhibitors to FVIII.22,23
Hemlibra is a prophylactic (preventative) treatment that can be administered by an injection of a ready-to-use solution under the skin (subcutaneously) once weekly, every two weeks or every four weeks (for adults and adolescents).24
Hemlibra was created by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is being co-developed by Chugai, Roche and Genentech. It is currently approved in the United States, the European Union and other countries for people with hemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors.
Hemlibra received Health Canada approval in August 2018 for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors.

Collaboration Will Apply IPD’s de novo Protein Design Expertise to Biotech Drug Discovery
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. and SEATTLE, June 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and the University of Washington’s Institute for Protein Design (IPD), which is revolutionizing its field of science by creating custom-designed proteins from scratch to improve human health, today announced a broad collaboration that will cover multiple projects with a goal of testing new technologies and creating protein-building approaches that can be broadly applied to the search for new medicines.
Under the terms of the agreement, Amgen has provided initial funding for three sponsored research projects that will seek to apply IPD’s de novo design technique to increase the versatility of traditional protein-based medicines. This will include optimizing Amgen’s repertoire of BiTE® (bispecific T cell engager) antibodies, with the goal of expanding the types of tumors that can be targeted with these molecules. IPD’s expertise could also help Amgen to generate antibodies against very challenging drug targets and to devise new ways to modulate the activity of the immune system. In the longer-term, the broad-based collaboration could help shape the discovery and development of protein-based therapies.
“We’re at a technology transition point from modifying what exists in nature, which has been the traditional approach to protein engineering, to using first principles to build proteins from scratch to have exactly the properties you want,” said David Baker, the Henrietta and Aubrey Davis Endowed Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and the founder and director of IPD. “We can now design proteins that have specific functions, and that is where our work starts tying into medicine, and why we are very excited to be working with Amgen.”
“We want to work with IPD in an open-ended way to try to solve some of the most intractable problems that we face in designing effective medicines,” said Raymond Deshaies, Ph.D., senior vice president of Global Research at Amgen. “This is a broad collaboration that will cover multiple projects, and we are hoping to build strong working relationships among scientists on both sides. The goal isn’t just to solve a few specific problems but to create approaches that can be applied very generally across a large suite of problems.”

16134,Alexa to Detect Cardiac Arrest with AI-Enabled Tool for Smart Speakers and Smartphones,"‘Alexa, monitor my heart’: Researchers develop first contactless cardiac arrest AI system for smart speakers","Amazon’s Alexa will have the future capabilities to predict the onset of heart attacks & calling for help while sleeping by detecting the gasping sound of agonal breathing
 AI capabilities are tested in a study capturing real agonal breathing from 911 calls, results demonstrated that it detected 97% agonal breathing events from up to 20 feet away from a speaker generating the sounds. The research is funded by the National Science Foundation
 The researcher plans to commercialize the technology via Sound Life Sciences, a spin-out of the University of Washington. The team envisage that technology could function like an app, or a skill for Alexa that runs passively on a smart speaker or smartphone while people sleep","Almost 500,000 Americans die each year from cardiac arrest, when the heart suddenly stops beating.
People experiencing cardiac arrest will suddenly become unresponsive and either stop breathing or gasp for air, a sign known as agonal breathing. Immediate CPR can double or triple someone’s chance of survival, but that requires a bystander to be present.
Cardiac arrests often occur outside of the hospital and in the privacy of someone’s home. Recent research suggests that one of the most common locations for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is in a patient’s bedroom, where no one is likely around or awake to respond and provide care.
Researchers at the University of Washington have developed a new tool to monitor people for cardiac arrest while they’re asleep without touching them. A new skill for a smart speaker — like Google Home and Amazon Alexa — or smartphone lets the device detect the gasping sound of agonal breathing and call for help. On average, the proof-of-concept tool, which was developed using real agonal breathing instances captured from 911 calls, detected agonal breathing events 97% of the time from up to 20 feet (or 6 meters) away. The findings are published June 19 in the Nature journal npj Digital Medicine.
“A lot of people have smart speakers in their homes, and these devices have amazing capabilities that we can take advantage of,” said co-corresponding author Shyam Gollakota, an associate professor in the UW’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. “We envision a contactless system that works by continuously and passively monitoring the bedroom for an agonal breathing event, and alerts anyone nearby to come provide CPR. And then if there’s no response, the device can automatically call 911.”

Agonal breathing is present for about 50% of people who experience cardiac arrests, according to 911 call data, and patients who take agonal breaths often have a better chance of surviving.
“This kind of breathing happens when a patient experiences really low oxygen levels,” said co-corresponding author Dr. Jacob Sunshine, an assistant professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine at the UW School of Medicine. “It’s sort of a guttural gasping noise, and its uniqueness makes it a good audio biomarker to use to identify if someone is experiencing a cardiac arrest.”
The researchers gathered sounds of agonal breathing from real 911 calls to Seattle’s Emergency Medical Services. Because cardiac arrest patients are often unconscious, bystanders recorded the agonal breathing sounds by putting their phones up to the patient’s mouth so that the dispatcher could determine whether the patient needed immediate CPR. The team collected 162 calls between 2009 and 2017 and extracted 2.5 seconds of audio at the start of each agonal breath to come up with a total of 236 clips. The team captured the recordings on different smart devices — an Amazon Alexa, an iPhone 5s and a Samsung Galaxy S4 — and used various machine learning techniques to boost the dataset to 7,316 positive clips.
“We played these examples at different distances to simulate what it would sound like if it the patient was at different places in the bedroom,” said first author Justin Chan, a doctoral student in the Allen School. “We also added different interfering sounds such as sounds of cats and dogs, cars honking, air conditioning, things that you might normally hear in a home.”
For the negative dataset, the team used 83 hours of audio data collected during sleep studies, yielding 7,305 sound samples. These clips contained typical sounds that people make in their sleep, such as snoring or obstructive sleep apnea.
From these datasets, the team used machine learning to create a tool that could detect agonal breathing 97% of the time when the smart device was placed up to 6 meters away from a speaker generating the sounds.
Next the team tested the algorithm to make sure that it wouldn’t accidentally classify a different type of breathing, like snoring, as agonal breathing.
“We don’t want to alert either emergency services or loved ones unnecessarily, so it’s important that we reduce our false positive rate,” Chan said.
For the sleep lab data, the algorithm incorrectly categorized a breathing sound as agonal breathing 0.14% of the time. The false positive rate was about 0.22% for separate audio clips, in which volunteers had recorded themselves while sleeping in their own homes. But when the team had the tool classify something as agonal breathing only when it detected two distinct events at least 10 seconds apart, the false positive rate fell to 0% for both tests.
The team envisions this algorithm could function like an app, or a skill for Alexa that runs passively on a smart speaker or smartphone while people sleep.

See related stories in STAT and Bloomberg.
“This could run locally on the processors contained in the Alexa. It’s running in real time, so you don’t need to store anything or send anything to the cloud,” Gollakota said.
“Right now, this is a good proof of concept using the 911 calls in the Seattle metropolitan area,” he said. “But we need to get access to more 911 calls related to cardiac arrest so that we can improve the accuracy of the algorithm further and ensure that it generalizes across a larger population.”
The researchers plan to commercialize this technology through a UW spinout, Sound Life Sciences, Inc.
“Cardiac arrests are a very common way for people to die, and right now many of them can go unwitnessed,” Sunshine said. “Part of what makes this technology so compelling is that it could help us catch more patients in time for them to be treated.”
Dr. Thomas Rea, a professor of general internal medicine at the UW School of Medicine and the medical director of King County Medic One was also a co-author on this paper. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation.

 The Resolution HRD assay will allow Janssen to identify patients with prostate cancer who may benefit from Niraparib therapy. In 2016, Janssen got exclusive WW license from Tesaro for Niraparib in prostate cancer
 The Resolution’s liquid biopsy test detects HRD mutations & gene deletions, being evaluated in P-II & P-III studies of Niraparib in PC and has received FDA’s BT designation on May 30, 2019","LIQUID BIOPSY ASSAY WITH RECENT BREAKTHROUGH DEVICE DESIGNATION FROM FDA IS BEING USED TO SCREEN PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER FOR HRD MUTATIONS AND DELETIONS AS PART OF PHASE II AND III CLINICAL STUDIES
KIRKLAND, WA — June 19, 2019 — Resolution Bioscience, Inc., today announced that its Resolution HRD™ liquid biopsy assay is being developed as a companion diagnostic for niraparib, a PARP inhibitor that is currently being investigated for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) as part of a research collaboration with Janssen Research & Development, LLC (Janssen). The cell-free DNA (cfDNA) assay, which detects homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) mutations and gene deletions, is currently being used in phase II and III clinical studies of niraparib in prostate cancer.

Recently granted Breakthrough Device Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration, the Resolution HRD assay has the potential to benefit late-stage prostate cancer patients when tissue can be difficult to collect. The Resolution liquid biopsy test detects sequence variations in key genes related to HRD for single nucleotide variants, copy number variants, and deletions. The ability to detect these alterations from a simple blood draw has the potential to allow for more men to receive targeted therapies, such as niraparib.
“Resolution Bioscience is committed to partnering with leading pharmaceutical companies to develop diagnostic assays that may assist in bringing new therapies to market,” said Mark Li, CEO of Resolution Bioscience. “Built on our proprietary cfDNA next-generation sequencing technology platform, we expect the Resolution HRD assay will enable Janssen to identify patients with prostate cancer who may benefit from niraparib therapy.”
Resolution Bioscience plans to seek approval for the Resolution HRD assay as a companion diagnostic for niraparib in prostate cancer. If approved, the Resolution HRD assay could be the first test to detect gene deletions from cfDNA, as well as to differentiate between single copy and biallelic (homozygous) gene deletions through a simple blood draw. The assay is also designed to detect biallelic loss of function through the combination of a deleterious mutation and a heterozygous deletion in the same gene, as well as homozygous deletions.

 The two P-III studies demonstrated that Ultomiris is non-inferior to the Soliris (q2w) on all 11 endpoints. Additionally, Ultomiris resulted in immediate and complete C5 inhibition, sustained for 8wks. and eliminates breakthrough hemolysis related with incomplete C5 inhibition
 Ultomiris is a long-acting C5 inhibitor, approved in the US & Japan for PNH in adults with its expected sBLA approval in the US and plans to submit sBLA in the EU and Japan in H2’19 for the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)","– Physicians in Japan will soon be able to prescribe a treatment for PNH that requires fewer infusions, reducing the treatment burden for patients –

– ULTOMIRIS has the potential to become the new standard of care for both complement inhibitor-naïve patients and patients switching from SOLIRIS ® (eculizumab) –

“As a physician, I am pleased to have a new medication for patients in Japan facing the burden of living with PNH—both for people naive to anti-complement therapy and those that are already on SOLIRIS seeking to make a change without interruption”
BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced that Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved ULTOMIRIS® (ravulizumab), the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor administered every eight weeks, for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).
PNH is an ultra-rare and severe disease that, when left untreated, may cause a wide range of debilitating symptoms and complications, including thrombosis. Thrombosis occurs when a blood clot presents inside a blood vessel, and slows or blocks the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Serious cases of thrombosis can occur throughout the body and result in organ damage, stroke, heart attack, and potentially premature death.1–8
“As a physician, I am pleased to have a new medication for patients in Japan facing the burden of living with PNH—both for people naive to anti-complement therapy and those that are already on SOLIRIS seeking to make a change without interruption,” said Jun-ichi Nishimura, M.D., Ph.D. Assistant Professor, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. “When PNH is not treated, the consequences can be serious.”
PNH can strike men and women of all races, backgrounds and ages without warning, with an average age of onset in the early 30s.1,9 PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis ranging from one to more than five years.10
The Ministry’s approval is based on comprehensive results from two Phase 3 studies, which were published in Blood.11,12 In these studies, which included 441 patients who had either never been treated with a complement inhibitor before, or who had been stable on SOLIRIS, the efficacy of ULTOMIRIS administered every eight weeks was non-inferior to the efficacy of SOLIRIS administered every two weeks on all 11 endpoints. The safety profile of ULTOMIRIS was similar to that of SOLIRIS. Additional data showed that ULTOMIRIS provided immediate and complete C5 inhibition that was sustained for eight weeks13 and that ULTOMIRIS eliminated breakthrough hemolysis associated with incomplete C5 inhibition.14 The entire clinical development program for ULTOMIRIS to date represents more than 800 patient years of experience.
“Immediate and complete C5 inhibition with ULTOMIRIS can provide meaningful benefits for patients and their families,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research & Development at Alexion. “Based on the totality of our compelling data from the largest Phase 3 program ever conducted in PNH, we believe ULTOMIRIS has the potential to become the new standard of care for patients with PNH in Japan. We would like to express our deep gratitude to the patients and investigators in Japan who supported this study with their participation.”
About Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a chronic, progressive, debilitating and life-threatening ultra-rare blood disorder characterized by hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) that is mediated by an uncontrolled activation of the complement system, a component of the body’s immune system.1,2,15 PNH can strike men and women of all races, backgrounds and ages without warning, with an average age of onset in the early 30s.1,9 PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis ranging from one to more than five years.10 Patients with PNH may experience a wide range of signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, erectile dysfunction, dark-colored urine and anemia.3–5,7,8,11,15 The most devastating consequence of chronic hemolysis is thrombosis, which can occur in blood vessels throughout the body, damage vital organs and cause premature death.16 The first thrombotic event can be fatal.1,9,17 Despite historical supportive care, including transfusion and anticoagulation management, 20 to 35 percent of patients with PNH die within five to 10 years of diagnosis.18,19 Patients with certain types of hemolytic anemia, bone marrow disorders and unexplained venous or arterial thrombosis are at increased risk of PNH.15,20–24
About ULTOMIRIS ® 
ULTOMIRIS (ravulizumab), the first and only long-acting C5 inhibitor administered every eight weeks, is approved in the U.S. and Japan as a treatment for adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). ULTOMIRIS works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. The terminal complement cascade, when activated in an uncontrolled manner, plays a role in severe ultra-rare disorders like PNH, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive myasthenia gravis (MG) and anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) auto-antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). In Phase 3 clinical studies in complement inhibitor-naïve patients with PNH11 and patients with PNH who had been stable on SOLIRIS® (eculizumab),12 intravenous treatment with ULTOMIRIS every eight weeks demonstrated non-inferiority to intravenous treatment with SOLIRIS every two weeks on all 11 endpoints.
The Phase 3 study of ULTOMIRIS, administered intravenously every eight weeks in adult patients with aHUS, met its primary objective. Alexion has submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of ULTOMIRIS as a treatment for patients with aHUS and plans to submit similar applications in the EU and Japan later in 2019. ULTOMIRIS is also currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical study in children and adolescents with aHUS, administered intravenously every eight weeks. Alexion has initiated a Phase 3 study of ULTOMIRIS, intravenously administered every eight weeks, as a potential treatment for patients with generalized MG (gMG), and is planning to initiate a Phase 3 in patients with NMOSD. In addition, Alexion has initiated Phase 3 studies of ULTOMIRIS delivered subcutaneously once per week as a potential treatment for patients with PNH, aHUS and gMG.
ULTOMIRIS has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for the treatment of patients with PNH in the U.S. and Japan and for the subcutaneous treatment of patients with aHUS in the U.S.
U.S. Indication of ULTOMIRIS ® (ravulizumab-cwvz)
ULTOMIRIS is a prescription medicine called a monoclonal antibody. ULTOMIRIS is used to treat adults with a disease called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). It is not known if ULTOMIRIS is safe and effective in children.
U.S. Important Safety Information for ULTOMIRIS ® (ravulizumab-cwvz)
ULTOMIRIS is a medicine that affects the immune system. ULTOMIRIS can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. ULTOMIRIS increases the chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early.
Meningococcal vaccines must be received at least 2 weeks before the first dose of ULTOMIRIS if one has not already had this vaccine. If one’s doctor decided that urgent treatment with ULTOMIRIS is needed, meningococcal vaccination should be administered as soon as possible. If one has not been vaccinated and ULTOMIRIS therapy must be initiated immediately, 2 weeks of antibiotics should also be administered with the vaccinations. If one had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, additional vaccination might be needed before starting ULTOMIRIS. Call one’s doctor or get emergency medical care right away if any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection occur: headache with nausea or vomiting, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, fever and a rash, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, headache and fever, fever, confusion, and eyes sensitive to light.
ULTOMIRIS is only available through a program called the ULTOMIRIS REMS.
ULTOMIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. People who take ULTOMIRIS may have an increased risk of getting infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Certain people may also have an increased risk of gonorrhea infection. To find out if one is at risk for gonorrhea infection, about gonorrhea prevention, and regular testing, talk to the healthcare provider. Call the healthcare provider right away if one has any new signs or symptoms of infection.
Before one receives ULTOMIRIS, tell the doctor about all of the medical conditions, including if one: has an infection or fever, is pregnant or plans to become pregnant, and is breastfeeding or plans to breastfeed. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS will harm an unborn baby. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS passes into the breast milk. One should not breast feed during treatment and for 8 months after one’s final dose of ULTOMIRIS.
Tell the doctor about all the medicines one takes, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. ULTOMIRIS and other medicines can affect each other causing side effects. Know the medications one takes and the vaccines one receives. Keep a list of them to show the doctor and pharmacist when one gets a new medicine.
If one stops receiving ULTOMIRIS, the doctor will need to monitor closely for at least 16 weeks after one stops ULTOMIRIS. Stopping ULTOMIRIS may cause breakdown of the red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: drop in the number of the red blood cell count, tiredness, blood in the urine, stomach-area (abdomen) pain, blood clots, shortness of breath, trouble swallowing, and erectile dysfunction (ED) in males.
ULTOMIRIS can cause serious side effects including infusion reactions. Infusion reactions may happen during one’s ULTOMIRIS infusion. Symptoms of an infusion reaction with ULTOMIRIS may include lower back pain, pain with the infusion, or feeling faint. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if these symptoms develop, or any other symptoms during the ULTOMIRIS infusion that may mean one is having a serious infusion reaction, including: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, and feel faint or pass out. One’s doctor will treat the symptoms as needed. The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS are upper respiratory infection and headache.

U.S. Important Safety Information for SOLIRIS ® (eculizumab)
SOLIRIS is a medicine that affects the immune system. SOLIRIS can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. SOLIRIS increases the chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections. Meningococcal infections may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early.
Meningococcal vaccines must be received at least 2 weeks before the first dose of SOLIRIS if one has not already had this vaccine. If one’s doctor decided that urgent treatment with SOLIRIS is needed, meningococcal vaccination should be administered as soon as possible. If one has not been vaccinated and SOLIRIS therapy must be initiated immediately, 2 weeks of antibiotics should also be administered with the vaccinations. If one had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, additional vaccination might be needed before starting SOLIRIS. Call one’s doctor or get emergency medical care right away if any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection occur: headache with nausea or vomiting, headache and fever, headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, fever, fever and a rash, confusion, muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, and eyes sensitive to light.
SOLIRIS is only available through a program called the SOLIRIS REMS.
SOLIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections. If one’s child is treated with SOLIRIS, make sure that the child receives vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Certain people may be at risk of serious infections with gonorrhea. Talk to the doctor about whether one is at risk for gonorrhea infection, about gonorrhea prevention, and regular testing. Certain fungal infections (Aspergillus) may also happen if one takes SOLIRIS and has a weak immune system or a low white blood cell count.
Before one receives SOLIRIS, tell the doctor about all of the medical conditions, including if one: has an infection or fever, is pregnant or plans to become pregnant, and is breastfeeding or plans to breastfeed. It is not known if SOLIRIS will harm an unborn baby. It is not known if SOLIRIS passes into the breast milk.
Tell the doctor about all the medicines one takes, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. SOLIRIS and other medicines can affect each other causing side effects.
It is important that one: has all recommended vaccinations before starting SOLIRIS, receives 2 weeks of antibiotics if one immediately starts SOLIRIS, and stays up-to-date with all recommended vaccinations during treatment with SOLIRIS. Know the medications one takes and the vaccines one receives. Keep a list of them to show the doctor and pharmacist when one gets a new medicine.
If one has PNH, the doctor will need to monitor closely for at least 8 weeks after stopping SOLIRIS. Stopping treatment with SOLIRIS may cause breakdown of the red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: drop in the number of the red blood cell count, drop in the platelet counts, confusion, kidney problems, blood clots, difficulty breathing, and chest pain.
If one has aHUS, the doctor will need to monitor closely for at least 12 weeks after stopping SOLIRIS for signs of worsening aHUS symptoms or problems related to abnormal clotting (thrombotic microangiopathy). Symptoms or problems that can happen with abnormal clotting may include: stroke, confusion, seizure, chest pain (angina), difficulty breathing, kidney problems, swellings in arms or legs and a drop in platelet count.
SOLIRIS can cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions. Serious allergic reactions can happen during one’s SOLIRIS infusion. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if one gets any of these symptoms during the SOLIRIS infusion: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, and feeling faint or pass out. If one has an allergic reaction to SOLIRIS, the doctor may need to infuse SOLIRIS more slowly, or stop SOLIRIS. The most common side effects in people with PNH treated with SOLIRIS include: headache, pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), back pain, and nausea. The most common side effects in people with aHUS treated with SOLIRIS include: headache, diarrhea, high blood pressure (hypertension), common cold (upper respiratory infection), stomach-area (abdominal pain), vomiting, pain or swelling of the nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), low red blood cell count (anemia), cough, swelling of legs or feet (peripheral edema), nausea, urinary tract infections, and fever. The most common side effects in people with gMG treated with SOLIRIS include: muscle and joint (musculoskeletal) pain.

Valneva to regain complete control of its R&D assets including its Lyme vaccine candidate, VLA15
 In 2007, Novartis & Intercell collaborated to accelerate vaccine for infectious diseases. Later, Intercell merged with Valneva in 2013, Novartis divested its global vaccine business (excluding influenza vaccines) to GSK in 2015
 Valneva’s VLA15 is a multivalent vaccine targeting the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia, being evaluated in P-II study and has received FDA’ s Fast Track designation. Valneva is developing VLA1553, a vaccine for chikungunya and has also received FT designation by FDA","Saint Herblain (France), June 20, 2019 – Valneva SE (“Valneva” or “the Company”), a biotech company developing and commercializing vaccines for infectious diseases with major unmet needs, today announces that GSK and Valneva have decided, by mutual agreement, to end the Strategic Alliance Agreement (“SAA”), originally agreed between Novartis and Intercell (predecessor companies of GSK and Valneva, respectively). Valneva will pay €9 million to GSK immediately and up to a further €7 million in milestones relating to marketing approvals of its Lyme vaccine. As a result, Valneva is now fully in control of its main R&D assets including its Lyme vaccine candidate VLA15.

Valneva has the only clinical stage Lyme vaccine candidate worldwide and is fully committed to advancing this asset. The Company is driving the program forward and has recently reported progress of its Phase 2 studies.

 Bayer & Regeneron collaborated to develop aflibercept whereas Regeneron holds exclusive rights to aflibercept in the US while Bayer retained exclusive marketing rights outside the US with equal profit sharing (Ex-Japan)
 Aflibercept (marketed as Eylea) is an anti-VEGF therapy approved in ~100 countries for 5 indications including patients with wAMD, macula edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and myopic choroidal neovascularization","Berlin, June 21, 2019 – Bayer has initiated a Phase III trial of its anti-VEGF treatment aflibercept for intravitreal injection in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), an eye condition in premature infants which can lead to irreversible blindness.
ROP occurs in premature infants as a result of incomplete or abnormal development of blood vessels serving the retina, potentially causing scarring and retinal detachment leading to visual impairment and irreversible blindness. Even with the currently available treatments it is believed to account for 6-18% of childhood blindness in developed countries. Taking into account its prevalence and severity, childhood blindness, including ROP, is a priority for VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, a joint global initiative between the World Health Organization and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.
“To suffer severe irreversible vision loss beginning in infancy is devastating for both affected children and their families, and preventing it must always be an absolute priority,” said Professor Stahl from the University Eye Hospital in Greifswald, Germany. “In its severest form, retinopathy of prematurity can cause total blindness; however, it is also a condition that, for many, can be managed if detected and treated appropriately at the right time. Since many mechanisms of the disease are not yet sufficiently known and the condition remains an ongoing threat around the globe, it is important to continue to further research into retinopathy of prematurity.”
“Childhood visual impairment and blindness can have far-reaching consequences, affecting all aspects of a child’s development. We have initiated this Phase III study to evaluate the potential of providing physicians with an additional treatment for premature infants with ROP,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceutical Division and Head of Research and Development. “This trial is an important step forward in our commitment to addressing the most significant unmet needs in ophthalmology.”
This Phase III, multi-center, randomized trial is designed to assess efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravitreal aflibercept for the treatment of ROP. Approximately 100 infants will be enrolled in 34 countries and will be randomized to receive intravitreal aflibercept or laser photocoagulation.
Aflibercept is a proven treatment option for patients with visual impairment due to several retinal conditions and has consistently delivered excellent outcomes in reducing preventable vision loss, both in randomised clinical studies as well as in real world clinical settings.
Aflibercept has been approved under the brand name EYLEA® in approximately 100 countries for five indications to treat patients with wAMD and patients with visual impairment due to: macula edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO; branch RVO or central RVO) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Aflibercept has also been approved for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization. Around 25 million vials of Eylea have been sold since launch worldwide resulting in approximately 3.6 million patient years of experience.
Bayer and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating on the global development of aflibercept. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to Eylea in the United States. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside the United States, where the companies share equally the profits from sales of Eylea, except for Japan where Regeneron receives a percentage of net sales.
About VEGF and aflibercept solution for injection into the eye
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a naturally occurring protein in the body. Its normal role in a healthy organism is to trigger formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) supporting the growth of the body’s tissues and organs. It is also associated with the growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the eye, which exhibit abnormal increased permeability that leads to edema.
Aflibercept solution for injection is a recombinant fusion protein, consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 and formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and Placental Growth Factor (PGF) and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of their cognate VEGF receptors.

16209,Sanofi and Regeneron Report Results of REGN3500 in P-II Study for Asthma,Sanofi and Regeneron announce positive topline Phase 2 results for IL-33 antibody in asthma,"The P-II study results involve assessing of REGN3500 + PBO, REGN3500 + Dupixent, Dupixent + PBO and PBO in 296 patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who were not well controlled on LABA and ICS therapy for 12wks.
 The P-II study resulted in meeting its 1EPs & 2EPs i.e, improvement in loss of asthma control & improvement in lung function respectively
 REGN3500 (SAR440340) is a mAb, inhibiting IL-33, being evaluated in P-II studies for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and atopic dermatitis, invented utilizing Regeneron’s VelocImmune technology, co-developed by Sanofi & Regeneron","Sanofi and Regeneron announce positive topline Phase 2 results for IL-33 antibody in asthma

REGN3500 (SAR440340) monotherapy significantly reduced loss of asthma control and improved lung function compared to placebo
PARIS and TARRYTOWN, NY – June 21, 2019 – Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial evaluating the investigational IL-33 antibody REGN3500 (SAR440340) met the primary endpoint of improvement in loss of asthma control when comparing REGN3500 monotherapy to placebo. The trial also met a key secondary endpoint, demonstrating REGN3500 monotherapy significantly improved lung function compared to placebo.

In the trial, the greatest improvement was observed in patients with blood eosinophil levels ≥300 cells/microliter. Patients treated with Dupixent® (dupilumab) monotherapy did numerically better than REGN3500 across all endpoints, although the trial was not powered to show differences between active treatment arms. The combination of REGN3500 and Dupixent also did not demonstrate increased benefit compared to Dupixent monotherapy in this trial. More detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting

“This trial suggests that REGN3500 may provide an alternative targeted approach for patients suffering from asthma,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “We look forward to working with Sanofi to advance REGN3500 through our asthma clinical trial program, as well as continuing our ongoing trials in atopic dermatitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.” 

Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 61.6% of patients who received REGN3500, 66.2% of patients receiving both REGN3500 and Dupixent, 56.8% of patients who received Dupixent and 64.9% of patients who received placebo. The incidence of serious AEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuations was low.

Despite standard-of-care treatment with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) therapy, people with moderate-to-severe asthma often have inadequately controlled, persistent symptoms that may make them suitable for treatment with a biologic therapy. These people live with coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing, and are at risk of severe asthma attacks that may require emergency room visits or hospitalizations

“Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and not everyone experiences it in the same way. Therefore, there is value in evaluating new therapies with distinct and novel mechanisms such as anti-IL-33,” said Steve Pascoe, M.D., Head of Immuno-Inflammation Development at Sanofi. “We have ongoing studies for SAR440340 in atopic dermatitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We will evaluate the results of these studies as well as the findings in asthma to determine the best path forward for this therapy.”

REGN3500 is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33), a protein that is believed to play a key role in type 1 and type 2 inflammation. Preclinical research showed REGN3500 blocked several markers of both types of inflammation. In moderate-to-severe asthma, there can be multiple sources of underlying inflammation that new therapies may help address.

About the Phase 2 Trial
The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week proof-of-concept trial that enrolled 296 adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who were not well controlled on LABA and ICS therapy. Patients were randomized into four treatment groups: REGN3500 plus placebo, REGN3500 plus Dupixent, Dupixent plus placebo, and placebo. All patients received fluticasone/salmeterol as the ICS/LABA maintenance therapy, which was withdrawn during the trial. At four weeks post-randomization, the LABA was withdrawn, and between six and nine weeks the ICS was tapered to withdrawal. Patients continued without ICS/LABA maintenance therapy until 12 weeks. If a patient experienced loss of asthma control (LOAC) during the trial, they resumed their prescreening ICS/LABA maintenance therapy and entered the safety follow-up period.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced LOAC on REGN3500 with or without Dupixent, compared to placebo.

About the REGN3500 (SAR440340) Development Program
Regeneron and Sanofi are currently studying REGN3500 in respiratory and dermatological diseases where inflammation is thought to play an underlying role. REGN3500 is being studied in Phase 2 trials for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and atopic dermatitis. These potential uses are investigational and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. REGN3500 was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology that yields optimized fully-human antibodies, and is being developed jointly by Regeneron and Sanofi as part of a global collaboration agreement.

About Dupixent® (dupilumab)
Dupixent is a fully-human monoclonal antibody specifically designed to inhibit the signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), two key proteins that may play a central role in the type 2 inflammation that underlies asthma as well as other allergic and atopic diseases.

Dupixent is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of people 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies; and for use with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma in people aged 12 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. Dupixent is also approved for certain patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and severe asthma in the European Union and Japan.

In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying dupilumab for additional diseases driven by allergic and other type 2 inflammation, including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (Phase 3 completed), pediatric asthma and atopic dermatitis (6 to 11 years of age, Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 2/3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phase 3), and food and environmental allergies (Phase 2). These potential uses, and its use in combination with REGN3500, are investigational and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

16227,Allergan's BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) Receives FDA's Approval for Upper Limb Spasticity in Pediatric Patients,FDA Approves BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) for Pediatric Patients with Upper Limb Spasticity,"The approval is based on two P-III studies result assessing BOTOX (3-6 units/kg) in 200 pediatric patients with upper limb spasticity aged 2-17yrs. for 12wks. followed by a one-year extension study
 Additionally, sBLA for using BOTOX in treating pediatric patients with lower limb spasticity is under FDA’s review with its expected approval in Q4’19
 BOTOX is a neurotoxin therapy injected in the muscles to treat increased muscle stiffness & eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) and has received six-month Priority Review by the FDA","–BOTOX® is the First Neurotoxin Treatment Approved to Treat Pediatric Patients, 2 to 17 Years of Age, with Upper Limb Spasticity––Approval Marks 10th BOTOX® Therapeutic Indication in its 30th Anniversary Year–

DUBLIN, June 21, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company’s supplemental biologics application (sBLA) for BOTOX® for the treatment of pediatric patients (2 to 17 years of age) with upper limb spasticity. BOTOX® was granted a six-month Priority Review by the FDA, which is typically granted to therapies that if approved, could offer significant improvements in safety and effectiveness when compared to current standard of care. The FDA is also reviewing an additional sBLA for the use of BOTOX® to treat pediatric patients with lower limb spasticity, with a decision expected in the fourth quarter of this year.
Damage to the brain and spine can result in spasticity, which is often observed as muscle tightness and stiffness in the upper and lower limbs. Upper limb spasticity can interfere with movement at the joints of the upper limb and its severity can range from mild to severe muscle stiffness. Common causes of spasticity in children include cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and stroke, which is a group of disorders affecting one’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture.
“Watching a child suffering with any degree of upper limb spasticity is very difficult,” said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer, Allergan. “This FDA approval is special to all of us at Allergan because we can now provide children and their caregivers an advancement in pediatric care with BOTOX®. This milestone underscores our constant focus on innovation and builds on our 30-years of research and development efforts with BOTOX® since FDA approval of blepharospasm and strabismus in 1989. We also look forward to the FDA’s decision on pediatric lower limb spasticity and continuing to serve our patients globally.”
The FDA approval is based on data from two Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of BOTOX® in over 200 pediatric patients with upper limb spasticity. These trials included a 12-week, double-blind study and a one-year open-label extension study.
The approved recommended dose per treatment session is 3 Units per kilogram to 6 Units per kilogram divided among affected muscles of the upper limb. The total dose in pediatric patients should not exceed 8 Units per kilogram body weight or 300 Units, whichever is lower, in a 3-month interval. Treatment with BOTOX® is not meant to replace existing physical therapy or other rehabilitation that may have been prescribed.
“Pediatric upper limb spasticity is a significant concern and can negatively impact a child’s development and quality of life,” said Mark Gormley, Jr. M.D., Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine Specialist, Gillette Children’s Specialty Healthcare-St. Paul. “Because spasticity is particularly debilitating to growing children, it requires ongoing care. BOTOX® has a well-established safety and efficacy profile and I believe it will be an important treatment option in helping successfully manage upper limb spasticity in children and adolescents.”
Allergan is committed to providing resources and services, such as the BOTOX® Savings Program, to help ensure BOTOX® is accessible and affordable to patients. Over the past 30 years, more than 100 million vials of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) have been distributed worldwide. With more than 3,700 articles on BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic published in scientific and medical journals, BOTOX® neurotoxin is one of the most widely researched medicines in the world.
BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) Important Information
Indications
BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used:
to treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity
to treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older
Treatment with BOTOX® in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity is not meant to replace existing physical therapy or other rehabilitation that may have been prescribed.
It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
BOTOX® may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX®:

Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months.
Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing.
There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat blepharospasm or strabismus.
BOTOX® may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX®. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.
Do not receive BOTOX® if you: are allergic to any of the ingredients in BOTOX® (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.
The dose of BOTOX® is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product.
Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® should be discontinued.
Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX®.
Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.
Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.
Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently.
Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® passes into breast milk).
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX® in the past.
Tell your doctor if you received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic by injection; take muscle relaxants; take an allergy or cold medicine; take a sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.
Other side effects of BOTOX® include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes, drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection.
For more information refer to the Medication Guide or talk with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

 The P-III EMBRACA study results: mPFS (8.6 mos.vs 5.6mos.); ORR (62.6% vs 27.2%); 46% reduction in the risk of disease progression
 Talzenna is a PARP inhibitor, being evaluated in multiple studies for breast and other cancers, including early triple-negative breast cancer and prostate cancer and has received FDA’s approval for gBRCAm HER2-, LA or m-breast cancer","Only once-daily PARP inhibitor approved in Europe for hereditary breast cancer
Friday, June 21, 2019 – 10:45am
EDT
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the European Commission approved TALZENNA® (talazoparib), an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA)1/2-mutations, who have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) locally advanced (LA) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients should have been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. Patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer should have been treated with a prior endocrine-based therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine-based therapy.1 This approval follows the medicine’s approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2018.
“Today’s approval of TALZENNA for certain patients with advanced-stage breast cancer and an inherited BRCA mutation is the latest example of our successful precision medicine approach to drug development,” said Andreas Penk, M.D., Regional President, Oncology International Developed Markets at Pfizer. “This important milestone builds on Pfizer’s decades-long legacy of developing therapies that improve outcomes for patients with breast cancer. We are thrilled that we can now offer these patients in Europe, who are often diagnosed at a younger age and have limited treatment options, an effective, once-daily, alternative treatment to chemotherapy.”
The European Commission’s approval of TALZENNA, which was acquired as part of Pfizer’s acquisition of Medivation, is based on results from the EMBRACA trial – the largest Phase 3 study of a PARP inhibitor in gBRCA-mutated, HER2- LA or MBC. The global trial evaluated once-daily TALZENNA compared to physician’s choice standard chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine) in patients with an inherited BRCA1/2 mutation in triple-negative or HR+/HER2- LA or MBC who may have received up to three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for their advanced disease. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).1,2
“In the EMBRACA trial, TALZENNA reduced the risk of disease progression by 46 percent and more than doubled the overall response rate compared to chemotherapy,” said Johannes Ettl, M.D., Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich in Germany and an investigator in the EMBRACA trial. “This improvement in outcomes for patients treated with TALZENNA reinforces the increasingly key role of genetic testing in treatment decision-making for patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.”
In the EMBRACA trial, TALZENNA significantly outperformed chemotherapy, extending median PFS to 8.6 months compared to 5.6 months for those treated with standard chemotherapy [95% CI: 7.2-9.3 vs. 4.2-6.7, respectively]. The superior PFS benefit with TALZENNA was observed across prespecified patient populations, including patients with triple-negative breast cancer, HR+/HER2- disease, with or without a history of CNS metastasis, and those who received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Secondary endpoints from the EMBRACA trial included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety. TALZENNA demonstrated an ORR of 62.6% (95% CI: 55.8-69.0), more than double that in the standard chemotherapy arm (27.2%) (95% CI: 19.3-36.3). OS is an event-driven endpoint and the data are not yet mature.1
Based on pooled data from patients who received 1 mg TALZENNA in clinical studies for solid tumors, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 25%) of patients receiving TALZENNA were fatigue (57.1%), anemia (49.6%), nausea (44.3%), neutropenia (30.2%), thrombocytopenia (29.6%) and headache (26.5%). Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (≥ 10%) in patients treated with TALZENNA were anemia (35.2%), neutropenia (17.4%) and thrombocytopenia (16.8%).1
About EMBRACA
The pivotal, Phase 3, open-label, 2:1 randomized EMBRACA trial is the largest Phase 3 trial of a PARP inhibitor in gBRCA-mutated, HER2- LA or MBC. The trial evaluated TALZENNA (1 mg once daily) compared to physician’s choice chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine) in 431 patients with an inherited BRCA1/2 mutation and locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative or HR+/HER2- breast cancer who may have received up to three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Of the patients enrolled, 190 were from European countries, such as Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. The primary endpoint was PFS, as assessed by BICR. Safety, ORR and OS were key secondary endpoints.1,2
Primary results from the EMBRACA trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, simultaneous to the online publication of patient-reported outcomes data in Annals of Oncology in August 2018.2,3

About Germline (Inherited) BRCA-Mutated Breast Cancer
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce proteins involved in DNA repair. When either of these genes is altered or mutated, DNA repair may not progress correctly. This can lead to the development of certain types of cancer such as breast cancer.4BRCAmutations can be hereditary (germline) or occur spontaneously (somatic).5 Together, germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for about 25 to 30% of hereditary breast cancers and approximately 3 to 6% of all breast cancers.5,6,7,8,9
Epidemiologic studies indicate that individuals with gBRCA-mutated breast cancer are diagnosed in their 30s-40s, which is approximately 20 years younger than the overall breast cancer population.10,11
BRCA-mutated breast cancer is metastatic if the disease has spread beyond the breast or to other parts of the body, including the bones, liver, lung or brain.12 There is currently no cure for MBC, the most advanced stage (stage IV) of the disease. The goal of treatment is to delay or slow disease progression while maintaining quality of life.13,14
Current European and U.S. clinical guidelines recommend gBRCA testing to inform therapeutic considerations for HER2- LA or MBC patients.15,16
About talazoparib
Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, which play a role in DNA repair. Preclinical studies suggest that talazoparib may work by blocking PARP enzyme activity and trapping PARP at the site of DNA damage, leading to decreased cancer cell growth and cancer cell death. Talazoparib anti-tumor activity also was observed in human patient-derived xenograft breast cancer tumor models that expressed mutated or wild-type BRCA1/2.1
In addition to gBRCA-mutated LA or MBC, talazoparib is being evaluated in several ongoing clinical trials in breast and other cancers, including early triple-negative breast cancer and prostate cancer, as well as other novel combinations with targeted therapies and studies with immunotherapy in various solid tumors.
Indication in the U.S.
TALZENNA® (talazoparib) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA)‑mutated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‑negative (HER2-), locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for TALZENNA.17
TALZENNA® (talazoparib) Important Safety Information from the U.S. Prescribing Information
Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in patients who received TALZENNA. Overall, MDS/AML have been reported in 2 out of 584 (0.3%) solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA in clinical studies. The duration of TALZENNA treatment in these two patients prior to developing MDS/AML was 4 months and 24 months, respectively. Both patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy.
Myelosuppression consisting of anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients treated with TALZENNA. Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 21%, and 15% of patients receiving TALZENNA. Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 0.7%, 0.3%, and 0.3% of patients.
Monitor complete blood counts for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter. Do not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous therapy. If hematological toxicity occurs, dose modifications (dosing interruption with or without dose reduction) are recommended. With respect to MDS/AML, for prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt TALZENNA and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue TALZENNA.
TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TALZENNA treatment. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment with TALZENNA and for at least 4 months after receiving the last dose. Based on animal studies, TALZENNA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Advise women not to breastfeed while taking TALZENNA and for at least 1 month after receiving the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were fatigue (62% vs 50%), anemia (53% vs 18%), nausea (49% vs 47%), neutropenia (35% vs 43%), headache (33% vs 22%), thrombocytopenia (27% vs 7%), vomiting (25% vs 23%), alopecia (25% vs 28%), diarrhea (22% vs 26%), and decreased appetite (21% vs 22%).
The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were anemia (39% vs 5%), neutropenia (21% vs 36%), and thrombocytopenia (15% vs 2%).
The most common lab abnormalities (≥25%) for TALZENNA vs chemotherapy were decreases in hemoglobin (90% vs 77%), leukocytes (84% vs 73%), lymphocytes (76% vs 53%), neutrophils (68% vs 70%), platelets (55% vs 29%), and calcium (28% vs 16%) and increases in glucose (54% vs 51%), aspartate aminotransferase (37% vs 48%), alkaline phosphatase (36% vs 34%), and alanine aminotransferase (33% vs 37%).
Coadministration with P-gp inhibitors or BCRP inhibitors may increase TALZENNA exposure. If coadministering with the P-gp inhibitors amiodarone, carvedilol, clarithromycin, itraconazole, or verapamil is unavoidable, reduce the TALZENNA dose to 0.75 mg once daily. When the P-gp inhibitor is discontinued, increase the TALZENNA dose (after 3–5 half-lives of the P-gp inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the P-gp inhibitor. When co-administering TALZENNA with other known P-gp inhibitors or BCRP inhibitors, monitor patients for potential increased adverse reactions.
For patients with moderate renal impairment, the recommended dose of TALZENNA is 0.75 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment. TALZENNA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or in patients requiring hemodialysis.
TALZENNA has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment.

 HLX02 is the first biosimilar of trastuzumab developed in China, indicated for HER2+ early-stage breast cancer, HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, untreated HER2+ metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer","Henlius trastuzumab biosimilar HLX02 has been accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for reviewing its Marketing Authorization Application (MAA). HLX02 has established three “Firsts” both in China and globally.

First China biosimilar conducted a multi-center, international phase 3 clinical trial
First trastuzumab developed in China following the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) technical guideline for biosimilar with the New Drug Application (NDA) received the acceptance for review from the NMPA
First China-developed trastuzumab biosimilar accepted for MAA review by the EMA
SHANGHAI, June 21, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Henlius, a leading biotech company in China developing both biosimilar and innovative biologics, announced today that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has officially accepted to review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) of its trastuzumab biosimilar HLX02. The European rights of this product have been out-licensed to its business partner Accord Healthcare. HLX02 is indicated for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) early-stagebreast cancer, HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, and untreated HER2+ metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.
The New Drug Application (NDA) of HLX02, a biosimilar of a classical targeted therapy for cancers, has been accepted for review by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China. The acceptance for review by the EMA demonstrates that the “China-developed” biosimilar has entered the global stage with the hope to benefit patients globally.
“We are very pleased to receive the EMA acceptance to review of our trastuzumab biosimilar HLX02 MAA submission,” said Dr. Scott Liu, co-Founder, President and CEO at Henlius. “It shows that our clinical, medical, regulatory affairs and quality system capabilities have been internationally recognized. We plan to work closely with EMA on this HLX02 MAA and hope to benefit HER2+ cancer patients globally with its high-quality and affordability.”
The Phase 3 study aimed for head-to-head similarity evaluation in efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles between HLX02 and reference trastuzumab sourced from the European Union (EU) in 649 previously untreated patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer in mainland China, Ukraine, Poland and the Philippines. The Phase 1 study has successfully demonstrated the equivalence in pharmacokinetics and safety profiles between HLX02 and reference trastuzumab sourced from both EU and China.
Apart from the R&D and innovation efforts, Henlius is also actively creating new business models and expanding its global presence. The acceptance of the regulatory submission of trastuzumab biosimilar HLX02 MAA in Europe is another example of strong progress Henlius continues to make across the robust biosimilars portfolio. The acceptance of HLX02 MAA review marks a key milestone for the collaboration between Henlius and its partner Accord. In June 2018, Henlius signed the licensing and supply agreements with Accord. Under this partnership, Accord is exclusively authorized to commercialize HLX02 in 53 countries including UK, France, Germany, and Italy in Europe; 17 countries in Middle East–North Africa (“MENA”) and certain countries in Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”).
Henlius has strong capabilities in integrated innovation. Its first rituximab injection (HLX01) has been successfully launched in China. Currently, both HLX02 (trastuzumab biosimilar) and HLX03 (adalimumab biosimilar) NDAs are under NMPA review.

16248,ï»¿Bristol-Myers Squibb Reports Results of Opdivo (nivolumab) in P-III CheckMate-459 Study as 1L Treatment for Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Bristol-Myers Squibb Announces Results from CheckMate -459 Study Evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) as a First-Line Treatment for Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"The P-III CheckMate-459 study results involve assessing of Opdivo vs sorafenib as a 1L treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
 The P-III CheckMate-459 study results demonstrated that it did not meet its 1EPs of overall survival (OS) per the pre-specified analysis, no new safety signals were observed
 Opdivo is PD-1 immune check inhibitor, harnessing the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response, being evaluated in multiple studies for HCC as monothx. or in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) for prior treated patients","PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today announced topline results from CheckMate -459, a randomized Phase 3 study evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The trial did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) per the pre-specified analysis (HR=0.85 [95% CI: 0.72-1.02]; p=0.0752). No new safety signals were observed with Opdivo. The full study results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
While CheckMate -459 did not reach its pre-specified primary endpoint, the results showed a clear trend towards improvement in OS for patients treated with Opdivo compared to sorafenib, a current standard of care.
“We are encouraged by the promising efficacy and safety trends seen with Opdivo in CheckMate -459, especially as HCC is a devastating and difficult-to-treat cancer, for which there have been no significant advances over sorafenib, a standard treatment, in more than a decade,” said Bruno Sangro, M.D., head of the Liver Unit, Clínica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.
Ian M. Waxman, M.D., development lead, Gastrointestinal Cancers, Bristol-Myers Squibb, commented, “We remain confident in the important role of Opdivo for the treatment of patients with HCC and look forward to evaluating insights garnered from this trial with the goal of ensuring patients with liver cancer have the opportunity to achieve the best possible outcomes.”
As part of its broad clinical program, Opdivo is being studied by the company across multiple settings and lines of therapy for HCC, including as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting (CheckMate -9DX [NCT03383458]) and in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) for previously treated patients (CheckMate -040 [NCT01658878]). Data from the Opdivo plus Yervoy cohort of CheckMate -040 were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2019. Bristol-Myers Squibb is grateful to the patients, caregivers and investigators involved in our clinical research program.
About CheckMate -459
CheckMate -459 was a Phase 3 randomized, multi-center study evaluating Opdivo versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, progression-free survival and the relationship between tumor PD-L1 expression and efficacy.
About Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Liver cancer is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related death in the United States. HCC is often diagnosed in the advanced stage, where effective treatment options are limited and the survival benefit provided by the first-line standard of care is less than three months over placebo. While most cases of HCC are caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are rising in prevalence and expected to contribute to increased rates of HCC.
Bristol-Myers Squibb: Advancing Oncology Research
At Bristol-Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The focus of our research is to increase quality, long-term survival for patients and make cure a possibility. Through a unique multidisciplinary approach powered by translational science, we harness our deep scientific experience in oncology and Immuno-Oncology (I-O) research to identify novel treatments tailored to individual patient needs. Our researchers are developing a diverse, purposefully built pipeline designed to target different immune system pathways and address the complex and specific interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment and the immune system. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines, like I-O, a reality for patients.
About Opdivo
Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
Opdivo’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has treated more than 35,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS
YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.
Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy, and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests, at baseline and before each dose.
Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or more severe pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, fatal cases of immune-mediated pneumonitis have occurred. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (24/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.7% (2/119) of patients.
In Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=12).
Immune-Mediated Colitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 (of more than 5 days duration), 3, or 4 colitis. Withhold OPDIVO monotherapy for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 or recurrent colitis upon re-initiation of OPDIVO. When administered with YERVOY, withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent colitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 26% (107/407) of patients including three fatal cases. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 10% (52/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 7% (8/119) of patients.
In a separate Phase 3 study of YERVOY 3 mg/kg, severe, life-threatening, or fatal (diarrhea of ≥7 stools above baseline, fever, ileus, peritoneal signs; Grade 3-5) immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 34 (7%) patients. Across all YERVOY-treated patients in that study (n=511), 5 (1%) developed intestinal perforation, 4 (0.8%) died as a result of complications, and 26 (5%) were hospitalized for severe enterocolitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater transaminase elevations. For patients without HCC, withhold OPDIVO for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for Grade 3 or 4. For patients with HCC, withhold OPDIVO and administer corticosteroids if AST/ALT is within normal limits at baseline and increases to >3 and up to 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), if AST/ALT is >1 and up to 3 times ULN at baseline and increases to >5 and up to 10 times the ULN, and if AST/ALT is >3 and up to 5 times ULN at baseline and increases to >8 and up to 10 times the ULN. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO and administer corticosteroids if AST or ALT increases to >10 times the ULN or total bilirubin increases >3 times the ULN. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 13% (51/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (38/547) of patients.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
Infusion Reactions
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
Lactation
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.
