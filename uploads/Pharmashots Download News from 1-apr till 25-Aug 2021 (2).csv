<ul><li><em>At Adaptimmune, we are leaders in designing and engineering T-cell receptors or TCRs to target solid tumors</em></li><li><em>Afamitresgene autoleucel or afami-cel is an engineered TCR T-cell therapy product designed to target solid tumors</em></li><li><em>We can engineer TCRs to target proteins expressed inside cells and this is a distinct advantage with solid tumors because they lack unique cell-surface proteins&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>In the case of afami-cel, this TCR is specifically engineered to target a tumor antigen called MAGE-A4 that is expressed in a broad range of cancers, including synovial sarcoma</em></li><li><em>To make afami-cel, we harvest a patients’ own T-cells via a process called apheresis</em></li><li><em>These T-cells are shipped to our manufacturing facility where we genetically modify them to express the enhanced TCR targeting MAGE-A4</em></li><li><em>We expand the modified T-cells, test them, and freeze them to send back to the patient for infusion</em></li><li><em>The patient undergoes a process called lymphodepletion to make room for the MAGE-A4 targeted T-cells or afami-cel product to expand&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>When the patient is ready, they receive their genetically modified T-cells to fight cancer</em></li><li><em>It is a “one and done” therapy, unlike chemotherapy or radiation that require multiple treatments</em></li><li><em>We have had patients tell us that our cell therapies have given them their lives back because they have been freed from frequent hospital trips to receive multiple rounds of chemo or radiation&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: When are you expecting the first approval of the company? Can you draw us a roadmap for application &amp; approval for our readers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dennis:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>We want afami-cel to be the first engineered TCR T-cell product approved in a solid tumor indication. More simply put, our goal is to make a difference for people suffering from sarcoma and to make afami-cel available to as many patients as we can.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>We are on track to file our first Biologics License Application or BLA with the US FDA next year for the approval of afami-cel for people with synovial sarcoma or MRCLS. We will file this application based on data from our Phase 2 SPEARHEAD-1 trial as well as data from our Phase 1 trial with afami-cel</em></li><li><em>Previously, we received several key regulatory designations based on data from patients with synovial sarcoma in our Phase 1 trial with afami-cel: RMAT in the US and PRIME in the EU, and orphan drug designation in both regions. These designations are important for 2 reasons</em><ul><li><em>First, they provide external validation of the clinical data. Regulatory designations such as the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation, or RMAT, the European Orphan Drug Designation, or the European Medicines Agency Priority Medicines Scheme or PRIME, require clear clinical evidence, demonstrating the ability to either address an unmet medical need or some advantage over available therapies. Only promising therapies receive these designations.</em></li><li><em>Second, these designations enable expedited drug development through several incentives. These incentives include expedited reviews of marketing applications and enhance interactions with regulatory authorities, including formal meetings.&nbsp;</em></li></ul></li><li><em>In addition to these regulatory designations, the clinical evidence from the Phase I trial allowed us to initiate the Phase 2 SPEARHEAD-1 trial. The data from SPEARHEAD-1, recently presented at ASCO and to be updated later this year at CTOS, further strengthen my confidence that afami-cel will be the first TCR T-cell therapy approved for a solid tumor indication.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the Company’s pathway to bring the first-ever TCR T-cell therapy for solid tumors to market?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dennis:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>It is our ambition to file for approval next year for afami-cel. Time to market will depend on our interactions with FDA and other regulatory authorities after filing</em></li><li><em>In addition to our regulatory preparations for filing our first BLA, we have also initiated several early commercial activities.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>These have included optimizing our patient journey in collaboration with patient advocacy groups, such as the Sarcoma Foundation of America.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>We've conducted some initial sarcoma market sizing. And we've had an engagement in early scientific advice with U.S. payers and health technology assessment bodies to generate insights on payer evidence requirements.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>We are also a fully integrated cell therapy company with our cell manufacturing facility with the capacity to meet the demands for our ongoing clinical trials as well as for people with synovial sarcoma and MRCLS if we receive marketing approval</em><strong><em>Q5. What are the other indications in which you are evaluating the ADP-A2M4?</em></strong></li><li><em>MAGE-A4 represents a tremendous opportunity as a cancer target and we aim to identify new indications for late-stage development from our ongoing trials</em></li><li><em>Our first-generation product targeting MAGE-A4 was called ADP-A2M4, now afami-cel</em></li><li><em>We also have a next-generation product targeting MAGE-A4 that uses the same TCR as afami-cel, with the addition of a CD8 alpha co-receptor (ADP-A2M4CD8) designed to increase potency</em></li><li><em>We have reported clinical responses in several MAGE-A4 expressing cancers, beyond sarcoma, with afami-cel or ADP-A2M4CD8 including melanoma, lung, head and neck, and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers</em></li><li><em>We are currently enrolling patients in our SURPASS trial with our next-generation product targeting MAGE-A4 with a focus on lung, gastroesophageal, head and neck, and bladder cancers – all indications where we have seen signs of efficacy with our MAGE-A4 targeted T-cells. We plan to identify additional indications for late-stage development from this trial</em></li><li><em>We also intend to initiate a Phase 2 trial, SURPASS-2, with ADP-A2M4CD8 for people with EGJ and esophageal cancers, which could form the basis of a second approval</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the company’s SPEAR (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform. How it is revolutionizing cancer therapies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dennis:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>SPEAR stands for Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor and this refers to the proprietary technology that enables us to engineer T-cell receptors or TCRs to optimally target and kill cancer cells</em></li><li><em>Solid tumors often evade the immune system because cancer looks a lot like the body’s own cells&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Every protein in the body is broken down and fragments -- called peptides -- are presented on the surface of body cells in antigen presentation molecules called human leukocyte antigen or HLA. The HLA:peptide complexes are surveyed by T-cells looking for evidence of foreign proteins – such as those from viruses</em></li><li><em>When T- cells recognize a peptide:HLA complex with the right binding strength, indicating that the protein is likely foreign, it kills the target cell</em></li><li><em>Because T-cells that bind self-proteins are eliminated during development and cancers look a lot like the body’s own cells, T-cells that naturally kill tumors can be rare</em></li><li><em>At Adaptimmune, we protein engineer and enhance TCRs to target specific cancer proteins that are expressed inside solid tumors</em></li><li><em>We then genetically engineer these optimized TCRs into a patient’s own T-cells, known as autologous cell therapy, to specifically recognize cancer proteins and kill tumor cells</em></li><li><em>Use of these engineered TCRs is not limited to our autologous platform, though, and these same receptors can be expressed in our allogeneic platform, which is still in preclinical development</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: Showcase your robust pipeline of T-cell therapies.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dennis:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>Our company’s mission is to design and deliver cell therapies for cancer and our first marketed product will be a TCR T-cell therapy targeting MAGE-A4, afami-cel, but that is only the beginning for us.</em></li><li><em>In addition to our Phase 1 SURPASS trial in multiple solid tumor indications with our next-generation SPEAR T-cell targeting MAGE-A4, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial with this next-generation product, SURPASS-2, for people with EGJ and esophageal cancers later this year</em></li><li><em>We also have an ongoing Phase 1 trial against another cancer target, AFP, for people with liver cancer. We reported data from our Phase 1 ADP-A2AFP trial last year at the International Liver Congress (ILC)</em></li><li><em>At the time of ILC, we reported that nine patients were treated as of the data cutoff, of those</em><ul><li><em>Four patients were treated with ~5 billion or more transduced cells (three in Cohort 3 and one in the expansion phase): 1 patient with the complete response, 1 with stable disease (SD), and 2 had progressive disease (PD)</em></li><li><em>Five patients were previously treated in the first two dose cohorts with doses of 100 million and 1 billion transduced cells, respectively, and all patients had the best responses to SD</em></li></ul></li><li><em>We will update data from the Phase 1 ADP-A2AFP trial later this year at the International Liver Cancer Association meeting during an oral presentation on Sep 5</em></li><li><em>To make our TCR T-cell therapies available to more patients, our preclinical pipeline includes TCRs that recognize more HLA types than our current TCR T-cell therapies&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>We also have several next-generation enhancements in our preclinical pipeline designed to improve our cell therapies</em></li><li><em>In addition, we have engineered TCRs that recognize cell surface proteins without the need for HLA, our HLA-independent TCRs or HiTs. HiTs are a very exciting technology that will enable us to go after cancers that are currently targeted by CAR-T and TRuC T-cell therapies&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Lastly, we have a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte or TIL program in collaboration with a leading TIL therapy center (CCIT, Denmark) for next-generation TILs co-expressing IL-7</em></li></ul>



<ul><li><em>Beyond our autologous platform, we have a very advanced allogeneic platform – or “off-the-shelf” platform in preclinical development. We can generate T-cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells that can kill cancer target cells in vitro</em></li><li><em>We can genetically modify these cells to express any of our engineered receptors as well as other enhancements. We can then select and expand banks of these cells to be ready “on-demand” when an eligible patient needs them.</em></li><li><em>Our current autologous platform has taught us what it takes to engineer and manufacture cell therapies for cancer and these learnings have informed the development of our allogeneic platform</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: Can you discuss your short-term and long-term goals of the company with our subscribers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dennis:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>We have a five-year strategic plan called our 2-2-5-2 plan, which we introduced in November of last year</em></li><li><em>The first aim is to have two commercial products targeting MAGE-A4 on the market in the next five years</em></li><li><em>We intend the first product to be afami-cel for synovial sarcoma and MRCLS, and we are on track to file the BLA next year</em></li><li><em>We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial with our next-generation T-cells targeting MAGE-A4 in esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers later this year, which may form the basis of a second approval for a product targeting MAGE-A4, depending on the data&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>The second aim is to have 2 more autologous TCR T-cell products from our current clinical pipeline on the market in five years. We are continuing to enroll people with multiple solid tumor types in our SURPASS trial, and we aim to identify additional indications to take forward into late-stage&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>The “5” is for 5 new autologous products in the clinic in five years – these could be in additional HLAs, next-generation enhancements, HiTs, or TILs</em></li><li><em>And finally, to have 2 allogeneic or off-the-shelf products in the clinic in the next five years&nbsp;</em></li></ul>

63534,PharmaShots Interview: Janssen’s Andrew Greenspan Shares Insight About the New AGA Guidelines Recommending Stelara (Ustekinumab) as a First-Line Treatment Option in Crohn's Disease,"
<p>In an interview with PharmaShots, Andrew Greenspan, VP, Immunology Affairs at Janssen shared his views on the new AGA guidelines on the medical management of moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease and also highlighted about Janssen’s efforts in improving the QoL of patients with CD</p>



<ul><li>The AGA guidelines assessed the overall benefit of each drug and also compared drugs via a network meta-analysis to assess their efficacy and recommended anti-TNF agents or ustekinumab and suggested vedolizumab as a first-line treatment</li><li>Ustekinumab or vedolizumab has been recommended by AGA in patients who have previously not responded to anti-TNF agents</li><li>The new AGA guidelines did not recommend the biologic natalizumab any further due to potential AEs and the availability of safer treatment options</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: What are the new AGA guidelines on the medical management of Crohn’s disease?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) regularly reviews its clinical guidelines for accuracy, relevance, and clinical impact in order to provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations to help guide clinical practice decisions; recently, it&nbsp;published&nbsp;its new clinical guidelines recommending therapies for the management of luminal and fistulizing Crohn’s disease.</em></p>



<p><em>Crohn’s disease is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects an estimated 3 million Americans and 2.5 million Europeans. Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cause or cure.</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>The organization evaluated the overall benefit and efficacy of available biologic therapies against one another for these guidelines, including assessment of the use of thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a biologic drugs for the induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory Crohn’s disease.</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>At Janssen, we are proud that the AGA’s new guidelines highlight STELARA</em><em>® (ustekinumab) as a recommended first-line treatment option, especially for those who have been previously unresponsive to anti-TNF agents. We believe this guideline supports the safety, efficacy&nbsp;and durability STELARA offers people living with Crohn’s disease, as well as Janssen’s goal of making STELARA the worldwide standard of care in IBD.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the key takeaways of AGA guidelines updates.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The main takeaway of the updated AGA guidelines is that biologics are noted as the most effective treatments for the management of Crohn’s disease, with STELARA recommended as a first-line treatment option, especially for patients who have been previously unresponsive to anti-TNF agents. The recommendation can be attributed to the vast body of clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of STELARA and is a vote of confidence for an additional advanced treatment for people living with Crohn’s disease around the world and the physicians who treat them.</em></p>



<p><em>The&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Association&nbsp;highlights that biologics should be used early in a patient’s treatment journey, rather than delaying their use until after failure of mesalamine and/or corticosteroids, in patients with moderate to severe or fistulizing Crohn’s disease. The guidelines also highlight anti-TNF agents for the management of Crohn’s disease.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: What is the importance of these guidelines for patients with Crohn’s disease?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>People living with Crohn’s disease deserve safe, effective, and convenient therapeutic options that can provide both rapid response and lasting remission. Adding to the body of evidence for these options helps us evaluate what may be the best choice for a particular person, especially as we see new advances, like biologic treatments, continuing to offer patients relief from the symptoms of moderate to severe Crohn’s disease.</em></p>



<p><em>As Janssen strives to provide safe and effective treatment options, we support the&nbsp;American Gastroenterological Association’s&nbsp;commitment to keep its members, patients, and the public at large apprised of the most current best practices, through regular review of its clinical guidelines, to&nbsp;provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations and to&nbsp;achieve the highest possible quality of patient care.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: What are the treatment goals for Crohn’s disease?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>As individuals with immune-mediated diseases often undergo long treatment journeys and can suffer for years before receiving an advanced or proper treatment, I’m always energized by the Janssen team’s work to drive innovation every day and help those living with these diseases.</em></p>



<p><em>This is especially true in the area of Crohn’s disease; as there is currently no cure for Crohn’s disease, a focus on clinical response, preventing flare-ups of symptoms, and remission is paramount when considering a patient’s treatment goals.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss the study designs and outcomes from the SEAVUE study.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Until now, there were no head-to-head trials comparing the safety and efficacy of the leading prescription biologics that treat Crohn’s disease. In the absence of direct head-to-head evidence, a multitude of indirect comparisons are often used to evaluate therapies—this can create uncertainty among physicians when determining which course of treatment may be best for their Crohn’s disease patients in the first-line setting.</em></p>



<p><em>To help physicians and patients make more informed treatment choices, we boldly conducted the first head-to-head Crohn’s disease trial in bio-naïve patients with STELARA and adalimumab therapies; namely, SEAVUE was a multicenter, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, active-controlled study in adult patients with Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</em></p>



<ul><li><em>The primary endpoint was clinical remission at 52 weeks defined as a CD Activity Index (CDAI) &lt;150.</em></li><li><em>Major secondary endpoints were:</em></li></ul>



<ul><li><em>Corticosteroid-free remission</em></li><li><em>Clinical response =100-point CDAI decrease from baseline</em></li><li><em>Remission in patient reported CDAI components (PRO-2 symptom remission: abdominal pain (AP) mean daily score =1 and stool frequency (SF) mean daily number =3)</em></li><li><em>Endoscopic remission (SES-CD score =3/0 for pts with BL score=3) at week 52</em></li><li><em>Clinical remission at week 16</em></li></ul>



<p><em>While STELARA did not achieve statistical separation from adalimumab in the trial, it demonstrated high rates of clinical efficacy and clinical remission.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: What were the key points of the abstracts presented at DDW 2021?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>The SEAVUE data showed treatment with STELARA demonstrated high rates of clinical remission, corticosteroid-free remission, clinical response, and endoscopic response through one year in biologic-naïve patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. However, it did not demonstrate statistical separation from adalimumab.</em></p>



<ul><li><em>STELARA-treated patients experienced a 64.9 percent clinical remission rate at one year, with adalimumab at 61 percent.</em></li><li><em>The majority of patients (60.7 percent) achieved corticosteroid-free clinical remission with STELARA at one year (57.4 percent with adalimumab).</em></li><li><em>STELARA achieved 72.3 percent clinical response rate at week 52 (adalimumab at 66.2 percent).</em></li><li><em>Results for STELARA (56.5 percent) and adalimumab (55.4 percent) achieved PRO-2 symptom remission.</em></li><li><em>At week 16, 57.1 percent of STELARA-treated patients achieved clinical remission (60 percent for adalimumab-treated patients).</em></li><li><em>The trial’s discontinuation rates prior to week 52 were 15.2 percent for STELARA-treated patients (and 23.6 percent for adalimumab-treated patients).</em></li></ul>



<ul><li><em>Discontinuation due to adverse events were 6.3 percent for STELARA-treated patients and 11.3 percent for adalimumab-treated patients, respectively.</em></li><li><em>Adverse events were consistent with STELARA’s established safety profile.</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: Discuss Janssen’s efforts to improve the QoL of patients with CD.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> <em>Janssen is committed to relentlessly advancing care for those living with chronic, difficult-to-manage immune-mediated diseases.

63574,PharmaShots Interview: Revolo’s Jonathan Rigby Shares Insights on the ‘1104 for Eosinophilic Esophagitis,"
<p>In an interview with<strong> PharmaShots, Jonathan</strong><strong> Rigby, Group Chief Executive Officer at Revolo Biotherapeutics </strong>shared his views on the unique mechanism of ‘<strong>1104</strong> and discuss the plan of the company’s clinical studies.</p>



<p><strong>Shots:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Revolo reported the US FDA’s approval to initiate a P-II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ‘1104 in adults with EoE</li><li>‘1104 is a naturally derived, first-in-class immune-regulatory peptide for allergic disease. In pre-clinical studies, a single dose of ‘1104 increased cells that control inflammation &amp; reduced levels of eosinophils &amp; other inflammatory cells without immunosuppression, showcasing its unique potential to change the treatment landscape for EoE</li><li>EoE is a progressive rare allergic disease characterized by difficulty swallowing and gastric reflux, because of elevated numbers of inflammatory immune cells in the esophagus wall</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What is Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> EoE is a progressive rare allergic disease characterized by difficulty swallowing and gastric reflux, as a result of elevated numbers of inflammatory immune cells in the esophagus wall. &nbsp;Roughly&nbsp;180,000 children and adults&nbsp;in the US have EoE,&nbsp;and up to 80% of patients have secondary allergic conditions. Early disease control is critical to avoid the thickening of the tissue of the esophagus.</em></p>



<p><em>There are no FDA-approved drug products for EoE, and&nbsp;50,000 patients are unresponsive to available treatments, including long-term steroids. Patients may take proton pump inhibitors, but chronic frequent dosing often leads to poor compliance.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the MoA of 1104. How will this drug change the treatment landscape for EoE.?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> </em>‘<em>1104 is a peptide that was derived from a natural immune-regulatory protein,&nbsp;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&nbsp;Chaperonin 60.1, that plays a key role in immune system function.</em></p>



<p><em>In allergic diseases, such as EoE, the immune system “overreacts” to certain molecules (allergic antigens) that are unknown to the body. This results in the stimulation of inflammatory immune cells and molecules, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue destruction.</em></p>



<p><em>Most pharmaceutical solutions currently in use or in development focus on alleviating the overactive immune and inflammatory response after it starts, by targeting downstream processes and leaving many patients with unresolved symptoms.</em></p>



<p><em>&nbsp;‘1104 resets the immune response “upstream,” or ahead of the inflammatory cascade, stimulating the production of immune cells that regulate the inflammatory response, thereby preventing the immune system from entering overdrive.</em></p>



<p><em>‘1104 has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for EoE by providing long-term disease remission</em> while eliminating the risk of life-threatening immune suppression often seen with the <em>current standard of care.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Discuss the P-I results of 1104 that allow you to advance the program to the P-II study.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> ‘1104 has already been evaluated in two Phase 1 clinical trials. In the first Phase 1 placebo-controlled clinical trial, administration of ‘1104 intravenously and subcutaneously was safe at clinically relevant doses in 94 healthy volunteers and patients with mild asthma. A second Phase 1 multiple ascending dose studies in 18 healthy subjects found again that ‘1104 given intravenously was safe and tolerable also with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and served as the basis of the selection of the 8 mg dose for a subsequent Phase 2 EoE trial.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What motivates you to work on eosinophilic esophagitis?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> Until a few years ago, there was little awareness about eosinophilic disorders like EoE. There are no FDA-approved drug products for this debilitating disease and a significant number of patients are left to adapt their diet and take medications without a total response.&nbsp; Given the allergic nature of the disease</em> and the mechanism of action of ‘1104, we believe it has the potential to really change the treatment landscape for these patients and are excited to provide them with the first-ever<em> disease-modifying therapy. We look forward to advancing a Phase 2 trial before the end of the year.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Big leaders like GSK, Sanofi or Takeda are also working on EoE. Do you think Revolo’s 1104 can compete with its competitors?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> Absolutely. There are others working to develop a therapy for EoE, but what makes our therapy and approach different from all others is that our drug acts before the inflammatory response occur. We don’t focus on targeting individual inflammatory molecules such as cytokines that are produced after the inflammatory response has begun. ‘1104 may prevent the inflammatory response from ever starting, which could drive clinical improvement compared to the current standard of care.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;How is the company revolutionizing autoimmune and allergic disease treatment?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We are revolutionizing autoimmune and allergic disease treatment by&nbsp;advancing therapies that may achieve superior long-term disease remission, require less frequent dosing, and avoid suppression of the immune system.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;What are the company’s clinical trial plans for this year and the coming years?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We recently received approval of an investigational new drug application by the FDA to evaluate ‘1104 in a Phase 2 trial for EoE. We also received Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the UK to evaluate ‘1104 in a Phase 2 allergen sensitivity study. We expect to start enrolling in both studies shortly and anticipate providing updates before the end of next year.</em></p>



<p><em>We are also advancing ‘1805, a modified analog of the endogenous binding immunoglobulin protein otherwise known as BiP, which is another key player in immune function. We anticipate initiating two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating ‘1805, one&nbsp;for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and the other for non-infectious uveitis in the near term.</em></p>



<p><em>Given the agnostic nature of the mechanism of action of ‘1104 and ‘1805, we believe they have the potential to treat multiple allergic and autoimmune diseases, respectively and we continue to explore additional indications.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: &nbsp;Are you open to collaborations to develop and commercialize your pipeline products?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong><em> We welcome collaborations with strategic partners who are looking to join us in drastically shifting the treatment landscape for allergic and autoimmune diseases. As we advance our clinical pipeline, we will consider every opportunity in order to bring treatments to patients in need as quickly as possible. We have identified many more additional indications for ‘1805 and ‘1104, and we are always willing to discuss partnerships as we explore the endless potential of these platform programs.</em></p>

63705,PharmaShots Interview: Rain Therapeutic's Avanish Vellanki Shares Insight on the Initiation of P-III MANTRA Trial of Milademetan for Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma,"
<p>In an interview with <strong>PharmaShots, Avanish Vellanki, CEO and Cofounder at Rain Therapeutics </strong>shared his views on the initiation of the P-III MANTRA trial to evaluate the safety &amp; efficacy of Milademetan for dedifferentiated liposarcoma and provide updates about the company's lead candidate, RAIN-32. </p>



<p><strong>Shots: </strong></p>



<ul><li>The company initiates P-III MANTRA trial to evaluate safety &amp; efficacy of milademetan vs trabectedin in a ratio (1:1) in 160 patients with unresectable or metastatic DD LPS with or without WD LPS that have progressed on one or more prior systematic therapies including at least 1 anthracycline-based therapy</li><li> The 1EPs of a trial is PFS, as assessed by blinded independent review &amp; 2EPs, include OS, ORR, DoR, DCE &amp; investigator-assessed PFS along with safety &amp; PRO’s</li><li> The company also provides patients update continuing to receive RAIN-32 as monothx. from the previously completed P-I dose-escalation &amp; expansion study. Additionally, the therapy has received FDA’s ODD for LPS</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>Discuss the design of the P-III MANTRA study for DDLPS.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>The MANTRA trial (NCT04979442) is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registrational study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milademetan compared to trabectedin, a current standard of care in patients with unresectable or metastatic de-differentiated (DD) liposarcoma (LPS) with or without a well-differentiated (WD) LPS component that has progressed on one or more prior systematic therapies, including at least one anthracycline-based therapy.</em></p>



<p><em>Approximately 160 patients are expected to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive milademetan &nbsp;or trabectedin. The primary objective of the trial is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review between the milademetan treatment arm and the trabectedin control arm. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and patient-reported outcomes.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: </strong><strong>What makes milademetan unique? Discuss it on behalf of its MoA and other features.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>Milademetan is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) which is oncogenic in numerous cancers. MDM2 is a critical regulator of tumor protein 53 (p53), also known as the “guardian of the genome” because it regulates the cell cycle and is therefore essential for tumor suppression. If MDM2 is overexpressed, p53 can be inactivated, leading to tumor growth and cancer progression. MDM2 inhibition by, milademetan may lead to the reactivation of p53, which can then resume its role in controlling cancer growth. In contrast to many prior generation MDM2 inhibitors, we believe milademetan does not exhibit material drug accumulation in tissues and therefore enabled an optimal dose schedule for efficacy and safety.&nbsp; We believe that a rationally designed dosing schedule in the prior clinical trial takes advantage of these properties of milademetan to demonstrate a potentially more favorable efficacy and safety versus competing for MDM2 programs.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Milademetan received U.S. Food and Drug Administration orphan drug designation for patients with LPS and has already demonstrated antitumor activity in an MDM2-amplified subtype of LPS and other solid tumors in Phase 1 clinical trial, potentially validating a rationally designed dosing schedule to mitigate safety concerns and widen the therapeutic window of MDM2 inhibition.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: What are your other plans with milademetan? Are you planning to explore its potential in other indications as well?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>In addition to the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating milademetan in patients with LPS, we anticipate exploring several other MDM2-dependent tumors as a monotherapy, as well as a multitude of tumors with wild-type p53 in combination with other agents, leveraging the safety profile of milademetan. In the near term, we plan to commence a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors in the second half of 2021 and a Phase 2 trial in intimal sarcoma by early 2022.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: Share the details about DDLPS with our readers. Discuss its epidemiology and symptoms.</strong> <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>WD and DD LPS are two of the four subtypes comprising LPS, and together account for two-thirds of the overall LPS population.&nbsp; WD LPS is less aggressive and tends to be a large painless mass found in deeper tissues, however, DD LPS is more aggressive, arising from WD LPS, and is usually found in the tissue behind the abdominal area or the extremities. Both WD and DD LPS exhibit amplification of the MDM2 gene with nearly a 100% frequency, and hence are rational opportunities for treatment with MDM2 inhibition.</em></p>



<p><em>The incidence of LPS is estimated at approximately 3,000 patients annually in the U.S. for which there are few effective treatment options with WD and DD LPS comprising about two-thirds of the total LPS population.<sup>1</sup> While the symptoms of LPS depend on where the tumor is located, patients may at first notice a new or growing lump that may be painful.<sup>2</sup></em><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: Do you feel competition in this space? If yes, who are they and how will milademetan create a difference with others?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>We believe we are leaders within the space given an ongoing Phase 3 pivotal study in DD LPS with an efficacy and safety profile from prior clinical studies that differentiate us from others.&nbsp; We believe milademetan could be the best-in-class MDM2 inhibitor. We intend to leverage the unique therapeutic window differences of milademetan versus the other programs by embarking on a broad and extensive clinical development program.&nbsp; We believe additional clinical studies will help to highlight the potential of milademetan across various MDM2-dependent and wildtype TP53 tumors.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: What makes you work on precision medicine for patients suffering from cancer?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>The recent advancements in cancer research and drug development allow for an unprecedented degree of insight into the critical drivers of cancer growth and its associated signaling networks and vulnerabilities. Our vision is to help cancer patients live life to the fullest. To make this a reality, we have assembled a relentless team who is unshaken by obstacles, fiercely aware that someone needs us now, and is committed to harnessing tumor biology to develop vanguard therapies to treat patients.</em></p>



<p><em>Overall, the Rain strategy is aimed at giving patients and their families their lives back. Finding new targeted treatment options for these patients is the essence of our work and patients are our inspiration. Patients guide our development of new treatment options that have the potential to be not only more effective but also preserve the quality of life. It is our ultimate goal to provide patients with effective treatment options that are not characterized by the unwanted side effects that are so common with most cancer treatments.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: Are you open to collaborations to offer precision therapies to more patients?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>We are always open to new collaborations to advance our precision oncology pipeline with partners that share our mission of developing and implementing innovative precision medicine strategies for patients suffering from cancer, and their families.</em></p>



<p><strong>Tuba: What are the company’s near-term plans? Share your achievements with our readers.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Avanish: </strong><em>In addition to the recent initiation of our Phase 3 MANTRA clinical trial, we recently provided an update from the Phase 1 dose-escalation</em> and expansion study evaluating milademetan across four-dose<em> schedules in patients with LPS, solid tumors or lymphomas.&nbsp;As of July 1, 2021, three WD/DD LPS patients received therapy with milademetan monotherapy for greater than 51 months. Further, we completed an initial public offering for Rain in April of this year that enables meaningful capital support to generate data for milademetan across a variety of MDM2-dependent tumor indications. We also plan to commence a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors in the second half of 2021 and a Phase 2 trial in intimal sarcoma by early 2022.</em></p>



<p><em>We look forward to collaborating with several partners and hope to present results from our ongoing research for milademetan and the RAD52 program at upcoming conferences.</em></p>
