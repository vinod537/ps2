Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance and commercial launch for the SelectSite(TM) C304-HIS deflectable catheter system for use in procedures involving His-bundle pacing (HBP).
The SelectSite C304-HIS deflectable catheter system features a deflectable, out-of-plane curve to reach the bundle of His and is designed to enable enhanced range maneuverability, fixation and implant success for a wider range of patient anatomies. Its adjustable form helps accommodate and secure the pacing lead in more challenging anatomies, including patients with a large right atrium.
""Pacing at the bundle of His is a promising procedure with a growing body of clinical evidence,"" said Pugazhendhi Vijayaraman, M.D., director of electrophysiology at Geisinger Heart Institute in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. ""The C304-HIS catheter's adjustable curve design should help implanters reach the His bundle fibers more easily and accommodate a variety of patient anatomies.""
The new catheter system facilitates placement of the Medtronic SelectSecure(TM) MRI SureScan(TM) Model 3830 cardiac pacing lead, the only pacing lead on the U.S. market approved for HBP. His-bundle pacing is a physiologic alternative to right ventricular pacing, in which a pacing lead is placed at or near the bundle of His, using the heart's native His-Purkinje conduction system to restore the heart's normal rhythm.
""There is a growing trend of physicians interested in His-bundle pacing for certain patients as it leverages the native conduction system,"" said Rob Kowal, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer, vice president of medical affairs in the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. ""Medtronic is pleased to continue to lead the industry with product innovations and training to support this emerging therapy technique.""

<span class=""xn-location"">ARITAN, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">May 29, 2019</span>  -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson today announced the publication of data from the randomized, open-label <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2479378-1&amp;h=2076132170&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT02252172&amp;a=Phase+3+MAIA+(MMY3008)"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Phase 3 MAIA (MMY3008)</a> study that showed DARZALEX® (daratumumab) plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) resulted in a significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).1 These data were published <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2479378-1&amp;h=3158562426&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa1817249%3Fquery%3Dfeatured_home&amp;a=today"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">today</a> in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.
""We continue to see scientific evidence through Phase 3 studies that support the use of daratumumab in combination with standard of care regimens,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Thierry Facon</span>, M.D., Service des Maladies du Sang, Hôpital Claude Huriez, <span class=""xn-location"">Lille, France</span>, MAIA investigator and author of the study. ""As multiple myeloma can become more complex at each relapse, it is important to select an optimal upfront therapy. Results from the MAIA study suggest that this daratumumab combination therapy should be considered for patients with multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible upon diagnosis.""
Results from the MAIA study demonstrated that at a median follow-up of 28 months, DARZALEX, in combination with Rd, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 44 percent in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for ASCT, compared to treatment with Rd alone (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-0.73; p&lt;0.001).1 The median PFS for DARZALEX-Rd has not yet been reached, compared to 31.9 months for patients who received Rd alone.1 The overall response rate (ORR) was 92.9 percent in the DARZALEX-Rd arm versus 81.3 percent in the Rd arm (p&lt;0.001).1 The addition of DARZALEX resulted in near-doubling of complete response (CR) or better (47.6 percent vs. 24.9 percent).1 In the MAIA study, treatment with DARZALEX-Rd resulted in a greater than threefold rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity compared to Rd alone (24.2 percent vs. 7.3 percent).1 All patients with MRD-negative status also had a response of CR or better.1 Patients who achieved MRD negativity demonstrated longer PFS than patients who remained MRD-positive, regardless of study treatment.1
The safety of DARZALEX in combination with Rd in this patient population was consistent with previously reported studies.1 The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) (&gt;10 percent) in the DARZALEX-Rd arm compared to Rd alone were neutropenia (50.0 percent vs. 35.3 percent), lymphopenia (15.1 percent vs. 10.7 percent), pneumonia (13.7 percent vs. 7.9 percent), anemia (11.8 vs. 19.7 percent) and leukopenia (11.0 percent vs. 4.9 percent), respectively.1 AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were less frequent in the DARZALEX-Rd group than with Rd alone (7.1 percent vs. 15.9 percent, respectively), despite the higher rate of neutropenia and pneumonia in the DARZALEX-Rd arm.1 There were fewer patients who discontinued the study treatment due to infections in DARZALEX-Rd versus Rd alone (0.5 percent vs. 1.4 percent, respectively).1 DARZALEX-associated infusion-related reactions (IRR) were reported in 40.9 percent of patients (2.7 percent were Grade 3 or 4); there were no Grade 5 events.1 One patient discontinued treatment with DARZALEX after an IRR.1
""The MAIA study findings demonstrate a consistent and clinically meaningful treatment effect when DARZALEX is incorporated into standard backbone regimens, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, for the initial treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Craig Tendler</span>, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Development and Global Medical Affairs, Oncology, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""We have submitted applications to global health authorities in support of the MAIA data and look forward to working with regulators in the hope of bringing a new combination regimen to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma.""
<u>About the MAIA Trial</u>1<br class=""dnr"" />The randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study included 737 newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT aged 45 – 90 years old (median age of 73). Patients were randomized to receive either DARZALEX-Rd or Rd alone in 28-day cycles. In the DARZALEX-Rd treatment arm, patients received DARZALEX 16 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) IV weekly for cycles 1 – 2, every two weeks for cycles 3 – 6 and every 4 weeks for cycle 7 and thereafter. Patients in the DARZALEX-Rd and Rd treatment arms received 25 mg of lenalidomide on days 1 – 21 of each 28-day cycle, and dexamethasone at 40 mg once a week for each cycle. Patients in both treatment arms continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
About DARZALEX® (daratumumab) <br class=""dnr"" />DARZALEX® (daratumumab), the first CD38-directed antibody approved anywhere in the world, is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma.2 CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.3 DARZALEX binds to CD38 and inhibits tumor cell growth causing myeloma cell death.2 DARZALEX may also have an effect on normal cells.2 DARZALEX is being evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development program across a range of treatment settings in multiple myeloma, such as in frontline and relapsed settings.4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess its potential in other malignant and pre-malignant hematologic diseases in which CD38 is expressed, such as smoldering myeloma.12,13

About Multiple Myeloma<br class=""dnr"" />Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.19,20 When damaged, these plasma cells rapidly spread and replace normal cells with tumors in the bone marrow.19,20 In 2019, it is estimated that 32,110 people will be diagnosed, and 12,960 will die from the disease, in the U.S.21 While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood counts, tiredness, high calcium levels, kidney problems or infections.22
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION2
CONTRAINDICATIONS<br class=""dnr"" />DARZALEX® is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS<br class=""dnr"" />Infusion Reactions – DARZALEX® can cause severe and/or serious infusion reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials, approximately half of all patients experienced an infusion reaction. Most infusion reactions occurred during the first infusion and were grade 1-2. Infusion reactions can also occur with subsequent infusions. Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4 hours of completing an infusion. Prior to the introduction of post-infusion medication in clinical trials, infusion reactions occurred up to 48 hours after infusion. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension.
Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion.
To reduce the risk of delayed infusion reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX® infusions. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Interference with Serological Testing – Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion.
Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient's serum. The determination of a patient's ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX®. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX®.
Neutropenia – DARZALEX® may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. DARZALEX® dose delay may be required to allow recovery of neutrophils. No dose reduction of DARZALEX® is recommended. Consider supportive care with growth factors.
Thrombocytopenia – DARZALEX® may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. DARZALEX® dose delay may be required to allow recovery of platelets. No dose reduction of DARZALEX® is recommended. Consider supportive care with transfusions.
Interference with Determination of Complete Response – Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
Adverse Reactions – The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence =20%) in clinical trials were: infusion reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, muscle spasms, arthralgia, back pain, pyrexia, chills, dizziness, insomnia, cough, dyspnea, peripheral edema, peripheral sensory neuropathy and upper respiratory tract infection.

Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Osaka, Japan; Representative Director, President and CEO: Hiroshi Nomura; hereinafter “Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma”) today signed a co-promotion and sales collaboration agreement with Novartis Pharma K.K. (Head Office: Tokyo, Japan; Representative Director, President and CEO: Kazunari Tunaba; hereinafter “NPKK”) for Equa® 50mg tablets (generic name: vildagliptin; hereinafter “Equa”), a selective DPP-4 inhibitor, and EquMet® combination LD/HD tablets (generic name: vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride combination tablets; hereinafter “EquMet”), a selective DPP-4 inhibitor/biguanide combination agent, both of which are currently indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan.
With the execution of this agreement, starting from July 1, 2019, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will jointly carry out activities to promote Equa and EquMet to healthcare professionals in Japan, in concert with NPKK. Additionally, from November 1, 2019, while the two companies will continue co-promotion, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will become the sole distributor of Equa and EquMet, receiving supplies of both products from NPKK.
Equa is a selective DPP-4 inhibitor that increases the concentration of active GLP-1, which enhances insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. EquMet was launched as the first selective DPP-4 inhibitor/biguanide combination tablets launched in the Japanese market. The combined sales of the two drugs were approximately ¥50.0 billion in fiscal 2018 (NHI price base).
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma positions diabetes as one of its focus areas in the Japanese market, and currently commercializes several drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, each with different mechanisms of action. Through the execution of this agreement, Equa and EquMet can now be added to its lineup, helping Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma strive contributing to the treatment of a greater number of diabetes patients in Japan. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma will make upfront payment under the terms of the agreement. It will record payments received from NPKK for the promotion of these products as revenue from July 1, 2019, and the sales of these products as revenue from November 1, 2019.
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma is currently evaluating the potential impact of this agreement on business results for the fiscal year ending March 2020 and will promptly announce any material information requiring disclosure. Financial goals for fiscal 2022, which were announced in conjunction with the Mid- 2 term Business Plan in April 2019, include consideration of a certain amount of contribution from marketing alliances. In addition, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma expects that the agreement announced today will contribute to the attainment of the annual revenue goal of ¥200 billion during the period of the next Mid-term Business Plan (fiscal 2023—2027).
?About Equa? Equa is a DPP-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (including any oral hypoglycemic or insulin preparation) that, by increasing the concentration of active GLP-1, stimulates the secretion of insulin and inhibits glucagon secretion to enable effective long-term control of blood sugar levels. The product was launched by NPKK in Japan on April 16, 2010 as Equa® 50mg tablets. On a drug price basis, sales in 2018 were ¥24.9 billion.
?About EquMet? EquMet was the first DPP-4 inhibitor and biguanide combination agent launched in Japan that demonstrated effective lowering of blood sugar levels, combining a DPP-4 inhibitor to stimulate insulin secretion with biguanide to improve insulin resistance through separate mechanisms. The product was launched by NPKK in Japan in November 2015 as EquMet® compound tablets LD/HD. On a drug price basis, sales in 2018 were ¥25.1 billion.

</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today the release of NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0, the first collaboration product from our partnership with GE Healthcare. Incorporating medical image viewing and storage capabilities with other patient data, the product enables tumour boards - multi-disciplinary teams who determine treatment plans for cancer patients - to have a more comprehensive view of each patient in one place.
Bringing together patient medical records from various systems for review by tumour boards can be time-consuming and cumbersome. The integration of GE Healthcare’s medical image viewer into NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0 enables radiologists to upload their patient records to the same dashboard where patient files from other disciplines in the cancer care team are stored. Having complete patient diagnostic information in one location helps specialists use the limited time they have during tumour boards to review all relevant files quickly and align on the best possible treatment plan for each cancer patient.
“This new version of NAVIFY Tumor Board is the first product developed in partnership with GE Healthcare and demonstrates our shared vision of accelerating personalised healthcare,” said Michael Heuer, CEO Roche Diagnostics. “Our mutual focus is on delivering clinical decision support solutions that enable healthcare professionals to make faster, more confident decisions, allowing more personalized treatment based on truly integrated diagnostics.”
“We are delighted to announce the first major milestone of our ongoing collaboration with Roche, as we work together to enable precision healthcare. Workflows around tumour boards can be inefficient, and we hope this single, holistic dashboard - including patient data and images - will enable oncology teams to align more quickly on the most optimal diagnosis and treatment plan for the benefit of each patient,” said Tom McGuinness, President and CEO, GE Healthcare Imaging.
The partnership combines Roche expertise in advanced lab testing and the GE Healthcare leadership in medical imaging and monitoring to provide an ecosystem of workflow solutions and apps on an industry-first shared integrated diagnostics platform. The companies are aiming to design products to enable seamless integration and analysis of comprehensive lab and medical imaging data, patient records, medical best practice, real time monitoring and the latest research outcomes. Clinicians will then have confidence that they are making the best possible treatment decision for each patient.
The new version of NAVIFY Tumor Board is initially available in the United States and Canada with additional markets to follow in the near future.
<h3>About the NAVIFY Decision Support portfolio</h3>

<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Survival Benefit Now Observed with KEYTRUDA in Combination with Chemotherapy in All Patient Populations (Regardless of PD-L1 Expression) and with KEYTRUDA Monotherapy in Patients Whose Tumors Expressed PD-L1 at CPS =1</b></p>
<p class=""bwalignc""><b>Data Presented Today at 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting</b></p>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of the final analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Abstract #6000). Data include the first-time presentation of certain overall survival (OS) hypotheses from the KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy study arm based on PD-L1 expression and the KEYTRUDA monotherapy study arm in the total patient population. Results of an interim analysis were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2018 Congress and demonstrated superior OS outcomes for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in the total population and KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with Combined Positive Score (CPS) =20 and CPS =1 compared with the EXTREME regimen, the current standard of care.
“It is exciting to see the full results from this trial, which is the first study to show superior overall survival over the current standard of care known as the EXTREME regimen,” said Dr. Danny Rischin, director of the department of medical oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia. “Patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer have a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. These findings underscore the potential of KEYTRUDA monotherapy and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy to become important new treatment options.”
The new findings presented today from the final analysis showed that KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin plus 5-FU) reduced the risk of death by 40% in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with CPS=20, demonstrating significantly longer OS (14.7 months [95% CI, 10.3-19.3]) compared with the EXTREME regimen (cetuximab with carboplatin or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]), the current standard of care (11.0 months [95% CI, 9.2-13.0]) (HR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.45-0.82]; p=0.0004). For the dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), statistical significance was not achieved for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in the CPS=20 population compared with the EXTREME regimen (HR=0.73 [95% CI, 0.55-.97]; p=0.0162). New findings for the CPS =1 population showed KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by 35% in these patients, with significantly longer OS (13.6 months [95% CI, 10.7-15.5]) compared with the EXTREME regimen (10.4 months [95% CI, 9.1-11.7]) (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.80]; p&lt;0.0001). Per the sequential testing strategy, superiority for PFS was not tested in this population (HR=0.82 [95% CI, 0.67-1.00]). Results for OS with KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population were consistent with the previously presented interim analysis, where non-inferiority was demonstrated (HR=0.83 [95% CI, 0.70-0.99]; p=0.0199), with a median OS of 11.5 months (95% CI, 10.3-13.4) for KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population compared with 10.7 months (95% CI, 9.3-11.7) for the EXTREME regimen. There was no difference in PFS between KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the total population and the EXTREME regimen (HR=1.34 [95% CI, 1.13-1.59]).
“As a company, Merck is committed to advancing research in this challenging treatment setting through our expansive head and neck cancer clinical research program,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “The full data from KEYNOTE-048 illustrate the impact of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy as potential new first-line treatment options for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We would like to sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their involvement in KEYNOTE-048.”
As previously announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for a new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking approval for KEYTRUDA as monotherapy or in combination with platinum and 5-FU chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC based in part on data from the second interim analysis of KEYNOTE-048. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of June 10, 2019.
<b>Study Design and Additional Data from KEYNOTE-048 (Abstract #6000)</b>
KEYNOTE-048, a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, NCT02358031), evaluated KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy or KEYTRUDA monotherapy, compared with the EXTREME regimen, as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. The dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS. The secondary endpoints were PFS (at six months and 12 months), objective response rate (ORR) and time to deterioration in the Quality of Life Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scales of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire and Safety. Duration of response (DOR) was evaluated as part of a pre-specified exploratory analysis. The primary and secondary endpoints, as well as exploratory DOR analysis, were evaluated in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS =20 and CPS =1) and in the total population, based on a fixed sequential testing strategy. Data cutoff for the final analysis was Feb. 25, 2019; data cutoff for the previously presented second interim analysis was June 13, 2018. Details of the OS benefit observed at the final analysis are below:

<b>About Head and Neck Cancer</b>
Head and neck cancer describes a number of different tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that begin in the flat, squamous cells that make up the thin surface layer of the structures in the head and neck. Two substances that greatly increase the risk of developing head and neck cancer are tobacco and alcohol. It is estimated that there were more than 887,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and over 453,000 deaths from the disease worldwide in 2018. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated that there will be more than 65,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and over 14,000 deaths from the disease in 2019.
<b>About KEYTRUDA</b> <sup><b>®</b> </sup><b>(pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg</b>
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.
<b>KEYTRUDA</b> <sup><b>®</b> </sup><b>(pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing</b>
<i>Melanoma</i>
KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma with involvement of lymph node(s) following complete resection. The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with melanoma is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 12 months in patients without disease recurrence.
<i>Lung Cancer</i>
KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.
KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.
KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic NSCLC, and whose tumors express PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) =1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.
KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS =1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.
In NSCLC, the recommended dose of KEYTRUDA is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.
When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for the chemotherapy agents administered in combination with KEYTRUDA, as appropriate.

<strong>Company Announcement</strong>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><strong>U.S. FDA grants Priority Review for daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone as treatment for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplant</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>September 26, 2019 PDUFA date</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Copenhagen, Denmark; May 30, 2019 –</strong><strong> Genmab A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: GEN) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) granted a Priority Review for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the use of daratumumab (DARZALEX<sup>®</sup>) in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTd) as treatment for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). </strong>The sBLA was submitted by Genmab’s licensing partner, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), in March 2019. Priority Review is a U.S. FDA designation for drugs that treat a serious condition and may provide a significant improvement in safety or efficacy. The U.S. FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date of September 26, 2019 to take a decision on daratumumab in this indication. In August 2012, Genmab granted Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab.
The sBLA submission is based on data from the Phase III CASSIOPEIA study of daratumumab in combination with VTd as treatment for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are candidates for ASCT. The study is sponsored by the French Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) in collaboration with the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) and Janssen. Genmab announced topline results from the trial in October 2018 and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) accepted an abstract containing more complete data, submitted by Janssen, for oral presentation at the 2019 ASCO Annual meeting in June 2019.
“Thanks to the strong collaborative effort of IFM, HOVON and Janssen, should the U.S. FDA approve this sBLA, patients in the United States newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are eligible candidates for ASCT may one day also be able to include DARZALEX in combination with VTd in their treatment regimen,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.
<strong>About the CASSIOPEIA (MMY3006) study</strong>
This Phase III study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study, run by the French Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) in collaboration with the Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) and Janssen, including 1,085 newly diagnosed patients with previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma who are eligible for high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. In the first part of the study, patients were randomized to receive induction and consolidation treatment with daratumumab combined with bortezomib, thalidomide (an immunomodulatory agent) and dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) or bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone alone. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that achieve a stringent Complete Response (sCR). In the second part of the study, patients that achieved a response will undergo a second randomization to either receive maintenance treatment of daratumumab 16 mg/kg every 8 weeks for up to 2 years versus no further treatment (observation). The primary endpoint of this part of the study is progression free survival (PFS).
<strong>About multiple myeloma</strong>
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excess proliferation of plasma cells.<sup>1</sup> Multiple myeloma is the third most common blood cancer in the U.S., after leukemia and lymphoma.<sup>2</sup> Approximately 26,000 new patients were expected to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and approximately 13,650 people were expected to die from the disease in the U.S. in 2018.<sup>3</sup> Globally, it was estimated that 160,000 people were diagnosed and 106,000 died from the disease in 2018.<sup>4</sup>  While some patients with multiple myeloma have no symptoms at all, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms which can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.<sup>5</sup>
<strong>About DARZALEX</strong><sup>®</sup> <strong>(daratumumab)</strong>
DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> (daratumumab) intravenous infusion is indicated in the United States in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI); and as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent, or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.<sup>6</sup> DARZALEX is the first monoclonal antibody (mAb) to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) approval to treat multiple myeloma. DARZALEX is indicated in Europe in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; and as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a PI and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. The option to split the first infusion of DARZALEX over two consecutive days has been approved in both Europe and the U.S. In Japan, DARZALEX is approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Daratumumab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the CD38 molecule, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells.  Daratumumab triggers a person’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells, resulting in rapid tumor cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action and through immunomodulatory effects, in addition to direct tumor cell death, via apoptosis (programmed cell death).<sup>6,7,8,9,10</sup>
Daratumumab is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. under an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab from Genmab. A comprehensive clinical development program for daratumumab is ongoing, including multiple Phase III studies in smoldering, relapsed and frontline multiple myeloma settings and in amyloidosis.  Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess the potential of daratumumab in other malignant and pre-malignant diseases, such as NKT-cell lymphoma, B and T-ALL.  Daratumumab has received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations

<b>Basel, June 3, 2019</b> <b>- </b>Novartis today announced positive topline data from two phase III, multicenter studies evaluating omalizumab (Xolair<sup>®</sup>) for the treatment of adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who have not adequately responded to standard-of-care (intranasal corticosteroids). Omalizumab, an injectable biologic treatment designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE), met both co-primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints across both POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 phase III trials[1].
CRSwNP is the inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with the presence of nasal polyps on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity[3],[4],[5].
The co-primary endpoints of POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 were change from baseline in Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) and change from baseline in average daily Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) over 24 weeks[6],[7]. Omalizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in both of these co-primary outcomes[1]. Key secondary endpoints met include Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) for health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) for sense of smell, posterior and anterior rhinorrhea scores for post-nasal drip and runny nose respectively[1].
""We are very pleased with the initial outcomes from the POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 trials. This is an important and exciting milestone for Xolair, which continues to help thousands of people around the world with severe allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria,"" said John Tsai, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. ""The results from these pivotal studies provide further evidence of the role of IgE in several inflammatory and respiratory conditions. Xolair reduces the amount of free IgE and in this study substantially reduced the size of nasal polyps and associated symptoms that impact the quality of life for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.""
In the studies, omalizumab was generally well tolerated with overall adverse events rates comparable to those observed in previous phase III trials in patients with moderate and severe allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria[1].
""Although the disease is not visible, people with nasal polyps may have significantly impaired quality of life - especially those with asthma who have increased nasal obstruction and loss sense of smell, which can impact the them physically, socially and mentally,"" said Professor Claus Bachert, Upper Airways Research Laboratory, Clinics ENT-Department, University Hospital Ghent, Belgium. ""The results of these studies are an important step forward to improving the lives of these patients.""
Additional findings and detailed results of co-primary and secondary endpoints from these trials will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.
<b>About Xolair<sup>®</sup> (omalizumab)</b>
Xolair (omalizumab) is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimizes the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.
An injectable prescription medicine, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005. Xolair is approved for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair has over one million patient years of exposure. In addition, a liquid formulation of Xolair in pre-filled syringes has been approved in the EU and more than 10 countries outside of the EU, including Canada, the US, and Australia. The self-administration indication for Xolair in pre-filled syringes was also approved in the EU in 2018. In the US., Novartis and Genentech, Inc. work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Outside the US, Novartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs.
Xolair is being investigated for the treatment of adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) but is not approved in this indication anywhere in the world.
<b>About POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 </b>
POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 are replicate phase III studies designed to determine the efficacy and safety of omalizumab compared with placebo in adult patients with CRSwNP who have had an inadequate response to standard-of-care treatment. Both trials were randomized, multicenter, double-blind and placebo-controlled. POLYP 1 involved 138 patients and POLYP 2 involved 127 patients, with and without a history of surgery. The primary outcomes for both trials were change from baseline in average daily nasal congestion score at Week 24, and change from baseline in nasal polyp score to week 24.  Patients in the studies were administered either omalizumab or placebo by subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks[6],[7].
<b>About Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP)</b>
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is the inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with the presence of noncancerous lesions (nasal polyps) on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity[3],[4],[5]. It is possible to have a single polyp or several and the size of the polyps can vary from microscopic to several centimeters[8],[9]. Symptoms can include nasal blockage/obstruction, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure and reduction in or loss of smell[4]. CRSwNP is diagnosed by physical examination with endoscopy. The condition can be associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis and aspirin sensitivity[10].

News Summary:
? Isatuximab, an investigational anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, added to
pomalidomide and dexamethasone prolonged progression free survival by 5
months compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone (11.53 vs.
6.47 months, p=0.001, HR 0.596)
? Overall response rate significantly greater with isatuximab combination
therapy compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (60% vs. 35%,
p&lt;0.0001)
? First positive randomized Phase 3 trial to evaluate an antibody in combination
with pomalidomide and dexamethasone presented at this year’s ASCO
annual meeting
? European Medicines Agency accepted for review the Marketing Authorization
Application for isatuximab
Paris – June 2, 2019 – Pivotal Phase 3 ICARIA-MM trial results demonstrated that
isatuximab added to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (isatuximab combination
therapy) showed statistically significant improvements compared to pomalidomide and
dexamethasone (pom-dex) alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
(RRMM).
These findings were presented today at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago. Isatuximab is an investigational monoclonal antibody
that targets a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor of a plasma cell.
“Isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in an
impressive 40% reduction in the risk of progression or death compared to
pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone,” said Paul Richardson, MD, principal
investigator and clinical program leader and director of clinical research at the
Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “This
outcome is noteworthy because this trial included a particularly difficult-to-treat,
relapsed and refractory patient population that was, in my view, highly reflective
of real-world practice.”
Isatuximab combination therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in
progression free survival (HR 0.596, 95% CI 0.44-0.81, p=0.001), and the median
progression free survival was longer in the isatuximab combination therapy arm (11.53
months, 95% CI: 8.936 to 13.897) than pom-dex alone (6.47 months, 95% CI: 4.468 to
8.279).
Also of note, isatuximab combination therapy demonstrated a significantly greater overall
response rate, compared to pom-dex alone (60% vs. 35%, p&lt;0.0001). In additional
analyses, isatuximab combination therapy compared to pom-dex alone showed a
treatment benefit consistent across multiple subgroups, including patients 75 years and
older, patients with renal insufficiency, and patients who were refractory to lenalidomide.
The results presented above were based on an independent review committee
assessment.
In addition, the following results favored isatuximab combination therapy:
? Isatuximab combination therapy demonstrated significantly higher very good
partial response (VGPR) rate compared to pom-dex (31.8% vs. 8.5%,
respectively, p&lt;0.0001) and a longer duration of response compared to pom-dex
alone (median 13.27 months vs. 11.07 months, respectively). Among patients who
achieved a response, isatuximab combination therapy demonstrated faster
median time to first response compared to pom-dex alone (35 days vs. 58 days,
respectively).
? Time to next treatment was longer with isatuximab combination therapy compared
to pom-dex alone (median not reached vs. 9.1 months, HR=0.538).
? Data at the time of analysis showed a trend towards an overall survival benefit
associated with isatuximab combination therapy. Final data on overall survival will
be reported when available.
Adverse events (AEs) of Grade =3 were observed in 86.8% of isatuximab combination
therapy patients vs. 70.5% of pom-dex patients. Additionally, isatuximab combination
therapy compared to pom-dex showed: 7.2% vs. 12.8% of patients discontinued due to
AEs, respectively; 7.9% vs. 9.4% patients died due to AEs, respectively; infections of
Grade =3 were seen in 42.8% vs. 30.2% of patients, respectively; and Grade =3
neutropenia was seen in 84.9% (febrile 11.8%) vs. 70.1% (febrile 2.0%) of patients,
respectively. Infusion reactions were reported in 38.2% (2.6% grade 3-4) of isatuximab
combination therapy patients.
First Positive Phase 3 Trial of a Monoclonal Antibody in Combination with PomDex
ICARIA-MM is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multi-center trial evaluating
isatuximab in combination with pom-dex versus pom-dex alone in patients with RRMM.
The study enrolled 307 patients with RRMM across 96 centers spanning 24 countries.
Overall, patients had received a median of three prior lines of anti-myeloma therapies,
including at least two consecutive cycles of lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor
given alone or in combination.
During the trial, isatuximab was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of
10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks, then every other week for 28-day cycles in
combination with standard doses of pom-dex for the duration of treatment.
Topline results from ICARIA-MM were previously announced in February 2019.
Developing Isatuximab, a Monoclonal Antibody
Isatuximab is an investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting a specific epitope
on the CD38 receptor. It is designed to trigger multiple, distinct mechanisms of action that
are believed to directly promote programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and
immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on multiple myeloma
cells and is a cell surface receptor target for antibody-based therapeutics in multiple
myeloma and other malignancies. The clinical significance of these findings is under
investigation.
Isatuximab is being developed by Sanofi and is currently being evaluated in multiple
ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with currently available treatments across
the multiple myeloma treatment continuum.
In the second quarter of 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for
review the Marketing Authorization Application and Sanofi filed a Biologics License
Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), both for use of isatuximab
in combination with pom-dex for the treatment of certain patients with RRMM.
Isatuximab is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic
malignancies and solid tumors. Isatuximab is an investigational agent and its safety and
efficacy have not been evaluated by the U.S. FDA, the EMA, or any other regulatory
authority.
Multiple Myeloma Leads to Significant Disease Burden
Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy1
, affecting more
than 138,0002 people worldwide. Multiple myeloma results in significant disease burden.
Patients with multiple myeloma continue to relapse over time making it a difficult to treat
and incurable malignancy.

The significant extension in survival met the early efficacy stopping criteria at a pre-specified interim analysis following 192 deaths (median OS, not reached vs. 40.9 [95% CI: 37.8-NE] months; HR=0.712 [0.535-0.948]; p=0.00973). Overall survival rates in the intent-to-treat population (n=672) at 42 months were 70.2% for Kisqali combination therapy compared to 46.0% for endocrine therapy alone. At the time of data cut-off, 35% of women taking Kisqali combination therapy were continuing the treatment. No new safety signals were observed[1]. Kisqali is not indicated for use with tamoxifen.
""Overall survival benefit is considered the 'gold standard' in cancer trials but is challenging to achieve in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. MONALEESA-7 reached this important endpoint earlier than anticipated,"" said Sara Hurvitz, MD, Medical Director of the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Research Unit and Director of the Breast Cancer Clinical Trials Program at UCLA. ""Impactful results like these ribociclib findings are what we wish for in every clinical trial, and to achieve overall survival improvement in an incurable disease, like metastatic breast cancer, is truly an outstanding advancement for patients.""
Susanne Schaffert, Ph.D., CEO, Novartis Oncology, added, ""Kisqali is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to achieve statistically significant overall survival benefit in combination with endocrine therapy, and we are so proud to share these powerful data with the medical and patient community. These exciting results add to the proven efficacy and safety profile of Kisqali, solidify it as a standard of care for people living with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and inspire us to continue to reimagine medicine.""
Results from subgroup analyses showed that Kisqali plus an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated a 30.0% reduced risk of death compared to an aromatase inhibitor alone (median OS not reached vs. 40.7 months [37.4-NE]; HR=0.699 [0.501-0.976]), and Kisqali plus tamoxifen demonstrated a 20.9% reduced risk of death compared to tamoxifen alone (HR=0.791 [0.454-1.377])[1]. Kisqali is not indicated for use with tamoxifen.  In the MONALEESA-7 primary analysis, increase in QTcF was on average greater and equal to 10 milliseconds in people taking tamoxifen plus placebo compared those taking aromatase inhibitor and placebo[4].
""Kisqali has characteristics that make it distinct from other CDK4/6 inhibitors. For one, Kisqali shows especially strong inhibition against CDK4. In pre-clinical data, Kisqali is four- to five-fold more potent against CDK4 compared to CDK6. CDK4 is likely the dominant CDK in breast cancer and a pivotal driver of disease progression,"" said Jeff Engelman, MD, Global Head of Oncology Research, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research.
MJ DeCoteau, Executive Director of Rethink Breast Cancer, said, ""Younger women living with advanced breast cancer encounter unique challenges as they face an incurable illness at the prime of their lives - they may be students, new moms or just embarking on their careers.  Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women 20-59, so knowing an approved treatment has been proven to help them live longer is an outstanding advancement and provides new hope for women with this devastating disease.""
<b>About Kisqali<sup>®</sup> (ribociclib)</b>
Kisqali<sup>®</sup> (ribociclib) is the CDK4/6 inhibitor with the largest body of first-line clinical trial evidence demonstrating consistent and sustained efficacy compared to endocrine therapy alone[5]. Kisqali is the only targeted therapy, including CDK4/6 inhibitors, in combination with endocrine therapy to demonstrate significantly longer overall survival compared to endocrine therapy alone as initial endocrine-based treatment for advanced breast cancer in the MONALEESA-7 trial[5]. Overall survival follow-up is ongoing for the Phase III MONALEESA-2 and MONALEESA-3 trials.
Novartis is continuing to reimagine cancer by investigating Kisqali in early breast cancer. The NATALEE study is a Phase III clinical trial of Kisqali with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- early breast cancer being conducted in collaboration with Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO)[5].
Kisqali is approved for use in more than 75 countries around the world, including the United States and European Union member states. Kisqali was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 and by the European Commission (EC) in August 2017, as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on findings from the pivotal MONALEESA-2 trial. Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor was approved for the treatment of pre-, peri- or postmenopausal women as initial endocrine based therapy, and also indicated for use in combination with fulvestrant as both first- or second-line therapy in postmenopausal women by the FDA in July 2018 and by the EC in December 2018. Regulatory filings are underway with other health authorities worldwide[5].
Kisqali was developed by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) under a research collaboration with Astex Pharmaceuticals[5].
<b>About Novartis in Advanced Breast Cancer</b>
Novartis tackles breast cancer with superior science, collaboration and a passion for transforming patient care. We've taken a bold approach to our research by including patient populations often neglected in clinical trials, identifying new pathways or mutations that may play a role in disease progression and developing therapies that not only maintain, but also improve, quality of life for patients. Our priority over the past 30 years and today is to deliver treatments proven to improve and extend lives for those diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.
<b>Important Safety Information FROM THE KISQALI EU SmPC </b>
KISQALI<sup>® </sup>(ribociclib) is a prescription medicine approved  in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine - based therapy in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer or fulvestrant as initial endocrine - based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It is not known if KISQALI is safe and effective in children or adolescents. KISQALI can cause a heart problem known as QT prolongation. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and may lead to death. KISQALI is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen due to an increased risk of QT prolongation. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a change in their heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if they feel dizzy or faint. KISQALI can cause serious liver problems. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they get any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea-colored) urine, feeling very tired, loss of appetite, pain on the upper right side of the stomach area (abdomen), and bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking KISQALI and may result in infections that may be severe. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before taking KISQALI, patients should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant as KISQALI can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant and who take KISQALI should use highly effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of KISQALI. Do not breastfeed during treatment with KISQALI and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of KISQALI. Patients should tell their health care provider about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements since they may interact with KISQALI. Patients should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking KISQALI. The most common side effects (incidence &gt;=20%) include infections, white blood cell count decreases, headache, cough, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, hair loss and rash. The most common Grade 3/4 side effects (incidence &gt;5%) were infections, low neutrophils, low leukocytes, low red blood cells, abnormal liver function tests, low lymphocytes, low phosphate levels and vomiting. Abnormalities were observed in hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests.

</ul>
<b>Basel, June 3, 2019</b> <b>-</b> Novartis announced today new data and clinical trial updates in NSCLC at the ASCO 2019 Annual Meeting. This includes primary efficacy results from the GEOMETRY <i>mono-1</i> Phase II clinical trial demonstrating that investigational MET inhibitor capmatinib (INC280) shows promise as a potential treatment option for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that harbor MET exon-14 skipping mutation. There are currently no approved targeted therapies to treat this particularly aggressive form of NSCLC. Results of the Phase II study will be presented at an oral session today at ASCO, June 3, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. CDT (Abstract #9004)[1].
GEOMETRY <i>mono-1</i> is an international, prospective, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating 97 adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon-14 skipping mutation who received capmatinib tablets 400 mg orally twice daily. Primary efficacy results among treatment-naive patients (Cohort 5b: 28 patients) were a 68% overall response rate (ORR) based on the Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) assessment per RECIST v1.1 (95% CI: (47.6 - 84.1)). Forty-one percent of previously treated NSCLC patients (Cohort 4: 69 patients) also responded (95% CI: (28.9 - 53.1)). Data on median duration of response (DOR), a key secondary endpoint, was 11.14 months (95% CI: (5.55 - NE)) and 9.72 months (95% CI: (5.55 - 12.98)), respectively. Intracranial activity in 54% (n=7/13) of patients, including some cases of complete resolution of brain lesions, was also observed by ad hoc neuro-radiologist review in patients with brain lesions. All results were based on independent assessment by the BIRC, and all tumor CT scans were evaluated in parallel by two radiologists to confirm the response.
The most common treatment related adverse events (AE) (&gt;=10% all grades) across all cohorts (n=334), were peripheral edema (42%), nausea (33%), creatinine increase (20%), vomiting (19%), fatigue (14%), decreased appetite (13%) and diarrhea (11%); the majority of the AEs were grades 1/2.
""New lung cancer treatment options are critical, as this deadly disease affects more than 2 million new patients around the world each year,"" said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. ""The GEOMETRY<i> mono-1</i> results are encouraging, and we look forward to discussing these results with health authorities with the hope of bringing this targeted treatment option to people with this aggressive type of lung cancer.""
<b><u>Capmatinib Granted Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designation Status</u></b>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently granted capmatinib Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon-14 skipping mutation with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Previously, both the U.S. FDA and Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency recognized capmatinib with Orphan Drug status. It is estimated that 3% to 4% of all patients with NSCLC have an identified MET mutation[3].
""The efficacy observed with capmatinib in the GEOMETRY <i>mono-1</i> trial is promising,"" said Juergen Wolf, MD, University Hospital, Cologne. ""In addition to positive overall response rate among first-line patients with the MET mutation, the duration for the responses, including the activity in the brain, and capmatinib's safety profile are important milestones for this patient population. As a group, patients with MET mutated NSCLC often require special clinical considerations, as they are generally older and with poor prognosis further limiting their treatment options.""
<b>About GEOMETRY <i>mono-1</i> </b>
GEOMETRY <i>mono-1</i> is an international, prospective, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent capmatinib (INC280) in adult patients with EGFR wildtype, ALK-negative rearrangement, advanced NSCLC harboring MET amplification and/or mutations. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon-14 skipping mutation (centrally confirmed) were assigned to Cohorts 4 (previously treated patients) or 5B (treatment-naive), regardless of MET amplification/gene copy number, and received 400 mg capmatinib tablets orally twice daily. The primary endpoint was ORR based on the BIRC assessment per RECIST v1.1. The key secondary endpoint was duration of response (DOR) by the BIRC. The GEOMETRY <i>mono-1 </i>study found an ORR in the treatment-naive patients (n=28) of 67.9% (95% CI: 47.6 - 84.1) and an ORR of 40.6% (95% CI: 28.9 - 53.1) in the previously treated patients (n=69). Median DOR was 11.14 months (95% CI: 5.55-NE) in treatment-naive patients and 9.72 months (95% CI: 5.55-12.98) in previously treated patients[1].
The most common treatment-related AEs included peripheral edema, nausea, creatinine increase and vomiting. Of patients treated with capmatinib, 84% experienced an AE, with 36% having grade 3/4 AEs (only 4.5% were Grade 4)[1].
Capmatinib (INC280) is an investigational, oral and selective MET inhibitor licensed to Novartis by Incyte Corporation in 2009. Under the Agreement, Incyte granted Novartis worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications.
<b>Studying Tumor-Promoting Inflammation in Lung Cancer - Ongoing CANOPY Trials</b>
Trials in Progress (TiP) updates on the CANOPY clinical program were also included in the ASCO updates. CANOPY is made up of three randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase III trials evaluating canakinumab (ACZ885), a selective IL-1ß inhibitor (Abstract #TPS9124) [4],[5].
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>CANOPY-A is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of canakinumab as adjuvant therapy in adult subjects with stages II-IIIA and NSCLC following complete surgical resection. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (Abstract #7013).</li>
 	<li>CANOPY-1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study investigating canakinumab versus placebo in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (CTx) and pembrolizumab in previously untreated patients with stage IIIB/IIC-IV squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. The study will evaluate the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 42 days of treatment, as well as PFS and overall survival (OS).</li>
 	<li>CANOPY-2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study investigating canakinumab or placebo plus docetaxel in stage IIIB-IV NSCLC patients previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, as well as CTx. The primary endpoints are incidence of DLT in the first 42 days of treatment and OS.</li>
</ul>
<b>Novartis Commitment to Lung Cancer</b>
Worldwide, lung cancer causes more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined, and more than 2 million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year[2]. Despite treatment advances, patients with NSCLC still have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. This includes the nearly 70% of NSCLC patients who have a genomic mutation that may be targeted with available therapies[6]. To determine the most appropriate treatment, medical organizations recommend genomic testing for patients with lung cancer[7].
Novartis Oncology's research has helped transform treatment approaches for patients living with NSCLC. Novartis continues its commitment to the global lung cancer community through ongoing studies, as well as the exploration of investigational compounds in NSCLC, including those that target genetic biomarkers and tumor promoting inflammation.

<b>Basel, June 3, 2019</b> <b>- </b>Novartis today announced positive topline data from two phase III, multicenter studies evaluating omalizumab (Xolair<sup>®</sup>) for the treatment of adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who have not adequately responded to standard-of-care (intranasal corticosteroids). Omalizumab, an injectable biologic treatment designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE), met both co-primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints across both POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 phase III trials[1].
CRSwNP is the inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with the presence of nasal polyps on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity[3],[4],[5].
The co-primary endpoints of POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 were change from baseline in Nasal Polyp Score (NPS) and change from baseline in average daily Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) over 24 weeks[6],[7]. Omalizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in both of these co-primary outcomes[1]. Key secondary endpoints met include Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) for health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) for sense of smell, posterior and anterior rhinorrhea scores for post-nasal drip and runny nose respectively[1].
""We are very pleased with the initial outcomes from the POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 trials. This is an important and exciting milestone for Xolair, which continues to help thousands of people around the world with severe allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria,"" said John Tsai, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. ""The results from these pivotal studies provide further evidence of the role of IgE in several inflammatory and respiratory conditions. Xolair reduces the amount of free IgE and in this study substantially reduced the size of nasal polyps and associated symptoms that impact the quality of life for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.""
In the studies, omalizumab was generally well tolerated with overall adverse events rates comparable to those observed in previous phase III trials in patients with moderate and severe allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria[1].
""Although the disease is not visible, people with nasal polyps may have significantly impaired quality of life - especially those with asthma who have increased nasal obstruction and loss sense of smell, which can impact the them physically, socially and mentally,"" said Professor Claus Bachert, Upper Airways Research Laboratory, Clinics ENT-Department, University Hospital Ghent, Belgium. ""The results of these studies are an important step forward to improving the lives of these patients.""
Additional findings and detailed results of co-primary and secondary endpoints from these trials will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.
<b>About Xolair<sup>®</sup> (omalizumab)</b>
Xolair (omalizumab) is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimizes the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade.
An injectable prescription medicine, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005. Xolair is approved for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair has over one million patient years of exposure. In addition, a liquid formulation of Xolair in pre-filled syringes has been approved in the EU and more than 10 countries outside of the EU, including Canada, the US, and Australia. The self-administration indication for Xolair in pre-filled syringes was also approved in the EU in 2018. In the US., Novartis and Genentech, Inc. work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Outside the US, Novartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs.
Xolair is being investigated for the treatment of adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) but is not approved in this indication anywhere in the world.
<b>About POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 </b>
POLYP 1 and POLYP 2 are replicate phase III studies designed to determine the efficacy and safety of omalizumab compared with placebo in adult patients with CRSwNP who have had an inadequate response to standard-of-care treatment. Both trials were randomized, multicenter, double-blind and placebo-controlled. POLYP 1 involved 138 patients and POLYP 2 involved 127 patients, with and without a history of surgery. The primary outcomes for both trials were change from baseline in average daily nasal congestion score at Week 24, and change from baseline in nasal polyp score to week 24.  Patients in the studies were administered either omalizumab or placebo by subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks[6],[7].
<b>About Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP)</b>
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is the inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with the presence of noncancerous lesions (nasal polyps) on the lining of the nasal sinuses or nasal cavity[3],[4],[5]. It is possible to have a single polyp or several and the size of the polyps can vary from microscopic to several centimeters[8],[9]. Symptoms can include nasal blockage/obstruction, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure and reduction in or loss of smell[4]. CRSwNP is diagnosed by physical examination with endoscopy. The condition can be associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis and aspirin sensitivity[10].

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Merck’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of ZERBAXA<sup>®</sup> (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for the treatment of patients 18 years and older with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: <i>Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, </i>and <i>Serratia marcescens</i>.<b> </b>The sNDA for ZERBAXA had previously been designated Priority Review status by the FDA.<b> </b>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.
This expanded use is based on results of the pivotal Phase 3 ASPECT-NP trial that compared ZERBAXA 3g (ceftolozane 2g and tazobactam 1g) intravenously every 8 hours to meropenem (1g intravenously every 8 hours) for 8 to 14 days for the treatment of adult patients with HABP/VABP.
ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to the components of ZERBAXA (ceftolozane/tazobactam), piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Additionally,<b> </b> <i>Clostridium difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA.<b> </b>See Important Safety Information below.
“Pneumonia in ventilated patients remains a significant clinical challenge and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality,” said Dr. Andrew Shorr, head of pulmonary, critical care and respiratory services, Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, D.C. “The need to cover diverse pathogens including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and certain Enterobacteriaceae adds to the challenge.”
According to a recent publication by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Consortium, ventilated patients with HABP have a higher rate of mortality (39%) than those with VABP (27%). In addition,<b> </b> <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is<i> </i>the most common Gram-negative pathogen in HABP/VABP and is becoming increasingly difficult to treat.
“We are grateful to all of the patients who participated in the studies which led to the approval of ZERBAXA for the treatment of HABP/VABP,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “This approval reflects Merck’s longstanding commitment to helping alleviate the burden of infectious diseases, including serious infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens.”
<b>Clinical Data Supporting Use of ZERBAXA (Ceftolozane and Tazobactam) in HABP/VABP</b>
A total of 726 adult patients hospitalized with HABP/VABP were enrolled in a multinational, double-blind study (NCT 02070757) comparing ZERBAXA 3g (ceftolozane 2g and tazobactam 1g) intravenously every 8 hours to meropenem (1g intravenously every 8 hours) for 8 to 14 days of therapy. All patients had to be intubated and on mechanical ventilation at randomization.
Efficacy was assessed based on all-cause mortality at Day 28 and clinical cure, defined as complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit which occurred 7 to 14 days after the end of treatment.<b> </b>The analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients.
Of the 726 patients in the ITT population, the median age was 62 years and 44% of the population was greater than or equal to 65 years of age, with 22% of the population greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The majority of patients were white (83%), male (71%) and were from Eastern Europe (64%). The median APACHE II score was 17 and 33% of patients had a baseline APACHE II score of greater than or equal to 20. All patients were on mechanical ventilation and 519 (71%) had VABP. At randomization, the majority of patients had been hospitalized for greater than or equal to 5 days (77%) and were in an ICU (92%), with 49% of patients ventilated for greater than or equal to 5 days. At baseline, 36% of patients had creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 80 mL/min. Of these, 14% had CrCl less than 50 mL/min.
Approximately 13% of patients were failing their current antibacterial drug therapy for HABP/VABP, and bacteremia was present at baseline in 15% of patients. Key comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at rates of 22%, 16% and 12%, respectively.
ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) was non-inferior to meropenem for 28-day all-cause mortality in the ITT population (all randomized patients), 24.0% (87/362) and 25.3% (92/364) respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 1.1 (stratified 95% CI: -5.13, 7.39; non-inferiority margin of 10%). In addition, ZERBAXA was non-inferior to meropenem for clinical response at Test-of-Cure (7-14 days after the end of therapy) in the ITT population, 54.4% (197/362) and 53.3% (194/364) respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 1.1 (stratified 95% CI: -6.17, 8.29; non-inferiority margin of 12.5%).
In the ventilated HABP sub-group, a favorable response for ZERBAXA in 28-day all-cause mortality was observed, 24.2% (24/99) for ZERBAXA and 37.0% (40/108) for meropenem, respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 12.8 (stratified 95% CI: 0.18, 24.75). In the VABP subgroup, 28-day all-cause mortality was 24.0% (63/263) for ZERBAXA and 20.3% (52/256) for meropenem, for a weighted proportion difference of -3.6 (stratified 95% CI: -10.74, 3.52).
Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or greater of patients receiving ZERBAXA in this study include hepatic transaminase increased 11.9% (43/361), renal impairment/renal failure 8.9% (32/361), diarrhea 6.4% (23/361), intracranial hemorrhage 4.4% (16/361), vomiting 3.3% (12/361), and <i>Clostridium difficile </i>colitis 2.8% (10/361). Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 1.1% (4/361) of patients receiving ZERBAXA and 1.4% (5/359) of patients receiving meropenem.
<b>Additional Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam)</b>
<b>Patients with changing renal function:</b> Dose adjustment is required for patients with CrCl 50 mL/min or less. All doses of ZERBAXA are administered over 1 hour. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly.
<b>Hypersensitivity:</b> ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to the components of ZERBAXA (ceftolozane/tazobactam), piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.
<i> <b>Clostridium difficile</b> </i> <b>-associated diarrhea (CDAD)</b>, ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against <i>C. difficile </i>should be discontinued, if possible.
<b>Development of drug-resistant bacteria:</b> Prescribing ZERBAXA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and risks the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
<b>Adverse Reactions:</b> The most common adverse reactions occurring in =5% of patients. in the HABP/VABP trial were increase in hepatic transaminases (11.9%), renal impairment/renal failure (8.9%) and diarrhea (6.4%).
<b>About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam)</b>
ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium.
ZERBAXA 3g dose (ceftolozane 2g and tazobactam 1g) is approved in the United States and is indicated for treatment of patients 18 years and older with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: <i>Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, </i>and <i>Serratia marcescens</i>.
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

British Columbia is improving the sustainability of its PharmaCare program by expanding the use of biosimilars, which will create opportunities for new drug listings and boost existing coverage for patients.
An immediate effect of this is the listing of Jardiance, a diabetes drug, as well as the psoriatic arthritis drug Taltz.
B.C. is following evidence-based results from a number of international jurisdictions that have over 10 years’ experience with these innovative drugs.
“B.C. is leading the country by promoting the widespread use of biosimilars, which have been proven to work just as safely and effectively as higher priced biologics. To date, Canada is far behind European jurisdictions,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Biosimilars are a necessary step to ensure PharmaCare provides existing coverage for more people and funds new drugs well into the future.”
Despite clear evidence to support the use of biosimilars – highly similar versions of biologics that cost anywhere from 25% to 50% less – Canada has a significantly lower use rate for biosimilars compared to other jurisdictions, at approximately 8%. Other nations have upwards of 50 to 95%.
Bioengineered drugs, known as biologics, collectively are the single biggest expense for public drug plans and their costs continue to climb. In 2018, B.C. spent $125 million on Lantus, Enbrel and Remicade, three biologic drugs that treat chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis and Crohn’s disease.
About 20,400 British Columbians living with either ankylosing spondylitis, diabetes, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis will have six months to work with their health-care team to transition their prescription from the biologic to the biosimilar drug by Nov. 25, 2019. After that time, PharmaCare will no longer provide coverage for the original biologic drug for these indications, except for exceptional cases.
“We know that our use rates can be much higher. For example, the biosimilars for infliximab (known as Inflectra and Remsima) have combined 5 to 10% use rate in Canada after four years on the market, compared to Norway (98%), United Kingdom (90%) and Scotland (85%). As a result, in 2017, Canada spent over $1.1 billion on the original biologic drug called Remicade,” added Dix.
B.C. consulted with a number of stakeholders on the transition to biosimilars and received support from prescribers and patient groups, such as the rheumatologists, the BC Society of Rheumatologists, endocrinologists, Doctors of BC, Arthritis Consumer Experts, Arthritis Society, BC Pharmacy Association, Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association, regional health authorities, Health Canada, CADTH, Patented Prices Medicine Review Board and the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance.
Roughly 2,700 Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis patients will also be transitioning to their biosimilar treatment option in the coming months. More information for gastroenterology patients will be available in summer 2019.
After the six-month transition period, PharmaCare will no longer provide coverage for the original biologic drug for these indications. By increasing the use of biosimilars, B.C. will save about $96.6 million over the first three years which will be redirected to support additional drug listings and improved patient coverage.
Effective May 27, Jardiance (empagliflozin) is now listed as a limited coverage benefit under PharmaCare. Jardiance is a type of drug known as an SGLT2 inhibitor and has been shown to be an effective treatment option to manage diabetes. Approximately 22,000 patients could stand to benefit from this listing, which will cost roughly $4.1 million this fiscal year and $18.9 million over three years.
The psoriatic arthritis drug Taltz (ixekizumab) is being added as a limited coverage benefit, and coverage criteria will be expanded for existing arthritis drugs to improve patient access. More information about improved coverage criteria is available on the PharmaCare website. These changes will help more British Columbians living with arthritis to find the treatment option that works best for them.
PharmaCare will also be broadening coverage for several drugs used for arthritis (i.e., DMARDs, certolizumab, leflunomide, rituximab, tocilizumab, and tofacitinib). These changes will improve patient access to these important medicines by, for example, reducing coverage pre-requirements and extending the coverage periods.
This is the latest major change to improve access to prescription drugs for British Columbians. In January 2019, B.C. made a $105-million investment over three years to reduce and/or eliminate deductibles and co-payments for lower-income British Columbians. This was the first change in the Fair Pharmacare deductible structure in 15 years.
As well, B.C. held a leading role in the national Generics 2.0 agreement to lower costs of the most commonly prescribed drugs, and actively participates in the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance to negotiate for lower drug costs for all Canadians. British Columbia will continue to work to make sure everyone can afford and receive the medication they need.
<strong>Quick Facts:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>B.C.’s move to biosimilars will focus on patients in the following therapeutic areas:
<ul>
 	<li>Rheumatology patients will transition from the entanercept biologic Enbrel to the biosimilar Brenzys or Erelzi;</li>
 	<li>Dermatology and rheumatology patients will transition from the infliximab biologic Remicade to the biosimilar Inflectra or Renflexis;</li>
 	<li>Endocrinology patients will transition from insulin glargine biologic Lantus to the biosimilar Basaglar; and</li>
 	<li>Gastrointestinal patients will transition from the infliximab biologic Remicade to the biosimilar Inflectra or Renflexis, with more information to come in the coming months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Exceptions may be granted for patients whose physicians determine they are medically unable to transition to the biosimilar drug. Exceptional coverage requests will be reviewed by PharmaCare’s Special Authority branch on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with physician-led advisory committees as needed.</li>
 	<li>First Nations Health Authority clients should consult with their health-care team, as PharmaCare coverage under the First Nations Health Benefits (Plan W) may differ.</li>

 	<li><strong>Compared with placebo, Xofluza treatment significantly reduced the likelihood of people developing influenza (flu) after exposure to an infected household member</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Data from the phase III BLOCKSTONE study will be submitted to health authorities globally</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the phase III BLOCKSTONE study, conducted by Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd., met its primary endpoint showing that people exposed to a household member with influenza (flu) and treated preventively with Xofluza<sup>™</sup> (baloxavir marboxil) were significantly less likely to develop the disease compared to those treated with placebo (1.9% versus 13.6%, p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, Xofluza was well tolerated with no safety signals identified. Full results from the BLOCKSTONE study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
“This positive phase III study adds to robust existing clinical data for Xofluza, and is the first to show that a single treatment with Xofluza reduced the likelihood that people living with an infected household member would develop flu,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Preventing otherwise healthy people from developing the flu virus will reduce the overall societal burden of disease, and we look forward to sharing these data with health authorities around the world.”
Xofluza is the first and only one-dose oral medicine approved to treat flu, and the first new flu medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action in nearly 20 years. Xofluza is also the only flu treatment with a new mechanism of action shown to be efficacious in both otherwise healthy people with the flu (in the CAPSTONE-1 study), and people at high risk of flu complications (in the CAPSTONE-2 study).<sup>1,2</sup>
Xofluza is currently approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza types A and B in children, adolescents and adults, and in the United States (US) for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in people 12 years of age and older. In addition, the FDA recently accepted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Xofluza as a one-dose oral treatment for people at high risk of complications from the flu, which includes adults 65 years of age or older, or those who have conditions such as asthma, chronic lung disease, morbid obesity or heart disease – for these people the flu can be particularly serious or deadly. The FDA is expected to decide on whether to approve this additional indication by 4 November 2019.
<h3>About BLOCKSTONE</h3>
BLOCKSTONE is a phase III, randomised, placebo-controlled, post-exposure prophylaxis study that evaluated a single dose of Xofluza compared with placebo in household members (adults and children) in Japan who are living with someone with an influenza infection confirmed by a rapid influenza diagnostic test (the ‘index patient’). The study was conducted by Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd. during the 2018-2019 flu season in Japan.
Participants enrolled in the study were household members of someone who had been diagnosed with influenza. The participants were randomised to receive a single dose of Xofluza (dose according to body weight) or placebo as a preventive measure against developing influenza. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the proportion of participants who tested positive for the influenza virus and had fever, and one or more respiratory symptoms between day one and ten.
Xofluza showed a significant prophylactic effect on influenza infection after a single oral dose in people exposed to an infected family member. The proportion of household members who became infected with flu was significantly lower in those treated preventively with Xofluza compared to those treated with placebo (proportion of subjects with influenza virus infection, fever and other influenza symptoms in the 10-day observation period: 1.9% versus 13.6%, p&lt;0.0001). The incidence of adverse events was 22.2% and 20.5% in Xofluza and placebo respectively. No serious adverse events were reported for Xofluza. Secondary objectives were clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety and tolerability.
<h3>About Xofluza<sup>TM</sup> (baloxavir marboxil)</h3>
Xofluza is a first-in-class, one-dose oral medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action that has demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of influenza viruses, including in vitro activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1) in non-clinical studies.<sup>3,4</sup> Unlike other currently available antiviral treatments, Xofluza is the first in a new class of antivirals designed to inhibit the cap-dependent endonuclease protein, which is essential for viral replication.<sup>3</sup>
Xofluza is being further studied in a phase III development programme, including paediatric populations and severely ill, hospitalised people with influenza, as well as to assess the potential to reduce transmission in otherwise healthy people.
Xofluza was discovered by Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd. and is being further developed and commercialised globally in collaboration with the Roche Group (which includes Genentech in the US) and Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd. Under the terms of this agreement, Roche holds worldwide rights to Xofluza excluding Japan and Taiwan, where rights will be retained exclusively by Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd.
<h3>About Roche in influenza</h3>
Influenza, or flu, is one of the most common, yet serious, infectious diseases, representing a significant threat to public health. Globally, annual epidemics result in 3 to 5 million cases of severe disease, millions of hospitalisations and up to 650,000 deaths worldwide.<sup>5,6,7,8,9</sup> In the US alone, the total economic burden of the flu is estimated to be $11.2 billion annually through reduced productivity and healthcare costs.<sup>10</sup> Roche has a long heritage in developing medicines that contribute to public health. We are committed to bringing innovation in the field of infectious diseases, including influenza. Tamiflu<sup>®</sup> (oseltamivir) has made a significant difference both to the treatment of seasonal influenza as well as in the management of recent pandemics, and we are proud to have brought this innovative medicine to patients. Although vaccines are an important first line of defence in preventing flu, there is a need for new medical options for prophylaxis and treatment. Current antiviral drugs have limitations with respect to efficacy, convenience of dosing, and resistance. Roche is committed to addressing the unmet need in this area through its agreement with Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialise Xofluza.
<h3>About Roche in infectious disease</h3>

<em><strong>Data Presented at European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Congress</strong></em>
</div>
<div class=""mainBody"">
<b>OSAKA, Japan, June 3, 2019 –</b> Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://www.takeda.com/investors/"">TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK</a>) (“Takeda”) today announced new data from an ad-hoc analysis of the Phase 3 HELP Study™, designed to evaluate the onset of action for TAKHZYRO<sup>®</sup> (lanadelumab) during days 0-69 of treatment. The analysis suggests that TAKHZYRO starts to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks during this early treatment phase, with patients experiencing an 80.1% decrease in mean monthly attack rate compared to placebo. The results were presented today (PD0369) during the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Congress in Lisbon, Portugal. HAE is a rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening disorder that can result in recurrent attacks of oedema (swelling) in various parts of the body.
“The unpredictable nature of HAE attacks makes living with the disease physically and emotionally challenging for patients,” said Professor Marcus Maurer, M.D., Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Allergie-Centrum-Charité, Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. “HAE requires an individualised approach to treatment, and it is important that a patient’s treatment plan helps reduce the frequency of attacks. These results are exciting as they suggest that lanadelumab begins to prevent HAE attacks during the initial phase of treatment.”
The ad-hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of TAKHZYRO compared with placebo during days 0-69 of treatment using the same approach that was used to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints during the complete study period (days 0-182). Results from the analysis showed that in patients receiving the recommended starting dose of TAKHZYRO 300 mg every two weeks, there was a significant reduction in mean monthly attack rate (80.1% decrease) compared to placebo (Adjusted P&lt;0.001). During this initial treatment phase, patients treated with TAKHZYRO 300 mg every two weeks also experienced fewer severe attacks compared to placebo (7.4% vs. 22%) and were more likely to be HAE attack-free compared to those on placebo (48.1% vs. 7.3%).
“Original data from the HELP Study showed that TAKHZYRO was effective in preventing HAE attacks over the entire duration of the study and, according to an exploratory analysis, many patients remained attack-free during the 16-week steady state period,” said Donatello Crocetta, M.D., Franchise Global Medical Unit Head, Rare Immunology and HAE at Takeda. “This new analysis supports previous study findings and builds on our understanding of how quickly TAKHZYRO can begin to help prevent HAE attacks, further supporting its use for appropriate patients as a preventive therapy that can be administered subcutaneously and begins to work rapidly.”
Across all TAKHZYRO treatment arms, (300 mg every two weeks, 300 mg every four weeks, 150 mg every four weeks), there was an improvement in mean monthly attack rate, monthly rate of moderate to severe attacks, monthly rate of attacks requiring acute treatment and the number of attack-free days, versus placebo, during the entire study period.
The most commonly observed adverse reactions (52.4%) associated with TAKHZYRO were injection site reactions. Of these, 97% were of mild intensity. Hypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was observed (1.2%).<sup>1</sup>
TAKHZYRO 300 mg is approved in the European Union and Australia for the routine prevention of recurrent attacks of HAE in patients aged 12 years and older. TAKHZYRO 300 mg is approved as prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE in patients aged 12 years and older in the United States and for the routine prevention of attacks in patients aged 12 years and older in Canada.
<b>The HELP Study™
</b>The HELP (Hereditary Angioedema Long-term Prophylaxis) Study™ was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered TAKHZYRO vs. placebo over 26 weeks in 125 patients 12 years of age or older with HAE.
The primary endpoint of the HELP Study™ was the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks over the entire 26-week study duration. TAKHZYRO demonstrated that subcutaneous injections every two or four weeks reduced the mean monthly number of attacks across all three TAKHZYRO treatment arms studies: 300 mg every two weeks, 300 mg every four weeks and 150 mg of TAKHZYRO every four weeks. At 300 mg every two weeks, TAKHZYRO reduced the number of mean monthly HAE attacks by 87% vs. placebo (Adjusted P&lt;0.001).
Secondary endpoints included: 1) number of attacks requiring acute treatment and 2) number of attacks assessed as moderate or severe. Overall, each TAKHZYRO treatment arm demonstrated statistically significant attack rate reductions compared with placebo for all secondary efficacy endpoints (Adjusted P&lt;0.001 for all comparisons), including: attacks requiring acute treatment (74% to 87%) and moderate or severe attacks (70% to 83%).
Complete results from the Phase 3 HELP Study™ were published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</i> on 27 November 2018.<sup>2</sup>
<b>About Hereditary Angioedema
</b>HAE is a rare genetic disorder that results in recurring attacks of oedema – swelling – in various parts of the body, including the abdomen, face, feed, genitals, hands and throat. The swelling can be debilitating and painful.<sup>3,4,5</sup> Attacks that obstruct the airways can cause asphyxiation and are potentially life-threatening.<sup>4,5</sup> HAE affects an estimated 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. It is often under-recognised, under-diagnosed and under-treated.<sup>3,6</sup>
<b>About TAKHZYRO<sup>®</sup> (lanadelumab)
</b>TAKHZYRO (lanadelumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and decreases plasma kallikrein activity. TAKHZYRO is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.
TAKHZYRO is formulated for subcutaneous administration and has a half-life of approximately two weeks in patients with HAE. TAKHZYRO is intended for the self-administration or administration by a caregiver, only after training by a healthcare professional.
<b>TAKHZYRO Safety Information for Europe
</b>Please consult the TAKHZYRO Summary Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing.
TAKHZYRO treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). TAKHZYRO may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training on SC injection technique by a healthcare professional.
<b>Contraindication
</b>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
<b>Warnings and Precautions
</b>Traceability: In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed. In case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, administration of TAKHZYRO must be stopped immediately and appropriate treatment must be initiated.
General: TAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks. In case of a breakthrough HAE attack, individualized treatment should be initiated with an approved rescue medication. There are no available clinical data on the use of lanadelumab in HAE patients with normal C1-INH activity.
Interference with coagulation test: Lanadelumab can increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of lanadelumab with the aPTT assay. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic coagulation through the activation of plasma kallikrein in the contact system. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein by lanadelumab can increase aPTT in this assay. None of the increases in aPTT in patients treated with TAKHZYRO were associated with abnormal bleeding adverse events. There were no differences in international normalised ratio (INR) between treatment groups.
Sodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.
<b>Interactions
</b>No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on the characteristics of lanadelumab, no pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered medicinal products is expected.
As expected, concomitant use of the rescue medication C1 esterase inhibitor results in an additive effect on lanadelumab-cHMWK response based on the mechanism of action (MOA) of lanadelumab and C1 esterase inhibitor.
<b>Immunogenicity
</b>Treatment with lanadelumab has been associated with development of treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in 11.9% (10/84) of subjects. All antibody titres were low. The ADA response was transient in 20% (2/10) of ADA positive subjects. 2.4% (2/84) of lanadelumab-treated subjects tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.
The development of ADA including neutralising antibodies against TAKHZYRO did not appear to adversely affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles or clinical response.
<b>Adverse Reactions
</b>The most commonly observed adverse reaction (52.4%) associated with TAKHZYRO was injection site reactions (ISR) including injection site pain, injection site erythema and injection site bruising. Of these ISRs, 97% were of mild intensity, 90% resolved within 1 day after onset with a median duration of 6 minutes.
Hypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was observed (1.2%)

SUMMIT, N.J. &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) and Acceleron Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: XLRN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted Celgene’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for luspatercept, an investigational erythroid maturation agent, for the treatment of adult patients with very low to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)-associated anemia who have ring sideroblasts and require red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, and for the treatment of adult patients with beta-thalassemia-associated anemia who require RBC transfusions. The FDA has granted Priority Review to this BLA for the evaluation of the beta-thalassemia indication and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of December 4, 2019. The FDA has also set a PDUFA date of April 4, 2020 for the evaluation of the MDS indication.

“The acceptance of the luspatercept filings and granting of the U.S. priority review for beta-thalassemia represent another important step in delivering this novel therapy to patients in need,” said Jay Backstrom, M.D., Chief Medical Officer for Celgene. “We believe that luspatercept can play a critical role in treating the anemia associated with these serious blood diseases, and with these milestones achieved we look forward to working closely with the agency to move this therapy toward approval.”
The safety and efficacy results provided in the application are from the pivotal phase 3 studies MEDALIST and BELIEVE, which evaluated the ability of luspatercept to effectively treat the anemia associated with MDS and beta-thalassemia, respectively. MEDALIST and BELIEVE were both presented at the 2018 American Society of Hematology annual meeting, where MEDALIST was included in the plenary session.
The companies also announced that Celgene’s Marketing Authorization Application in the EU has been successfully validated and the review is now underway.
“The ongoing U.S. and European regulatory reviews of the luspatercept filings in MDS and beta-thalassemia strongly support our primary goal, which has always been to bring a potentially transformative new treatment to these patients with unmet clinical need as quickly as possible,” said Habib Dable, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. “At the same time, we continue to explore the ability of luspatercept to address anemia in additional settings, including patients with treatment-naïve MDS, non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, and myelofibrosis.”
Luspatercept is an investigational therapy that is not approved for any use in any country.
<b>About Luspatercept</b>
Luspatercept is a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent (EMA) that regulates late-stage red blood cell maturation. Acceleron and Celgene are jointly developing luspatercept as part of a global collaboration. A phase 3 trial (COMMANDS) in ESA-naïve, lower-risk MDS patients, the BEYOND phase 2 trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, and a phase 2 trial in myelofibrosis are ongoing.

<b>About MEDALIST</b>
MEDALIST is a phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of luspatercept in adults with very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). All patients were RBC transfusion dependent and were either refractory or intolerant to prior erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy or were ESA naïve with endogenous serum erythropoietin = 200 U/L and had no prior treatment with disease modifying agents. The median age of the patients enrolled in the trial was 71 years in the luspatercept treatment group and 72 years in the placebo group. Median transfusion burden in both treatment arms was 5 RBC units/8 weeks. 229 patients were randomized to receive either luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg (153 patients) or placebo (76 patients) by subcutaneous injection once every 21 days. The study was conducted at 65 sites in 11 countries.
<b>About BELIEVE</b>
BELIEVE is a phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study comparing luspatercept + best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo + BSC in adults with beta-thalassemia patients who require regular RBC transfusions. The median age of the patients was 30 years in both treatment arms. 336 patients were randomized to receive either luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg (224 patients) or placebo (112 patients) by subcutaneous injection every 21 days for up to 48 weeks. Crossover to the luspatercept treatment groups was allowed after unblinding based on the recommendation of an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee; patients treated with luspatercept will be followed for up to 3 years. The study was conducted at 65 sites in 15 countries.

<strong>First Investigational Therapy in a Pivotal Trial to Address Unmet Need for Patients with Advanced Urothelial Cancer After Treatment with Platinum Chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 Inhibitor-</strong>

<strong>TOKYO and BOTHELL, Wash., June 3, 2019</strong> – Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced that data from the first cohort of a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial known as EV-201 demonstrated that the investigational agent enfortumab vedotin rapidly shrank tumors in most patients, resulting in an objective response rate (ORR) of 44 percent (55/125; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 35.1-53.2). Complete responses (CR) were observed in 12 percent of patients (15/125). The median duration of tumor response was 7.6 months (range 0.95-11.3+). This cohort was open to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who had received previous treatment with a platinum-containing chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor. Responses were similar in the subgroups of patients analyzed, including those who had the worst prognosis, such as patients who had three or more previous lines of therapy, patients with liver metastases, and those who had not responded to a PD-1/L1 inhibitor. Treatment-related adverse events that occurred in 40 percent or more of patients were fatigue, alopecia, rash, decreased appetite, taste distortion, and peripheral neuropathy.
The data will be featured today in the official press program of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and be presented as a Late-Breaking oral presentation (Abstract #LBA4505) and have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
Despite recent advances in treatment, approximately 80 percent of people do not respond to PD-1/L1 inhibitors, which are the standard of care after platinum-containing therapy has failed as an initial treatment for advanced disease. These patients have few treatment options and new therapies are urgently needed.
Enfortumab vedotin is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets Nectin-4, a protein that is highly expressed in urothelial cancers. Based on the results of the EV-201 trial, the companies plan to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) for enfortumab vedotin to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this year. Based on preliminary results from the phase 1 EV-101 trial, the FDA granted enfortumab vedotin Breakthrough Therapy designation for people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer whose disease has progressed during or following checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
“Outcomes for patients diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer are generally poor, and treatment options after initial chemotherapy and immunotherapy are very limited,” said Daniel P. Petrylak, M.D., Professor of Medicine and of Urology, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven. “These data have the potential to change the treatment course of advanced urothelial cancer, and it is gratifying to see these results for patients.”
“Even with the recent introduction of new therapies, there remains a need for continued innovation in the treatment of urothelial cancer, and if approved, we hope to bring this potential treatment to physicians and patients as quickly as possible,” said Andrew Krivoshik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Oncology Therapeutic Area Head at Astellas.
“We are encouraged that enfortumab vedotin is the first novel therapy to demonstrate substantial clinical activity in these difficult-to-treat patients who currently have limited treatment options,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Seattle Genetics.
A global, randomized phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial (EV-301) is ongoing and is intended to support global registrations. Another trial (EV-103) is underway to evaluate enfortumab vedotin in earlier lines of treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, including in combination with pembrolizumab and/or platinum chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients as well as patients who progressed from earlier-stage disease.
EV-201 Study Results
Efficacy
In the first cohort of the EV-201 study, 125 patients were treated with enfortumab vedotin. The primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 44 percent per blinded independent central review (BICR) [(55/125; 95% CI: 35.1-53.2)]. The overall duration of response (DoR), a key secondary endpoint, was 7.6 months (range 0.95-11.3+).
Most responses occurred within the first cycle of treatment, and were observed across all pre-specified patient subgroups irrespective of lines of therapy, response to prior PD-1/L1 inhibitor, or presence of liver metastases:
• Three or more prior therapies: 41 percent ORR (26/63)
• Non-responders to PD-1/L1 inhibitors: 41 percent ORR (41/100)
• Liver metastases: 38 percent ORR (19/50)
Median overall survival (OS) was 11.7 months (95% CI:9.1-not reached), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.8 months (95% CI:4.9-7.5).
Safety
• The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurring in more than 40 percent of patients were fatigue (50 percent (62/125)); alopecia (49 percent (61/125)); rash (48 percent (60/125)); decreased appetite (44 percent (55/125)); taste distortion (40 percent (50/125)); and peripheral neuropathy (50 percent (63/125)).
• Most peripheral neuropathy (94 percent) and rash (75 percent) were less than or equal to Grade 2 in severity. Hyperglycemia occurred in 11 percent of patients (14/125).
• The most common severe AEs (defined as greater than or equal to Grade 3) were: neutropenia – experienced by 8 percent of patients (10/125); anemia in 7 percent of patients (9/125); and fatigue in 6 percent of patients (7/125). One death due to interstitial lung disease occurred outside the safety-reporting period and was confounded by prolonged high-dose steroid use and suspected pneumonia.

The approval of Emgality for the treatment of episodic cluster headache is an important milestone as it provides a new treatment option, which has been long-awaited by those impacted by this disease,"" said Christi Shaw, president, Lilly Bio-Medicines.
Cluster headache is characterized by the abrupt onset of severe to very severe pain on one side of the head. Pain is felt in the orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal regions (around or above the eye and/or temple) and can be accompanied by symptoms on the same side of the body: conjunctival injection (eye redness), lacrimation (tearing), nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (runny nose), forehead and facial sweating, miosis (constriction of the pupil), ptosis (drooping eyelid) and/or eyelid edema (swollen eyelid), and/or restlessness or agitation.<sup>2</sup> Cluster headache, although severely crippling, is challenging to diagnose because of limited awareness and, for some, may take five years or more to diagnose on average.<sup>3</sup> It has been historically challenging to conduct clinical trials that identify treatment options that help reduce the frequency of attacks for those with episodic cluster headache. During a cluster period, which usually spans two weeks to three months, attacks last 15 to 180 minutes and can occur from once every other day to eight times per day.<sup>2</sup> People with episodic cluster headache represent 85 to 90 percent of cluster headache prevalence, with approximately 250,000 adults living with this disease in the U.S.<sup> 2,4</sup>
""As someone impacted by cluster headache and an advocate for others living with this disease, I know firsthand the desperation that we have felt for additional treatment options that can reduce the frequency of these attacks that have such a debilitating impact on our lives,"" said Bob Wold, founder, Clusterbusters, Inc. ""The approval of Emgality for the treatment of episodic cluster headache is a cause for celebration and hope. On behalf of this community, we thank the FDA, Lilly, the researchers and the patients who helped to usher forward this innovative treatment.""
The efficacy of Emgality was evaluated for the treatment of episodic cluster headache in a randomized, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.<sup>1</sup> In the study, 106 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-monthly injections of Emgality 300 mg (N=49) or placebo (N=57), with a baseline number of weekly cluster headache attacks of 17.8 for Emgality and 17.3 for placebo. Patients on Emgality experienced an average of 8.7 fewer weekly cluster headache attacks over Weeks 1 to 3 vs. 5.2 fewer weekly attacks for patients on placebo (p=0.036).<sup>1 </sup>With Emgality, 71.4% of patients had their weekly cluster headache attacks cut in half or more from baseline at Week 3 vs. 52.6% of patients with placebo (p=0.046).<sup>1</sup>
Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with episodic cluster headache treated with Emgality 300 mg monthly is consistent with the safety profile in patients with migraine treated with Emgality 120 mg monthly.<sup>1</sup> Two Emgality-treated patients discontinued double-blind treatment during the episodic cluster headache study because of adverse events.<sup>1</sup>
""For years, there have been few therapeutic options to offer patients for the treatment of episodic cluster headache. With today's approval, physicians are now armed with an FDA-approved medication that has the potential to help patients living with this condition by reducing the frequency of cluster attacks,"" said David Kudrow, M.D., director, California Medical Clinic for Headache.
For episodic cluster headache, the recommended dosage of Emgality is 300 mg (administered as three consecutive subcutaneous injections of 100 mg each) at the onset of the cluster period, and then monthly until the end of the cluster period.<sup>1</sup>
Emgality will be available to patients for pickup at retail pharmacies. The U.S. list price of Emgality for the treatment of episodic cluster headache is the same per milligram as the migraine indication.

<b>About the Episodic Cluster Headache Study
</b>The efficacy and safety of Emgality were evaluated for the treatment of episodic cluster headache in a randomized, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study included 106 adults who met the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (beta version) diagnostic criteria for episodic cluster headache and had a maximum of 8 attacks per day, a minimum of one attack every other day, and at least 4 attacks during the prospective 7-day baseline period. All patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-monthly subcutaneous injections of Emgality 300 mg or placebo. Patients were allowed to use certain specified acute/abortive cluster headache treatments, including triptans, oxygen, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the study. The study excluded patients on other treatments intended to reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks; patients with medication overuse headache; patients with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities compatible with an acute cardiovascular event or conduction delay; and patients with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of screening. In addition, patients with any history of stroke, intracranial or carotid aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, or vasospastic angina; clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease; or diagnosis of Raynaud's disease were excluded. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in weekly cluster headache attack frequency across Weeks 1 to 3.<sup>1</sup> A secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved a response (defined as a reduction from baseline of 50% or greater in the weekly cluster headache attack frequency) at Week 3.<sup>1</sup>

 	<li><strong>Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro showed improvements across multiple efficacy measures compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil, including progression-free survival and deep remissions as determined by minimal residual disease measurement</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>This 12-month, fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free combination was recently approved for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia under the FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review pilot programme</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced results from the pivotal phase III CLL14 study in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) showing that Venclexta<sup>®</sup>/Venclyxto<sup>®</sup> (venetoclax) plus Gazyva<sup>®</sup>/Gazyvaro<sup>®</sup> (obinutuzumab) met its primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). The 12-month, fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free combination reduced the risk of disease worsening or death by 65% compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil (PFS, as assessed by investigator; HR=0.35; 95% CI 0.23-0.53; p&lt;0.001), when given to people with previously untreated CLL who have co-existing medical conditions. The results were presented at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</i>.<sup>1,2</sup>
At two years, one year after stopping treatment, nearly nine out of ten patients (88.2%) in the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro arm remained progression-free, compared to 64.1% in the Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm. Safety for Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro appeared consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines. Common Grade 3-4 adverse events with Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil, respectively, were low white blood cell count (52.8% vs. 48.1%) and infections (17.5% vs. 15.0%).
“The results of our phase III CLL14 trial, reported today at ASCO and in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, represent a major advance in improving outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are pleased this fixed-duration, chemotherapy-free regimen of Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro was approved by the FDA and look forward to providing an important treatment option to even more adults with the most common form of adult leukaemia.”
The treatment benefit demonstrated with the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro combination compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil was consistent across secondary endpoints, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Overall response (84.7% vs. 71.3%; p&lt;0.001).</li>
 	<li>Complete response with at least partial blood count recovery (49.5% vs. 23.1%; p&lt;0.001).</li>
 	<li>Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity in the bone marrow (56.9% vs. 17.1%; p&lt;0.001) and peripheral blood (75.5% vs. 35.2%; p&lt;0.001) three months after treatment. MRD-negativity means no cancer can be detected using a specific, highly sensitive test, and was defined as less than one CLL cell in 10,000 white blood cells.</li>
</ul>
These data were presented at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting on Tuesday 4 June 2019, at 10.09-10.21 CST (17.09-17.21, CET; abstract #7502), and simultaneously published in the <i>NEJM</i>.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination on 15 May 2019, under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review and Assessment Aid pilot programmes, for the treatment of people with previously untreated CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. This is the second regimen of Roche medicines approved under the RTOR pilot programme, which is exploring a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. Additional submissions of the CLL14 data to health authorities around the world are ongoing.

<h3>About the CLL14 study<sup>2</sup></h3>
CLL14 (NCT02242942) is a randomised phase III study evaluating the combination of fixed-duration Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and co-existing medical conditions. Co-existing medical conditions included reduced kidney function or co-morbidities assessed by a standard scale (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale). 432 patients with previously untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive either a 12-month duration of Venclexta/Venclyxto alongside six-month duration of Gazyva/Gazyvaro (Arm A) or six-month duration of Gazyva/Gazyvaro alongside 12-month duration of chlorambucil (Arm B). Arm A started with an initial dosing of Gazyva/Gazyvaro followed by a five-week Venclexta/Venclyxto dose ramp-up to help reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by independent review committee (IRC), minimal residual disease (MRD) status, overall response rate (ORR), complete response (with or without complete blood count recovery), overall survival, duration of response, event-free survival, time to next CLL treatment, and safety. The CLL14 study is being conducted in cooperation with the German CLL Study Group, headed by Michael Hallek, MD, University of Cologne.
After a median follow-up of 28 months, results showed:
<ul>
 	<li>Patients who received Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro lived significantly longer without their disease worsening (PFS, as assessed by investigator) compared to those who received Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23-0.53; p&lt;0.001).
<ul>
 	<li>At two years, 88.2% of patients in the Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro arm had not experienced disease progression, compared to 64.1% with Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil.</li>
 	<li>Median PFS reported by investigators was not yet reached in either arm. IRC assessment of PFS was consistent (HR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.22- 0.51; p&lt;0.001).</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Clinical benefit observed for Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil was consistent across secondary endpoints, including ORR (84.7% vs. 71.3%; p&lt;0.001) and CR including incomplete marrow recovery (49.5% vs. 23.1%; p&lt;0.001).</li>
 	<li>In addition, higher rates of MRD-negativity in the bone marrow (56.9% vs. 17.1%; p&lt;0.001) and peripheral blood (75.5% vs. 35.2%; p&lt;0.001) were observed three months after treatment with Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil. MRD-negativity was defined as less than one CLL cell in 10,000 leukocytes.</li>
 	<li>Safety for Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro appeared consistent with the known safety profile of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified with the combination. Common Grade 3-4 adverse events with Venclexta/Venclyxto plus Gazyva/Gazyvaro compared to Gazyva/Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil, respectively, were low white blood cell count (52.8% vs. 48.1%) and infections (17.5% vs. 15.0%).</li>
</ul>
<h3>About Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax)</h3>
Venclexta/Venclyxto is a first-in-class targeted medicine designed to selectively bind and inhibit the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other tumours, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from dying or self-destructing, a process called apoptosis. Venclexta/Venclyxto blocks the BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.
Venclexta/Venclyxto is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialised by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the US and by AbbVie outside of the US. Together, the companies are committed to research with Venclexta/Venclyxto, which is currently being studied in clinical trials across several types of blood and other cancers.
In the US, Venclexta has been granted five Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL); as a monotherapy for people with relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion; in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for people with untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) for people with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, and in combination with Gazyva in people with previously untreated CLL and co-existing medical conditions.
Venclexta/Venclyxto is approved in more than 50 countries. Roche and AbbVie are currently working with regulatory agencies around the world to bring this medicine to additional eligible patients in need.
<h3>About Gazyva/Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab)</h3>
Gazyva/Gazyvaro is an engineered monoclonal antibody designed to attach to CD20, a protein expressed on certain B-cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells. Gazyva/Gazyvaro is designed to attack and destroy targeted B-cells both directly and together with the body's immune system. Gazyva is marketed as Gazyvaro in the EU and Switzerland.
Gazyva/Gazyvaro is currently approved in more than 90 countries in combination with chlorambucil for people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in more than 80 countries in combination with bendamustine for people with certain types of previously treated follicular lymphoma and in more than 70 countries in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.
Additional combination studies investigating Gazyva/Gazyvaro with other approved or investigational medicines, including cancer immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors, are underway across a range of blood cancers.
<h3>About the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG)</h3>
Founded in 1996 and headed by Michael Hallek, MD, the GCLLSG has been running various phase III, phase II and phase I trials in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with the goal to provide optimal treatment to patients suffering from this disease. Among those were landmark trials like the CLL8 and the CLL11 trials, which led to the current standard of care in CLL. For many years, GCLLSG has been aiming to improve not just the treatment of younger and physically fit patients, but also that of elderly and less fit patients. These patients are generally underrepresented in clinical trials although they constitute the majority of CLL patients treated by doctors in daily practice. The GCLLSG is an independent non-profit research organisation supported by the German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe). <a class=""external icon-newwindow"" href=""http://www.dcllsg.de/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.dcllsg.de</a>

<strong>LOS ANGELES, Calif., June 4, 2019</strong> - Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: PBYI), a biopharmaceutical company, announced that results from the Phase III NALA trial of PB272 (neratinib) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior lines of HER2-directed treatments (third-line disease) in the setting of metastatic disease, were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2019 Annual Meeting in Chicago. “Neratinib + capecitabine versus lapatinib + capecitabine in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer previously treated with = 2 HER2-directed regimens: Findings from the multinational, randomized, phase III NALA trial,” was presented as an oral presentation by Adam M. Brufsky, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Co-Director, Comprehensive Breast Cancer Center, Magee Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Slides from the presentation are available on the Puma Biotechnology website.
The Phase III NALA trial is a randomized controlled trial of neratinib plus capecitabine versus Tykerb® (lapatinib) plus capecitabine in patients with third-line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The trial enrolled 621 patients who were randomized (1:1) to receive either neratinib plus capecitabine or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The trial was conducted globally at sites in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. The co-primary endpoints of the trial are centrally confirmed progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). An alpha level of 1% was allocated to the PFS and 4% allocated to OS. The study was to be considered positive if either of the co-primary endpoints was positive. Puma reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the design of the Phase III clinical trial and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also provided follow-on scientific advice (SA) consistent with that of the FDA regarding the Company's Phase III trial design and endpoints used in the trial.
For the primary analysis of centrally confirmed PFS, treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in a statistically significant improvement in centrally confirmed PFS (hazard ratio=0.76, p=0.0059) compared to treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine. Because the proportional hazard assumption did not hold, the statistical analysis plan for the NALA trial prespecified that a restricted means survival analysis at 24 months would be performed. In this prespecified analysis the mean PFS for the patients treated with neratinib plus capecitabine was 8.8 months and the mean PFS for the patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine was 6.6 months.
For the primary analyses of OS, neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in an improvement in OS that trended positively in favor of the neratinib plus capecitabine arm of the study (hazard ratio = 0.88, p=0.21). The median OS for the patients treated with neratinib plus capecitabine was 21.0 months and the median OS for the patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine was 18.7 months. In the prespecified restricted means analysis the mean OS at 48 months for the patients treated with neratinib plus capecitabine was 24.0 months and the mean OS for the patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine was 22.2 months.
For the secondary endpoint of time to intervention for symptomatic central nervous system disease (also referred to as brain metastases), the results of the trial showed that treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine led to an improvement over the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine. The overall cumulative incidence of CNS metastases was 22.8% for the neratinib plus capecitabine arm and 29.2% for the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm (p=0.043, descriptive). For the secondary enpoint of duration of response, neratinib plus capecitabine treatment resulted in a longer duration of response compared to lapatinib and capecitabine treatment, with a median response of 8.54 months compared to a median response of 5.55 months (HR = 0.495, p = 0.0004, descriptive).
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between arms: TEAEs leading to neratinib/lapatinib discontinuation were lower with neratinib (10.9%) than with lapatinib (14.5%). There was a higher rate of grade 3 diarrhea with neratinib plus capecitabine compared to lapatinib plus capecitabine (24.4% vs 12.5%); however, the discontinuations due to diarrhea (neratinib plus capecitabine: 2.6%, lapatinib plus capecitabine: 2.3%) were similar in both arms.
Puma plans to submit its New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on the Phase III NALA trial results in the second quarter/third quarter of 2019.
“Patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on two or more prior treatments continue to need additional treatment options,” said Adam M. Brufsky, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Co-Director, Comprehensive Breast Cancer Center, Magee Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “The results of the Phase III NALA trial are promising not only for a significant PFS improvement and a trend toward an OS improvement, but also for the potential to prevent progression of CNS metastases, which is a growing concern in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.”
Alan H. Auerbach, Chief Executive Officer and President of Puma Biotechnology, said, “We are highly encouraged by these results from the NALA trial with the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior lines of HER2-directed treatments. We look forward to working with the regulatory authorities in the hope of bringing another potential treatment option to patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer as soon as possible.”

<div class=""wd_subtitle wd_language_left"">First and Only Treatment in China Approved for Patients with This Ultra-Rare Genetic Condition</div>
<div class=""wd_subtitle wd_language_left"">More than 1,300 Patients Treated with Vimizim in Over 50 Countries</div>
<div>
<span class=""xn-location"">SAN RAFAEL, Calif.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 4, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) announced today that Vimizim® (elosulfase alfa) has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the treatment of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA), also known as Morquio A syndrome. Vimizim is the first treatment in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> approved for this condition.
In <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2018</span>, the Chinese government issued the country's first national list of rare diseases, which included MPS.  The list also includes phenylketonuria (PKU), Tetrahydrobiopterin Deficiency, and hemophilia—diseases that BioMarin either has an approved therapy for or is developing one.  The list gives priority to rare diseases with a relatively high prevalence, that pose a heavy burden and that are highly treatable.  Also, in <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2018</span>, the Chinese Drug Evaluation Center posted a list of 48 drugs already approved in the U.S., EU or <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span> that could be eligible for Priority Review in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, which included Vimizim.
""Vimizim is the first, and currently only, disease-specific treatment option for this very rare, progressively degenerative, autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disorder,"" said Luo Xiaoping, Vice Chairman of the Pediatrics society of the Chinese Medical Association and head of Endocrine Genetic Metabolism Group of Chinese Medical Association.
""Morquio A syndrome is an ultra-rare and difficult condition to treat. Vimizim is the only specific treatment available and offers improved endurance to these patients,"" said Gu Xuefan, Deputy Director of Shanghai Institute of Pediatrics, Director of Pediatric Endocrinology and Inherited Metabolic Diseases Research Office of Xinhua Hospital, Director of Pediatric Genetic Diseases Diagnosis and Treatment Center, and Director of Pediatric Endocrinology and Inherited Metabolism Group of Shanghai Medical Association.
""Vimizim is approved for patients with mucupolysaccharidosis type IVA. It's used to improve the patients' pulmonary function, and significantly increase their walking distance in six minutes,"" said Qiu Zhengqing, Member of the Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism Group of the Chinese Medical Association, communication reviewer of Chinese Journal of Pediatrics and the Chinese Medical Genetics Journal.
""We are pleased to be able to deliver the first drug therapy for Morquio A to patients in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> and to build upon our efforts to serve patients with rare diseases in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>,"" said Jean-Jacques Bienaimé, Chairman and CEO of BioMarin. ""We hope to continue to deliver therapies to treat patients who have rare genetic diseases with unmet medical needs.""
BioMarin will market Vimizim directly in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, building on its existing presence in the country with a team that has been marketing a BioMarin therapy, Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride), and that team is well-suited for serving ultra-rare disease populations. In the U.S., Kuvan is approved to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) due to tetrahydrobiopterin- (BH4-) responsive Phenylketonuria (PKU).
Morquio A syndrome is an ultra-rare, severely debilitating disease affecting an estimated 3,000 patients in the developed world. The disease occurs as a result of a deficiency of activity in an enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism. The pervasive and progressive accumulation of GAGs leads to significant morbidities and multisystemic clinical impairments resulting in diminished functional capacity, impaired quality-of-life and early mortality. The most common features of the disease are progressive skeletal dysplasia, the need for frequent surgical procedures related primarily to musculoskeletal or respiratory dysfunction, and significant limitations in mobility, endurance and breathing.
""The approval of Vimizim in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> underscores our commitment to providing this much-needed therapy to patients with Morquio A syndrome across the globe,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Hank Fuchs</span>, M.D., President of Global Research and Development at BioMarin. ""We will continue to seek approvals in other countries so that more patients within the MPS community have access to the treatments they deserve.""
<b>About Morquio A Syndrome</b>
Morquio A syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is a disease in which people are missing an enzyme essential in the breakdown and removal of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) called keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S). The incompletely broken-down GAGs remain stored in cells in the body causing progressive damage. This excessive storage causes systemic skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities, limiting mobility and endurance. Malformation of the chest impairs respiratory function, and looseness of joints in the neck causing spinal instability and potentially spinal cord compression. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, corneal clouding, and heart disease. Initial symptoms often become evident in the first five years of life. The disease substantially limits both the quality and length of life of those affected.
The rate of incidence of Morquio A syndrome is as yet unconfirmed and varies among different populations, and estimates vary between 1 in 200,000 live births and 1 in 450,000 live births.
<b>About VIMIZIM</b>
VIMIZIM® (elosulfase alfa) is a treatment for patients with Morquio A syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA). VIMIZIM is the first approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) designed to target the underlying cause of Morquio A Syndrome—a deficiency in the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6 sulfatase (GALNS). VIMIZIM is intended to provide the exogenous enzyme GALNS that will be taken up into the lysosomes and increase the catabolism of GAGs. Morquio A syndrome is a rare, severely debilitating and progressive disease that previously had no approved, standard-of-care treatment other than supportive care.
<b>Important Safety Information from U.S. Prescribing Information</b>
Life-threatening allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, can occur during VIMIZIM® (elosulfase alfa) infusions. Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when VIMIZIM is administered and for an appropriate period of time following administration.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed as early as 30 minutes from the start of infusion but as late as six days after infusion. Frequent symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions included anaphylactic reactions, urticaria, peripheral edema, cough, dyspnea, and flushing.
Because of the potential for hypersensitivity reactions, administer antihistamines with or without antipyretics prior to infusion.  If severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion of VIMIZIM and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients with acute febrile or respiratory illness at the time of VIMIZIM infusion may be at higher risk of life-threatening complications from hypersensitivity reactions.
Sleep apnea is common in MPS IVA patients. Evaluation of airway patency should be considered prior to initiation of treatment with VIMIZIM. Patients using supplemental oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep should have these treatments readily available during infusion in the event of an acute reaction, or extreme drowsiness/sleep induced by antihistamine use.
Spinal or cervical cord compression (SCC) is a known and serious complication of MPS IVA and may occur as part of the natural history of the disease. In clinical trials, SCC was observed both in patients receiving VIMIZIM and patients receiving placebo. Patients with MPS IVA should be monitored for signs and symptoms of SCC (including back pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, urinary and fecal incontinence) and given appropriate clinical care.
All patients treated with VIMIZIM 2 mg/kg once per week in the placebo-controlled trial developed anti-drug antibodies.
VIMIZIM should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known if VIMIZIM is present in human milk.
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below 5 years of age have not been established.
In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (=10%) occurring during infusion included pyrexia, vomiting, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, chills, and fatigue. The acute reactions requiring intervention were managed by either temporarily interrupting or discontinuing infusion, and administering additional antihistamine, antipyretics, or corticosteroids.

<div class=""media float"">
<div class=""bd plntxt"">
<b>Berlin/Monheim, June 4, 2019 </b>– Bayer today announced a collaboration with Arvinas, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in New Haven, Connecticut. The new life science research partnership uniquely leverages the full potential of Arvinas’ novel PROTAC® technology, coupled with Bayer’s leading expertise in health and agriculture to develop innovations for the benefit of patients and farmers.
Arvinas is a pioneer in Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera, also known as PROTACs. PROTAC® technology harnesses the naturally occurring protein degradation system of the cell to selectively remove target proteins by proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins into amino acids.
For Bayer, a company which is uniquely positioned in health and agriculture, the collaboration demonstrates the utilization of potential synergies of emerging and converging research across human and plant applications that is unprecedented in the life science sector.
Bayer will form an exclusive joint venture as the first company to explore the PROTAC® technology in agriculture for crop protection, and at the same time establish a target-based pharmaceutical research collaboration with Arvinas. In addition, Bayer will make an equity investment to sustain its commitment for the technology.
<b>Agricultural joint venture</b>
Within the framework of the joint venture the exploration of novel molecular target space to address weeds, insects and/or diseases that threaten crops worldwide will be pioneered. As the technology degrades targets rather than inhibiting them, it offers a completely new category of crop protection applications in agriculture. In addition, PROTACs have the potential to revive crop protection mechanisms that have become ineffective due to resistance.
“The goal is to utilize the complementary expertise of Bayer and Arvinas to develop novel research discoveries that ultimately deliver new crop protection products for farmers,” said Dr. Robert Reiter, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG's Crop Science Division and Head of Crop Science Research &amp; Development. “With this cutting-edge science, we aim to deliver safe and effective solutions that will aid farmers in protecting and producing crops that help to feed a growing global population.”
Within the framework of the joint venture, Bayer has committed more than USD 55 million over six years to translate the new protein degradation technology in agro chemistry and to build an agro-specific PROTAC® IP portfolio.
<b>Pharmaceutical collaboration and equity investment</b>
Today, up to 80 percent of the human proteome is still considered undruggable by small molecule inhibitors, the mechanism underlying many therapeutic drugs currently available. By removing target proteins directly rather than blocking them, protein degraders like PROTACs may provide multiple advantages over small molecule inhibitors. In addition, no inhibitors have been identified for a majority of the targets of interest in drug development.
“In line with our strategy to adopt novel modalities in R&amp;D, we are entering into a collaboration with Arvinas as we see the breakthrough innovation potential in this technology,” said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG's Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “Because PROTACs don’t inhibit the target protein's enzymatic activity, but bind their targets with high selectivity, it may be possible to retool previously ineffective inhibitor molecules as PROTACs for next-generation medicines for patients.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Arvinas will receive an upfront payment and pharmaceutical R&amp;D support over the next four years, as well as a direct equity investment. These investments combined will exceed USD 60 million. Bayer will own the rights to novel lead structures generated in the course of the collaboration. As programs progress through research, development, and commercialization, Arvinas might also be eligible to receive pre-defined development milestones of over USD 685 million and commercial royalties.
“As the first company founded to explore targeted protein degradation, we’ve been excited about the potential to improve the lives of patients since our inception,” said John Houston, Ph.D., President and CEO of Arvinas. “We’ve also anticipated the broad potential of our PROTAC® platform to move beyond treating human disease. This collaboration enables us not only to expand our platform into new therapeutic areas, but also begins a new journey in applying our approach to agriculture. We are thrilled to work with Bayer to begin developing solutions to efficiently support the needs of the world’s growing population and to improve human health.”
<b>About PROTAC® (Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera) Protein Degraders</b>
Arvinas’ PROTAC® protein degraders harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to degrade disease-causing proteins. PROTAC® protein degraders recruit an E3 ligase to tag the target protein with ubiquitin, which directs its degradation through the proteasome, a large protein complex that breaks down the ubiquitinated target protein into small peptides and amino acids. As the target protein is degraded, the PROTAC® protein degrader is released and acts iteratively to destroy additional target protein.
PROTAC® protein degraders offer numerous potential advantages as a therapeutic, including broad tissue distribution, routes of administration that include oral delivery, and simpler manufacturing than other new modalities, such as cell-based therapies. Arvinas has developed and optimized a proprietary library of protein targeting ligands, E3 ligase ligands, and linkers, which allow the company to rapidly identify and optimize efficient protein degraders with favorable characteristics for successful drug development.
<b>About Arvinas</b>
Arvinas is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapies that degrade disease-causing proteins. Arvinas uses its proprietary technology platform to engineer proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTAC® targeted protein degraders, that harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to selectively and efficiently degrade and remove disease-causing proteins. The company’s lead program, ARV-110 for the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, began clinical trials in 1Q2019.

<span class=""xn-location"">CHICAGO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">May 31, 2019</span> /<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PRNewswire</a>/ -- IBM Watson Health and its partners today unveiled 22 new scientific studies that demonstrate progress in providing clinical decision support for cancer care globally at the American Society for Clinical Oncology 2019 annual meeting.
""Artificial intelligence technology is helping to enhance the way clinicians treat cancer today, in the real world,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Nathan Levitan</span>, MD, MBA, Chief Medical Officer for Oncology and Genomics at IBM Watson Health. ""AI is helping multidisciplinary tumor boards make more informed decisions based on curated scientific evidence; it is surfacing critical insights and information that is not identified manually; and it is helping to improve patient satisfaction by delivering a comprehensive view of treatment options.""
Watson Health's studies show how Watson AI provides value in supporting evidence-informed treatment decisions, improving patient confidence in treatment plans, and annotating genomic variants and identifying clinical interventions. In total, more than 70 peer-reviewed studies, posters and abstracts support Watson Health offerings in oncology and genomics.
""In this early era of AI use in healthcare decision-making, the studies presented at ASCO this year offer compelling evidence of the important role this technology will play in helping oncologists improve cancer treatment for each individual patient,"" Levitan continued.
Following are among the key study findings being presented at ASCO:
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b><span class=""xn-location"">Watson</span> for Oncology Informs Clinical Decision Changes in 13.6% of Cases Reviewed by Multidisciplinary Tumor Board: </b>In a blinded evaluation of 1000 breast, lung and colorectal cancer patients in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>, the multidisciplinary tumor board at Manipal Hospitals changed their treatment decisions in 13.6% of cases based on information provided by <span class=""xn-location"">Watson</span> for Oncology. Investigators reported that in these cases, decisions changed because <span class=""xn-location"">Watson</span> provided recent evidence for a newer treatment (55%), a more personalized alternative (30%), or new insights from genotypic and phenotypic data and evolving clinical experiences (15%).

<b>IBM Watson Health Continues to Enhance Products</b>
IBM Watson Health continuously seeks to enhance capabilities in its offerings to help physicians improve the efficacy and efficiency of cancer treatment. During ASCO, IBM Watson Health <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2482882-1&amp;h=635496415&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fabstracts.asco.org%2F239%2FAbstView_239_268551.html&amp;a=reported+data"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">reported data</a> on a new method to automatically identify clinically relevant, high-quality scientific publications by training machine learning on the text from abstracts of papers cited in three expert resources: NCCN, NCI-PDQ, and Hemonc.org. The model classified papers in the test set with 93% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, and 91% specificity, which suggests that machine learning can be used to automatically identify relevant clinical publications and may reduce the time clinicians spend finding pertinent evidence for their patients.
Additionally, IBM Watson Health is strategically focused on tailoring offerings to support the workflow experience of oncologists in key markets based on feedback from physicians and insight from scientific data. Watson Health oncology and genomics offerings are currently being used to support physicians and patients in their cancer care journeys in more than 15 markets around the world.
""With 18 million diagnoses globally each year, cancer is a devastating disease that has a heavy human toll, as well as a high health system cost,"" said Dr. Levitan. ""Patients often face grueling and confusing treatment regimens, while oncologists sift through reams of medical literature and genomic data to identify the best care plan for each individual patient. All the while, researchers are hamstrung by trials that too often fail due to low patient recruitment. IBM Watson Health was created to help address pressing health challenges through data, analytics and AI, and this is our focus in oncology.""

<strong>Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, Japan, June 5, 2019</strong> – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (<a href=""https://uat-corp.cms.takeda.com/testtesttest/corpcom/investors/"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://uat-corp.cms.takeda.com/testtesttest/corpcom/investors/"" data-action=""External"">TSE: 4502/NYSE: TAK</a>) today announced that the Phase 3 TOURMALINE-AL1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis did not meet the first of two primary endpoints. Treatment with NINLARO<sup>TM</sup> (ixazomib) in combination with dexamethasone did not demonstrate a significant improvement in overall hematologic response compared to physician’s choice of standard of care regimens. As a result of this analysis, Takeda has decided to discontinue the trial.
“While we are disappointed with this outcome, we aim to maximize our learnings from this trial and share findings with the community in hopes of helping to improve care for patients living with this devastating disease,” said Phil Rowlands, Ph.D., Head, Oncology Therapeutic Area Unit, Takeda. “This has been one of the largest studies ever conducted in systemic light-chain AL amyloidosis and we are proud to have led it. This study demonstrated our dedication to this rare and traditionally difficult-to-enroll patient population and we thank the patients and investigators for their engagement and participation. We remain optimistic about NINLARO and continue to investigate NINLARO in patient populations across the continuum of multiple myeloma care.”
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) did not raise any concerns about the safety profile of NINLARO in this setting. Patients are encouraged to consult their study investigators to address any questions.
<h4>About the TOURMALINE-AL1 Trial</h4>
TOURMALINE-AL1 (NCT01659658) is an international, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study, designed to determine whether NINLARO<sup>TM</sup> (ixazomib) in combination with dexamethasone improves hematologic response, 2-year vital organ (heart or kidney) deterioration and mortality rate versus a physician's choice of a chemotherapy regimen in participants diagnosed with relapsed or refractory systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Patients were randomly selected to receive either NINLARO plus dexamethasone, or physician’s choice of dexamethasone plus melphalan; dexamethasone plus cyclophosphamide; dexamethasone plus thalidomide; dexamethasone plus lenalidomide; or dexamethasone alone. For more information, please visit <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01659658"" data-category=""External"" data-label=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01659658"" data-action=""External"">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01659658</a>.
<h4>About AL Amyloidosis</h4>
Primary AL amyloidosis is a condition that falls under the umbrella of plasma cell dyscrasias. AL amyloidosis arises from a clonal plasma cell that produces abnormal immunoglobulin light-chain fragments. These misfolded light-chains form insoluble fibrils that aggregate as amyloid deposits in organs and tissues throughout the body, ultimately leading to organ dysfunction and death. The most common organs affected are the kidneys, heart, liver, and autonomic or peripheral nerves. There are currently no treatments approved for the treatment of AL amyloidosis.
<h4>About NINLARO™ (ixazomib) capsules</h4>
NINLARO™ (ixazomib) is an oral proteasome inhibitor which is being studied across the continuum of multiple myeloma treatment settings. NINLARO was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015 and is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. NINLARO is currently approved in more than 60 countries, including the United States, Japan and in the European Union, with more than 10 regulatory filings currently under review. It was the first oral proteasome inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials and to receive approval.
The comprehensive ixazomib clinical development program, TOURMALINE, includes four ongoing pivotal trials, which together are investigating major multiple myeloma patient populations.
<ul>
 	<li>TOURMALINE-MM1, investigating ixazomib vs. placebo in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma</li>
 	<li>TOURMALINE-MM2, investigating ixazomib vs. placebo in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma</li>
 	<li>TOURMALINE-MM3, investigating ixazomib vs. placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma following induction therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)</li>
 	<li>TOURMALINE-MM4, investigating ixazomib vs. placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have not undergone ASCT; this study is currently enrolling</li>
</ul>
In addition to the TOURMALINE program, ixazomib is being evaluated in multiple therapeutic combinations for various patient populations in investigator initiated studies globally.
<h4>NINLARO™ (ixazomib) capsules: Global Important Safety Information</h4>
<strong>SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>
<strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> has been reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively) with platelet nadirs typically occurring between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle and recovery to baseline by the start of the next cycle. It did not result in an increase in hemorrhagic events or platelet transfusions. Monitor platelet counts at least monthly during treatment with NINLARO and consider more frequent monitoring during the first three cycles. Manage with dose modifications and platelet transfusions as per standard medical guidelines.
<strong>Gastrointestinal toxicities</strong> have been reported in the NINLARO and placebo regimens respectively, such as diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), and vomiting (22% vs. 11%), occasionally requiring use of antiemetic and anti-diarrheal medications, and supportive care.
<strong>Peripheral neuropathy</strong> was reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 21% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). The most commonly reported reaction was peripheral sensory neuropathy (19% and 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Peripheral motor neuropathy was not commonly reported in either regimen (&lt; 1%). Monitor patients for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and adjust dosing as needed.
<strong>Peripheral edema</strong> was reported with NINLARO (25% vs. 18% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Evaluate patients for underlying causes and provide supportive care, as necessary. Adjust the dose of dexamethasone per its prescribing information or the dose of NINLARO for severe symptoms.
<strong>Cutaneous reactions</strong> occurred in 19% of patients in the NINLARO regimen compared to 11% of patients in the placebo regimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens was maculo-papular and macular rash. Manage rash with supportive care, dose modification or discontinuation.
<strong>Hepatotoxicity</strong>, drug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular injury, hepatic steatosis, and hepatitis cholestatic have been uncommonly reported with NINLARO. Monitor hepatic enzymes regularly and adjust dose for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms.
<strong>Pregnancy</strong>- NINLARO can cause fetal harm. Advise male and female patients of reproductive potential to use contraceptive measures during treatment and for an additional 90 days after the final dose of NINLARO. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while taking NINLARO due to potential hazard to the fetus. Women using hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of contraception.
<strong>Lactation</strong>- It is not known whether NINLARO or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There could be potential adverse events in nursing infants and therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued.
<strong>SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS</strong>
<strong>Hepatic Impairment</strong>: Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
<strong>Renal Impairment</strong>: Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. NINLARO is not dialyzable and, therefore, can be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis.
<strong>DRUG INTERACTIONS</strong>
Co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers with NINLARO is not recommended.
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS</strong>
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (= 20%) in the NINLARO regimen, and greater than in the placebo regimen, were diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), thrombocytopenia (28% vs. 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 21%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), peripheral edema (25% vs. 18%), vomiting (22% vs. 11%), and back pain (21% vs. 16%). Serious adverse reactions reported in = 2% of patients included thrombocytopenia (2%) and diarrhea (2%). For each adverse reaction, one or more of the three drugs was discontinued in = 1% of patients in the NINLARO regimen.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &amp; BASEL, Switzerland--(<a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Enzyvant, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing transformative therapies for patients with rare, often fatal conditions, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for filing its Biologics License Application (BLA) for RVT-802, a novel investigational tissue-based regenerative therapy designed to treat pediatric congenital athymia, and granted Priority Review. Congenital athymia is a rare and deadly condition associated with complete DiGeorge Anomaly (cDGA), CHARGE syndrome, and FOXN1 deficiency. At this time, the FDA is not planning to hold an Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the application, and Enzyvant anticipates a regulatory decision in December 2019.
<blockquote>
<p id=""pull-quote"">“The long-term data for RVT-802 as a one-time treatment reinforces the potentially life-saving value and durable impact of this therapy. We are committed to working collaboratively with payers to establish a value-based reimbursement model that accelerates access for patients.”</p>

Children with congenital athymia are born without a thymus, resulting in a severe immunodeficiency due to the inability to produce normally functioning T cells, which defend against infection and regulate essential processes in the immune system. Approximately 20 infants are born each year in the United States with congenital athymia, which is fatal if untreated. Death typically occurs in the first 24 months of life due to susceptibility to infection. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for this condition. RVT-802 stimulates and facilitates the body’s production of naive, immunocompetent T cells, with the goal of bolstering the immune system and restoring the body’s ability to fight infection. Investigational RVT-802 is designed to be administered as a single treatment.
“We are proud to be advancing RVT-802, a regenerative therapy that embodies bold, transformative science. The intense urgency to treat infants and young children who would otherwise succumb to congenital athymia drew us to forge a partnership with Duke University and continues to motivate us to advance toward a potential approval with focus and speed,” said Rachelle Jacques, Chief Executive Officer of Enzyvant. “The long-term data for RVT-802 as a one-time treatment reinforces the potentially life-saving value and durable impact of this therapy. We are committed to working collaboratively with payers to establish a value-based reimbursement model that accelerates access for patients.”
The BLA filing for RVT-802 included clinical data that demonstrated long-term durability of treatment with RVT-802. At the time of the BLA filing, a total of 93 patients received RVT-802 across multiple clinical studies, including 85 patients who met the criteria for inclusion in the efficacy analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival [95% confidence interval] at year one and year two post treatment were 76% [66 - 84] and 75% [66 - 83], respectively. For patients surviving 12 months post-treatment, there was a 93% probability of surviving 10 years post-treatment. During clinical development, the most commonly (= 5%) reported RVT-802 related adverse events included thrombocytopenia (11%), neutropenia (8%), pyrexia (5%), and proteinuria (5%).
“The journey of this therapy has involved the dedication and contributions of so many and, most notably, the bravery of patients and their families,” said Dr. Louise Markert, Professor of Pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine, whose pioneering work at Duke led to the development of RVT-802. “It is gratifying to see this therapy advance a significant step closer to a potential FDA approval. We are hopeful we can look to a future of continuing to save children’s lives.”
“We congratulate the Enzyvant team on this important milestone, as well as Dr. Markert and her colleagues at Duke for their remarkable scientific accomplishments and dedication to athymic patients and their families,” said Myrtle Potter, Vant Operating Chair at Roivant Pharma, and Chair of Enzyvant’s Board of Directors. “We look forward to the potential of RVT-802 becoming available as an approved regenerative medicine to all families and patients who could benefit from it.”
Ms. Jacques will be presenting at Roivant Pipeline Day in New York City tomorrow, June 6, at 4:20 p.m. ET.

<b>About RVT-802</b>
RVT-802 is a novel investigational tissue-based regenerative therapy designed to treat primary immune deficiency resulting from pediatric congenital athymia. In a healthy, functioning immune system, T cells that start as stem cells in bone marrow become fully developed in the thymus. RVT-802 is designed to replicate this process in the absence of a thymus.
Derived from infant thymus tissue, RVT-802 is processed and cultured prior to implantation into a patient’s quadricep muscle. The patient’s bone marrow stem cells migrate to the implanted tissue product, where they are trained to become naïve, immunocompetent T cells. With the renewed ability to generate T cells, immune system function can be restored.
RVT-802 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Rare Pediatric Disease, and Orphan Drug designations by the FDA.
In 2016, Enzyvant entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Duke University to develop RVT-802. M. Louise Markert, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine, has led research on the treatment of immunodeficiency in patients with congenital athymia. The findings of Dr. Markert and her research team have been published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> as well as numerous other peer-reviewed scientific journals and clinical publications.

The study known as BRACELET-1 (<strong>BR</strong>east c<strong>A</strong>n<strong>CE</strong>r with the Oncolytic Reovirus Pe<strong>L</strong>areor<strong>E</strong>p in Combina<strong>T</strong>ion with anti-PD-L<strong>1</strong> and Paclitaxel) is an open label study that will enroll 45 patients into three cohorts with 15 patients per cohort: paclitaxel alone, paclitaxel in combination with pelareorep and paclitaxel in combination with both pelareorep and avelumab. The study will examine the expression of immune-related biomarkers to identify changes in T cell clonality between pre-treatment and on-therapy biopsies to confirm our previously identified biomarker and is designed to assess efficacy in terms of overall response rate at week 16 per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST. The safety of the combination will also be evaluated. During the period of the study and for 90 days after a pre-determined interim analysis, Oncolytics may exclusively develop pelareorep in HR+ / HER2- metastatic breast cancer with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer.
*Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2-negative (HR+ / HER2-) metastatic breast cancer and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for this use. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for HR+ / HER2- metastatic breast cancer by any health authority worldwide.
<strong>About avelumab</strong>
Avelumab is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. Avelumab has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, avelumab has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.3-5 Avelumab has also been shown to induce NK cell-mediated direct tumor cell lysis via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) <em>in vitro</em>.5-7 In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab.
<strong>Avelumab Approved Indications</strong>
Avelumab (BAVENCIO<sup>®</sup>) in combination with axitinib is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO©) for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in more than 45 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.
<strong>Avelumab Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label</strong>

<div class=""rich-text"">
AstraZeneca today announced positive results from the Phase III ELEVATE-TN trial of <i>Calquence</i> (acalabrutinib) in patients with previously-untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most common type of leukaemia in adults.<sup>1</sup> This is the second <i>Calquence</i> pivotal trial in CLL to meet its primary endpoint early, following the positive results of the ASCEND trial, <a href=""https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2019/calquence-phase-iii-ascend-trial-met-primary-endpoint-at-interim-analysis-in-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia-and-will-stop-early-07052019.html"">announced in May</a>.
The trial met its primary endpoint; <i>Calquence</i> in combination with obinutuzumab demonstrated a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with the chemotherapy-based combination of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab.
The trial also met a key secondary endpoint showing <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy achieved a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in PFS compared to the chemotherapy and obinutuzumab regimen.
The safety and tolerability of <i>Calquence </i>was consistent with its established profile.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&amp;D said: “These findings confirm the superiority of <i>Calquence </i>as a monotherapy and also in combination<i> </i>over standard-of-care treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The positive results from both the ELEVATE-TN and ASCEND trials will serve as the foundation for regulatory submissions later this year.”
AstraZeneca plans to present detailed results from ELEVATE-TN at a forthcoming medical meeting. Additionally, AstraZeneca will present full results from the Phase III ASCEND clinical trial in relapsed or refractory CLL as a late-breaking abstract at the upcoming European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress on 16 June 2019 (Abstract #LB2606).
<i>Calquence</i> is currently approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the US, Brazil, the UAE, and Qatar and is being developed for the treatment of CLL and other blood cancers.
<b>About ELEVATE-TN</b>
ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) is a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of <i>Calquence</i> alone or in combination with obinutuzumab vs. chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in previously-untreated patients with CLL. In the trial, 535 patients were randomised (1:1:1) into three arms. Patients in the first arm received chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the second arm received <i>Calquence</i> (100mg twice daily until disease progression) in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the third arm received <i>Calquence</i> monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression).<sup>2</sup>
The primary endpoint is PFS in the <i>Calquence</i> and obinutuzumab arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm, assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and a key secondary endpoint is IRC-assessed PFS in the <i>Calquence</i>monotherapy arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm. Other secondary endpoints include objective response rate, time to next treatment and overall survival.<sup>2</sup>
<b>About <i>Calquence</i></b>
<i>Calquence</i> (acalabrutinib) was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
<i>Calquence</i> is an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). <i>Calquence</i> binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.<sup>3</sup>In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.
As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating <i>Calquence</i>in 26 company-sponsored clinical trials. <i>Calquence</i> is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma, and multiple myeloma and other haematologic malignancies. Several Phase III clinical trials in CLL are ongoing, including ASCEND, ELEVATE-TN, ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006) evaluating acalabrutinib vs. ibrutinib in patients with previously-treated high-risk CLL, and ACE-CL-311 evaluating acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax and with/without obinutuzumab in patients with previously-untreated CLL without 17p deletion or TP53 mutation.
<b>About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</b>
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 191,000 new cases globally and 20,720 new cases in the US annually, and prevalence that is expected to grow with improved treatment.<sup>1,4,5,6</sup> In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections.<sup>1</sup> As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.<sup>1</sup> This could result in anaemia, infection and bleeding.<sup>1</sup> B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.

First anti-IL5 biologic to give healthcare professionals choice of how and where their patients receive treatment.
GlaxoSmithKline (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two new methods for administering Nucala (mepolizumab), an autoinjector and a pre-filled safety syringe, for patients or caregivers to administer once every four weeks, after a healthcare professional decides it is appropriate. This is the first anti-IL5 biologic to be licensed in the US for at-home administration, and the first respiratory biologic to be approved for administration via an autoinjector.
This approval will give healthcare professionals and people living with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) or the rare disease eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) the option for Nucala to be administered outside of a clinical setting by a patient or caregiver after their healthcare professional agrees this approach is appropriate. The original lyophilised powder version remains available for administration by a healthcare professional.
<strong>Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President, R&amp;D, GSK, said:</strong> “Nucala’s efficacy is well-established and this approval means that, for the first time, we are able to provide patients living with these debilitating conditions the option of receiving this important medicine in their own home.”
<strong>Tonya Winders, President, Global Allergy and Asthma Patient Platform (GAAPP), added:</strong> “People living with conditions like severe asthma often struggle to control their day-to-day symptoms, making routine activities like attending healthcare appointments a challenge. Empowering patients to take their medicines at home is an approach that has been successful in other chronic diseases such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. GAAPP welcomes this approval for Nucala so it can be administered in a doctor’s office or in the convenience of a patient’s home.”
The approval is supported by positive patient experience data from two open-label, single-arm, phase IIIa studies (NCT03099096 &amp; NCT03021304) evaluating the real-world use of Nucala administered via the new options in-clinic and at home by patients with SEA, or by their caregivers. Both studies showed patients were able to successfully self-administer treatment with both the autoinjector and pre-filled syringe after appropriate training (89-95% and 100% respectively). In addition, the majority of patients preferred at home self-administration options compared to in-clinic administration.
A further open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study (NCT03014674) confirmed that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Nucala administered via pre-filled syringe or autoinjector was comparable to the originally approved lyophilised formulation.
Following this approval, it is expected that the new administration options for Nucala will be available in the US shortly.
<h2>About severe asthma and eosinophilic inflammation</h2>
Severe asthma is defined as asthma which requires treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming ‘uncontrolled’ or which remains ‘uncontrolled’ despite this therapy. Severe asthma patients are also often categorised by long-term use of oral corticosteroids (OCS). In a sub-set of severe asthma patients, the over-production of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) is known to cause inflammation in the lungs. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. Studies suggest that approximately 60% of patients with severe asthma have eosinophilic airway inflammation.
<h2>About eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)</h2>
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome, is a chronic rare disease that is caused by inflammation in the walls of small-to-medium sized blood vessels (vasculitis). Approximately five people out of every one million will be diagnosed with EGPA each year worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 14-45 per million. The mean age of diagnosis is 48 years, and the disease can be life-threatening for some patients. In EGPA, patients usually develop asthma initially, before the vasculitis extends to inflammation in the walls of small blood vessels that supply tissues in the lungs, sinuses, skin, nerves and other organs. EGPA can result in damage to multiple organs in the body.
<h2>About Nucala (mepolizumab)</h2>
First approved in 2015 for severe eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab is the first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets IL-5. It is believed to work by preventing IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils. Inhibiting IL-5 binding in this way reduces blood eosinophils.
Mepolizumab has been developed for the treatment of diseases that are driven by inflammation caused by eosinophils. It has been studied in over 3,000 patients in 21 clinical trials across a number of eosinophilic indications and has been approved (under the brand name Nucala) in the US, Europe and in over 20 other markets, as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. It is also the only anti-IL5 biologic therapy approved for paediatric use from aged six to 17 in Europe in severe eosinophilic asthma. In the US, Japan and Canada and a number of other markets, it is approved as add-on maintenance treatment for patients with EGPA. Mepolizumab is currently being investigated for severe hypereosinophilic syndrome, nasal polyposis and COPD.
In the US, Nucala (100mg fixed dose subcutaneous injection of mepolizumab) is licensed as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma aged 12 years and older, and with an eosinophilic phenotype. Nucala (3x 100mg subcutaneous injection of mepolizumab) is licensed for the treatment of adult patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Nucala is not approved for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Full US Prescribing Information is available at <a href=""https://gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribing_Information/Nucala/pdf/NUCALA-PI-PIL.PDF"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">US Prescribing Information Nucala</a>.
Nucala injection is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare provider. A patient may self-inject or the patient caregiver may administer Nucala injection subcutaneously after the healthcare provider determines it is appropriate. The healthcare provider should provide proper training in subcutaneous injection technique and on the preparation and administration of Nucala injection prior to use according to the “Instructions for Use”.
<h2>Important safety information for Nucala (mepolizumab)</h2>
The following information is based on the US Prescribing Information for Nucala. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labelled safety information for Nucala.
<strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS</strong>
Nucala should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to mepolizumab or excipients in the formulation.
<strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</strong>
<strong>Hypersensitivity Reactions
</strong>Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, rash) have occurred following administration of Nucala. These reactions generally occur within hours of administration but in some instances can have a delayed onset (i.e. days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, Nucala should be discontinued.
<strong>Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease
</strong>Nucala should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, or acute bronchospasm.
<strong>Opportunistic Infections: Herpes Zoster
</strong>In controlled clinical trials, 2 serious adverse reactions of herpes zoster occurred in subjects treated with Nucala compared to none in placebo. Consider varicella vaccination if medically appropriate prior to starting therapy with Nucala.
<strong>Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage
</strong><a name=""_Toc141171983""></a>Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) abruptly upon initiation of therapy with Nucala. Decreases in corticosteroid doses, if appropriate, should be gradual and under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.
<strong>Parasitic (Helminth) Infection
</strong>It is unknown if Nucala will influence a patient’s response against parasites. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with Nucala. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with Nucala and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with Nucala until infection resolves.
<strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS
</strong>
The most common adverse reactions (=3% and more common than placebo) reported in the first 24 weeks of two clinical trials with Nucala (and placebo) were: headache, 19% (18%); injection site reaction, 8% (3%); back pain, 5% (4%); fatigue, 5% (4%); influenza, 3% (2%); urinary tract infection 3% (2%); abdominal pain upper, 3% (2%); pruritus, 3% (2%); eczema, 3% (&lt;1%); and muscle spasm, 3% (&lt;1%).
Systemic Reactions, including Hypersensitivity Reactions:  In 3 clinical trials, 3% of subjects who received Nucala experienced systemic (allergic and nonallergic) reactions compared to 5% in the placebo group. Systemic allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 1% of subjects who received Nucala compared to 2% of subjects in the placebo group. Manifestations included rash, pruritus, headache, and myalgia. Systemic nonallergic reactions were reported by 2% of subjects who received Nucala and 3% of subjects in the placebo group. Manifestations included rash, flushing, and myalgia. A majority of the systemic reactions were experienced on the day of dosing. Reports of anaphylaxis have been received postmarketing.
Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, swelling, itching, burning sensation) occurred at a rate of 8% in subjects treated with Nucala compared with 3% in subjects treated with placebo.
<strong>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</strong>
The data on pregnancy exposures from the clinical trials are insufficient to inform on drug-associated risk. Monoclonal antibodies, such as mepolizumab, are progressively transported across the placenta in a linear fashion as pregnancy progresses; therefore, potential effects on a foetus are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
<h2>GSK’s commitment to respiratory disease</h2>
For 50 years, GSK has led the way in developing medicines that advance the management of asthma and COPD. From introducing the world’s first selective short-acting beta agonist in 1969, to launching six treatments in five years to create today’s industry-leading respiratory portfolio, we continue to innovate so we can reach the right patients, with the right treatment. Working together with the healthcare community, we apply world-class science to discover and understand the molecules that become the medicines of tomorrow. We won’t stand still until the simple act of breathing is made easier for everyone.

<i> </i>
<b>Basel, June 6, 2019</b> <b>- </b>Novartis announced today new early stage histology data in kidney transplantation, suggesting that with investigational compound iscalimab (CFZ533) it may be possible to prolong the durability of transplanted kidneys as well as to potentially improve long-term outcomes for kidney transplant patients[1].
""Extending the life of transplanted kidneys would mean fewer patients going back on dialysis or needing a second transplant - relieving pressure on waiting lists that in the US are already three-to-five years long,"" said Eric Hughes, Global Development Unit Head, Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology. ""In our journey to reimagine care for patients, I'm excited about the potential of durable transplants becoming a reality.""
The data, presented at the American Transplant Congress (ATC) examines whether calcineurin-free treatment with iscalimab preserves the quality of transplanted kidney grafts. In this analysis, iscalimab demonstrated lower chronic allograft damage index (CADI) scores compared with tacrolimus (current standard-of-care), with normal renal histology seen in three of five patients (60%) on iscalimab vs none of seven on tacrolimus[1]. Low CADI scores have been associated with improved long-term outcomes[4]. The findings, although in a limited number of patients, are to be confirmed in an ongoing Phase IIb trial (Cirrus I, NCT03663335).
<b>About iscalimab (CFZ533)</b>
Iscalimab is a new, fully human, monoclonal antibody preventing cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) pathway signaling and activation of CD40+ cell types[1]. In a recent multicenter, randomized control trial (NCT02217410), with the primary endpoint of non-inferiority on the composite endpoint, iscalimab therapy showed non-inferiority on a composite clinical endpoint, improved renal function, reduced risk for new onset diabetes and similar safety compared with tacrolimus[5]. The analysis presented at the ATC included patients from this study that underwent either routine biopsies or biopsies as part of a follow-up protocol. The data was reviewed and scored by a blinded pathologist using the established Banff criteria and CADI. A CADI of 1 or less was considered as 'normal renal histology'. The average CADI at final biopsy was 1.6 ±0.6 for iscalimab and 5.1 ±0.8 for tacrolimus[1].

<p align=""center""><b>Advanced Accelerator Applications Receives Positive CHMP Opinion for LysaKare<sup>®</sup> for Reduction of Kidney Exposure to Radiation During Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with Lutetium (<sup>177</sup>Lu) Oxodotreotide (Lutathera<sup>®</sup>)</b></p>
<b>Saint-Genis-Pouilly, France, June 5, 2019 - Advanced Accelerator Applications S.A. </b>(AAA), a Novartis company, today announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization of LysaKare<b><sup>®</sup></b>25g/25g (arginine hydrochloride/lysine hydrochloride) solution for reduction of renal (kidney) radiation exposure during peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with lutetium (<sup>177</sup>Lu) oxodotreotide (Lutathera<sup>®</sup>) in adults.  If approved by the European Commission, LysaKare would be the first commercially registered arginine hydrochloride/lysine hydrochloride amino acid solution of this concentration available in Europe.
Lutathera, indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated (G1 and G2), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) in adults, was the first PRRT ever approved by the European Commission in September 2017. Lutathera PRRT includes a targeting molecule attached to a radioactive component. The kidneys are the primary dose limiting organs for PRRT with Lutathera, and a lysine and arginine amino acid solution is co-administered to patients to reduce renal uptake and retention of Lutathera, thus reducing renal radiation exposure by approximately 50% and mitigating the risk for radiation-induced renal injury.
""LysaKare was developed to enhance patient safety and comfort during PRRT with Lutathera,"" noted Germo Gericke, M.D., Head of Research and Development for Advanced Accelerator Applications. ""This positive opinion by the CHMP supports our commitment to providing the best and most comprehensive care possible.""
Clinical efficacy and safety for arginine and lysine are based on published literature of studies using solutions with the same arginine and lysine content as LysaKare. There are limited data on the safety profile of arginine and lysine solution for infusion without concomitant administration of PRRT, which also includes the use of anti-emetics as pre-medication and often the concomitant use of short acting somatostatin analogues. The main adverse reactions which are related mainly to the amino acid solution are nausea (approximately 25%), vomiting (approximately 10%) and hyperkalaemia. These adverse reactions are mostly mild to moderate.
The European Commission (EC) takes binding decisions on the authorization of medicines valid throughout the EU. It bases its decisions on scientific assessments by the CHMP, ensuring that medicines comply with high quality, safety and efficacy standards. If approved by the EC, the centralized marketing authorization will be valid in the 28 countries that are members of the EU. Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as members of the European Economic Area (EEA), will take corresponding decisions based on the EC's recommendation.
The European Commission will review the CHMP opinion and is expected to deliver its final decision within three months. The decision will be applicable to all 28 European Union member states plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

<b>Pivotal phase 3 data in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes presented at the American Diabetes Association's&lt;span&gt;®&lt;/span&gt; 79th Scientific Sessions&lt;span&gt;®&lt;/span&gt;</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
INDIANAPOLIS, June 9, 2019 /- Two phase 3 studies show that Eli Lilly and Company's (NYSE: LLY) ultra rapid lispro (URLi) provided non-inferior A1C reductions compared to Humalog<sup>®</sup> (insulin lispro) at 26 weeks in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The data from these treat-to-target studies showed URLi also significantly reduced the rise in blood glucose one hour and two hours after a test meal compared to Humalog.<sup>1,2</sup> Additional data from the study in people with type 1 diabetes demonstrated URLi significantly improved glucose time in range during the day.<sup>3</sup> URLi is an investigational novel mealtime insulin formulation being developed to better manage blood glucose levels. These data and several other studies were presented at the American Diabetes Association's<sup>®</sup> 79<sup>th</sup> Scientific Sessions<sup>®</sup>.
The two phase 3 studies, PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D, evaluated the safety and efficacy of URLi compared to Humalog in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Both studies met the primary endpoint of non-inferior A1C reduction from baseline compared to Humalog at 26 weeks, when the insulins were dosed at mealtime. Further, URLi demonstrated superior reduction in blood glucose spikes at both one hour (-27.9 mg/dL [T1D], -11.8 mg/dL [T2D]) and two hours (-31.2 mg/dL [T1D] and -17.4 mg/dL [T2D]) after a test meal compared to Humalog.<sup>1,2</sup>
Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin. The studies showed no significant difference in severe, nocturnal or overall hypoglycemia rates reported by study participants.<sup>1,2</sup>
""Many people taking mealtime insulin are not meeting their A1C goals while also experiencing high blood glucose levels after eating. This may create worry about their ability to achieve good control,"" said Bruce Bode, MD, FACE, diabetes specialist at Atlanta Diabetes Associates.<sup>4</sup> ""The results from these two studies suggest that URLi may help control blood glucose after meals, as well as help people reach A1C goals.""
The PRONTO studies were designed as treat-to-target, which enables clinicians to determine differences in other important treatment effects – such as rates of hypoglycemia, post-meal glucose control and glucose time in range – at the same level of glycemic control. A sub-set of participants in PRONTO-T1D were evaluated using blinded continuous glucose monitoring to provide more complete information on daily blood glucose patterns. At 26 weeks, URLi demonstrated a significantly better blood glucose profile up to four hours after breakfast compared to Humalog. The study further showed that URLi had significantly longer (+43.6 minutes) time in range (71-180 mg/dL) during the day and similar time in range during the night compared to Humalog.<sup>3</sup>
Data from a phase 1 clinical pharmacology study in people with type 1 diabetes also demonstrated URLi's effect on post-meal blood glucose control. Results showed URLi was absorbed significantly faster into the blood stream compared to Humalog, insulin aspart and fast-acting insulin aspart. URLi also showed lower blood glucose spikes after a test meal compared to the insulins tested, which was significant compared to Humalog and insulin aspart. Additionally, the early blood glucose profile with URLi closely matched that of participants without diabetes.<sup>5</sup>
""We're developing URLi to provide a mealtime insulin option that more closely mirrors the way insulin works in people without diabetes,"" said Tom Hardy, MD, PhD, senior medical director at Lilly. ""If approved, URLi will offer a new mealtime insulin option that, in clinical trials, showed similar A1C reductions to Humalog with significant improvements in post-meal blood glucose after a test meal.""
Lilly submitted applications for URLi with regulatory authorities in Europe and Japan and plans to submit in the U.S. later this year.
<b>About the PRONTO Studies
</b>PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D were randomized, double-blind, controlled, treat-to-target comparisons of ultra rapid lispro (URLi) and Humalog (insulin lispro), both in combination with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The primary objective of each study, conducted in 1,222 and 673 participants, respectively, was to evaluate whether URLi is non-inferior to Humalog in reducing A1C from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment. Key endpoints were adjusted for multiple testing, including the comparisons of one and two hour post-prandial glucose and A1C superiority.
<b>Important Safety Information for Humalog</b>
<b>What is the most important information I should know about Humalog?</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li><b>Do not share your Humalog KwikPen, Humalog Junior KwikPen, cartridges, reusable pen compatible with Lilly 3 mL cartridges, or syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them.</b></li>
 	<li>Do not change the insulin you use without talking to your healthcare provider. Changes may make you more likely to experience low or high blood glucose. Changes should be made cautiously under the supervision of your healthcare provider.</li>
 	<li>Test your blood glucose levels as your healthcare provider instructs.</li>
 	<li>Your insulin dose may need to change because of illness, stress, other medicines you take, change in diet, or change in physical activity or exercise.</li>
 	<li>When used in a pump, do not mix or dilute Humalog with any other insulin or liquid.</li>
</ul>
<b>Who should not take Humalog?</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Do not take Humalog if your blood glucose is too low (hypoglycemia) or if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the ingredients in Humalog.</li>
</ul>
<b>Before using Humalog, what should I tell my healthcare providers?</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>About all of your medical conditions, including liver, kidney, or heart failure or other heart problems.</li>
 	<li>If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.</li>
 	<li>About all the medicines you take, including prescription (especially ones commonly called TZDs [thiazolidinediones]) and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.</li>
</ul>
<b>How should I use Humalog?</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Humalog is a rapid-acting insulin. Take Humalog within fifteen minutes before eating or right after eating a meal.</li>
 	<li>Always make sure you receive the correct type of Humalog from the pharmacy.</li>
 	<li>Do not use Humalog if it is cloudy, colored, or has solid particles or clumps in it.</li>
 	<li>Inject Humalog under your skin (subcutaneously). Never inject into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) your injection site with each dose. Make sure you inject the correct insulin and dose.</li>
 	<li>Do not re-use needles. Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles can cause you to receive the wrong dose of Humalog and result in infection.</li>
 	<li>Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how Humalog affects you. Do not use alcohol while using Humalog.</li>
</ul>
<b>What are the possible side effects of Humalog?</b>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>Severe low blood glucose can cause unconsciousness (passing out), seizures, and death. Low blood glucose is the most common side effect. There are many causes of low blood glucose, including taking too much Humalog. It is important to treat it quickly. You can treat mild to moderate low blood glucose by drinking or eating a quick source of glucose right away. Symptoms may be different for each person. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about low blood glucose symptoms and treatment.</li>
 	<li>Severe life-threatening allergic reactions (whole-body reactions) can happen. Get medical help right away if you develop a rash over your whole body, have trouble breathing, have a fast heartbeat, or are sweating.</li>
 	<li>Humalog can cause life-threatening low potassium in your blood (hypokalemia), which can cause severe breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and death.</li>
 	<li>Serious side effects can include swelling of your hands and feet and heart failure when taking certain pills called thiazolidinediones or ""TZDs"" with Humalog. This may occur in some people even if they have not had heart problems before. Tell your healthcare provider if you have shortness of breath, swelling of your ankles or feet, or sudden weight gain, which may be symptoms of heart failure. Your healthcare provider may need to adjust or stop your treatment with TZDs or Humalog.</li>
 	<li>Failure of your insulin pump or infusion set or degradation of the insulin in the pump can cause hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Always carry an alternate form of insulin administration in case of pump failure.</li>
 	<li>The most common side effects of Humalog include low blood glucose, allergic reactions, including reactions at your injection site, skin thickening or pits at the injection site (lipodystrophy), itching, and rash. These are not all of the possible side effects. Ask your healthcare provider for more information or for medical advice about side effects.</li>

KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tilos Therapeutics, a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics targeting the latent TGFß complex for the treatment of cancer, fibrosis and autoimmune diseases.
“At Merck we continue to enhance our robust pipeline through active execution of our business development strategy,"" said Dr. Dean Li, senior vice president, discovery and translational medicine, Merck Research Laboratories. “Tilos has developed a compelling portfolio of candidates that employ a novel approach to modulating the potent signaling molecule TGFß by binding to latency-associated peptide, with potential applications across a range of disease indications.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all outstanding shares of Tilos for total potential consideration of up to $773 million, including an upfront payment as well as contingent milestone payments.
“We are proud that the Tilos team has advanced the discoveries of our scientific founders by developing a portfolio of anti-LAP antibodies designed to realize the full potential of TGFß-modulating therapeutics,” said Dr. Barbara Fox, CEO, Tilos. “This agreement with Merck, an industry leader in biopharmaceutical research and development, provides meaningful validation for our therapeutic approach and best positions our pipeline for broad clinical and commercial success.”
Tilos was founded by Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund and Partners Innovation Fund, based on discoveries by the laboratory of Dr. Howard Weiner at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Additional investment was provided by ShangPharma Innovation Fund.
<b>About TGFß and LAP</b>
TGFß is a potent cytokine believed to play an important role in the development of cancer and fibrotic diseases. TGFß is secreted as a complex with the protein, latency-associated peptide (LAP). LAP forms a cage around TGFß, holding the cytokine in an inactive state until it is deployed. Evidence has shown that anti-LAP antibodies block the release of TGFß from the TGFß-LAP complex with the potential to provide a novel therapeutic mechanism to reduce TGFß activity.
<b>About Merck</b>
For more than a century, Merck, a leading global biopharmaceutical company known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world’s most challenging diseases. Through our prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products, we work with customers and operate in more than 140 countries to deliver innovative health solutions.

DUBLIN and PALO ALTO, Calif. - June 7, 2019 - Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, services and solutions, and Tidepool, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to making diabetes data more accessible, actionable and meaningful, have agreed to work together to create an interoperable automated insulin pump system. Medtronic will develop a future Bluetooth-enabled MiniMed(TM) pump that would be compatible with Tidepool Loop, a future FDA-regulated, open source automated insulin delivery app for iPhone® and Apple Watch® currently in development.
""We think that Medtronic is making a very bold and important move here that shows tremendous courage and is the absolutely right thing for the diabetes community,"" said Howard Look, founder and CEO of Tidepool. ""Medtronic makes incredibly robust and reliable pump hardware, and they have extensive marketing, sales, and support organizations for people with diabetes and for healthcare providers. This network can help bring closed-loop systems to more people living with diabetes.""
As part of the agreement, Medtronic will contribute financial support to Tidepool for the integration development effort and develop a software development kit to enable iPhone to pump communication. Both companies will be working closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the regulatory process to garner approvals for both the Tidepool Loop app and the future Bluetooth-enabled MiniMed(TM) pump that will work with Tidepool Loop. This includes pursuing iCGM (Integrated Continuous Glucose Monitoring) classification for the Guardian(TM) Sensor 3 and ACE (Alternate Controller Enabled) pump classification for a future Bluetooth-enabled MiniMed pump. This would enable an FDA-cleared interoperable system - with ACE pump and iCGM sensor components - that may be mixed and matched with the Tidepool Loop app as the user chooses.
""We have been listening and engaging with the diabetes community to understand what is important to them. We recognize that collaboration with Tidepool is a way to further drive industry innovation,"" said Ali Dianaty, vice president of research and development for the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. ""Working with Tidepool and supporting interoperability, we can increase the options available for people with diabetes to manage their condition as they seek out solutions that help them achieve better health and improve quality of life.""
Tidepool Loop will be an automated insulin delivery app for iPhone and Apple Watch that connects to an insulin pump and CGM using Bluetooth LE. It runs an algorithm every five minutes to adjust a user's basal rate for the next 30 minutes, with the goal to help reduce or avoid high and low blood glucose. Tidepool intends to deliver Tidepool Loop as an FDA-regulated product, broadly available via the iOS App Store, compatible with multiple, in-warranty pumps and CGMs.
About Tidepool
Tidepool is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission of making diabetes data more accessible, actionable, and meaningful by liberating data from diabetes devices, supporting researchers, and providing great software to the entire diabetes community, including people living with diabetes and their healthcare providers.

 	<li><strong>New targeted medicine shown to improve clinical outcomes in people with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma compared to a commonly used regimen</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>First-in-class antibody-drug conjugate that specifically targets CD79b, a protein expressed in the majority of B-cells</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Ninth indication with Breakthrough Therapy Designation in Roche’s haematology portfolio to receive FDA approval</strong></li>
</ul>
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to Polivy™ (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq) in combination with bendamustine plus Rituxan® (rituximab) (BR) for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have received at least two prior therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on complete response rates observed in a randomised, controlled clinical trial. The FDA's Accelerated Approval Program allows conditional approval of a medicine that fills an unmet medical need for a serious condition. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
“Despite meaningful progress in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, treatment options are very limited when the disease is refractory to or recurrent after multiple regimens,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Today’s approval of this Polivy combination will provide a novel treatment that is both immediately available and very much needed for people with this aggressive disease.”
The accelerated approval of Polivy was based on the results from the phase Ib/II GO29365 study. This is the first and only randomised pivotal clinical trial to show higher response rates over BR, a commonly used regimen, in people with R/R DLBCL who are ineligible for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant. Results of the study showed that 40% of people treated with Polivy plus BR achieved a complete response (n=16/40; 95% CI: 25-57), meaning no cancer could be detected at the time of assessment, compared to 18% with BR alone (n=7/40; 95% CI: 7-33). Complete response rates were assessed by independent review committee. The study also showed that 45% of people on Polivy plus BR achieved an objective response at the end of treatment (n=18/40; 95% CI: 29-62), compared to 18% of people treated with BR alone (n=7/40; 95% CI: 7-33). Of the people treated with Polivy plus BR who achieved a complete or partial response, 64% (n=16/25) had a duration of response (DOR) lasting at least six months as compared to 30% (n=3/10) of people treated with BR alone. Additionally, 48% (n=12/25) of people treated with Polivy plus BR had a DOR lasting at least a year as compared to 20% (n=2/10) of people treated with BR alone. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of patients, and at least 5% more frequently in patients treated with Polivy plus BR compared to BR alone, included low white blood cell count, low platelet levels, low red blood cell count, numbness, tingling or pain in the hands and feet, diarrhoea, fever, decreased appetite and pneumonia.
The US FDA granted Priority Review for the company’s Biologics License Application for Polivy in February 2019. Priority Review designation is granted to medicines that the FDA considers to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. In addition, Polivy was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of people with R/R DLBCL in 2017. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines intended to treat a serious condition with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies.
<h3>About the GO29365 study</h3>
GO29365 is a global, phase Ib/II randomised study evaluating the safety, tolerability and activity of Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq) in combination with bendamustine and Rituxan (rituximab) (BR) or Gazyva (obinutuzumab) in relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Eligible patients were not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant at study entry. The phase II part of the study randomised 80 patients with heavily pre-treated R/R DLBCL to receive either BR, or BR in combination with Polivy for a fixed duration of six 21-day cycles. Patients enrolled had received a median of two prior therapies (a range of 1-7 prior therapies in the Polivy arm and range of 1-5 prior therapies in the BR alone arm). The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) at the end of treatment, as measured by positron emission tomography and assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR; CR and partial response) by investigator assessment and best ORR at the end of treatment by investigator and IRC assessment. Exploratory endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, event-free survival and overall survival.
<h3>About Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq)</h3>
Polivy is a first-in-class anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The CD79b protein is expressed specifically in the majority of B-cells (an immune cell impacted in some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)), making it a promising target for the development of new therapies.<sup>1,2</sup> Polivy binds to CD79b and destroys these B-cells through the delivery of an anti-cancer agent, which is thought to minimise the effects on normal cells.<sup>3,4</sup> Polivy is being developed by Roche using Seattle Genetics ADC technology and is currently being investigated for the treatment of several types of NHL.
<h3>About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</h3>
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about one in three cases of NHL.<sup>5</sup> DLBCL is an aggressive (fast-growing) type of NHL, which is generally responsive to treatment in the frontline.<sup>6</sup> However, as many as 40% of patients will relapse, at which time salvage therapy options are limited and survival is short.<sup>1,4</sup> Approximately 150,000 people worldwide are estimated to be diagnosed with DLBCL each year.<sup>7</sup>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","INDIANAPOLIS, June 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today the company will present positive, five-year Phase 3 data for Taltz® (ixekizumab). Patients with moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis who continued to receive Taltz maintained high levels of skin clearance with no unexpected safety outcomes for up to five years of treatment. These data will be presented at the World Congress of Dermatology (WCD) in Milan, Italy on June 11.
“Of patients who continued to take Taltz through five years in the extension period of this study, more than 90 percent maintained significant skin clearance as measured by PASI 75 and almost half of patients maintained completely clear skin,” said Craig Leonardi, M.D., lead investigator of the study and adjunct professor of dermatology at St. Louis University School of Medicine. “These results demonstrate that patients taking Taltz can achieve sustained skin clearance over the five-year treatment period.”
Patients who were static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) 0/1 responders at Week 12 and who completed 60 weeks of treatment could enter the open-label extension period of UNCOVER-1 (n=110). In the extension period of the study, Taltz demonstrated sustained response from Week 60 through Week 264 in patients who continuously received on-label dosing (160 mg starting dose, 80 mg every two weeks [Q2W] through Week 12, and every four weeks [Q4W] thereafter). Response rates were maintained over the five-year period, with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 90 and 100 response rates of 94.3 percent, 81.8 percent and 46.6 percent, respectively at week 264.
“Lilly is committed to helping people living with immune-mediated diseases, including moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis,” said Rhonda Pacheco, Pharm.D., global brand development leader for immunology at Lilly. “These results reaffirm that the high levels of skin clearance Taltz can provide early in treatment may be sustained over a long period of time.”
During Weeks 60-264, treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with previous studies of Taltz from the UNCOVER program. Additionally, there were no new or unexpected safety findings during the extension period. Four-year data from UNCOVER-3 will also be presented at the WCD.
The Taltz safety profile has been studied in 13 clinical trials in moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis with a total exposure of more than 17,000 patient-years as part of the Taltz clinical trial program.
Later this year, Lilly plans to announce the results from IXORA-R, a clinical trial designed to evaluate superiority between Taltz and Tremfya® (guselkumab) in adult patients with moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR TALTZ
Taltz is approved for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. Taltz is also approved to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TALTZ
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections
Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.
Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis
Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
Hypersensitivity
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each =0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group (Crohn’s disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than in the placebo group (0%) during clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease.
Immunizations
Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions (>1%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis was consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis.
Please see accompanying Prescribing Information and Medication Guide. Please see Instructions for Use included with the device.

About Taltz®
Taltz® (ixekizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with interleukin 17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Taltz inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
About Moderate- to Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune disease that affects the skin.1 It occurs when the immune system sends out faulty signals that speed up the growth cycle of skin cells. Psoriasis affects approximately 125 million people worldwide, approximately 20 percent of whom have moderate- to severe plaque psoriasis.1,2 Psoriasis can occur on any part of the body, including the genital area.1 Up to 63 percent of psoriasis patients experience genital psoriasis over the course of their disease.3 The most common form of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis, appears as raised, red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells.1 Patients with plaque psoriasis often have other serious health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.1

<h3><strong>
</strong><em>Innovative Health Solution’s IB-Stim is first treatment indicated to reduce functional abdominal pain in children with IBS</em></h3>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<strong>INDIANAPOLIS </strong>– Innovative Health Solutions, Inc. (IHS) announced today <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-first-medical-device-relief-pain-associated-irritable-bowel-syndrome-patients"">FDA clearance</a> for its new device – IB-Stim – to treat functional abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in patients ages 11-18. IBS is one of the leading causes of abdominal pain in children.
“This is a monumental day for the millions of children suffering from functional abdominal pain related to IBS, along with their parents and clinical providers,” said IHS Chief Executive Officer Brian Carrico. “We know how debilitating this condition can be, and we are proud to release IB-Stim as the first FDA indicated treatment option for this patient population.”
The IB-Stim is a non-surgical device that is placed behind the patient’s ear during an outpatient visit and works by sending gentle electrical impulses into cranial nerve bundles located in the ear. This stimulation targets brain areas involved in processing pain and aids in the reduction of functional abdominal pain associated with IBS.
The FDA based its decision on a double blind, randomized, controlled trial which was designed to measure the effects of IB-Stim compared to placebo on several aspects of pain including worst pain and the pain-frequency-severity-duration composite score. The study also measured patients’ overall symptom improvement based on the Symptom Response Scale. The study showed that prior to IB-Stim treatment, 70 percent of patients had failed to improve with an average of four medications trialed. Patients treated with IB-Stim demonstrated an 81 percent improvement in global symptoms with no serious adverse events, and minimal to no side effects.
“We are thrilled that the laboratory studies translated to the clinical side,” said Dr. Adrian Miranda, chief medical officer for IHS. “This is an example of true translational research. We are committed to improving the lives of children and their families and couldn’t be happier with the FDA’s decision.”
With FDA indication, IB-Stim is now available for medical providers. Click <a href=""http://www.ibstim.com/"">here</a> for more information about IB-Stim.

<span class=""xn-location first-child"">NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">June 11, 2019</span> /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced new results showing a significant number of patients treated with SKYRIZI™ (risankizumab) experienced complete skin clearance at week 94.<sup>1</sup> In the study, at week 28 patients who achieved a static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0/1) were re-randomized to continue treatment with SKYRIZI or withdrawal.<sup>1</sup> After 94 weeks of continuous treatment with SKYRIZI, 73 percent and 72 percent of these patients achieved a sPGA score of clear (sPGA 0) and a 100 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100), respectively, compared to 2 percent of patients re-randomized to withdrawal (p&lt;0.001).<sup>1</sup> These two-year results (up to 104 weeks) from the Phase 3 IMMhance study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of SKYRIZI in adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, will be presented today at the 24th World Congress of Dermatology (WCD) in <span class=""xn-location last-child"">Milan</span>.
""Results show that SKYRIZI has the potential to provide long-term relief from the signs and symptoms of psoriasis,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child last-child"">Marek Honczarenko</span>, M.D., Ph. D., vice president, immunology development, AbbVie. ""Our studies demonstrated that SKYRIZI can not only offer complete skin clearance at two years of treatment for the majority of patients, but re-treatment with SKYRIZI following a relapse can help patients regain skin clearance in just 16 weeks. We are pleased to add positive long-term data to the growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety profile of SKYRIZI for adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.""
SKYRIZI is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.
There were two phases in the IMMhance study.<sup class=""first-child"">1</sup> Results from the first phase were <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2490817-1&amp;h=2700844680&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.abbvie.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Frisankizumab-meets-all-primary-endpoints-reporting-positive-results-in-fourth-pivotal-phase-3-psoriasis-study.htM&A=previously+reported"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">previously reported</a> and showed that after 16 weeks of treatment, SKYRIZI (n=407) met the co-primary endpoints of PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 versus placebo (n=100) (p&lt;0.001).<sup>1</sup> The second phase (week 28 through week 104) evaluated the efficacy and safety of continuous therapy with SKYRIZI versus randomized withdrawal, as well as re-treatment.<sup>1</sup> Patients who achieved sPGA 0/1 at week 28 with SKYRIZI were re-randomized to continue SKYRIZI (n=111) every 12 weeks or to withdrawal (n=225).<sup>1</sup> The primary endpoint from the second phase of the study, sPGA 0/1, was also met at one year (52 weeks) (p&lt;0.001).<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>
For those re-randomized to continue SKYRIZI, the last dose was given at week 88.<sup class=""first-child"">1</sup> Between one year (week 52) and week 94, the proportion of these patients who achieved complete skin clearance continued to increase.<sup>1</sup> sPGA 0 and PASI 100 responses increased from 65 percent and 64 percent at week 52 to 73 percent and 72 percent at week 94, respectively (p&lt;0.001).<sup>1</sup> At two years, 81 percent and 78 percent of patients treated with continuous SKYRIZI maintained clear or almost clear skin (sPGA 0/1 or PASI 90) compared to 7 percent and 4 percent re-randomized to withdrawal, respectively (p&lt;0.001).<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>
Among patients re-randomized to withdrawal who experienced a loss of response (defined as a sPGA score of moderate to severe [=3]) on or after week 32 (n=153), 84 percent regained clear or almost clear skin (sPGA 0/1) after 16 weeks of re-treatment with SKYRIZI.<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1</sup>
""In the IMMhance study, SKYRIZI provided an increasing number of patients with complete skin clearance up to 94 weeks,"" said <span class=""xn-person first-child"">Melinda Gooderham</span>, M.D., dermatologist and medical director at the SKiN Centre for Dermatology in <span class=""xn-location last-child"">Peterborough, Ontario</span> and a study investigator. ""SKYRIZI not only offers relief from the signs and symptoms of psoriasis following a withdrawal from medication, but the study further demonstrates the significant rates of complete skin clearance that can be achieved with continuous treatment at the recommended dose. These data underscore the lasting impact this new treatment option could provide for people living with psoriasis.""
No new safety findings were observed in patients who continued with SKYRIZI for two years compared with those who withdrew to placebo at week 28.<sup class=""first-child"">1</sup> Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar to placebo at week 16 and remained stable over time in patients treated with SKYRIZI.<sup class=""last-child"">1</sup>
<b class=""first-child last-child"">About the Phase 3 IMMhance Study<sup class=""first-child last-child"">1</sup></b>
The IMMhance study is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SKYRIZI compared to placebo in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In the first phase, patients were randomized 4:1 to SKYRIZI (n=407)(150 mg), given as a subcutaneous injection at baseline, 4 weeks later and every 12 weeks thereafter, or placebo (n=100). In the second phase of this study (week 28 through week 104), patients originally randomized to SKYRIZI who achieved sPGA 0/1 at week 28 were re-randomized to SKYRIZI (maintenance, n=111) or placebo (withdrawal, n=225). Safety was assessed in all patients. Patients received their last dose of SKYRIZI at week 88 and follow up was conducted until week 104.
This Phase 3 study was conducted in cooperation between AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim.

<b class=""first-child last-child"">About SKYRIZI (risankizumab) in the European Union<sup class=""first-child last-child"">3</sup></b>
SKYRIZI (risankizumab) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.
<b class=""first-child last-child"">Important EU Safety Information<sup class=""first-child last-child"">3</sup></b>
SKYRIZI is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. SKYRIZI may increase the risk of infection. In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, SKYRIZI should be used with caution. Treatment with SKYRIZI should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.
Prior to initiating treatment with SKYRIZI, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients receiving SKYRIZI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating SKYRIZI in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.
Prior to initiating therapy with SKYRIZI, completion of all appropriate immunizations should be considered according to current immunization guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with SKYRIZI. Patients treated with SKYRIZI should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections, which occurred in 13 percent of patients. Commonly (greater than or equal to 1/100 to less than 1/10) reported adverse reactions included tinea infections, headache, pruritus, fatigue and injection site reactions.

<b>- CAROLINA® demonstrated no increased cardiovascular risk for Tradjenta® (linagliptin) versus glimepiride in the only active-comparator cardiovascular outcome trial for a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor</b><b>- Adults with diabetes treated with Tradjenta experienced fewer events of hypoglycemia and a modest weight reduction compared with glimepiride</b><b>- Detailed results from CAROLINA were presented at the American Diabetes Association's 79th Scientific Sessions</b>
<div class=""xn-content"">
RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, June 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced detailed findings from the CAROLINA<sup>®</sup> trial demonstrating that Tradjenta<sup>®</sup> (linagliptin) did not increase cardiovascular risk compared with glimepiride in adults with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk. The findings were reported today at the American Diabetes Association's79<sup>th</sup> Scientific Sessions<sup>®</sup> in San Francisco.
The trial met its primary endpoint, defined as non-inferiority for Tradjenta versus glimepiride in time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE), which occurred in 11.8% (356 people) of the Tradjenta group compared with 12.0% (362 people) of the glimepiride group. The overall safety profile of Tradjenta in CAROLINA was consistent with previous data, and no new safety signals were observed.
The study assessed Tradjenta safety over the longest period ever studied in a DPP-4 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trial, with a median follow-up of more than 6 years. Tradjenta was similar to glimepiride in the secondary endpoint of 3P-MACE plus hospitalization for unstable angina (4P-MACE) (13.2% for Tradjenta versus 13.3% for glimepiride).
""Millions of people living with type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease,"" said Mohamed Eid, M.D., M.P.H., M.H.A., vice president, Clinical Development &amp; Medical Affairs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ""When treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor such as Tradjenta is appropriate, it is critical that physicians have therapeutic options with established long-term safety and tolerability. The findings from CAROLINA complement the results from CARMELINA<sup>®</sup>, which demonstrated similar long-term cardiovascular safety for Tradjenta compared with placebo, including no increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure, in adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease.""
In CAROLINA, a higher proportion of the Tradjenta group (16.0%) achieved the secondary composite efficacy endpoint of treatment sustainability compared with the glimepiride group (10.2%).<sup>*</sup> Compared with glimepiride, Tradjenta demonstrated similar overall effects on A1C, but reduced the relative risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) by 77% (10.6% of patients treated with Tradjenta experienced any hypoglycemic incident versus 37.7% for glimepiride). This risk reduction was consistent across all hypoglycemia categories, including severe hypoglycemia requiring hospitalization. Tradjenta was also associated with a modest weight reduction of 1.5 kg versus glimepiride.
""The American College of Cardiology and American Diabetes Association recommend type 2 diabetes treatments with proven cardiovascular benefits for patients with established cardiovascular disease,"" said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly Diabetes. ""But physicians considering additional therapies to lower blood glucose for their patients need a DPP-4 inhibitor with an established long-term safety profile. This new data from CAROLINA, along with data from the placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trial CARMELINA, expands the evidence and experience with Tradjenta, to provide healthcare professionals with confidence in the long-term safety profile across a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes.""

</b>CAROLINA (CARdiovascular Outcome study of LINAgliptin versus glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes) is a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial that involved 6,033 adults with type 2 diabetes from 43 countries at more than 600 sites observed for a median duration of more than 6 years. The trial included adults with early type 2 diabetes: adults with a median disease duration of 6.2 years who either received no treatment or received one or two glucose-lowering agents (e.g., metformin). The study was designed to assess the effect of Tradjenta (5 mg once daily) compared with the sulfonylurea glimepiride (both added to stable background glucose-lowering medication and cardiovascular standard of care) on cardiovascular safety in adults with type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk or established cardiovascular disease. These patients reflect people that doctors typically see in their daily clinical practice.
CAROLINA was led by an academic trial steering committee and Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company. CAROLINA is the only DPP-4 inhibitor active-comparator cardiovascular outcome trial.
<b>About our cardiovascular outcome trials
</b>Cardiovascular outcome trials are highly relevant, as cardiovascular disease is a major complication and the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes. Worldwide, most people with type 2 diabetes die of a cardiovascular event. In 2015, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company announced results from the landmark cardiovascular outcome trial EMPA-REG OUTCOME<sup>® </sup>with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, which reduced the relative risk of cardiovascular death by 38% in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, on top of standard of care.<sup>†</sup><sup>‡</sup> As a result, empagliflozin was the first type 2 diabetes medicine approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death.
CAROLINA is one of two cardiovascular outcome trials with the DPP-4 inhibitor Tradjenta. CAROLINA and CARMELINA (CArdiovascular safety and Renal Microvascular outcomE with LINAgliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high vascular risk) provide one of the most comprehensive datasets on the long-term safety of a DPP-4-inhibitor across a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes.
CARMELINA is a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that involved 6,979 adults with type 2 diabetes from 27 countries at more than 600 sites observed for a median duration of 2.2 years. CARMELINA studied the impact of Tradjenta on cardiovascular and kidney safety in adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and/or kidney disease. The study met its primary endpoint,<sup>§</sup> with Tradjenta demonstrating a similar cardiovascular safety profile compared with placebo when added to standard of care. CARMELINA also included a key secondary composite endpoint,<sup>**</sup> showing a similar kidney safety profile compared with placebo. The overall safety profile of Tradjenta in CARMELINA was consistent with previous data, and no new safety signals were observed. CARMELINA also showed a similar rate of hospitalization for heart failure for Tradjenta compared with placebo.

<b>What is TRADJENTA?
</b>TRADJENTA is a prescription medicine that is used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.
TRADJENTA is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).
If you have had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in the past, it is not known if you have a higher chance of getting pancreatitis while you take TRADJENTA.
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>What is the most important information I should know about TRADJENTA?
</b>Serious side effects can happen to people taking TRADJENTA, including inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which may be severe and lead to death. Before you start taking TRADJENTA, tell your doctor if you have ever had pancreatitis, gallstones, a history of alcoholism, or high triglyceride levels.
Stop taking TRADJENTA and call your doctor right away if you have pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe and will not go away. The pain may be felt going from your abdomen through to your back. The pain may happen with or without vomiting. These may be symptoms of pancreatitis.
<b>Heart failure. </b>Heart failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough. Before you start taking TRADJENTA, tell your doctor if you have ever had heart failure or have problems with your kidneys. Contact your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms: increasing shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially when you lie down; swelling or fluid retention, especially in the feet, ankles, or legs; an unusually fast increase in weight or unusual tiredness. These may be symptoms of heart failure.
<b>Who should not take TRADJENTA?
</b>Do not take TRADJENTA if you are allergic to linagliptin or any of the ingredients in TRADJENTA.
Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction to TRADJENTA may include rash, itching, flaking or peeling; raised red patches on your skin (hives); swelling of your face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty breathing or swallowing. If you have any of these symptoms, stop taking TRADJENTA and call your doctor or go to the emergency room right away.
<b>What should I tell my doctor before using TRADJENTA?
</b>Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you have or have had inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis). Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. TRADJENTA may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how TRADJENTA works. Especially tell your doctor if you take
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li>other medicines that can lower your blood sugar. If you take TRADJENTA with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as sulfonylurea or insulin, your risk of getting low blood sugar is higher. The dose of your sulfonylurea or insulin may need to be lowered while you take TRADJENTA.</li>
 	<li>rifampin (Rifadin<sup>®</sup>, Rimactane<sup>®</sup>, Rifater<sup>®</sup>, Rifamate<sup>®</sup>),* an antibiotic that is used to treat tuberculosis.</li>
</ul>

KENILWORTH, N.J.---Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, as monotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] =1) or in combination with platinum and fluorouracil (FU), a commonly used chemotherapy regimen, for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial, where KEYTRUDA demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with the EXTREME regimen (cetuximab with carboplatin or cisplatin plus FU), a standard treatment, as monotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS =1) (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.64-0.96]; p=0.0171) and in combination with chemotherapy in the total study population (HR=0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.93]; p=0.0067). With these new indications, KEYTRUDA is the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the first-line setting as monotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS =1) or in combination with chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 expression for patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC and the first anti-PD-1 therapy to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in OS in these patients.
“This approval is a very exciting milestone in the treatment of head and neck cancer and has the potential to transform the way we treat patients with this debilitating disease by offering important new therapeutic options,” said Dr. Barbara Burtness, professor of medicine, Yale School of Medicine and co-director, Development Therapeutics Research Program, Yale Cancer Center. “Metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer has been an area of significant unmet need, so it is encouraging to have immunotherapy regimens available for patients in the first-line setting.”
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.
“Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has historically presented many challenges to physicians and patients, including limited treatment options and physical and functional issues caused by the disease and its treatment,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, vice president, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “This approval is an important advance in the management of this devastating cancer. The results of KEYNOTE-048, which support this approval, demonstrated that KEYTRUDA monotherapy for patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 CPS greater than or equal to one and KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 expression significantly prolonged survival for patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the first-line setting.”
KEYTRUDA was initially approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy in 2016 under the FDA’s accelerated approval process based on objective response rate data from the Phase 1b KEYNOTE-012 trial. In accordance with the accelerated approval process, continued approval was contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit, which has now been demonstrated in KEYNOTE-048 and has resulted in the FDA converting the accelerated approval to a full (regular) approval.
<b>Data Supporting the Approval</b>
This approval is based on data from the pre-specified interim analysis of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial, a randomized, multi-center, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 882 patients with metastatic HNSCC who had not previously received systemic therapy and who were considered incurable by local therapies. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] =50% or &lt;50%) according to the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit, HPV status according to p16 IHC (positive or negative), and ECOG Performance Status (PS) (0 vs. 1). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms:
<ul>
 	<li class=""bwlistitemmargb"">KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks;</li>
 	<li class=""bwlistitemmargb"">KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every three weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously every three weeks and FU 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every three weeks (maximum of six cycles of platinum and FU);</li>
 	<li class=""bwlistitemmargb"">Cetuximab 400 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>intravenously as the initial dose then 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously once weekly, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every three weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously every three weeks and FU 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every three weeks (maximum of six cycles of platinum and FU).</li>
</ul>
Among the 882 patients, the study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range, 20 to 94), 36% age 65 or older; 83% male; 73% White, 20% Asian, and 2.4% Black; 61% had ECOG PS of 1; and 79% were former or current smokers. Twenty-two percent of patients’ tumors were HPV positive; 23% had PD-L1 TPS =50%; and 95% had stage IV disease (19% were stage IVA, 6% were stage IVB, and 70% were stage IVC). Eighty-five percent of patients’ tumors had PD-L1 expression of CPS =1, and 43% had CPS =20.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 24 months. A retrospective re-classification of patients’ tumor PD-L1 status according to CPS using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit was conducted using the tumor specimens used for randomization.
The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ) sequentially tested in the subgroup of patients with CPS =20, the subgroup of patients with CPS =1 and the overall population.

In KEYNOTE-048, the safety of KEYTRUDA, as a single agent and in combination with platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and FU chemotherapy, was investigated in patients with previously untreated, recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 200 mg every three weeks was 3.5 months (range, 1 day to 24.2 months) in the KEYTRUDA single agent arm and was 5.8 months (range, 3 days to 24.2 months) in the combination arm.
KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 12% of patients in the KEYTRUDA single agent arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were sepsis (1.7%) and pneumonia (1.3%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 31% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA (=2%) were pneumonia (2.3%), pneumonitis (2.3%) and hyponatremia (2%). The most common adverse reactions (=20%) with KEYTRUDA as a single agent were fatigue (33%), constipation (20%), and rash (20%).
KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 16% of patients in the combination arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonia (2.5%), pneumonitis (1.8%) and septic shock (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 45% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (=2%) were neutropenia (14%), thrombocytopenia (10%), anemia (6%), pneumonia (4.7%) and febrile neutropenia (2.9%). The most common adverse reactions (=20%) with KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU were nausea (51%), fatigue (49%), constipation (37%), vomiting (32%), mucosal inflammation (31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), stomatitis (26%) and cough (22%).
<b>About KEYTRUDA</b> <sup><b>®</b> </sup><b>(pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg</b>
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.
<b>KEYTRUDA</b> <sup><b>®</b> </sup><b>(pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing</b>

""About one in three people with type 2 diabetes have chronic kidney disease, which puts them at increased risk of kidney failure and negative cardiovascular outcomes,<sup>i</sup> like cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke, and heart failure,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">James List</span>, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular &amp; Metabolism, Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC. ""With the results from our CREDENCE study, INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> is now poised to become the first therapy in nearly two decades for treating chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes, providing both kidney and cardiovascular protection.""
<b>CV Outcomes </b><br class=""dnr"" />The CV results from CREDENCE found INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> significantly reduced major CV events in the overall study population, with consistent results across all composite endpoints and individual components of the composite endpoints. Specifically, INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> reduced the risk of CV death, heart attack or stroke by 20 percent compared to placebo (9.9% vs. 12.2%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.95; P=0.01). INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> also reduced the risk of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure by 31 percent (8.1% vs. 11.5%; HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.83; P&lt;0.001) and hospitalization for heart failure by 39 percent (4.0% vs. 6.4%; HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001). For the subgroup analysis, researchers found:
<ul>
 	<li>CV results observed in the overall study population were consistent across the primary and secondary prevention groups, including all clinical subgroups and across groups defined by renal function.</li>
 	<li>For CV death, heart attack and stroke, there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the primary and secondary prevention groups (p-interaction=0.25). Specifically, INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> reduced the risk of the composite of CV death, heart attack and stroke by 32 percent in the primary prevention group (HR: 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.94) and 15 percent in the secondary prevention group (HR: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.06).</li>
</ul>
<b>Renal and Safety Outcomes</b><br class=""dnr"" />The renal results from CREDENCE found INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> demonstrated a 30 percent reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint – comprised of progression to doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESKD), and renal or CV death (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.82; P&lt;0.0001) – with consistent results across individual components of the primary composite endpoint, as well as across all 15 prespecified subgroups examined. For the subgroup analysis, researchers found:
<ul>
 	<li>Renal results observed in the overall study population were consistent across the primary and secondary prevention groups.</li>
 	<li>Specifically, INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> reduced the risk of ESKD by 31 percent (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.95; P-interaction: 0.89) and 33 percent (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.96; P-interaction: 0.89) in the primary and secondary prevention groups, respectively.</li>
</ul>
In addition, CREDENCE found the incidence rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were numerically lower for patients treated with INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> as compared to placebo. For the subgroup analysis, safety outcomes were similar in both primary and secondary prevention groups. Of note, there was no difference in fracture risk or incidence of amputations in the primary and secondary prevention groups.
<b>About CREDENCE</b><br class=""dnr"" />The phase 3 CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation, NCT02065791) clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, event-driven, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-arm, multicenter study. It evaluated 4,401 patients from 34 countries with T2D and established stage 2 or 3 CKD who were receiving standard of care, which included a maximum tolerated labeled daily dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and received either INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> 100 mg daily or matching placebo, with a mean follow-up of 2.62 years.
In <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2019</span>, Janssen submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, the doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death for adults with CKD and T2D, based on data from the CREDENCE study. The application was given a Priority Review, which FDA assigns to medicines that may offer significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition. If this new indication is approved, INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> would be the first T2D medication to treat CKD, one of the most common and potentially life-threatening comorbidities associated with T2D.<sup>i</sup>
The FDA most recently approved an indication for INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> in <span class=""xn-chron"">October 2018</span> to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events, including heart attack, stroke or death due to a CV cause in adults with T2D who have established CV disease. INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> is also indicated to lower blood sugar in adults with T2D. INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> is contraindicated for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/<span class=""xn-money"">1.73 m</span><sup>2</sup>), ESKD, or those on dialysis. In addition, INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> is not recommended when eGFR is persistently less than 45 mL/min/<span class=""xn-money"">1.73 m</span><sup>2</sup>.<br class=""dnr"" /><br class=""dnr"" />Please see the Important Safety Information below and the full <b><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2493090-1&amp;h=1639693528&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.janssenlabels.com%2Fpackage-insert%2Fproduct-monograph%2Fprescribing-information%2FINVOKANA-pi.pdf&amp;a=Prescribing+Information"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Prescribing Information</a></b> for additional details.
<b>WHAT IS INVOKANA<sup>®</sup>?</b> <br class=""dnr"" />INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> is a prescription medicine used:
<ul>
 	<li>along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes</li>
 	<li>to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease. INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> is not for people with type 1 diabetes or with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in blood or urine). It is not known if INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.</li>
</ul>
<b>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</b>
<b>INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> can cause important side effects, including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Amputations. INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> may increase your risk of lower-limb amputations. Amputations mainly involve removal of the toe or part of the foot; however, amputations involving the leg, below and above the knee, have also occurred. Some people had more than one amputation, some on both sides of the body.</b> You may be at a higher risk of lower-limb amputation if you: have a history of amputation, have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, have had blocked or narrowed blood vessels (usually in leg), have damage to the nerves (neuropathy) in the leg, or have had diabetic foot ulcers or sores. <b>Call your doctor right away if you have new pain or tenderness, any sores, ulcers, or infections in your leg or foot.</b> Your doctor may decide to stop your INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> for a while if you have any of these signs or symptoms. Talk to your doctor about proper foot care</li>
 	<li><b>Dehydration. INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> can cause some people to become dehydrated (the loss of too much body water), which may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, lightheaded, or weak, especially when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension).</b> You may be at higher risk of dehydration if you have low blood pressure, take medicines to lower your blood pressure (including diuretics [water pills]), are on a low sodium (salt) diet, have kidney problems, or are 65 years of age or older</li>
 	<li><b>Vaginal yeast infection. </b>Women who take INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> may get vaginal yeast infections. Symptoms include: vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), or vaginal itching</li>
 	<li><b>Yeast infection of the penis (balanitis or balanoposthitis). </b>Men who take INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> may get a yeast infection of the skin around the penis. Symptoms include: redness, itching, or swelling of the penis; rash of the penis; foul-smelling discharge from the penis; or pain in the skin around penis</li>
</ul>
Talk to your doctor about what to do if you get symptoms of a yeast infection of the vagina or penis.
<b>Do not take INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> if you:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>are allergic to canagliflozin or any of the ingredients in INVOKANA<sup>®</sup>. Symptoms of allergic reaction may include: rash; raised red patches on your skin (hives); or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing</li>
 	<li>have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis</li>
</ul>
<b>Before you take INVOKANA<sup>®</sup>, tell your doctor if you</b> have a history of amputation; heart disease or are at risk for heart disease; blocked or narrowed blood vessels (usually in leg); damage to the nerves (neuropathy) of your leg; diabetic foot ulcers or sores; kidney problems; liver problems; history of urinary tract infections or problems with urination; are on a low sodium (salt) diet; are going to have surgery; are eating less due to illness, surgery, or change in diet; pancreas problems; drink alcohol very often (or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term); ever had an allergic reaction to INVOKANA<sup>®</sup>; or have other medical conditions.
<b>Tell your doctor if you are or plan to become pregnant, are breastfeeding, or plan to breastfeed. </b>INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> may harm your unborn baby. If you become pregnant while taking INVOKANA<sup>®</sup>, tell your doctor right away. INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> may pass into your breast milk and may harm your baby. Do not breastfeed while taking INVOKANA<sup>®</sup>.
<b>Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. </b>Especially tell your doctor if you take diuretics (water pills), rifampin (used to treat or prevent tuberculosis), phenytoin or phenobarbital (used to control seizures), ritonavir (Norvir<sup>®</sup>, Kaletra<sup>®</sup> – used to treat HIV infection), or digoxin (Lanoxin<sup>®</sup>– used to treat heart problems).
<b>Possible Side Effects of INVOKANA<sup>®</sup></b>
I<b>NVOKANA<sup>®</sup> may cause serious side effects, including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Ketoacidosis</b> (increased ketones in your blood or urine). <b>Ketoacidosis has happened in people who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes</b>, during treatment with INVOKANA<sup>®</sup>. Ketoacidosis is a serious condition, which may need to be treated in a hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. <b>Ketoacidosis can happen with INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL. Stop taking INVOKANA<sup>®</sup> and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, stomach-area pain, tiredness, or trouble breathing</b></li>
 	<li><b>Kidney problems.</b> Sudden kidney injury has happened to people taking INVOKANA<sup>®</sup>. Talk to your doctor right away if you: 1) reduce the amount of food or liquid you drink, if you are sick, or cannot eat or 2) you start to lose liquids from your body from vomiting, diarrhea, or being in the sun too long</li>
 	<li><b>A high amount of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia)</b></li>

 	<li><strong>Genmab signs agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. to collaborate exclusively on next-generation CD38 antibody product, HexaBody-CD38, incorporating Genmab’s proprietary HexaBody technology</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>New agreement builds on Genmab’s successful DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> collaboration with Janssen</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Next-generation HexaBody-CD38 could potentially add to the DARZALEX multiple myeloma franchise and expand the potential of CD38-targeted therapies in further indications</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Copenhagen, Denmark; June 11, 2019 – </strong><strong>Genmab A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: GEN) announced today it has entered into an exclusive worldwide license and option agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) to develop and commercialize HexaBody-CD38, a next-generation human CD38 monoclonal antibody product incorporating Genmab’s proprietary HexaBody technology</strong>. Under the terms of the agreement, Genmab will collaborate exclusively with Janssen on HexaBody-CD38, with Genmab funding research and development activities until completion of clinical proof of concept studies in multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on the data from these studies, Janssen may exercise its option and receive a worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize HexaBody-CD38. Should this occur, Janssen will pay Genmab a USD 150 million option exercise fee and up to USD 125 million in development milestones, as well as a flat royalty rate of 20% on sales of HexaBody-CD38 until a specified time in 2031, followed by 13-20% tiered royalties on sales thereafter. Should Janssen not exercise its option, the terms of the agreement allow Genmab to continue to develop and commercialize HexaBody-CD38 for DARZALEX-resistant patients, and in all other indications except those multiple myeloma or amyloidosis indications where DARZALEX is either approved or is being actively developed.
The agreement is the outcome of pre-clinical research on novel CD38 targeting concepts conducted by Genmab. For HexaBody-CD38, Genmab obtained promising pre-clinical data in a panel of multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia models.
“With this agreement, we hope to build upon the successful and productive relationship that we have established with Janssen. As a result of our collaboration, DARZALEX has dramatically improved outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma, yet there are still unmet needs for patients. We are excited that Genmab’s world-class antibody expertise and passion for innovation has led to the novel HexaBody-CD38 product concept. Encouraging pre-clinical data suggest that HexaBody-CD38 could be superior to daratumumab for certain tumor cell types and may expand and extend the promise of CD38-targeted therapies for more patients with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, and potentially beyond,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab.
Additional details of the collaboration are not being disclosed and this news does not materially impact Genmab’s 2019 Financial Guidance.
<strong>About Genmab </strong>
Genmab is a publicly traded, international biotechnology company specializing in the creation and development of differentiated antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.  Founded in 1999, the company has two approved antibodies, DARZALEX<sup>®</sup> (daratumumab) for the treatment of certain multiple myeloma indications, and Arzerra<sup>®</sup> (ofatumumab) for the treatment of certain chronic lymphocytic leukemia indications.  Daratumumab is in clinical development for additional multiple myeloma indications, other blood cancers and amyloidosis.  A subcutaneous formulation of ofatumumab is in development for relapsing multiple sclerosis.  Genmab also has a broad clinical and pre-clinical product pipeline.  Genmab's technology base consists of validated and proprietary next generation antibody technologies - the DuoBody<sup>®</sup> platform for generation of bispecific antibodies, the HexaBody<sup>®</sup>platform, which creates effector function enhanced antibodies and the HexElect<sup>®</sup> platform, which combines two co-dependently acting HexaBody molecules to introduce selectivity while maximizing therapeutic potency. The company intends to leverage these technologies to create opportunities for full or co-ownership of future products.  Genmab has alliances with top tier pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.  For more information visit <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qQ7ahpFsfEoLVudGGnuaXe4cVJ7_8oYI14oKY_v-0CUZl8Tod016HfHZbcKajV6uWocVEq7NQDhn7s3fbmpKag=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>www.genmab.com</u></a>.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 11, 2019  <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=L0KUbxCmM7C2ph0hz8nRbmf3Sbb3S9Di39q4ShY5nKrHVq_QkUip01W0cf2sOdQmpf16fid3JLA0Tp9iWrY_wQ=="" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><u>Biogen Inc.</u></a> (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that it will present new data at the European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) 2019 in Madrid, Spain (June 12-15). The abstracts include real-world data from the company’s biosimilar anti-TNF portfolio, which includes BENEPALI<sup>™</sup> (etanercept), FLIXABI<sup>™</sup> (infliximab) and IMRALDI<sup>™</sup> (adalimumab). Biosimilars are products that are demonstrated to be similar to or interchangeable with approved biological product and have the potential to lower drug costs. In Europe, approximately 145,000 patients have been treated with a Biogen biosimilar and the company expects the uptake of these products to generate 1.8 billion euros in healthcare cost savings in 2019.
“These new real-world data reinforce Biogen’s ongoing commitment to providing innovative and value-based therapeutic options to tens of thousands of patients with unmet medical need,” said Ian Henshaw, vice president and head of Biogen’s global biosimilars unit. “The cost savings we generate through our biosimilars business unit will help alleviate global healthcare system burden, which could enable governments to allow broader access to critical therapies.”
To compile real-world evidence, physicians ask patients open-ended questions about treatment experience. The real-world data to be presented at EULAR this year provide further insight into patient experience with anti-TNF biosimilars, including adherence data.
“Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases face the reality of a lifetime of ongoing disease management and now biosimilars enable more patients access to those life-changing medicines while providing our healthcare systems significant savings,” said Dr. Peter Taylor, Norman Collisson professor of musculoskeletal sciences, Nuffield department of orthopedics, rheumatology and musculoskeletal sciences at the University of Oxford, England. “The new real-world data to be presented at EULAR further establish the comparable safety and efficacy of biosimilars against their reference products.”
Biosimilars represent an important component of Biogen’s European portfolio. Biosimilar products benefit patients and are strategically important as Biogen works with payers and health systems globally with the goal of creating room in healthcare budgets to provide access for patients to innovative therapies.
Biogen and its collaboration partner Samsung Bioepis will present a total of nine abstracts at the congress. In February 2012 Biogen entered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung BioLogics, establishing an entity, Samsung Bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar products.
Data to be presented include results of the real-world data generating BENEFIT study, which evaluated the outcomes of transition from the reference product etanercept to its biosimilar in routine clinical practice. The study demonstrated no clinically significant difference in disease score from baseline to six months post transition in 533 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)<sup>2 </sup><em>(June 14, 11:45.-13:30 CET – FRI0103 – Hall 10)</em>.
Additionally, data from a pooled analysis of etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab biosimilars and reference products across 1,461 patients will be presented. The analysis demonstrated similar outcomes between biosimilars and their respective reference products in terms of disease fluctuation at six months and one year of treatment<sup>3</sup><em>(June 15, 10:30-12:00 CET – SAT0162 – Hall 10)</em>.

<b>South San Francisco, CA -- June 11, 2019 --</b>
Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and granted Priority Review for the use of Rituxan<sup>®</sup> (rituximab), in combination with glucocorticoids (GCC), for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in children two years of age and older. GPA and MPA are rare, potentially life-threatening diseases affecting small and medium sized blood vessels.<sup>1</sup>
“We are committed to delivering new treatment options for rare diseases, such as pediatric GPA and MPA, for which there are currently no approved medicines,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We will continue to work closely with the FDA to bring Rituxan to children with these two serious and potentially life-threatening diseases.”
Priority Review Designation is granted to medicines that, if approved, the FDA has determined to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment of a serious disease.
The sBLA was submitted based on data from the PePRS study, a Phase IIa, global, open-label, single-arm study investigating the safety, pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics and exploratory efficacy of intravenous Rituxan in 25 patients with severe GPA or MPA between six and 17 years of age.<sup>2</sup> Treatment with four weekly infusions of Rituxan in combination with a tapering course of oral glucocorticoids was assessed in newly diagnosed or relapsing active GPA or MPA pediatric patients.
Rituxan is currently indicated for the treatment of four autoimmune indications. The FDA approved Rituxan for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 2006, for the treatment of adults with GPA and MPA in 2011, and for adults with pemphigus vulgaris in 2018. Since 2006, more than 900,000 patients have been treated with Rituxan for autoimmune conditions worldwide. If approved, this would be the first pediatric indication for Rituxan.
<strong>About Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis and Microscopic Polyangiitis </strong>
Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (formerly known as Wegener's Granulomatosis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) are two types of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).<sup>3</sup>AAV is a form of vasculitis, or blood vessel inflammation, that primarily affects small blood vessels.<sup>3</sup> In general, GPA and MPA both affect the small blood vessels of the kidneys, lungs, sinuses, and a variety of other organs, but the diseases may affect each person differently.<sup>1,4 </sup>Both GPA and MPA are considered rare diseases, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of up to three cases per 100,000 people.<sup>1,4</sup> Cases of pediatric onset GPA and MPA are even more rare and are associated with severe, potentially life-threatening symptoms.<sup>5</sup>
<strong>What autoimmune diseases does Rituxan treat?</strong>
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): with another prescription medicine called methotrexate, to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe active RA in adults, after treatment with at least one other medicine called a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist has been used and did not work well enough.
Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA): with glucocorticoids, to treat adults with GPA and MPA.
Pemphigus vulgaris (PV): to treat adults with moderate to severe PV.
It is not known if Rituxan is safe or effective in children.
<strong>Important Side Effect Information</strong>
<strong>What is the most important information patients should know about Rituxan?</strong>
<strong>Rituxan can cause serious side effects that can lead to death, including:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><u>Infusion-Related Reactions</u>:</strong> Infusion-related reactions are very common side effects of Rituxan treatment. Serious infusion-related reactions can happen during your infusion or within 24 hours after your infusion of Rituxan. Your healthcare provider should give you medicines before your infusion of Rituxan to decrease your chance of having a severe infusion-related reaction<u></u></li>
 	<li><strong><u>Severe Skin and Mouth Reactions</u></strong><strong>: </strong>Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you get any of these symptoms at any time during your treatment with Rituxan: painful sores or ulcers on your skin, lips, or in your mouth; blisters; peeling skin; rash; or pustules<u></u></li>
 	<li><strong><u>Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation</u></strong><strong>: </strong>If you have had hepatitis B or are a carrier of hepatitis B virus, receiving Rituxan could cause the virus to become an active infection again. Hepatitis B reactivation may cause serious liver problems, including liver failure and death. You should not receive Rituxan if you have active hepatitis B liver disease. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for hepatitis B infection during and for several months after you stop receiving Rituxan<u></u></li>
 	<li><strong><u>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)</u>:</strong> PML is a rare, serious brain infection caused by a virus that can happen in people who receive Rituxan. People with weakened immune systems can get PML. PML can result in death or severe disability. There is no known treatment, prevention, or cure for PML</li>
</ul>
<strong>Before receiving Rituxan, patients should tell their healthcare provider if they:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>have had a severe reaction to Rituxan or a rituximab product</li>
 	<li>currently have or have a history of other medical conditions, especially heart disease</li>
 	<li>have had a severe infection, currently have an infection, or have a weakened immune system</li>
 	<li>have had a recent vaccination or are scheduled to receive vaccinations</li>
 	<li>are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Females who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Rituxan and for 12 months after the last dose of Rituxan</li>
 	<li>are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Rituxan</li>
 	<li>are taking any medications, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements</li>
</ul>
<strong>What are the possible side effects of Rituxan?</strong>
Rituxan can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): </strong>TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause you to have kidney failure and the need for dialysis treatment or may cause an abnormal heart rhythm. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms of TLS: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lack of energy</li>
 	<li><strong>Serious Infections: </strong>Serious infections can happen during and after treatment with Rituxan and can lead to death. Rituxan can increase your risk of getting infections and can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. People with serious infections should not receive Rituxan</li>
 	<li><strong>Heart Problems: </strong>Rituxan may cause chest pain, irregular heartbeats, and heart attack. Your healthcare provider may monitor your heart during and after treatment with Rituxan if you have symptoms of heart problems or have a history of heart problems</li>
