Biosimilars such as Zessly enable earlier patient access to important medicines and positively impact healthcare systems
Zessly is the third EC approval for a Sandoz biosimilar in 12 months
Holzkirchen, – Sandoz, a Novartis division and the global leader in biosimilars, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Zessly® (infliximab) for use in Europe.
Zessly is approved for use in all indications of the reference medicine*** including rheumatoid arthritis, adult Crohn’s disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, adult ulcerative colitis, pediatric ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis.
“The European Commission approval for Zessly is a key milestone in bringing this important medicine to appropriate patients,” said Richard Francis, CEO, Sandoz. “Biosimilars, such as Zessly, help to address a significant unmet need for earlier patient access to biologic medicines and are at the heart of our Sandoz commitment to improving and extending lives.”
The EC approval was based on review of a comprehensive development program, including analytical, preclinical and clinical data, which confirmed Zessly matched its reference medicine in terms of safety, efficacy and quality. The clinical Phase III confirmatory study in rheumatoid arthritis (REFLECTIONS B537-02) met its primary endpoint, demonstrating equivalent efficacy of Zessly to the reference medicine as measured by the American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response at Week 14.[1]
As a Novartis division, Sandoz is well-positioned to lead the biosimilars industry based on its experience and capabilities in development, manufacturing and commercialization. Zessly is the sixth approved biosimilar medicine for Sandoz, with several more major oncology and immunology launches expected globally by 2020.
About Zessly (infliximab) 
Zessly blocks the action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in patients with certain autoimmune diseases in which excess TNF-alpha activity may be harmful or cause onset of disease. By blocking the action of TNF-alpha, infliximab inhibits an underlying cause of inflammation.

 The study demonstrated in meeting al 1EPs and resulted bioequivalence in terms of safety, efficacy, PK, immunogenicity in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis
 Hyrimoz (adalimumab) is an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis-causing inflammation and tissue destruction","Biosimilar Hyrimoz(adalimumab) approved for use in all same indications as reference medicine*** including rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology
Early therapeutic intervention is essential in rheumatoid arthritis, supporting urgency of treatments like Hyrimoz
Fourth Sandoz biosimilar approved in Europe** in past 18 months, and seventh in total, underscoring Sandoz commitment to making access happen through a robust portfolio
Holzkirche Sandoz, a Novartis division and the pioneer and global leader in biosimilars, today announced that the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization to biosimilar Hyrimoz® (adalimumab) for use in all indications of the reference medicine***, including rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, uveitis and ulcerative colitis.[1],[2]
Rheumatoid arthritis alone affects up to 1% of people in the European Union. Patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis can have chronic inflammation that causes fatigue, pain and joint stiffness. Symptoms can be reversible with appropriate treatment, however the joint damage and the resulting disability are permanent.[3] The introduction of biosimilars has been shown to improve access to advanced treatment options, such as biologic medicines.[4]
“We believe in making access happen for patients who are suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases. Earlier and expanded access to important, disease-modifying, biologic medicines can fundamentally change how patients manage their health,” said Stefan Hendriks, Global Head of Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz. “Biosimilars such as Hyrimoz can also play a transformational role in healthcare system sustainability – so we look forward to making Hyrimoz, and other important biosimilar medicines, broadly available.”
The approval was based on a comprehensive data package comprising analytical, preclinical and clinical research demonstrating that Hyrimoz matches the reference biologic in terms of safety, efficacy and technical quality. A randomized, double-blind, three-arm, parallel study confirmed the pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and safety of Hyrimoz. The study met the primary endpoint, demonstrating bioequivalence for all primary pharmacokinetic parameters. A Phase III confirmatory safety and efficacy study (ADACCESS) demonstrated therapeutic equivalence in the sensitive indication of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis, with a similar safety and immunogenicity profile to the reference biologic. No meaningful clinical differences were observed.[5]-[7]
Sandoz is well-positioned to lead the biosimilars industry based on its experience and capabilities in development, manufacturing and commercialization. Hyrimoz is the company’s seventh approved biosimilar medicine in Europe. Additional biosimilars for oncology and immunology indications are expected to launch globally across major regions by 2020.
About Hyrimoz (adalimumab)
Hyrimoz is an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein that is overproduced in certain autoimmune conditions-including rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis-causing inflammation and tissue destruction in joints, mucosa or skin. In some cases of autoimmune disease, the immune system damages the body’s own tissues. Hyrimoz can be a potentially appropriate treatment option for certain patients across a variety of indications. Hyrimoz works by targeting and blocking the protein that contributes to disease symptoms.[1]

 The CHMP recommendation will be reviewed by EU with its expected results in H2’18
 Fulphila (pegfilgrastim) is a PEGylated form of the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) targeted for febrile neutropenia (FN)","BENGALURU, India and HERTFORDSHIRE, England/PITTSBURGH– Biocon Ltd. (BSE code: 532523, NSE: BIOCON) and Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ: MYL) today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion recommending approval of Fulphila®, a biosimilar to Amgen’s Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim).
The CHMP positive opinion is based upon a review of evidence demonstrating biosimilarity. Data submitted as part of the Marketing Authorization Application included similarity assessment in analytical testing, preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrated biosimilarity to the reference product, Neulasta. The Phase I program in healthy volunteers and Phase III clinical study conducted in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, demonstrated no clinically meaningful differences in terms of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, efficacy and immunogenicity compared to Neulasta.
The CHMP positive opinion will now be considered by the European Commission. The decision on approval is expected by November 2018.
Fulphila was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier this year and is the first FDA-approved biosimilar for Neulasta in the U.S. Regulatory applications for Fulphila also have been submitted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several other countries.
Biocon CEO & Joint Managing Director, Dr. Arun Chandavarkar, said: “CHMP’s decision to recommend approval of Biocon and Mylan’s biosimilar Pegfilgrastim brings us a step closer to offer this high quality, affordable biologic therapy for cancer patients in the EU, having launched this product in the US, earlier this year. It is an outcome of our commitment to enhance access for patients and be a leading global biosimilars player on the back of significant investments in R&D and global scale manufacturing, together with our partner Mylan.”
Mylan President Rajiv Malik commented, “We are very proud to be a leader in bringing the first wave of biosimilars to the European market and driving greater access to more affordable treatment options for patients living with chronic and life-threatening illness such as cancer. Receiving CHMP positive opinion for our pegfilgrastim biosimilar, Fulphila, is a key milestone in this journey, demonstrating our commitment to patient and healthcare communities across Europe and the strength of our collaboration with Biocon.”
Neulasta had brand sales of more than US$ 450 million in Europe for the 12 months ending June 30, 2018, according to IQVIA.
About Pegfilgrastim
Chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia (FN) causes treatment delays and interruptions and can have fatal consequences. Current guidelines provide recommendations on granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) for prevention of FN when the risk is considered to be high. Pegfilgrastim as an injectable biologic medication is a PEGylated form of the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). It serves to stimulate the level of white blood cells (neutrophils). Pegfilgrastim treatment can be used to stimulate bone marrow to produce more neutrophils to fight infection in patients undergoing chemotherapy.
About Biosimilars
A biosimilar is a biological medicine highly similar to another already approved biological medicine (the ‘reference medicine’). Biosimilars are approved according to the same standards of pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy that apply to all biological medicines. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for evaluating the majority of applications to market biosimilars in the European Union (EU). Further information is available on the EMA website here.

7178,"GSK Signs a Worldwide Development &amp; Commercialization Collaboration with Merck KGaA, for $4.2B","GSK and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany announce global alliance to jointly develop and commercialise M7824, a novel immunotherapy with potential in multiple difficult-to-treat cancers","Merck KGaA to receive $4.2B as total deal value, including $341.76M upfront, up to $3.8B milestones including R&D, regulatory and commercialization. GSK to get worldwide co-development and co-commercialization rights for Merck’s M7824 with 50/50 profit/cost sharing
 The focus of the agreement is to strengthen GSK’s oncology portfolio in areas of immuno-oncology, cell therapy, cancer epigenetics and genetic medicine
 Merck’s M7824 (bintrafusp alfa) is a bifunctional immunotherapy targeting TGF-β trap with anti-PD-L1 mechanism and is evaluated in P-I/II vs pembrolizumab in 700 patients with PD-L1 expressing advanced NSCLC","Eight high priority immuno-oncology clinical development studies ongoing or expected to commence in 2019, including studies in non-small cell lung and biliary tract cancers
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will receive an upfront payment of €300 million (£260 million) and is eligible for potential development milestone payments of up to €500 million (£440 million) triggered by data from the M7824 lung cancer programme, plus future approval and commercial milestones of up to €2.9 billion (£2.5 billion), for a total potential deal value of up to €3.7 billion (£3.2 billion)
GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany today announced that they have entered into a global strategic alliance to jointly develop and commercialise M7824 (bintrafusp alfa*). M7824 is an investigational bifunctional fusion protein immunotherapy that is currently in clinical development, including potential registration studies, for multiple difficult-to-treat cancers. This includes a Phase II trial to investigate M7824 compared with pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment in patients with PD-L1 expressing advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
M7824 is designed to simultaneously target two immuno-suppressive pathways, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) trap and an anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. Bifunctional antibodies aim to increase efficacy above and beyond that achieved with individual therapies or combinations of individual therapies.1 M7824 has the potential to offer new ways to fight difficult-to-treat cancers beyond the established PD-1/PD-L1 class. In addition to use as a single agent, M7824 is also being considered for use in combination with other assets from the pipelines of both companies.
Dr Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “Despite recent medical advances, many patients with difficult-to-treat cancers don’t currently benefit from immuno-oncology therapies leaving them with limited treatment options. M7824 brings together two different biological functions in a single molecule and we have observed encouraging clinical results in treating certain cancer patients, particularly those people with non-small cell lung cancer. I’m excited by the potential impact this first-in-class immunotherapy could have on the lives of cancer patients.”
Dr Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board and CEO Healthcare of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany said: “Our bifunctional fusion protein M7824 has the potential to bring new answers to patients living with cancer. Together with GSK we aim to drive a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer as the leader in this novel class of immunotherapies. GSK clearly emerged as the ideal partner due to their strong commitment to oncology, and the complementary talent and capabilities they will bring to our alliance. We now look forward to harnessing the full potential of M7824 across a broad range of cancer indications as we continue to advance our oncology portfolio.”
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will receive an upfront payment of €300 million (£260 million) and is eligible for potential development milestone payments of up to €500 million (£440 million) triggered by data from the M7824 lung cancer programme. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will also be eligible for further payments upon successfully achieving future approval and commercial milestones of up to €2.9 billion (£2.5 billion). The total potential deal value is up to €3.7 billion (£3.2 billion). Both companies will jointly conduct development and commercialisation with all profits and costs from the collaboration being shared equally on a global basis.
For GSK, this alliance is a further step in the company’s priority to strengthen its pharmaceuticals pipeline. This follows the company’s recent acquisition of TESARO, an oncology-focused company based in Waltham, Massachusetts. GSK’s approach to oncology is focused on innovation in the areas of immuno-oncology, cell therapy, cancer epigenetics and, most recently, genetic medicine.
This alliance reflects Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany’s strategic approach to oncology R&D, identifying those opportunities that can progress the company’s highly promising clinical stage assets as efficiently and rapidly as possible, whether through internal expertise and capabilities or external collaborations.
With this alliance, both companies have the leadership position in this new class of immunotherapies, specifically leveraging TGF-β biology.
*Bintrafusp alfa is the proposed International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for the bifunctional immunotherapy M7824. Bintrafusp alfa is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use anywhere in the world.

About M7824 (also now known as bintrafusp alfa)
M7824 is an investigational bifunctional immunotherapy that is designed to combine a TGF-β trap with the anti-PD-L1 mechanism in one fusion protein. M7824 is designed to combine co-localised blocking of the two immuno-suppressive pathways – targeting both pathways aims to control tumour growth by potentially restoring and enhancing anti-tumour responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumours, as well as a randomised Phase II trial to investigate M7824 compared with pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment in patients with PD-L1 expressing advanced NSCLC. The multicentre, randomised, open-label, controlled study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of M7824 versus pembrolizumab as a monotherapy treatment.
To-date, nearly 700 patients have been treated with M7824 across more than 10 tumour types in Phase I studies. Encouraging data from the ongoing Phase I studies indicates M7824’s potential safety and clinical anti-tumour activity across multiple types of difficult-to-treat cancers, including advanced NSCLC, human papillomavirus-associated cancers, biliary tract cancer (BTC) and gastric cancer. In addition, in pre-clinical studies M7824 demonstrated superior anti-tumour activity, compared with anti-PD-L1 alone or with anti-PD-L1 and TGF-β trap when co-administered. In total, eight high priority immuno-oncology clinical development studies are ongoing or expected to commence in 2019, including studies in non-small cell lung and biliary tract cancers.

 P-III study results: reduction on a composite endpoint of aTTP-related death (12.7% vs 49.3%); aTTP recurrences (13% vs 38%); no deaths reported
 Cablivi (caplacizumab-yhdp) is an anti-vWF Nanobody, has received FDA’s FT designation and will be available in the US in H1’19. In 2018, Sanofi in-licensed Cablivi from Ablyn","PARIS – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
Cablivi® (caplacizumab-yhdp) in combination with plasma exchange and
immunosuppression for the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(aTTP) in adults. Cablivi is the first FDA approved therapy specifically indicated for the
treatment of aTTP.
“The U.S. approval of Cablivi provides a much-needed treatment option for people
facing this challenging disease. There have been limited medicines available to
treat aTTP until now,” says Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer,
Sanofi. “Cablivi marks the first U.S. approval in our newly formed rare blood
disorders franchise, and we look forward to continuing to provide important
medicines for people living with these very serious diseases.”
Cablivi targets von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein in the blood involved in hemostasis.
It is designed to inhibit the interaction between vWF and platelets. Cablivi is an anti-vWF
Nanobody and Sanofi’s first Nanobody®-based medicine to receive approval in the U.S.
Nanobodies® are a novel class of proprietary therapeutic proteins based on single-domain
antibody fragments that contain the unique structural and functional properties of naturallyoccurring heavy chain only antibodies.
Cablivi received FDA Fast Track designation and was evaluated under Priority Review,
which is reserved for medicines that represent significant improvements in safety or
efficacy in treating serious conditions.
An Unmet Need in a Rare Blood Disorder
aTTP is a rare, life-threatening, autoimmune blood disorder. aTTP is considered an urgent,
medical emergency. For some patients, resuscitative measures might be required and the
immediate outcome might not be predictable. In most cases, patients are routinely treated
in intensive care units during the first few days following their aTTP diagnosis. It is
estimated that up to 20% of patients die from TTP episodes, despite currently available
treatments (plasma exchange and immunosuppression), with most deaths occurring within
30 days of diagnosis. In the U.S., aTTP affects fewer than 2,000 adults each year.
“aTTP is a very severe, life-threatening disease. For those faced with this rare
diagnosis, the treatment and care can be difficult and the threat of recurrence is
ever-present,” said Spero R. Cataland, M.D., Professor of Internal Medicine,
Division of Hematology, Wexner Medical Center at the Ohio State University.
“Cablivi provides new hope for adults in the U.S. suffering with aTTP and provides
a much needed treatment option to help effectively manage aTTP episodes.”
In aTTP, accumulation of ultra-large vWF causes extensive clot formation in small blood
vessels throughout the body, leading to severe thrombocytopenia (very low platelet count),
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (loss of red blood cells through destruction), and
ischemia (restricted blood supply to parts of the body).
Cablivi Clinical Program and Results
The approval of Cablivi in the U.S. is based on the results of the pivotal multicentre,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study known as
HERCULES. This trial evaluated the efficacy of Cablivi in combination with plasma
exchange and immunosuppressive therapy (n=72) versus placebo, plasma exchange and
immunosuppressive therapy (n=73) in 145 adults experiencing an episode of aTTP.
In the HERCULES study, treatment with Cablivi in combination with plasma exchange and
immunosuppression resulted in a significantly shorter time to platelet count response
versus plasma exchange and immunosuppression alone (Hazard Ratio 1.55 [1.10; 2.20]
p=0.01), the study’s primary efficacy endpoint; in secondary endpoints, Cablivi showed a
significant reduction on a composite endpoint of aTTP-related death, recurrence of aTTP,
or a major thromboembolic event during study drug treatment versus plasma exchange
and immunosuppression alone (12.7% vs. 49.3%; p <0.0001); and a significantly lower
percentage of aTTP recurrences in the overall study period versus plasma exchange and
immunosuppression alone (13% vs. 38%; p<0.001). Results of this study were published
in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2019.
In the HERCULES and TITAN (Phase 2) clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse
reactions were epistaxis (bleeding from the nose) 29%, headache 21% and gingival (gums)
bleeding 16%. In the placebo group, two deaths were reported in the TITAN study and
three deaths in the HERCULES study. No deaths were reported during the study drug
treatment period in the Cablivi group in the TITAN and HERCULES studies. However, one
death was reported in the HERCULES study during the treatment free follow up period,
which was determined not to be Cablivi treatment related.
About Cablivi
Cablivi should be administered upon initiation of plasma exchange therapy, based on a
diagnosis of aTTP. Cablivi is first administered as an 11 mg intravenous injection prior to
plasma exchange, followed by an 11 mg subcutaneous injection after completion of plasma
exchange on day 1. During the daily plasma exchange period and 30 days following daily
plasma exchange, patients will take daily 11 mg subcutaneous injections. If after the initial
treatment symptoms of the underlying disease are unresolved the treatment can be further
extended for a maximum of 28 days. Subcutaneous injection can by administered by a
patient/caregiver following proper training.
Cablivi is expected to be available in the U.S. late in the first quarter. The U.S. list price,
or wholesale acquisition cost, for treating a typical aTTP episode with Cablivi is $270,000.
Sanofi is committed to helping U.S. patients who have been prescribed Cablivi access their
medication and get the support they need, and will be launching Cablivi Patient Solutions,
a comprehensive patient support program. For patients with aTTP who are prescribed
Cablivi, Cablivi Patient Solutions will provide support to eligible patients who require
financial assistance.
Cablivi was developed by Ablynx, which was acquired by Sanofi in 2018. Cablivi was
approved in the European Union in August 2018. Cablivi is part of the company’s rare
blood disorders franchise within Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global business unit
of Sanofi.

 Nuzyra (qd, IV/oral) is an antibiotic, targeted for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, also being evaluated in UTI & is approved by the US FDA for resistance diseases i.e CABP & ABSSSI","BOSTON, Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRTK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies based upon tetracycline chemistry, announced The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) today published detailed results from the OPTIC and OASIS-1 Phase 3 clinical trials of NUZYRA™ (omadacycline).

NUZYRA is a modernized tetracycline that is a once-daily intravenous (IV) and oral for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Both studies published in NEJM met all primary and secondary endpoints and showed that NUZYRA was safe and well-tolerated. NUZYRA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on October 2, 2018 for the treatment of adults with CABP and ABSSSI and is now commercially available in the United States.
“Treating skin infections and pneumonia has become increasingly complex due to growing resistance among common pathogens, safety concerns surrounding current antibiotics and the limited availability of oral treatment options,” said Keith Kaye, MD, MPH, Director of Research in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan Medical Center. “In both pneumonia and skin settings, NUZYRA’s demonstrated efficacy against common pathogens, including pathogens resistant to other antibiotic classes, suggest that it has an important role for doctors in need of effective and safe IV and oral agents for their patients.”
OPTIC (Omadacycline for Pneumonia Treatment in the Community) Study
OPTIC was a global, pivotal Phase 3 clinical study that compared the safety and efficacy of once-daily, IV-to-oral NUZYRA to IV-to-oral moxifloxacin for treating adults with CABP. OPTIC demonstrated that NUZYRA was non-inferior to moxifloxacin for the treatment of adults with CABP and was safe and well-tolerated. In the intent-to-treat population, NUZYRA (n=386) was non- inferior to moxifloxacin (n=388) for early clinical response (ECR) (81.1% vs. 82.7%; difference [95% CI]: -1.6 [-7.1, 3.8]) and investigator assessment of clinical response (IACR) at post-treatment evaluation (PTE) was 87.6% vs. 85.1% (difference: 2.5 [-2.4, 7.4]). Efficacy results were consistent across study populations, PORT Risk Class and causative pathogen.
The rate of serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 6.0% in the NUZYRA-treated group and 6.7% in the moxifloxacin-treated group. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal events (NUZYRA, 10.2%; moxifloxacin 18.0%) and included vomiting (2.6% vs. 1.5%), nausea (2.4% vs. 5.4%), and diarrhea (1.0% vs. 8.0%), respectively. There were no cases of Clostridium difficile colitis or infection in patients treated with NUZYRA, compared with eight cases (2.1%) in patients treated with moxifloxacin. The mortality rate was 2.1% with NUZYRA and 1.0% with moxifloxacin.
OASIS-1 (Omadacycline in Acute Skin and Skin Structure Infections Study) 
The global pivotal Phase 3 registration study known as OASIS-1 evaluated the efficacy and safety of an IV to oral once-daily NUZYRA against twice-daily linezolid over a seven to 14-day course of therapy in 645 adult patients. OASIS-1 demonstrated that NUZYRA was non-inferior to linezolid for treating ABSSSI, with a similar safety profile. Efficacy results were consistent across study populations and sub-populations, type of skin infection and causative pathogen including MRSA.
In the modified intent-to-treat population (mITT), NUZYRA (n=316) was non-inferior (10% NI margin) to linezolid (n=311) for ECR (84.8% vs. 85.5%; difference [95% CI]: -0.7 [–6.3, 4.9]). NUZYRA also was non-inferior to linezolid for IACR at PTE in the mITT (86.1% vs. 83.6%; difference: 2.5 [-3.2, 8.2]) and clinically evaluable (96.3% vs. 93.5%; difference 2.8 [-1.0, 6.9]) populations. In both groups, efficacy was comparable for methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, which account for nearly half of all ABSSSI isolates in the United States.
Serious TEAEs occurred in 3.7% of NUZYRA patients and 2.5% of linezolid patients, none of which were considered related to study drug. Among TEAEs, gastrointestinal events were most common in both treatment groups (18.0% for NUZYRA and 15.8% for linezolid) and included nausea (12.4% vs. 9.9%), vomiting (5.3% vs. 5.0%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 3.1%), respectively. The mortality rate was 0.3% with NUZYRA and 0.6% with linezolid.
“The publication of two of our global Phase 3 trials in a journal as prestigious as The New England Journal of Medicine is an affirmation of the clinical impact to the practice of medicine in an era of growing resistance to older antibiotic agents and will help inform physicians’ decisions as they treat these serious, often life-threatening, community-acquired infections,” said Evan Loh, M.D., President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “These pivotal clinical trials demonstrated that NUZYRA is an effective, well-tolerated monotherapy option for patients with activity across an appropriate spectrum of bacteria, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypicals, and drug resistant strains and we believe NUZYRA can play an important role in winning the battle against the growing health challenge of antibiotic resistance.”

About NUZYRA
NUZYRA (omadacycline) is a novel antibiotic with both once-daily intravenous (IV) and oral formulations for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). A modernized tetracycline, NUZYRA is specifically designed to overcome tetracycline resistance and exhibits activity across a spectrum of bacteria, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypicals, and other drug-resistant strains.
Indications and Usage 
NUZYRA is a tetracycline class antibiotic indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the following infections caused by susceptible microorganisms:
Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) caused by the following:
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae.
Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) caused by the following:
Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus anginosus grp. (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterbacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Usage
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of NUZYRA and other antibacterial drugs, NUZYRA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.
Important Safety Information
Contraindications
NUZYRA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to omadacycline or tetracycline class antibacterial drugs, or to any of the excipients.
Warnings and Precautions
Mortality imbalance was observed in the CABP clinical trial with eight deaths (2%) occurring in patients treated with NUZYRA compared to four deaths (1%) in patients treated with moxifloxacin. The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established. All deaths, in both treatment arms, occurred in patients >65 years of age; most patients had multiple comorbidities. The causes of death varied and included worsening and/or complications of infection and underlying conditions. Closely monitor clinical response to therapy in CABP patients, particularly in those at higher risk for mortality.
The use of NUZYRA during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia.
The use of NUZYRA during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause irreversible inhibition of bone growth.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with NUZYRA. Life-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. NUZYRA is structurally similar to other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. Discontinue NUZYRA if an allergic reaction occurs.
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs.
NUZYRA is structurally similar to tetracycline-class of antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions. Adverse reactions including photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, pancreatitis, and abnormal liver function tests, have been reported for other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs, and may occur with NUZYRA. Discontinue NUZYRA if any of these adverse reactions are suspected.
Prescribing NUZYRA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2%) are nausea, vomiting, infusion site reactions, alanine aminotransferase increased, apartate aminotransferase increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, hypertension, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, and constipation.
Drug Interactions
Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage while taking NUZYRA.
Absorption of tetracyclines, including NUZYRA is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate and iron containing preparations.
Use in Specific Populations
Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NUZYRA
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-833-727-2835 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

7375,AstraZeneca's Fasenra Receives Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) For Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES),US FDA grants Fasenra Orphan Drug Designation for hypereosinophilic syndrome,"The FDA’s ODD for Fasenra follows its evaluation in P-II study assessing Fasenra vs PBO @12 weeks in patients with high level of eosinophils in blood and tissues 
 The P-II study demonstrated meeting its 1EP with depleted blood eosinophils at week 12 and is conducted by United States NIH with Astrazeneca, published in H2’19
 Fasenra (benralizumab) is a mAb, binds with IL-5 receptor on eosinophils and has received FDA’s ODD for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in Nov,2018 and is approved for severe eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU and Japan","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to Fasenra (benralizumab) for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).
HES is a group of rare, potentially fatal disorders characterised by high numbers of eosinophils in blood and tissues, which can cause progressive damage to any organ in the body.1,2 The FDA grants ODD status to medicines intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US.
A Phase II clinical trial of Fasenra for the treatment of HES has been conducted by the United States National Institutes of Health in collaboration with AstraZeneca, with results expected to be published later in 2019. In the trial, Fasenra depleted blood eosinophils at week 12 compared with placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial, with evidence of eosinophil clearance in affected tissue at week 24.3
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, R&D BioPharmaceuticals, said: “In patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome, high levels of eosinophils contribute to a range of debilitating symptoms and can even lead to life-threatening organ damage. Based on results from the Phase II trial, we believe Fasenra has the potential to address critical unmet medical needs in patients living with hypereosinophilic syndrome.”
Fasenra is AstraZeneca’s first respiratory biologic and is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe, eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan and several other countries. In November 2018, the FDA granted ODD for Fasenra for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).
About hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)
HES is a group of rare disorders in which high numbers of eosinophils are found in the blood and tissue which can cause progressive organ damage over time, and if left untreated, can be fatal.1,2 HES most commonly impacts the skin, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system.2
The symptoms of HES may include cough, fever, fatigue, asthma, difficulty breathing, wheezing, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin rashes, arthritis, muscle aches and joint pain.2
The goal of HES treatment is to reduce eosinophils in the blood and tissues, prevent organ damage and slow disease progression.2,4 HES treatment typically includes glucocorticoids, immunomodulatory therapies and cytotoxic therapies.1
About Fasenra
Fasenra (benralizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to IL-5 receptor α on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis (programmed cell death).5,6
Fasenra is AstraZeneca’s first respiratory biologic, now approved as an add-on maintenance treatment in severe, eosinophilic asthma in the US, EU, Japan, and several other jurisdictions, with further regulatory reviews ongoing. Where approved, Fasenra is available as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection via a prefilled syringe administered once every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, and then once every 8 weeks thereafter. Fasenra is also being studied in severe nasal polyposis. Phase III trials for Fasenra in HES have not yet commenced.
Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca with MedImmune, the company’s global biologics research and development arm, and is in-licensed from BioWa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Japan.

7525,ï»¿Medtronic's Pipeline Flex Embolization Device Receives FDA's Expanded Indication Approval for Intracranial Aneurysms (IAs),Medtronic Receives FDA Approval on Expanded Indication for Pipeline Flex Embolization Device,"The expanded approval is based on PREMIER Trial assessing Pipeline Flex in 141 patients with mean aneurysm size of 5.0±1.92 mm
 The study resulted in one-year occlusion rates of 76.7% with use of 1.1 device & 2.2% occurrence of major stroke or neurological death and additional data from PUFs study with efficacy rates 70.8 % @ 1yr. extended to 95% @5yrs.
 Pipeline Flex is a medical device targeted for cardiovascular wide-neck IAs located in the ICA with expanded indication for small or medium IAs and is used to treat patients since 2011 in the US","Approval Based on Clinical Data from the PREMIER Trial – New Indication Provides Options for Patients with Small or Medium, Wide-Necked Brain Aneurysms

DUBLIN – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) announced today that it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval on an expanded indication for its Pipeline(TM) Flex embolization device.1Previously indicated for the endovascular treatment of adults with large or giant wide-necked intracranial aneurysms (IAs) in the internal carotid artery from the petrous to the superior hypophyseal segments, the new indication opens options for patients with small or medium, wide-necked brain aneurysms in the territory from the petrous to the terminus of the internal carotid artery.
An estimated 500,000 people throughout the world die each year due to ruptured brain aneurysms, with half the victims younger than 50 years of age.2
Approval was based on clinical data from the Prospective Study on Embolization of Intracranial aneurysms with the Pipeline(TM) Device (PREMIER) trial, which expands understanding of the safety and efficacy for this device for a broader patient population. A total of 141 subjects with a mean aneurysm size of 5.0±1.92 mm were analyzed. Data showed one-year occlusion rates of 76.7 percent with the use of 1.1 device per subject on average and a 2.2 percent occurrence of major stroke or neurological death.3
“PREMIER is another landmark study with Pipeline and moves the bar on the safe treatment of wide-necked brain aneurysms,” said Dr. Ricardo Hanel, neurosurgeon, director of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Center at Baptist Health in Jacksonville, Fla., and principal investigator for the PREMIER trial. “This data changes the way we, as physicians, think about using Pipeline Flex to treat our patients.”
Designed to divert blood flow away from an aneurysm, the Pipeline Flex embolization device features a braided cylindrical mesh tube that is implanted across the base or neck of the aneurysm. The device cuts off blood flow to the aneurysm, reconstructing the diseased section of the parent vessel. This is the second Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study for this implant which gained FDA approval after completing the ‘Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed aneurysms’ (PUFs) trial, a 5-year study for large and giant wide-necked aneurysms of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) where efficacy rates were reported at 70.8 percent at 1 year that progressed to 95 percent in subjects with angiographic follow up at the 5 year time period. In the PUFs study the overall occurrence of major stroke or neurological death was 5.6 percent4. There were no documented cases of aneurysm recurrence in patients treated with the implant.
“Working hand-in-hand with physicians to develop new technology and clinical data is at the core of our mission. The PREMIER study not only demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy outcomes but also delivered on our commitment to broadening access to innovative therapies for new groups of patients requiring aneurysm treatment,” said Stacey Pugh, vice president and general manager of the Neurovascular business, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group at Medtronic.
In the United States, the Pipeline Flex device is intended for use for the endovascular treatment of complex wide-necked intracranial aneurysms located in the ICA, attached to parent vessels measuring between 2.0 and 5.0 mm in diameter.
Flow diversion has been used to treat patients in the United States since 2011. This product is part of the Neurovascular portfolio in Medtronic’s Restorative Therapies Group.

 Brineura (cerliponase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy for restoring TPP1 enzyme deficient in patients with CLN2 disease administered directly into CSF in brain and has received the US FDA & EU approval in April,17 and June,17 for late infantile neuronal CLN2 respectively","SAN RAFAEL, Calif., — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) today announced that an ongoing open-label extension study treating patients with Brineura® (cerliponase alfa) continued to show a reduced rate of decline compared to a natural history cohort of CLN2 disease for three years as measured by the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale.
The data presented today shows a durability of treatment effect in the primary efficacy endpoint where response to treatment was seen in 19 of 23 or 83% of treated patients after three years. A response is defined as the absence of an unreversed two-point decline in the motor-language (ML) scale or a score of 0, outcomes that represent clear and substantial decline in motor and language function. Natural history patients were 12 times more likely on average to have experienced an unreversed two-point decline in ML score than treated patients at three years. After three years on treatment with Brineura, treated patients’ ML scores were on average 3.8 points better than natural history. After two years on treatment with Brineura, treated patients’ ML scores were on average 3.3 points better than natural history.
“Every day, week, month and year of maintaining clinical function, including language and mobility, is critical to children with CLN2 disease and their families,” said Angela Schulz, M.D., lead study investigator from the Department of Paediatrics, Children’s Hospital, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. “Following these children has allowed us to better understand the effect of the treatment over time, which contributes to the advancement in the standard of care.”
“CLN2 disease is a destructive and rapidly progressing brain disease in children and the data has consistently shown over time that cerliponase alfa can make a big difference in slowing the progression of the disease,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President, Worldwide Research and Development at BioMarin. “It is important to us to contribute to the body of medical knowledge of CLN2 disease with data that is useful to the medical community treating these children.”
Brineura was approved in April 2017 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to slow the loss of ambulation in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency. Brineura also was approved in June 2017 by the European Commission. Brineura is the first treatment approved to treat children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease.
Study Design
An open-label study was conducted from September 2013 to November 2015 at five centers (Germany, Italy, US, and two in the UK) to assess the efficacy and safety of intraventricular cerliponase alfa in children with CLN2 disease. The studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; the study protocol was approved by relevant ethics boards.
Eligible patients were aged 3-16 years of age with a diagnosis of CLN2 disease and a combined score of 3-6 on the motor and language domains of a CLN2 clinical rating scale (total range 0-6, 0 representing no function and 3 representing normal function for each of the two domains). Patients who completed the 48-week open-label study were eligible to enroll in a 240-week extension study of 300 mg administered every two weeks. Patients enrolled in the DEM-CHILD NCL natural history database and diagnosed with CLN2 disease served as the comparison group.
Twenty-four patients aged 3-8 years were enrolled in the clinical study. One patient withdrew after week 1 due to inability to continue with study procedures; 23 patients were treated with Brineura every other week for three years or more. Of 23 patients enrolled in the extension study, 21 are continuing in the extension. The discontinuation in the extension study of two patients was not due to adverse events.
About CLN2 Disease
Children with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency, typically begin experiencing seizures between the ages of two and four years old, preceded in the majority of cases by language development delay. The disease progresses rapidly with most affected children losing the ability to walk and talk by approximately 6 years of age. Initial symptoms are followed by movement disorders, motor deterioration, dementia, blindness, and death usually occurring between the ages of eight and 12 years of age. During the later stages of the disease, feeding and tending to everyday needs become very difficult. BioMarin estimates the incidence of CLN2 disease is approximately one in 200,000, with up to 1,200 to 1,600 children in the regions of the world where BioMarin operates, many of whom are undiagnosed.
The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a heterogeneous group of lysosomal storage disorders that includes the autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder CLN2 disease. CLN2 disease is caused by mutations in the TPP1 gene resulting in deficient activity of the enzyme TPP1. In the absence of TPP1, lysosomal storage materials normally metabolized by this enzyme accumulate in many organs, particularly in the brain and retina. Buildup of these storage materials in the cells of the nervous system contribute to the progressive and relentless neurodegeneration which manifests as loss of cognitive, motor, and visual functions.
About Brineura
Brineura is a recombinant form of human TPP1, the enzyme deficient in patients with CLN2 disease. It is an enzyme replacement therapy designed to restore TPP1 enzyme activity and break down the storage materials that cause CLN2 disease. In order to reach the cells of the brain and central nervous system, the treatment is delivered directly into the fluid surrounding the brain (cerebrospinal fluid) using BioMarin’s patented technology.

Indication
Brineura® (cerliponase alfa) is a prescription medication used to slow loss of ability to walk or crawl (ambulation) in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency.
Important Safety Information
Brineura is a prescription medicine. Before treatment with Brineura, it is important to discuss your child’s medical history with their doctor. Tell the doctor if they are sick or taking any medication and if they are allergic to any medicines. Your child’s doctor will decide if Brineura is right for them. If you have questions or would like more information about Brineura, contact your child’s doctor.
Brineura is only given by infusion into the fluid of the brain (known as an intraventricular injection) and using sterile technique to reduce the risk of infection. An intraventricular access device or port must be in place at least 5 to 7 days prior to the first infusion. Intraventricular access device-related infections, including meningitis, were observed with Brineura treatment. If any signs of infection or meningitis occur, contact your child’s doctor immediately. The signs and symptoms of infections may not be readily apparent in patients with CLN2 disease. Your doctor should vigilantly be looking for signs and symptoms of infection, including meningitis, during treatment with Brineura.
Your child’s intraventricular access device should be replaced prior to 4 years of single-puncture administration of Brineura, because the device may deteriorate due to repeated use.
Brineura should not be used in patients with active intraventricular access device-related complications (e.g., leakage, device failure, or device-related infection, including meningitis), symptom of acute, unresolved localized infection around the device insertion site (e.g. cellulitis or abscess), or with shunts used to drain extra fluid around the brain. Your child’s doctor should inspect the scalp and collect samples of your child’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prior to each infusion of Brineura, to check that there is no device failure or infections present.
Low blood pressure and/or slow heart rate may occur during and following the Brineura infusion. Contact your child’s doctor immediately if these reactions occur.
Undesirable or hypersensitivity reactions related to Brineura treatment, including fever, vomiting, and irritability, may occur during treatment and as late as 24 hours after infusion. Your child may receive medication such as antihistamines before Brineura infusions to reduce the risk of reactions. Serious and severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) may occur. If a reaction occurs, the infusion will be stopped and your child may be given additional medication. If a severe reaction occurs, the infusion will be stopped and your child will receive appropriate medical treatment. If any signs of anaphylaxis occur, immediately seek medical care.
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below 3 years of age have not been established.
The most common side effects reported during Brineura infusions included fever, problems with the electrical activity of the heart, decreased or increased protein in the fluid of the brain, vomiting, seizures, hypersensitivity, collection of blood outside of blood vessels (hematoma), headache, irritability, and increased white blood cell count in the fluid of the brain, device-related infection, slow heart rate, feeling jittery, and low blood pressure. Intraventricular device-related side effects included infection, delivery system-related complications, and increased white blood cell count in fluid of the brain.
These are not all of the possible side effects with Brineura. Talk to your child’s doctor if they have any symptoms that bother them or that do not go away.
Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. at 1-866-906-6100, or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or go to www.fda.gov/medwatch.

7721,Orthofix Medical's M6-C Artificial Cervical Disc Receives FDA's Approval for Cervical Disc Degeneration,Orthofix Announces FDA Approval of the M6-C Artificial Cervical Disc to Treat Patients with Cervical Disc Degeneration,"The approval is based on Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study assessing M6-C artificial cervical disc vs anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in patients with cervical radiculopathy with/out cord compression at between C3 to C7
 The US IDE study results @24months: 90.5% improvement in Neck Disability Index; improvement in arm & neck pain score (91.2% & 90.5% vs 77.9% & 79.9%); administration of analgesic @surgery (80.6% vs 85.7%) @24mos. (14.0% vs 38.2%); need of additional surgery (1.9% vs 4.8%)
 The M6-C artificial cervical disc is used to replace an intervertebral disc, restore physiological motion in spine, mimics the anatomical structure & capable to absorb shocks and has received EU’s CE Mark with up to 45,000 implants","LEWISVILLE, Texas—Orthofix Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:OFIX), a global medical device company focused on musculoskeletal products and therapies, today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the M6-C™ artificial cervical disc for patients suffering from cervical disc degeneration. The M6-C artificial cervical disc was developed by Spinal Kinetics, a company acquired by Orthofix in April 2018
“With the approval of the M6-C artificial cervical disc, Orthofix now has the industry’s most comprehensive portfolio of cervical spine products to best serve our surgeon customers and patients,” said Orthofix President and Chief Executive Officer, Brad Mason. “In addition to a full line of anterior, posterior and interbody fusion cervical implants, we offer the CervicalStim™ device, the only FDA-approved cervical bone growth stimulation therapy, and the Trinity ELITE® allograft, a market-leading allograft developed in partnership with MTF Biologics. The launch of the M6-C artificial cervical disc in the U.S. will complement this existing spine portfolio and represents a significant milestone in the execution of our strategy to accelerate topline growth.”The M6-C artificial cervical disc is a next-generation artificial disc developed to replace an intervertebral disc damaged by cervical disc degeneration. Designed to restore physiologic motion to the spine, the M6-C disc is indicated as an alternative to cervical fusion. The M6-C artificial cervical disc preserves motion by restoring biomechanical function at the treated level after native disc removal and potentially reduces subsequent degeneration of adjacent vertebral segments. The M6-C device is the only artificial cervical disc that mimics the anatomic structure of a natural disc by incorporating an artificial visco-elastic nucleus and fiber annulus into its design. Like a natural disc, this unique construct allows for shock absorption at the implanted level, as well as provides a controlled range of motion when the spine transitions in its combined complex movements.
Pre-market approval was based on clinical data from a U.S. Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the M6-C artificial cervical disc compared to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of symptomatic cervical radiculopathy with or without cord compression. Patients in the study presented with degenerative cervical radiculopathy requiring surgical intervention, and confirmed clinically and radiographically at one vertebral level from C3 to C7.
Study results at 24 months include the following clinical patient outcomes:
90.5 percent of patients who received the M6-C disc demonstrated a meaningful clinical improvement in the Neck Disability Index.
A meaningful clinical improvement in arm pain score was seen in 91.2 percent of the M6-C disc patients compared to 77.9 percent in ACDF patients. In addition, this same meaningful improvement was seen in neck pain scores with 90.5 percent of patients who received the M6-C disc compared to 79.9 percent in patients who underwent the ACDF procedure.
The M6-C disc preserved range of motion in flexion-extension and lateral bending in the study group.
Prior to surgery, 80.6 percent of the M6-C disc patients and 85.7 percent of the ACDF patients were taking some type of pain medication for the treatment of their cervical spine condition. At 24 months, 14.0 percent of the M6-C disc patients were still taking some type of pain medication compared to 38.2 percent of the ACDF patients.
Of the patients still taking pain medication there was a seven times higher rate of opioid use with the ACDF patients than with patients who received the M6-C disc.
Additional surgery at the treated level was needed in 4.8 percent of the ACDF patients compared to 1.9 percent of the M6-C disc patients.
The prospective, non-randomized, concurrently controlled, multi-center clinical trial was conducted at 23 sites in the United States.
“Cervical disc degeneration is a common condition that can cause pain in the neck, shoulders, arms and hands and lead to numbness and weakness in the arm or hands. Often this condition is the result of a vertebral disc that has deteriorated or been damaged due to the natural aging process or an injury,” said Dr. Rick Sasso, orthopedic spine surgeon, professor and chief of spine surgery at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis and an investigator in the M6-C artificial cervical disc IDE study. “For many of these patients, the M6-C artificial cervical disc will give us the ability to replace the patient’s damaged disc with one that closely mimics their natural disc, enabling them to regain motion and return to their normal activities.”
Orthofix expects to release the M6-C artificial cervical disc in 2019 through a controlled, limited market launch in the U.S. accompanied by an extensive training and education curriculum for surgeons. The M6-C artificial cervical disc received CE Mark approval for distribution in the European Union and other international geographies in 2006 and there have been more than 45,000 implants of the M6-C artificial cervical disc outside of the U.S. to date.
Conference Call
The Company will conduct a conference call to discuss the FDA approval of the M6-C artificial cervical disc along with its fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 financial results on Monday, February 25 at 3:30 p.m. Central time (4:30 p.m. Eastern time).

7859,Regeneron Reports Results of Eylea (aflibercept) in P-III PANORAMA Trial for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR),One-Year Results From Positive Phase 3 Eylea Trial In Diabetic Retinopathy Presented At Angiogenesis Symposium,"The P-III PANORAMA Trial involves assessing of Eylea (aflibercept) vs sham injection in 402 patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR in without DME for 16 wks. or 8 wks.
 P-III study results: Patients with ≥2‑step improvement on DRSS score (65%, 80% vs 15%); Patients who developed a vision-threatening event (10%, 11% vs 41%); patients with severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (15%, 15% vs 53%); Subgroup with moderately severe NPDR (8%, 10%, vs 36%)
 Eylea (aflibercept) is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, indicated for Neovascular (Wet) AMD, Macular Edema RVO & DME, with expected PDUFA on 13 May, 2019 for DR","Trial showed that early intervention with EYLEA improved diabetic retinopathy severity and prevented serious vision-threatening complications
EYLEA diabetic retinopathy sBLA target action date of May 13, 2019
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that positive detailed one-year results from the Phase 3 PANORAMA trial evaluating EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection in patients with moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) were presented for the first time at the Angiogenesis, Exudation, and Degeneration 2019 symposium.
The trial confirmed that moderately severe and severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is not a benign condition, with patients at high risk of rapidly progressing to vision-threatening events. In untreated patients with severe NPDR, 53% developed these events at one year. Most importantly, EYLEA treatment prevented approximately 74% of these complications.
Key one-year data presented at the meeting are summarized below:

c Nominal p=0.0019 versus sham
d Nominal p<0.0001 versus sham
Topline one-year results from PANORAMA were previously reported in October 2018.
“PANORAMA provides high-quality data to inform treatment of NPDR without DME, as it is the first prospective trial involving these high-risk patients since the landmark ETDRS trial of the 1980s when laser was the only treatment option,” said Charles C. Wykoff, M.D., Ph.D., PANORAMA investigator, retina surgeon and ophthalmologist with Retina Consultants of Houston. “Without treatment, a large percentage of patients in the trial developed proliferative disease and CI-DME in the first year. EYLEA treatment reduced the risk of these events by approximately 74% compared to sham injection, underscoring the potential importance of early EYLEA anti-VEGF therapy. This efficacy was seen even with an every 16-week treatment regimen after loading doses, a management approach that may realistically be achieved in the real world.”
Adverse events were consistent with the known profile of EYLEA. Serious ocular treatment-emergent adverse events in the study eye occurred in 0 and 1 patients in the EYLEA treatment groups and 1 patient in the sham injection group. Ocular inflammation occurred in 1 patient in each EYLEA treatment group and 0 patients in the sham injection group. Anti-Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC)-defined arterial thromboembolic treatment-emergent events occurred in 4 and 2 patients in the EYLEA treatment groups and 5 patients in the sham injection group.
A supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy has been accepted for review by the U.S. FDA with a target action date of May 13, 2019.
The safety and efficacy of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy in patients without DME have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.
About the PANORAMA trial
PANORAMA is an ongoing, pivotal, double-masked, randomized, two-year trial that enrolled 402 patients and is designed to investigate EYLEA for the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR in patients without DME, compared to sham injections. Details on trial design include:

Three treatment arms – An observational sham injection group and two EYLEA treatment groups. EYLEA was dosed every 8 weeks (following five initial monthly doses) or every 16 weeks (following three initial monthly doses and one 8-week interval).
Primary endpoint – The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a two-step or greater improvement in the DRSS from baseline for the combined EYLEA treatment groups at week 24, and for each EYLEA treatment group separately (every 8-week group and every 16-week group) at week 52. The DRSS is a systematic grading scale to assess the severity of diabetic retinopathy based on photographs of the retina following a dilated eye exam.
Secondary endpoints – These include assessment of whether EYLEA reduced VTCs (defined as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and anterior segment neovascularization) or development of CI-DME, as well as its impact on other anatomic effects, visual acuity improvement, and safety.
A separate ongoing trial sponsored by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network known as Protocol W is also evaluating EYLEA for the treatment of NPDR in patients without DME.
About Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
Approximately eight million people live with DR, a disease characterized by microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina often caused by poor blood sugar control in people with diabetes. The disease generally starts as NPDR and often has no warning signs or symptoms. NPDR may progress to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a stage of the disease in which abnormal blood vessels grow onto the surface of the retina and into the vitreous cavity potentially causing severe vision loss.
DME can occur at any stage of DR as the blood vessels in the retina become increasingly fragile and leak fluid, potentially causing visual impairment. In the U.S., approximately 1.5 million adults are diagnosed with DME, while approximately 3.5 million people have DR without DME.
About EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection
EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye. It is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels (vascular permeability) in the eye by blocking VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PLGF), two growth factors involved in angiogenesis. In the U.S., EYLEA is the market-leading FDA-approved anti-VEGF treatment for its approved indications and is supported by a robust body of research that includes seven pivotal Phase 3 trials.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR EYLEA® (aflibercept) INJECTION

EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.
Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.
Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.
There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.
Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.
The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.
INDICATIONS
EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in patients with DME.

Additionally, at 30 months, the objective response rate (ORR) per investigator for intermediate- and poor-risk patients with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy improved compared to the previous analysis at a minimum of 17.5 months.
OS: The 30-month OS rate for the intermediate- and poor-risk population was 60% for patients treated with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy versus 47% for patients treated with sunitinib [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.66 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.54, 0.80); p<0.0001].
ORR: Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy was associated with a 42% ORR versus 29% with sunitinib (p=0.0001). More than half (52%) of the intermediate- and poor-risk patients who responded to Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy had a response lasting at least 18 months versus 28% of the patients who responded to sunitinib.
Complete Response (CR): The CR rate was 11% with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy versus 1% with sunitinib.
The results were similar for the intention-to-treat (ITT, i.e., all randomized) population with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy, demonstrating significantly improved:

OS: The 30-month OS rate for the ITT population was 64% for patients treated with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy versus 56% for patients treated with sunitinib [HR 0.71 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.86); p=0.0003].
ORR: The ORR was 41% with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy versus 34% for sunitinib (p=0.015).
CR: The CR rate was 11% with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy versus 2% with sunitinib.
The overall safety of the combination was consistent with that observed in the 17.5-month minimum follow-up analysis and with previously reported studies of these medicines in patients with RCC. No new safety signals or drug-related deaths occurred with extended follow-up.
“The results from this 30-month follow-up from the CheckMate -214 study are meaningful as they continue to demonstrate that in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, a population with considerable unmet treatment needs, there is potential for long-term survival benefits with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab,” said CheckMate -214 investigator Nizar M. Tannir, M.D., FACP, Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
The data will be featured in a rapid oral presentation (Abstract #547) on Saturday, February 16, 2019 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco.
“We are pleased that the results from CheckMate -214 continue to provide clinical evidence that combining Opdivo and Yervoy can extend survival for certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma,” said Arvin Yang, M.D., Ph.D., development lead, melanoma and genitourinary cancers, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “These follow-up data reinforce our scientific approach and ongoing commitment to delivering treatment options that help patients living with this relentless disease live longer.”
About CheckMate -214
CheckMate -214 is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study evaluating the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Patients in the combination group received Opdivo 3 mg/kg plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg every three weeks for four doses followed by Opdivo 3 mg/kg every two weeks. Patients in the comparator group received sunitinib 50 mg once daily for four weeks, followed by two weeks off before continuation of treatment. Patients were treated until progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoints of the trial are overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR) in an intermediate to poor-risk patient population (approximately 75% of patients).
About Renal Cell Carcinoma
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for more than 140,000 deaths worldwide each year. Clear-cell RCC is the most prevalent type of RCC and constitutes 80% to 90% of all patients. RCC is approximately twice as common in men as in women, with the highest rates of the disease in North America and Europe. Globally, the five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with metastatic, or advanced, kidney cancer is 12.1%.

About Opdivo
Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
Opdivo’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 25,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS
YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.
Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy, and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests, at baseline and before each dose.
Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
Infusion Reactions
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO
Complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who received allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Outcomes were evaluated in 17 patients from Checkmate 205 and 039, who underwent allogeneic HSCT after discontinuing OPDIVO (15 with reduced-intensity conditioning, 2 with myeloablative conditioning). Thirty-five percent (6/17) of patients died from complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe or refractory GVHD. Grade 3 or higher acute GVHD was reported in 29% (5/17) of patients. Hyperacute GVHD was reported in 20% (n=2) of patients. A steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, without an identified infectious cause, was reported in 35% (n=6) of patients. Two cases of encephalitis were reported: Grade 3 (n=1) lymphocytic encephalitis without an identified infectious cause, and Grade 3 (n=1) suspected viral encephalitis. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in one patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure. Other cases of hepatic VOD after reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD have also been reported. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
Lactation
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.
Serious Adverse Reactions
In Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse drug reactions reported in 2% to <5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase. In Checkmate 066, serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=206). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO.

8117,Astellas Reports Results of Xtandi (enzalutamide) in P-III ARCHES Trial for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC) in Men,"Phase 3 ARCHES Trial Shows XTANDI (enzalutamide) Significantly Improved Radiographic Progression-Free Survival in Men with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
 Vartika Singh","The P-III ARCHES trial involves assessing of Xtandi + ADT (enzalutamide, 160mg) vs ADT monothx in 1,150 men with mHSPC at the US, Canada, EU, South America
 P-III ARCHES study results: reducing the risk of radiographic progression or death by 61%; reduced the risk of PSA progression, antineoplastic therapy & deterioration in urinary symptoms; Undetectable PSA (68.1% vs 17.6%); ORR (83.1% vs 63.7%); GRADE 3 or 4 AEs (23.6% vs 24.7%)
 Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor targeted for astration-resistant prostate cancer. In Oct 2009, Pfizer & Astellas globally collaborated to jointly develop & commercialize enzalutamide in the US","NEW YORK and TOKYO, – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) announced today results from the Phase 3 ARCHES trial in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Prostate cancer is considered metastatic once the cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to other parts of the body.1 Men are considered hormone (or castration) sensitive if their disease still responds to medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone levels.2
The results show that XTANDI® (enzalutamide) plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) met the primary endpoint by significantly reducing the risk of radiographic progression or death by 61% versus ADT alone (n=1,150; HR=0.39 [95% CI: 0.30-0.50]; p<0.0001). These data will be presented in an oral session at the 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco (Abstract #687; Thursday, February 14th, 1:55 PM PT).
“The ARCHES trial demonstrated that XTANDI plus standard hormonal therapy delayed disease progression, and if approved, has the potential to be an important treatment option for men with prostate cancer that has spread but has not yet become hormone resistant,” said Andrew Armstrong, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Surgery, Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, and Director of Research in the Duke Cancer Institute’s Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancers.
Median time to a radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) event was not reached in the XTANDI plus ADT arm, while median time to an rPFS event in the ADT alone arm was 19.4 months. Significant improvements in rPFS were also observed in all prespecified subgroups including disease volume, pattern of disease localization at baseline, geographic region, and prior docetaxel use (HRs=0.24-0.53). Secondary endpoints reported in the abstract showed that XTANDI plus ADT reduced the risk of PSA progression (HR=0.19 [95% CI: 0.13-0.26]; p<0.0001) and reduced the risk of starting a new antineoplastic therapy (HR=0.28 [95% CI: 0.20-0.40]; p<0.0001) compared to ADT alone. Undetectable PSA and objective response rates were also higher in men treated with XTANDI plus ADT versus ADT alone (68.1% versus 17.6%; p<0.0001 and 83.1% versus 63.7%; p<0.0001, respectively). Treatment with XTANDI plus ADT did not significantly reduce the risk of deterioration in urinary symptoms compared to ADT alone. At the time of the analysis, overall survival (OS) data were not mature.
Adverse events (AEs) in the ARCHES clinical trial were generally consistent with those reported in enzalutamide clinical trials in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported in 23.6 percent of men receiving XTANDI plus ADT versus 24.7 percent of men receiving ADT alone. Common AEs (occurring in at least 5 percent of patients) that were reported more often in patients treated with XTANDI plus ADT versus those treated with ADT alone included hot flush, fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, asthenia and dizziness.
Based on the ARCHES results, the companies intend to discuss these data with global health authorities to potentially support a new indication for XTANDI in men with mHSPC. XTANDI is currently approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of CRPC and in the EU for the treatment of metastatic and high-risk non-metastatic CRPC.
Seven additional abstracts evaluating XTANDI will also be presented at the 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.
About ARCHES
The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial enrolled 1,150 patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) at sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Americaand the Asia-Pacific region. Patients in the ARCHES trial were randomized to receive XTANDI 160 mg daily or placebo and continued on a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist or had a history of bilateral orchiectomy. The ARCHES trial included patients with both low- and high-volume disease and both newly diagnosed patients with mHSPC and patients who had prior definitive therapy and subsequently developed metastatic disease. The trial also included some patients who had received recent treatment with docetaxel for mHSPC, but whose disease had not progressed. The primary endpoint of the trial was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease progression as assessed by central review, or death within 24 weeks of treatment discontinuation. For more information on the ARCHES (NCT02677896) trial, go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.
About Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
In men with prostate cancer, the disease is considered metastatic once the cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to other parts of the body, such as the bones, lymph nodes, bladder and rectum.1 Men are considered hormone (or castration) sensitive if their disease still responds to medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone levels.2 Approximately 38,000 men in the U.S. develop metastatic HSPC every year.3,4
About XTANDI®(enzalutamide) capsules
XTANDI (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
As part of Pfizer and Astellas’ ongoing commitment to the clinical development of enzalutamide, XTANDI is also being evaluated in the EMBARK trial, in men with high-risk non-metastatic HSPC. Details about EMBARK (NCT02319837) are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Important Safety Information for XTANDI® in CRPC
Warnings and Precautions
Seizure occurred in 0.4% of patients receiving XTANDI in clinical studies. In a study of patients with predisposing factors for seizure, 2.2% of XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure. Patients in the study had one or more of the following pre-disposing factors: use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold; history of traumatic brain or head injury, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, Alzheimer’s disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, history of seizure, presence of a space occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while taking XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) In post approval use, there have been reports of PRES in patients receiving XTANDI. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.
Hypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with XTANDI in clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions.
Ischemic Heart Disease In the placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.7% vs 1.2%). Grade 3-4 ischemic events occurred in 1.2% of patients on XTANDI versus 0.5% on placebo. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on XTANDI compared to 0.1% on placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 ischemic heart disease.
Falls and Fractures In the placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Fractures occurred in 8% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 3% of patients treated with placebo. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI. XTANDI should not be handled by females who are or may become pregnant.
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in the XTANDI patients from the randomized placebo-controlled trials were asthenia/fatigue, decreased appetite, hot flush, arthralgia, dizziness/vertigo, hypertension, headache and weight decreased. In the bicalutamide-controlled study, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) reported in XTANDI patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, hot flush, hypertension, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight loss.
In the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients taking XTANDI who previously received docetaxel, Grade 3 and higher adverse reactions were reported among 47% of XTANDI patients and 53% of placebo patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported for 16% of XTANDI patients and 18% of placebo patients. In the placebo-controlled study of chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were reported in 44% of XTANDI patients and 37% of placebo patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported for 6% of both study groups. In the placebo-controlled study of non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in 31% of XTANDI patients and 23% of placebo patients. Discontinuations with an adverse event as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI patients and 6% of placebo patients. In the bicalutamide-controlled study of chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were reported in 39% of XTANDI patients and 38% of bicalutamide patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 8% of XTANDI patients and 6% of bicalutamide patients.
Lab Abnormalities: In the two placebo-controlled trials in patients with mCRPC, Grade 1-4 neutropenia occurred in 15% of XTANDI patients (1% Grade 3-4) and 6% of placebo patients (0.5% Grade 3-4). In the placebo-controlled trial in patients with nmCRPC, Grade 1-4 neutropenia occurred in 8% of patients receiving XTANDI (0.5% Grade 3-4) and in 5% of patients receiving placebo (0.2% Grade 3-4).
Hypertension: In the two placebo-controlled trials in patients with mCRPC, hypertension was reported in 11% of XTANDI patients and 4% of placebo patients. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in <1% of patients in each arm. In the placebo-controlled trial in patients with nmCRPC, hypertension was reported in 12% of patients receiving XTANDI and 5% of patients receiving placebo.
Drug Interactions
Effect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, as they can increase the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the dose of XTANDI. Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers as they can decrease the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, increase the dose of XTANDI.
Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Avoid CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, as XTANDI may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. If XTANDI is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), conduct additional INR monitoring.

8223,ï»¿Bayer Signs an Exclusive License Agreement with Moberg Pharma for MOB-015 in EU,Moberg Pharma and Bayer Sign Exclusive License Agreement for MOB-015 in Europe,"Moberg to receive $1.69M upfront, $56.39M milestone, royalties & supply fees based on sales of MOB-015. Bayer to get exclusive commercialization rights for MOB-015 in EU post completion of its P-III
 The focus of the agreement is to develop MOB-015 based on Moberg’s formulation of terbinafine offering therapies & for the advancement of dermatological products for nail fungus (onychomycosis)
 Moberg Pharma’s MOB-015 is a topical formulation of terbinafine, evaluated in P-III study in 800 patients for onychomycosis at North America and EU for 52 weeks, with its expected results in Q4’19 and Q4’20 respectively","STOCKHOLM, Moberg Pharma AB (OMX: MOB) has signed an exclusive license agreement with Bayer for commercialization of MOB-015 in Europe. Under the agreement, Moberg Pharma is eligible to receive up to EUR 50 million contingent on development and commercial success, as well as supply fees including royalties.
Moberg Pharma has entered into a license agreement granting the Consumer Health division of Bayer exclusive European rights to MOB-015, a new topical treatment of onychomycosis based on Moberg’s patented proprietary formulation of terbinafine. Bayer will be marketing, distributing and selling MOB-015 in Europe upon completion of Phase III clinical development and registration.
“We are thrilled to partner with Bayer for the European launch, as part of our vision of making MOB-015 the leading nail fungus treatment worldwide. This is the second major agreement for MOB-015 and a further validation of the significant market potential for our asset,” says Peter Wolpert, Moberg Pharma’s CEO.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Moberg Pharma will finalize the ongoing Phase III program, complete registration in Europe and provide supply for the product. Moberg Pharma is eligible to receive up to EUR 50 million in milestone payments, including EUR 1.5 million paid at signing. The majority of the milestone payments are contingent on sales targets, with the balance contingent on development and regulatory milestones. Moberg Pharma will also receive supply fees including royalties.
We are excited about the opportunity to partner with Moberg and the potential to bring this cutting-edge technology to market in order to advance one of our key categories,” says Heiko Petersen, Head of Bayer’s Global Category Business Unit Dermatology.
The European OTC market for onychomycosis drugs amounted to EUR 192 million in 2017, growing at 2.6%

About this information
This information is information that Moberg Pharma AB is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation. The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact persons set out above, at 6.00 p.m. CET on February 11th, 2019.
About MOB-015 and Onychomycosis
Approximately 10% of the general population suffer from onychomycosis and a majority of those afflicted go untreated. The global market opportunity is significant with more than hundred million patients worldwide and a clear demand for better products. Moberg Pharma estimates the annual worldwide peak sales potential for MOB-015 to be in the range of USD 250-500 million.
MOB-015 is an internally developed topical formulation of terbinafine based on Moberg Pharma’s experience from its leading OTC product Kerasal Nail®/Emtrix®. Oral terbinafine is currently the gold standard for treating onychomycosis but associated with safety issues, including drug interactions and liver damage. For many years, developing a topical terbinafine treatment without the safety issues of oral terbinafine has been highly desirable, but unsuccessful due to insufficient delivery of the active substance through the nail.
In a previous phase 2 study, MOB-015 demonstrated delivery of high microgram levels of terbinafine into the nail and through the nail plate into the nail bed. Mycological cure of 54% and significant clear nail growth was observed in patients who completed the phase 2 study. The results are remarkable, particularly when taking into account the severity of the nails included in the study – on average approximately 60% of the nail plate was affected by the infection. Plasma levels of terbinafine with MOB-015 were substantially lower than after oral administration, reducing the risk of liver toxicities observed with oral terbinafine.
MOB-015 is currently being evaluated over 52 weeks in two randomized, multicenter, controlled Phase 3 studies, including in total approximately 800 patients in North America and Europe. The primary endpoint in both studies is the proportion of patients achieving complete cure of their target nail. Topline results from the North American study are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019, followed by results in Europe in 2020.

– Milestone Marks Fifth Approved Indication for ADCETRIS in Europe, Reinforcing Takeda’s Commitment to Developing Innovative Solutions for People Living with CD30-Positive Malignancies
Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, Japan – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced that the European Commission (EC) extended the current marketing authorization of ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) to include treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with AVD (Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine). ADCETRIS is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed at CD30, a defining marker of Hodgkin lymphoma. The decision follows a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on December 13, 2018.
“The decision by the European Commission is a welcomed advancement for patients with previously untreated Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma – a population that has not been offered a new treatment option in decades,” said Anna Sureda, M.D., Ph.D., Head of the Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Programme, Institut Català d’Oncologia – Hospital Duran i Reynals. “Patients with Stage IV disease carry a higher risk of progression following their first therapy and experience poorer outcomes as a result. The approval of this regimen may help address this unmet need by providing European physicians and their patients with a new option that showed significant benefit compared to ABVD along with a safety profile consistent with when ADCETRIS is used as a single agent.”
“We are pleased that the European Commission has approved ADCETRIS in combination with AVD, which has the potential to represent an important milestone for patients and serves as a testament to Takeda’s longstanding commitment to the Hodgkin lymphoma community,” said Jesús Gómez-Navarro, M.D., Vice President, Head of Oncology Clinical Research and Development, Takeda. “The ECHELON-1 clinical trial demonstrated that the addition of ADCETRIS and the removal of bleomycin from the standard ABVD regimen yielded both efficacy and safety benefits in patients. We look forward to making this therapy available for appropriate European patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.”
The approval is based on the results of the randomized, open-label, two-arm, multi-center Phase 3 ECHELON-1 study designed to compare ADCETRIS plus AVD to ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) as a therapy in adult patients with previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma. The trial achieved its primary endpoint resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival (PFS) versus the control arm (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; p-value=0.035), which corresponds to a 23 percent reduction in the risk of progression, death or need for additional anticancer therapy. Key subgroup analyses showed a larger effect in patients with Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm versus the control arm (modified PFS; HR 0.71; p-value = 0.023).
The safety profile of ADCETRIS plus AVD in the ECHELON-1 trial was generally consistent with that known for the single-agent components of the regimen. The most common clinically relevant adverse events of any grade that occurred in at least 15 percent of patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD and ABVD arms were: neutropenia, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, peripheral sensory neuropathy, diarrhea, pyrexia, peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain and stomatitis. In both the ADCETRIS plus AVD and ABVD arms, the most common Grade 3 or 4 events were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutrophil count decrease.
This decision by the European Commission means that ADCETRIS in combination with AVD is now approved for marketing of this indication in the 28 member states of the European Union and applicable in Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.

About Hodgkin Lymphoma
Lymphoma is a general term for a group of cancers that originate in the lymphatic system. There are two major categories of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma is distinguished from other types of lymphoma by the presence of one characteristic type of cell, known as the Reed-Sternberg cell. The Reed-Sternberg cell expresses CD30.
According to the Lymphoma Coalition, approximately 67,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma each year and more than 25,000 people die each year from this cancer.
Up to 30 percent of previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma patients progress following their first therapy depending on the stage of the disease. Only 50 percent of patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma achieve long-term remission with high-dose chemotherapy and an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), a historically used treatment regimen, highlighting the need for successful treatments for previously untreated patients.

About ADCETRIS
ADCETRIS is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprising an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody attached by a protease-cleavable linker to a microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), utilizing Seattle Genetics’ proprietary technology. The ADC employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-positive tumor cells.
ADCETRIS injection for intravenous infusion has received FDA approval for six indications in adult patients with: (1) previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) or other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified, in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone, (2) previously untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, (3) cHL at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation, (4) cHL after failure of auto-HSCT or failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates, (5) sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen, and (6) primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) who have received prior systemic therapy.
Health Canada granted ADCETRIS approval with conditions for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL in 2013, and non-conditional approval for post-autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) consolidation treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma patients at increased risk of relapse or progression.
ADCETRIS received conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission in October 2012. The approved indications in Europe are: (1) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT, or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option, (2) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL, (3) for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT, (4) for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least one prior systemic therapy and (5) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CD30-positive Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with AVD.
ADCETRIS has received marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in more than 70 countries for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL. See important safety information below.
ADCETRIS is being evaluated broadly in more than 70 clinical trials, including a Phase 3 study in first-line Hodgkin lymphoma (ECHELON-1) and another Phase 3 study in first-line CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas (ECHELON-2), as well as trials in many additional types of CD30-positive malignancies.
Seattle Genetics and Takeda are jointly developing ADCETRIS. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Seattle Genetics has U.S. and Canadian commercialization rights and Takeda has rights to commercialize ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. Seattle Genetics and Takeda are funding joint development costs for ADCETRIS on a 50:50 basis, except in Japan where Takeda is solely responsible for development costs.

ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) Important Safety Information (European Union)
Please refer to Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
ADCETRIS is contraindicated for patients with hypersensitivity to brentuximab vedotin and its excipients. In addition, combined use of ADCETRIS with bleomycin causes pulmonary toxicity.
SPECIAL WARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): John Cunningham virus (JCV) reactivation resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death can occur in patients treated with ADCETRIS. PML has been reported in patients who received ADCETRIS after receiving multiple prior chemotherapy regimens. PML is a rare demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that results from reactivation of latent JCV and is often fatal.
Closely monitor patients for new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs or symptoms, which may be suggestive of PML. Suggested evaluation of PML includes neurology consultation, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JCV DNA by polymerase chain reaction or a brain biopsy with evidence of JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional follow up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established Hold dosing for any suspected case of PML and permanently discontinue ADCETRIS if a diagnosis of PML is confirmed.
Be alert to PML symptoms that the patient may not notice (e.g., cognitive, neurological, or psychiatric symptoms).
Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients treated with ADCETRIS. Fatal outcomes have been reported. Closely monitor patients for new or worsening abdominal pain, which may be suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Patient evaluation may include physical examination, laboratory evaluation for serum amylase and serum lipase, and abdominal imaging, such as ultrasound and other appropriate diagnostic measures. Hold ADCETRIS for any suspected case of acute pancreatitis. ADCETRIS should be discontinued if a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed.
Pulmonary Toxicity: Cases of pulmonary toxicity, some with fatal outcomes, including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), have been reported in patients receiving ADCETRIS. Although a causal association with ADCETRIS has not been established, the risk of pulmonary toxicity cannot be ruled out. Promptly evaluate and treat new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g. cough, dyspnoea) appropriately. Consider holding dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.
Serious infections and opportunistic infections: Serious infections such as pneumonia, staphylococcal bacteremia, sepsis/septic shock (including fatal outcomes), and herpes zoster, and opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and oral candidiasis have been reported in patients treated with ADCETRIS. Carefully monitor patients during treatment for emergence of possible serious and opportunistic infections.
Infusion-related reactions (IRR): Immediate and delayed IRR, as well as anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADCETRIS. Carefully monitor patients during and after an infusion. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue administration of ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy. If an IRR occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. The infusion may be restarted at a slower rate after symptom resolution. Patients who have experienced a prior IRR should be premedicated for subsequent infusions. IRRs are more frequent and more severe in patients with antibodies to ADCETRIS.
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): TLS has been reported with ADCETRIS. Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden are at risk of TLS. Monitor these patients closely and manage according to best medical practice.
Peripheral neuropathy (PN): ADCETRIS treatment may cause PN, both sensory and motor. ADCETRIS-induced PN is typically an effect of cumulative exposure to ADCETRIS and is reversible in most cases. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening PN may require a delay and a dose reduction or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.
Hematological toxicities: Grade 3 or Grade 4 anemia, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged (equal to or greater than one week) Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia can occur with ADCETRIS. Monitor complete blood counts prior to administration of each dose.
Febrile neutropenia: Febrile neutropenia has been reported with ADCETRIS. Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to administration of each dose of treatment. Closely monitor patients for fever and manage according to best medical practice if febrile neutropenia develops.

When ADCETRIS is administered in combination with AVD, primary prophylaxis with G‑CSF is recommended for all patients beginning with the first dose.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS): SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with ADCETRIS. Fatal outcomes have been reported. Discontinue treatment with ADCETRIS if SJS or TEN occurs and administer appropriate medical therapy.
Gastrointestinal (GI) Complications: GI complications, some with fatal outcomes, including intestinal obstruction, ileus, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, erosion, ulcer, perforation and haemorrhage, have been reported with ADCETRIS. Promptly evaluate and treat patients if new or worsening GI symptoms occur.
Hepatotoxicity: Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have been reported with ADCETRIS. Serious cases of hepatotoxicity, including fatal outcomes, have also occurred. Pre-existing liver disease, comorbidities, and concomitant medications may also increase the risk. Test liver function prior to treatment initiation and routinely monitor during treatment. Patients experiencing hepatotoxicity may require a delay, dose modification, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.
Hyperglycemia: Hyperglycemia has been reported during trials in patients with an elevated body mass index (BMI) with or without a history of diabetes mellitus. Closely monitor serum glucose for patients who experiences an event of hyperglycemia. Administer anti-diabetic treatment as appropriate.
Renal and Hepatic Impairment: There is limited experience in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Available data indicate that MMAE clearance might be affected by severe renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and by low serum albumin concentrations.
CD30+ CTCL: The size of the treatment effect in CD30 + CTCL subtypes other than mycosis fungoides (MF) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) is not clear due to lack of high level evidence. In two single arm phase II studies of ADCETRIS, disease activity has been shown in the subtypes Sézary syndrome (SS), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and mixed CTCL histology. These data suggest that efficacy and safety can be extrapolated to other CTCL CD30+ subtypes. Carefully consider the benefit-risk per patient and use with caution in other CD30+ CTCL patient types.
Sodium content in excipients: This medicinal product contains 13.2 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.7% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
INTERACTIONS
Patients who are receiving a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, concomitantly with ADCETRIS may have an increased risk of neutropenia. If neutropenia develops, refer to dosing recommendations for neutropenia (see SmPC section 4.2). Co-administration of ADCETRIS with a CYP3A4 inducer did not alter the plasma exposure of ADCETRIS but it appeared to reduce plasma concentrations of MMAE metabolites that could be assayed. ADCETRIS is not expected to alter the exposure to drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes.
PREGNANCY: Advise women of childbearing potential to use two methods of effective contraception during treatment with ADCETRIS and until 6 months after treatment. There are no data from the use of ADCETRIS in pregnant women, although studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Do not use ADCETRIS during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risks to the fetus.
LACTATION (breast-feeding): There are no data as to whether ADCETRIS or its metabolites are excreted in human milk, therefore a risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. With the potential risk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue/abstain from therapy with ADCETRIS.
FERTILITY: In nonclinical studies, ADCETRIS treatment has resulted in testicular toxicity, and may alter male fertility. Advise men being treated with ADCETRIS not to father a child during treatment and for up to 6 months following the last dose.
Effects on ability to drive and use machines: ADCETRIS may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS
Monotherapy: The most frequent adverse reactions (≥10%) were infections, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, neutropenia, rash, cough, vomiting, arthralgia, peripheral motor neuropathy, infusion-related reactions, pruritus, constipation, dyspnoea, weight decreased, myalgia and abdominal pain. Serious adverse drug reactions occurred in 12% of patients. The frequency of unique serious adverse drug reactions was ≤1%. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 24% of patients.
Combination Therapy: In the study of ADCETRIS as combination therapy with AVD in 662 patients with previously untreated advanced HL, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were: neutropenia, nausea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, peripheral sensory neuropathy, diarrhoea, pyrexia, alopecia, peripheral motor neuropathy, decreased weight, abdominal pain, anaemia, stomatitis, febrile neutropenia, bone pain, insomnia, decreased appetite, cough, headache, arthralgia, back pain, dyspnoea, myalgia, upper respiratory tract infection, alanine aminotransferase increased. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 3% of patients included febrile neutropenia (17%), pyrexia (6%), and neutropenia (3%). Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 13% of patients.

ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) Important Safety Information (U.S.)
BOXED WARNING
PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY (PML): JC virus infection resulting in PML and death can occur in ADCETRIS-treated patients.
Contraindication
ADCETRIS concomitant with bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity (e.g., interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation).
Warnings and Precautions

Peripheral neuropathy (PN): ADCETRIS causes PN that is predominantly sensory. Cases of motor PN have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced PN is cumulative. Monitor for symptoms such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Institute dose modifications accordingly.
Anaphylaxis and infusion reactions: Infusion-related reactions (IRR), including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients during infusion. If an IRR occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapy. Premedicate patients with a prior IRR before subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid.
Hematologic toxicities: Fatal and serious cases of febrile neutropenia have been reported with ADCETRIS. Prolonged (≥1 week) severe neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia can occur with ADCETRIS.
Administer G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1 for patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated Stage III/IV cHL or previously untreated PTCL.
Monitor complete blood counts prior to each ADCETRIS dose. Monitor more frequently for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for fever. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or G-CSF prophylaxis with subsequent doses.

Serious infections and opportunistic infections: Infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. Closely monitor patients during treatment for bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.
Tumor lysis syndrome: Closely monitor patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden.
Increased toxicity in the presence of severe renal impairment: The frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment.
Increased toxicity in the presence of moderate or severe hepatic impairment: The frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Avoid use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and serious cases have occurred in ADCETRIS-treated patients. Cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin, and occurred after the first ADCETRIS dose or rechallenge. Preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may increase the risk. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. Patients with new, worsening, or recurrent hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.
PML: Fatal cases of JC virus infection resulting in PML have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. First onset of symptoms occurred at various times from initiation of ADCETRIS, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial exposure. In addition to ADCETRIS therapy, other possible contributory factors include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression. Consider PML diagnosis in patients with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities. Hold ADCETRIS if PML is suspected and discontinue ADCETRIS if PML is confirmed.
Pulmonary toxicity: Fatal and serious events of noninfectious pulmonary toxicity, including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms, including cough and dyspnea. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, hold ADCETRIS dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.
Serious dermatologic reactions: Fatal and serious cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with ADCETRIS. If SJS or TEN occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy.
Gastrointestinal (GI) complications: Fatal and serious cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported. Other fatal and serious GI complications include perforation, hemorrhage, erosion, ulcer, intestinal obstruction, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, and ileus. Lymphoma with preexisting GI involvement may increase the risk of perforation. In the event of new or worsening GI symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, perform a prompt diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately.
Embryo-fetal toxicity: Based on the mechanism of action and animal studies, ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus, and to avoid pregnancy during ADCETRIS treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of ADCETRIS.
Most Common (≥20% in any study) Adverse Reactions
Peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, constipation, vomiting, alopecia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, anemia, stomatitis, lymphopenia, and mucositis.
Drug Interactions
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers has the potential to affect the exposure to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).
Use in Specific Populations
Moderate or severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment: MMAE exposure and adverse reactions are increased. Avoid use.
Advise males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during ADCETRIS treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of ADCETRIS.
Advise patients to report pregnancy immediately and avoid breastfeeding while receiving ADCETRIS.

 The split dosing regimen provides an option to health care practitioners to split the infusion of DARZALEX over two consecutive days and is approved by EC in Dec,2018 and its sBLA is filled by Janssen 
 Darzalex (daratumumab, IV infusion) is a human IgG1k mAb, binds with CD38 molecule targeted for multiple myeloma and has received two BT designation from the U.S. FDA for multiple myeloma, as both a monothx and combination therapy. In Aug 2012, Janssen acquired WW development & commercialization rights for Darzalex from Genmab","DARZALEX split dosing regimen approved by U.S. FDA
Provides healthcare professionals with option to split first DARZALEX infusion over two consecutive days
Approval supported by data from EQUULEUS (MMY1001) clinical trial
Genmab A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: GEN) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has approved a split dosing regimen for DARZALEX (daratumumab). The approval will be included in an update to the Prescribing Information in order to provide healthcare professionals the option to split the first infusion of DARZALEX over two consecutive days. The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) was submitted by Genmab’s licensing partner, Janssen Biotech, Inc., in July, 2018. The split dosing option was previously approved in Europe by the European Commission in December 2018. In August 2012, Genmab granted Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab.
“We are pleased that, with this change, patients in the U.S. receiving their first infusion of DARZALEX may now have this more flexible dosing option,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab
This approval was supported by data from the Phase Ib EQUULEUS (MMY1001) clinical trial, which demonstrated DARZALEX pharmacokinetics (PK) concentrations were comparable regardless of whether the first dose was administered as a split infusion or as a single first infusion in patients with multiple myeloma. The safety profile of DARZALEX was comparable when administered initially as either a split or a single dose.
About the EQUULEUS (MMY1001) Study
The Phase Ib EQUULEUS open-label study includes up to 240 patients with the goal of evaluating the safety, tolerability and dose of daratumumab when administered in combination with various backbone treatment regimens for different settings of multiple myeloma.
About DARZALEX(daratumumab)
DARZALEX (daratumumab) injection for intravenous infusion is indicated in the United States in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (PI); and as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent, or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.1 DARZALEX is the first monoclonal antibody (mAb) to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) approval to treat multiple myeloma. DARZALEX is indicated in Europe in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; and as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a PI and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. The option to split the first infusion of DARZALEX over two consecutive days has been approved in both Europe and the U.S. In Japan, DARZALEX is approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. DARZALEX is the first human CD38 monoclonal antibody to reach the market in the United Stated, Europe and Japan. For more information, visit www.DARZALEX.com.
Daratumumab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to the CD38 molecule, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. Daratumumab triggers a person’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells, resulting in rapid tumor cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action and through immunomodulatory effects, in addition to direct tumor cell death, via apoptosis (programmed cell death).1,2,3,4,5
Daratumumab is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. under an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab from Genmab. A comprehensive clinical development program for daratumumab is ongoing, including multiple Phase III studies in smoldering, relapsed and frontline multiple myeloma settings and in amyloidosis. Additional studies are ongoing or planned to assess the potential of daratumumab in other malignant and pre-malignant diseases, such as NKT-cell lymphoma, B and T-ALL. Daratumumab has received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA, for multiple myeloma, as both a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies.

8575,ï»¿Gilead Reports Results of Selonsertib in P-III STELLAR-4 study for Compensated Cirrhosis (F4) due to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),Gilead Announces Topline Data From Phase 3 STELLAR-4 Study of Selonsertib in Compensated Cirrhosis (F4) Due to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),"The P-III STELLAR-4 study involves assessing of Selonsertib (18mg, 6mg, qd) vs PBO (qd) in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to NASH for 240 wks.
 The P-III study didn’t meet its 1EPs @48wks., achieved a ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis (14.4%, 12.5% or 12.8%) and was well-tolerated with safe results
 Selonsertib is qd an oral inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), evaluated in P-II ATLAS study in combination with cilofexor (GS-9674) and firsocostat (GS-0976) for advanced fibrosis due to NASH","FOSTER CITY, Calif.– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that STELLAR-4, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selonsertib, an investigational, once-daily, oral inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), did not meet the pre-specified week 48 primary endpoint of a ≥ 1-stage histologic improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH.
In the study of 877 enrolled patients who received study drug, 14.4 percent of patients treated with selonsertib 18 mg (p=0.56 vs. placebo) and 12.5 percent of patients treated with selonsertib 6 mg (p=1.00) achieved a ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis according to the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) classification without worsening of NASH after 48 weeks of treatment, compared with 12.8 percent of patients who received placebo. Selonsertib was generally well-tolerated and safety results were consistent with prior studies.
“While we are disappointed that the STELLAR-4 study did not achieve its primary endpoint, we remain committed to advancing therapies for patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH, where there is a significant unmet need for effective and well-tolerated treatments. Gilead has a long-term commitment and proven track record of addressing significant challenges in the field of liver diseases. Data from this large study of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH, including the extensive set of biomarkers collected, will further advance our understanding of the disease and inform our broader NASH development programs,” said John McHutchison, AO, MD, Chief Scientific Officer, Head of Research and Development, Gilead. “We are grateful to the patients and investigators who participated in the STELLAR-4 study, and we now await the upcoming results from the Phase 3 STELLAR-3 trial of selonsertib in patients with bridging fibrosis (F3) due to NASH and the Phase 2 ATLAS combination trial of selonsertib, cilofexor (GS-9674) and firsocostat (GS-0976) in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH later this year.”
Further in-depth analysis of the findings is ongoing and the data will be submitted to an upcoming scientific conference. Gilead will work with the Data Monitoring Committee and investigators to conclude the STELLAR-4 study in a manner consistent with the best interests of each patient.
Selonsertib, cilofexor and firsocostat, alone or in combination, are investigational compounds and are not approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authority. Safety and efficacy have not been established for these agents.
About Selonsertib and the STELLAR-4 Study
Selonsertib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of ASK1, a protein that promotes inflammation, apoptosis (cell death) and fibrosis in settings of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can be increased in many pathological conditions including liver diseases such as NASH.
The STELLAR-4 study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selonsertib in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to NASH. Eligible adults ages 18 to 70 years were randomized and received selonsertib 18 mg (n=354), selonsertib 6 mg (n=351) or placebo (n=172) for up to 240 weeks. Either selonsertib or placebo is being administered orally once daily. The primary endpoints of the study are a composite of the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis according to the NASH CRN classification without worsening of NASH at week 48 and event-free survival at week 240 as assessed by time to the first clinical event. Further information about the clinical study can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
About Gilead’s Clinical Programs in NASH
NASH is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterized by fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver, which can lead to scarring, or fibrosis, that impairs liver function. Individuals with advanced fibrosis, including bridging fibrosis (F3) or compensated cirrhosis (F4), are at a significantly higher risk of liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality.
Gilead is advancing multiple novel investigational compounds for the treatment of advanced fibrosis due to NASH, evaluating single-agent and combination therapy approaches against the core pathways associated with NASH – hepatocyte lipotoxicity, inflammation and fibrosis. Investigational compounds in development include the ASK1 inhibitor selonsertib, the selective, non-steroidal FXR agonist cilofexor (GS-9674) and the ACC inhibitor firsocostat (GS-0976). The STELLAR-3 Phase 3 trial evaluating selonsertib among NASH patients with bridging fibrosis (F3) is ongoing. Cilofexor and firsocostat are currently in Phase 2 studies in NASH, including the ATLAS Phase 2 trial evaluating combinations of selonsertib, cilofexor and firsocostat in advanced fibrosis (F3 and F4) due to NASH.

8677,Janssen (J&amp;J) Reports Voting Results from FDA Advisory Committees for Spravato (esketamine) in Adults with Resistant Depression,FDA Advisory Committee Recommends Approval of SPRAVATO (esketamine) Nasal Spray C III for Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression,"FDA’s PDAC & DSaRM has jointly voted (14 yes, 2 no, 1 abstain) for favorable benefit-risk profile of Spravato (esketamine) nasal spray C-III, based on five P-III studies (including three short term, one maintenance and a long-term study) vs PBO in patients with treatment-resistant depression
 The study demonstrated no new safety signals with well tolerated results, providing support for its NDA filling to the US FDA on 4 Sept,2018, with its expected PDUFA date on 4 Mar,2019
 Spravato (esketamine) is a glutamate receptor modulator nasal spray, used for restoring synaptic connections in the brain cells in major depressive disorders and has received FDA’s BT designation for treatment-resistant depression with imminent risk for suicide","If approved, SPRAVATO will offer the first new mechanism of action in 30 years to treat this debilitating disease, continuing Janssen’s 60-plus-year history and commitment to research that make a difference for people living with mental illnesses, including severe mood disorders

TITUSVILLE, N.J., – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Psychopharmacologic Drug Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee jointly voted (14 yes, 2 no, 1 abstain) that data support the favorable benefit-risk profile of SPRAVATOTM (esketamine) nasal spray CIII for adults living with treatment-resistant depression. SPRAVATOTM is an investigational prescription treatment that is thought to work differently than currently approved therapies for major depressive disorder (MDD). Janssen announced on September 4, 2018 that it submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for the approval of SPRAVATO.1 If approved, SPRAVATO would provide the first new mechanism of action in 30 years to treat this debilitating mental illness.2,3
“We are pleased with the advisory committees’ vote and their recommendation to approve SPRAVATO as a potential therapy for adults living with treatment-resistant depression,” said Husseini K. Manji, M.D., Global Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “Our comprehensive research program for esketamine nasal spray supports a positive benefit-risk profile for adults with treatment-resistant depression.”
The committees based their support on the safety and efficacy data from five Phase 3 studies in patients with treatment-resistant depression: three short-term studies; one maintenance of effect study; and one long-term safety study. In addition, the SPRAVATOTM research program provided supportive data from three Phase 2 studies and 19 Phase 1 studies in patients with treatment-resistant depression and healthy volunteers. Data from both a short-term Phase 3 study and a long-term Phase 3 study demonstrated that esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant provided statistically significant, clinically meaningful, rapid, and sustained improvement of depressive symptoms in this difficult-to-treat population.4,5 All the patients who participated in the Phase 3 studies received esketamine or placebo in addition to a newly initiated oral antidepressant at the start of the treatment phase.
The long-term safety study showed that esketamine was generally tolerable, with no new safety signals with dosing up to 52 weeks compared to data from short-term (4-week) studies.6 Discontinuation rates due to esketamine-related adverse events were low and occurred typically in the first weeks. Most treatment-emergent adverse events, including dissociative symptoms, dizziness/vertigo, increased blood pressure, and sedation, occurred shortly after dosing while patients were under the supervision of a health care professional, were transient, and resolved the same day. In addition to the comprehensive clinical research program, the company proposed a robust Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
While the FDA is not bound by the committees’ recommendation, it does take its advice into consideration. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for SPRAVATOTM is March 4, 2019.
About SPRAVATOTM
SPRAVATOTM (esketamine) nasal spray is an investigational product being studied by Janssen Research & Development, LLC as part of a global development program. Esketamine is a glutamate receptor modulator, thought to help restore synaptic connections in brain cells in people with major depressive disorder. It is believed to have a novel mechanism of action, meaning it is thought to work differently than currently available therapies for major depressive disorder.
The U.S. FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designations for esketamine for treatment-resistant depression and for a second indication, major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide.7
About Treatment-Resistant Depression
Major depressive disorder affects nearly 300 million people of all ages globally and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Individuals with depression, including major depressive disorder, experience continuous suffering from a serious, biologically based disease which has a significant negative impact on all aspects of life, including quality of life and function.8 Although currently available antidepressants are effective for many patients, about one-third of patients do not respond to treatment and are thought to have treatment-resistant depression.9

 Lebrikizumab is a mAb, bind to IL-13, involved in prevention of the formation of IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα heterodimer complex and is evaluated in P-IIb study in 280 patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis aged >18yrs.","Almirall acquires option to license rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis in Europe
– Dermira to receive an option fee of $30 million
– Lebrikizumab is an investigational anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody currently in Phase 2b development with topline data expected by early April 2019

BARCELONA, Spain and MENLO PARK, Calif.,- Almirall, S.A. (BME: ALM) and Dermira, Inc. (NASDAQ: DERM) announced today that the companies have entered into an option and license agreement under which Almirall has acquired an option to exclusively license rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and certain other indications in Europe. In exchange, Dermira will receive an upfront option fee of $30 million. If Almirall exercises its option to obtain the license following the results of the ongoing Phase 2b study, Dermira will receive a $50 million option exercise fee and will be eligible to receive additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments, as well as double-digit royalties.
Lebrikizumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that blocks signaling of IL-13, a cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Based on the central role of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis and lebrikizumab’s unique molecular profile, combining a differentiated mechanism of action, high affinity for its target and robust pharmacokinetics, Dermira and Almirall believe targeting IL-13 with lebrikizumab presents an opportunity to deliver a therapy with a compelling combination of safety, tolerability, efficacy, convenience and ease of use to people living with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and the healthcare practitioners who care for them.
“As a prevalent, debilitating condition with limited treatment options, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis represents a significant unmet medical need. Almirall shares our commitment to dermatology and excitement about the opportunity for lebrikizumab to advance the standard of care for the millions of people living this condition,” said Tom Wiggans, chairman and chief executive officer of Dermira. “This transaction is an excellent financial, operational and strategic fit for Dermira, and we are pleased to have the opportunity to enlist Almirall’s development and commercial expertise to help make lebrikizumab available in Europe while we continue to pursue development and potential commercialization in the U.S.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Almirall will make an initial payment of $30 million to Dermira in exchange for an option to acquire an exclusive license to develop lebrikizumab in dermatology indications and commercialize lebrikizumab in all indications in Europe. Following the availability of topline data from Dermira’s ongoing Phase 2b clinical study of lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, Dermira will provide to Almirall a data package consisting of topline and additional data, after which Almirall will have 45 days to exercise its option. If Almirall elects to exercise its option, the company will pay Dermira an option exercise fee of $50 million.
If Almirall exercises its option, Almirall will be obligated to make additional payments to Dermira upon the achievement of certain milestones, including $30 million in connection with the initiation of certain Phase 3 clinical studies and up to $85 million upon the achievement of regulatory milestones and the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab in Europe. In addition, Dermira will be entitled to receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain thresholds for net sales of lebrikizumab in Europe, as well as royalty payments representing percentages of net sales that range from the low double-digits to the low twenties.
“At Almirall, we continue to deepen in our commitment to dermatology,” said Peter Guenter, chief executive officer of Almirall. “Atopic dermatitis is a condition that affects millions of people living in Europe, and we are pleased to support the development and commercialization of lebrikizumab, a differentiated treatment that we believe could become a best-in-disease therapy for these patients. We are excited to be collaborating with Dermira and look forward to positive results from the Phase 2b study and subsequently moving into registrational studies.”
Lebrikizumab Phase 2b Study Design
Dermira is conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as monotherapy in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Based on early clinical experience with lebrikizumab, the study is designed to build on the body of evidence supporting targeting of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis by evaluating three different dosing regimens, with the objective of optimizing the clinical profile of lebrikizumab and establishing the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program. The study enrolled 280 patients ages 18 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the United States, randomized in a 3:3:3:2 fashion as follows:

Group 1: A loading dose of 250 mg of lebrikizumab at week 0, followed by 125 mg of lebrikizumab every four weeks.
Group 2: A loading dose of 500 mg of lebrikizumab at week 0, followed by 250 mg of lebrikizumab every four weeks.
Group 3: A loading dose of 500 mg of lebrikizumab at each of weeks 0 and 2, followed by 250 mg of lebrikizumab every two weeks.
Group 4: Placebo at week 0 and every two weeks thereafter.
The primary endpoint of the study is the percent change in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) from baseline to week 16. Key secondary endpoints that will be evaluated during the 16-week treatment period include: the proportion of patients with a 75 percent improvement from baseline in EASI (EASI-75); the proportion of patients with an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a reduction of 2 or more points (on a 5-point scale) from baseline; the proportion of patients achieving EASI-50 and EASI-90; and changes in pruritus (itch) and sleep loss scores from baseline, both scored using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). Key inclusion criteria for patients enrolled in this study included chronic atopic dermatitis for at least one year, an EASI score of 16 or greater, an IGA score of 3 or greater, and a body surface area involving at least 10 percent at screening and baseline. Following the end of the 16-week assessment period, patients will be followed for an additional 16 weeks. Topline safety and efficacy results from the study are expected by early April 2019.
About Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis is the most common and severe form of eczema, a chronic inflammatory condition that can present as early as childhood and continue into adulthood. A moderate-to-severe form of the disease is characterized by persistent itching and red, dry, cracked skin that covers much of the body. The skin condition can have a negative impact on patients’ mental and physical functioning, limiting their daily activities and health-related quality of life. Patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have reported a larger impact on quality of life than patients with psoriasis.
About Lebrikizumab 
Lebrikizumab is a novel, humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind IL-13 with high affinity, specifically preventing the formation of the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα heterodimer complex and subsequent signaling, thereby inhibiting the biological effects of IL-13 in a targeted and efficient fashion. IL-13 is a central pathogenic mediator that drives multiple aspects of the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis by promoting type 2 inflammation and mediating its effects on tissue, resulting in skin barrier dysfunction, itch, skin thickening and infection.

8887,Novartis' Egaten (triclabendazole) Receives FDA's Approval for Fascioliasis in the US,"Novartis receives FDA approval for Egaten for the treatment of fascioliasis, a neglected tropical disease","The approval is based on the study assessing Egaten (triclabendazole) in patients with fascioliasis aged ≥ 6yrs.
 Novartis’ Egaten is in use since 2005 by WH, serving 2M fascioliasis patients in 30 countries, and renewed the agreement of donating Egaten in 2018 to 2022 for the treatment of 300,000 patients/year
 Egaten (triclabendazole) is a drug targeted for fascioliasis, registered on WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and has received FDA’s Priority Review voucher based on this approval","Egaten is the only drug approved in the US for the treatment of people with fascioliasis and is currently the only treatment recommended by the WHO 
Fascioliasis, commonly known as liver fluke infestation, is estimated to infect 2.4 million people globally[1]
Novartis has been donating Egaten to the WHO since 2005, helping to treat around 2 million patients in more than 30 countries
FDA approval reinforces the company’s commitment to reduce the burden of neglected tropical diseases including fascioliasis, leprosy and malaria
Basel, Switzerland, – Novartis announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Egaten® (triclabendazole) for the treatment of fascioliasis in patients six years of age and older. This makes Egaten the only FDA-approved drug for people with this disease and is expected to facilitate broader access to this important drug not only in the US, but also in affected countries worldwide.
“Novartis has a long-standing commitment to addressing global health challenges and supporting disease elimination efforts, in diseases such as leprosy, malaria and fascioliasis,” said Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. “Today’s FDA approval of Egaten is another important milestone that we believe will help further expand access to this one-day treatment, taking us a step closer toward disease elimination.”
Fascioliasis, commonly known as liver fluke infestation, is a neglected tropical disease that infects 2.4 million people worldwide[1], with an additional 180 million at risk of infection[2]. It is caused by two species of parasitic flatworms that can infect humans following ingestion of larvae in contaminated water or food.
Egaten is currently the only medicine for fascioliasis recommended by the WHO and is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It is supplied by WHO during epidemic outbreaks and for periodic use in endemic countries. FDA approval of Egaten is expected to facilitate drug licensing and import to these countries, helping ensure sufficient and prompt availability of the drug when needed. Fascioliasis is recognized by the FDA as a neglected tropical disease, triggering the award of a Priority Review Voucher based upon this approval.
Novartis has been donating Egaten to the WHO since 2005, helping to treat around 2 million fascioliasis patients in more than 30 countries. In 2018, we renewed our agreement with the WHO to extend the drug donation until 2022, expected to reach 300 000 patients per year.
“This FDA decision is welcome news for millions who suffer or are at risk of fascioliasis and removes a major hurdle in expanding treatment to countries where it is most needed,” said Dr Mwelecela Malecela, Director of the Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases at the WHO. “We are thankful to Novartis for their sustained decade-long commitment in tackling yet another disease of poverty.”
The Novartis commitment to neglected tropical diseases
Novartis is a signatory to the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, which aims to control, eliminate or eradicate 10 diseases by 2020. The Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, founded in 2001, is dedicated to finding new medicines to treat neglected diseases. In addition to malaria, research currently focuses on parasitic diseases such as cryptosporidiosis (diarrheal disease) and three major kinetoplastid diseases: human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. Building on our experience in neglected diseases, Novartis also implements programs to target access to medicine for chronic diseases and, most recently, to address sickle cell disease in Africa, starting in Ghana.
About fascioliasis
Fascioliasis is caused by two species of parasitic flatworms or trematodes that mainly affect the liver (Fasciola hepatica or Fasciola gigantica). Both species can infect humans following ingestion of larvae in contaminated water or food (mainly raw or undercooked vegetation). The larvae mature into adult worms in the biliary tract. No continent is free from fascioliasis; human cases have been reported from more than 70 countries worldwide[1].
Left untreated, fascioliasis can result in considerable pain and discomfort, leading to poor quality of life and loss of productivity. The acute phase of the disease is manifested with fever, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and eosinophilia. The disease later progresses to a latent phase with less symptoms and ultimately into a chronic or obstructive phase. In children, fascioliasis can be a serious infection with high fever, enlarged tender liver, and anemia.
About Novartis

As a leading global medicines company, we use innovative science and digital technologies to create transformative treatments in areas of great medical need.

The transaction is expected to close in Q2’19
 The focus of the agreement is to advance surgical treatments in connection with digital technologies for the treatment of lung cancer including open, laparoscopic, robotic and endoluminal surgeries
 Auris Health’s Monarch Platform is an endoscopic robotic technology with advancement in micro-instrumentation, sensing, & data science in one platform for improved outcomes","Auris Health’s Robotic Platform Expands Johnson & Johnson’s Digital Surgery Portfolio
New Brunswick, NJ – Focused on creating the next frontier of surgery, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), today announced that Ethicon, Inc., entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion in cash. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health is a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. This acquisition will accelerate Johnson & Johnson’s entry into robotics with potential for growth and expansion into other interventional applications.
“In this new era of health care, we’re aiming to simplify surgery, drive efficiency, reduce complications and improve outcomes for patients, ultimately making surgery safer,” said Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices, Johnson & Johnson. “We believe the combination of best-in-class robotics, advanced instrumentation and unparalleled end-to-end connectivity will make a meaningful difference in patient outcomes.”
With this acquisition, Frederic Moll, M.D., CEO and Founder of Auris Health and a visionary in the field of surgical robotics, will be joining Johnson & Johnson upon completion of this transaction.
“We’re thrilled to be joining Johnson & Johnson to help push the boundaries of what is possible in medical robotics and improve the lives of patients across the globe. Together, we will be able to dramatically accelerate our collective product innovation to develop new interventional solutions that redefine optimal patient outcomes,” said Dr. Moll. “This combination is a testament to the incredible work of the Auris Health team and the innovation engine behind the Monarch Platform, which represents a huge step forward in endoluminal technology. We look forward to continuing to shape the future of intervention with the added expertise and resources of the world’s largest healthcare organization.”
Johnson & Johnson is continuously working to disrupt medical innovation. With Auris Health’s current focus on lung cancer, the Monarch Platform robotic technology will play an important role within the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson (LCI), enabling the development of a differentiated digital solution that addresses key steps in the lung cancer care journey, from diagnosis to early stage intervention, that are central to the company’s commitment to develop solutions that prevent, intercept and cure this deadly disease.
Johnson & Johnson continues to make meaningful investments to transform the surgical experience, connecting digital solutions to enhance surgical performance. In addition to advancing the company’s focused initiatives to combat lung cancer, Auris Health’s technology will support Johnson & Johnson’s vision of being a world leader across the continuum of surgical approaches, including open, laparoscopic, robotic and endoluminal. This move is also complementary to the acquisition of Orthotaxy’s robotic technology for orthopaedics and the continued development of the Verb Surgical Platform, through a strategic partnership with Verily.
“We are very committed to our partnership with Verily on the development of the Verb Surgical Platform. Collectively, these technologies, together with our market-leading medical implants and solutions, create the foundation of a comprehensive digital ecosystem to help support the surgeon and patient before, during and after surgery,” said Ms. McEvoy.
Johnson & Johnson is creating a connected digital ecosystem centered around using data to improve patient outcomes that leverages world-class robotic technology. This ecosystem will empower patients to take charge of their health, guide surgeons through procedures and help them advance their skills and enable healthcare systems to deliver more consistent procedures while also managing costs.
The closing is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2019. The company will discuss the transaction further during its next quarterly earnings call on April 16, 2019.

 Proleukin (aldesleukin, human recombinant IL-2) is a synthetic protein acts similarily as nterleukin-2 (IL-2) involved in activating WBCs and is being evaluated in 80 trials in the US for multiple therapy areas","Clinigen Group plc (AIM: CLIN, ‘Clinigen’ or the ‘Group’), the global pharmaceutical and services company, has signed an agreement with Novartis to acquire the US rights to Proleukin® (aldesleukin, human recombinant interleukin-2) for up to $210m in cash, consisting of an upfront and deferred payments along with future sales-related milestones.
Clinigen already owns the rights to Proleukin outside the US, which it acquired in July 2018.
Highlights

Proleukin is indicated for metastatic melanoma and metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the US
Clinigen will be the exclusive global owner of the licensed version of this drug
Currently being used in around 80 active studies within the US across multiple disease areas
Has the potential to become an integral part of cancer combination therapies
Total consideration: up to $210m for US rights to Proleukin
Initial $120m payable
$60m deferred consideration over the 12 months following completion
A further $30m consideration based on sales milestones
In the year to 30 June 2018, in the US, Proleukin made revenue of $60.0m according to IQvia (IMS). Gross profit margin is expected to be similar to other specialty medicines within the Commercial Medicines division
The acquisition will be modestly EPS accretive in the current financial year as the product transitions to Clinigen, and at least 25% accretive in the first full financial year
Clinigen has increased its debt facility from £300m to £375m; terms of the extended debt remain unchanged with the facility in place until October 2023
Proleukin further diversifies the Commercial Medicines portfolio of niche hospital-only and critical care products. The Group currently owns three product assets within the US – Foscavir®, Ethyol® and Totect® with commercial rights currently licensed to Pfizer (Foscavir) and Cumberland Pharmaceuticals (Ethyol and Totect)
Clinigen expects adjusted EBITDA* in the six months ended 31 December 2018 to be £41.8m (2017: £34.4m) representing 22% reported growth or 8% growth on an organic basis**, underlining how the Group continues to be highly cash generative.
On completion, the Group’s bank covenant leverage*** is expected to be around 2.4x net debt / EBITDA before reducing towards 2.0x by 31 December 2019.
The completion of the acquisition is subject to US anti-trust clearance and is expected to occur in April 2019.
Shaun Chilton, Group Chief Executive Officer, Clinigen, said:
“This highly earnings enhancing acquisition of US rights to Proleukin is significant to the whole Group not just the Commercial Medicines division.
“As part of Commercial Medicines, Proleukin is an excellent fit within our oncology and infectious disease medicines as well as diversifying our wider portfolio – it will be the largest product in the portfolio in terms of current sales. The product has significant potential for revitalisation, which will provide further breadth and diversity to the portfolio and material increases in revenues.
“For Clinigen as a whole, Proleukin creates an ideal platform to expand our existing footprint in the higher value US market and therefore enables us to exploit other opportunities across the business. This follows our acquisition last year of CSM and iQone which strengthened our Continental European footprint.
“At the financial level, the combination of this deal structure and the Group’s cash generative nature will ensure our debt profile reduces quickly over the next year.”
* Adjusted EBITDA excludes amortisation of acquired intangibles and products, and other non-underlying items relating to acquisitions, and includes the Group’s share of EBITDA from its joint venture.
** Year on year comparisons referred to as ‘organic’, are a measure of growth on a constant currency basis, excluding the impact of business and product acquisitions. Business and product acquisitions in the current period are excluded from organic EBITDA and for the acquisitions completing in the prior year, they are included on a pro-forma basis as if they occurred on the first day of the prior year. Organic growth is presented to aid the reader’s understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
*** Bank covenant leverage is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA of the Group for the last 12 months by net debt at the period end. Adjusted EBITDA includes the EBITDA from the businesses and assets acquired during the last 12 months, including on a pro forma basis the period prior to it becoming a member of the Group.

Notes to Editors
About Proleukin (aldesleukin)
Proleukin (aldesleukin) is indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (metastatic RCC). In certain markets Proleukin is also indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic melanoma. Careful patient selection is mandatory prior to the administration of Proleukin.
Proleukin is a synthetic protein, and acts in the body in a very similar way to a human protein called interleukin-2 (IL-2). This protein is part of the immune system. IL-2 activates certain white blood cells in the body called lymphocytes, which fight against diseases and infections. IL-2 stimulates the production of lymphocytes in the body, and enhances the body’s defences.
About metastatic renal cell carcinoma (metastatic RCC)
Renal cell carcinoma occurs when cancer cells form in the tubules of the kidney. Tubules are tiny tubes in your kidney that help filter waste products from your blood in order to make urine.
Smoking, hypertension, obesity, and hepatitis C all increase the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma becomes metastatic renal cell carcinoma when it spreads beyond your kidney to your lymph system, bones, or other organs.
About metastatic melanoma
Melanoma is the rarest and most dangerous type of skin cancer. It begins in the melanocytes, which are the cells in your skin that produce melanin. Melanoma develops into growths on your skin, which often resemble moles. These growths or tumours may also come from existing moles. Melanomas can form on skin anywhere on your body, including inside the mouth or vagina.
Metastatic melanoma occurs when the cancer spreads from the tumour to other parts of your body. This is also known as stage 4 melanoma. Melanoma is the most likely of all skin cancers to become metastatic if not caught early.

 The combination trial agreement is built upon the trial assessing VB10.16 monothx in patients with precancerous cervical lesion. Vaccibody plans for the onset of P-II for the combination in H2’19
 Tecentriq (atezolizumab) is a mAb inhibiting PD-L1 while blocking its interaction with PD-1 and B7.1 receptor. VB10.16 is a DNA vaccine, targeting HPV16 induced malignancies and is evaluated in P-I/IIa study for patients with pre-cancerous HPV16 induced high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia","Vaccibody AS, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company, announced today that it has entered into a collaboration with Roche to explore a combination of Vaccibody’s VB10.16 and the PD-L1-blocking immune-checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) in patients with advanced cervical cancer. Vaccibody expects to start a phase II study with up to 50 patients in the second half of 2019.
Martin Bonde, CEO of Vaccibody, said: “We are very pleased with this collaboration. This is an important study as it explores a novel targeted treatment approach that addresses the high medical need of patients with advanced cervical cancer.” Agnete Fredriksen, President and CSO of Vaccibody added: “The combination of VB10.16 and atezolizumab is building on the positive data VB10.16 has generated as monotherapy in patients with precancerous cervical lesions. In this study, it was observed that VB10.16 creates a target for PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, thereby providing a sound scientific rationale for combining VB10.16 with an immune-checkpoint inhibitor like atezolizumab in cervical cancer patients.”
The planned study will assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of the VB10.16-atezolizumab combination in patients with advanced cervical cancer.
 
About VB10.16
VB10.16 is an investigational therapeutic DNA vaccine developed to treat human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) induced pre-malignancies and malignancies. The drug candidate has demonstrated favorable 6M interim clinical data in a Phase I/IIa study in pre-cancerous HPV16 induced high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL; CIN 2/3).
 
About cervical cancer
Cervical cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women in developing countries and is the second most commonly occurring cancer amongst women worldwide. An estimated 45,800 cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed in the US and EU in 2019 and similarly an estimated 18,400 deaths from cervical cancer will occur in 2019. Cervical cancer is caused by high risk HPV. HPV16 is the type that most frequently causes cancer. It has been reported to be the most common genotype in high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. It is detected in up to 60% of all cervical cancers, especially in younger women and it has also been found to play an essential role in the development of several other cancer types (approximately 90% of anal cancers; 40% of penile, vaginal, and vulvar cancers; 25% of oral cavity cancers and 35% of oropharyngeal cancers). Gardasil® and Cervarix® are preventive HPV vaccines which prevent infection of HPV, but these do not have an effect in already infected patients. A high percentage of the eligible population for the preventive vaccines does not get vaccinated, thus HPV infection and HPV+ cancer still requires effective therapeutic interventions. There is currently no available therapy treating HPV specifically.
 
About Vaccibody
Vaccibody is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of novel immunotherapies. The company is a leader in the rapidly developing field of individualized cancer neoantigen vaccines and is using the Vaccibody technology to generate best-in-class therapeutics to treat cancers with a high unmet medical need. A phase I/IIa neoantigen clinical trial is currently enrolling patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, clear renal cell carcinoma as well as urothelial or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Vaccibody’s front runner program (VB10.16) is a therapeutic DNA vaccine against HPV16 induced pre-malignancies and malignancies. The first-in-human study (phase I/IIa), which has reported positive 6M interim data, evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of VB10.16 in women with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL; CIN 2/3).

9196,Bayer Reports Results of Darolutamide in P-III ARAMIS trial for Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (nmCRPC),Bayer’s darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly extends metastasis-free survival with a favorable safety profile compared to placebo plus ADT in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,"The P-III ARAMIS trial involves assessing of Darolutamide (600 mg, bid) + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) vs PBO + ADT in 1509 patients in the ratio (2:1) with nmCRPC
 P-III ARAMIS study results: mMFS (40.4 vs 18.4 mos.); 59% reduction in risk of metastasis or death; time to pain progression (40.3 vs 25.4 mos.); PFS (36.8 vs 14.8 mos.); 62% risk reduction of local progression, Presented at ASCO GU in San Francisco
 Darolutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist inhibiting the receptor function and the growth of prostate cancer cells and is evaluated in P-III ARASENS for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer","Statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival (MFS), with a median MFS of 40.4 months with darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo plus ADT (18.4 months) / Positive trend in overall survival with a 29% reduction in risk of death at interim analysis (P=0.045) / Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar for darolutamide plus ADT and placebo plus ADT / Health-related quality of life was maintained / First results from the Phase III ARAMIS trial with the androgen receptor antagonist darolutamide were presented in an oral presentation at American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine
Berlin, Results from the pivotal Phase III ARAMIS trial in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) showed a statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival (MFS) with darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to placebo plus ADT (HR=0.41, 95% CI 0.34-0.50; P<0.001). This translates to a 59 percent reduction in the risk of metastasis or death. The median MFS was 40.4 months in the darolutamide arm compared with 18.4 months for the placebo arm – an overall improvement in median MFS of 22 months.
A positive trend in overall survival (OS) was also observed (HR=0.71, 95% CI 0.50-0.99; P=0.045), and all other secondary endpoints demonstrated a benefit in favor of darolutamide. Importantly, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) with greater than or equal to 5 percent frequency or of grade 3–5 was comparable between darolutamide and placebo arms; only fatigue occurred in more than 10 percent of patients (darolutamide plus ADT resulted in 12.1 percent versus 8.7 percent in patients with placebo plus ADT). Quality of life outcomes were similar between the treatment groups.
These data were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU) in San Francisco and published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.
“In addition to a benefit in MFS, a favorable safety profile is critical for these largely asymptomatic nmCRPC patients because treatment decisions can impact their overall well-being, prognosis and compliance with the treatment as well as other medications that are typical for this patient population. These data are exciting for the prostate cancer community; they not only show darolutamide’s significant efficacy in preventing the spread of prostate cancer, but also its favorable tolerability profile that, once approved, may allow patients to continue their day-to-day life without adding any burden,” said Karim Fizazi, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine at the Institut Gustave Roussy, University of Paris Sud, France.
“While many new treatment options in the field of prostate cancer have been developed in recent years, gaps persist, particularly in providing patients with treatments that are both effective and have a safety profile that does not constitute an additional toxicity burden in their lives,” said Scott Z. Fields, M.D., senior vice president and head of Oncology Development at Bayer’s Pharmaceutical Division. “Bayer is working diligently to bring innovative, efficacious and tolerable treatments to patients in need. With the positive results of the ARAMIS trial, we are one step closer to our goal of bringing darolutamide to patients and physicians.”
Bayer plans to discuss the data from the ARAMIS trial with health authorities regarding the submission of new drug applications. Bayer has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for darolutamide in men with nmCRPC. Darolutamide is being developed jointly by Bayer and Orion Corporation, a globally operating Finnish pharmaceutical company.
Detailed study results
The MFS benefit observed with darolutamide was consistent across all subgroups of patients. In an interim analysis of OS, darolutamide showed a positive trend, with a 29 percent reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.71, 95% CI 0.50-0.99; P=0.045, median not reached).
In addition, darolutamide plus ADT demonstrated a significant benefit over placebo plus ADT for time to pain progression (40.3 months compared to 25.4 months; HR=0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79; P<0.001) and time to cytotoxic chemotherapy (median not reached compared to 38.2; HR=0.43, 95% CI 0.31-0.60; P<0.001). Another secondary endpoint, time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), also demonstrated a benefit in favor of darolutamide (median not reached). Darolutamide extended progression-free survival (PFS) (36.8 months compared to 14.8 months; HR=0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.45; P<0.001), with a 62 percent risk reduction of local progression, distant metastases or death.
Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was similar between darolutamide and placebo; most AEs were grade 1 and 2 (55 percent with darolutamide plus ADT and 54 percent with placebo plus ADT). Compared to placebo plus ADT, darolutamide plus ADT did not increase rates of critical AEs including, but not limited to, seizures, falls, fractures, rash, cognitive disorder, mental impairment or hypertension. Patients with a history of seizure were not excluded from the study.
The results of Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-based endpoints (based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate; FACT-P, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life; EORTC-QLQ-PR25, and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires) demonstrated maintenance of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with a positive trend favoring darolutamide over placebo.
About the ARAMIS trial design
The ARAMIS trial is a randomized, Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral darolutamide in patients with nmCRPC who are currently being treated with ADT as standard of care and are at high risk for developing metastatic disease. 1,509 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 600 mg of darolutamide twice a day or placebo along with ADT.
The primary endpoint of this trial is MFS defined as time between randomization and evidence of metastasis or death. The secondary endpoints of this trial are OS, time to pain progression, time to initiation of first cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to first SSE, and characterization of the safety and tolerability of darolutamide.
About castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men worldwide. In 2018, an estimated 1.2 million men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and about 358,000 died from the disease worldwide. Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men. Prostate cancer results from the abnormal proliferation of cells within the prostate gland, which is part of a man´s reproductive system. It mainly affects men over the age of 50, and the risk increases with age. Treatment options range from surgery to radiation treatment to therapy using hormone-receptor antagonists, i.e. substances that stop the formation of testosterone or prevent its effect at the target location. However, in nearly all cases, the cancer eventually becomes resistant to conventional hormone therapy.
CRPC is an advanced form of the disease where the cancer keeps progressing even when the amount of testosterone is reduced to very low levels in the body. The field of treatment options for castration-resistant patients is evolving rapidly, but until recently, there have been no effective treatment options for CRPC patients who have rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels while on ADT and no detectable metastases. In men with progressive nmCRPC, a short PSA doubling time has been consistently associated with reduced time to first metastasis and death.
About darolutamide
Darolutamide is a non-steroidal androgen receptor antagonist with a distinct chemical structure that binds to the receptor with high affinity and exhibits strong antagonistic activity, thereby inhibiting the receptor function and the growth of prostate cancer cells. In addition to the Phase III trial ARAMIS in men with nmCRPC, darolutamide is also being investigated in a Phase III study in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (ARASENS). Information about these trials can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Darolutamide is not approved by the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency or any other health authority.

9201,Nestle Health Science (NHSc) Exercises its Exclusive WorldWide Option to License CDX-6114 from Codexis,Codexis Announces Nestlé Health Science Exercises Option for Exclusive Global License to CDX-6114 for the Management of Phenylketonuria,"Codexis to receive $3M milestone and NHSc to get exclusive WW rights to develop and commercialize Codexis’s CDX-6114 for phenylketonuria (PKU)
 In 2017, Codexis & NHSc collaborated to develop CDX-6114 using Codexis’ CodeEvolver protein engineering platform paying $14M upfront and future milestones and granted an option to license for CDX-6114 to NHSc 
 Codexis’s CDX-6114 is an enzyme involved in converting amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine prevents further phenylalanine toxicity. CodeEvolver is a protein technology used for the development of therapies & proteins in multiple applications","REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Codexis, Inc. (Nasdaq: CDXS), a leading protein engineering company, announces that Nestlé Health Science has exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license for the global development and commercialization of Codexis’ novel, orally delivered enzyme CDX-6114 for the management of phenylketonuria (PKU), an orphan metabolic disorder. Nestlé Health Science was granted this option under the Development, Option and Licensing Agreement with Codexis announced in October 2017. CDX-6114 is Codexis’ first internally developed biotherapeutic product candidate.

The exercise of the option triggers a $3 million milestone payment. Upon exercising its option, Nestlé Health Science has now assumed all responsibility for future clinical development and commercialization of CDX-6114.
“We are proud to have discovered an enzyme that shows promise as a novel treatment for patients with PKU and are delighted that Nestlé Health Science has elected to take on its continued development,” said Codexis President and CEO John Nicols. “The exercise of this option further validates our strategy to partner biotherapeutics discovered using our CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform, and to do so early in the process of clinical development.”
“We are excited about taking the next step in developing this enzyme that could lead to the first orally available and convenient therapeutic option for those afflicted with PKU,” said Greg Behar, CEO, Nestlé Health Science. “PKU is the result of a missing enzyme, and left untreated it can lead to intellectual disability, seizures and cognitive and behavioral disabilities. Current treatment options are limited, with most patients managing PKU through restrictive diets. CDX-6114 is a therapeutic enzyme candidate that compensates for the missing natural enzyme with the advantage of being orally dosed and stable in the gastrointestinal tract which presents an attractive option for the management of the disease.”
About Phenylketonuria (PKU)
PKU is an inborn metabolic disorder resulting from a mutation in the gene for the enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine, which is present in almost all dietary protein, into tyrosine. As a result of this deficiency, phenylalanine builds up to levels that are toxic in the brain, causing serious neurological symptoms including intellectual disability, seizures and cognitive and behavioral disabilities. To avoid phenylalanine toxicity and the most severe disease symptoms, individuals with PKU must follow a strict, lifelong diet that is low in phenylalanine and must supplement their diet with a synthetic phenylalanine-free formula to provide sufficient nutrients. Maintaining a strict, lifelong diet is a challenge for individuals with PKU. There are an estimated 50,000 people with PKU in the developed world.

9250,Bristol-Myers (BMS) Reports Results of Opdivo (nivolumab) + Yervoy (ipilimumab) in P-II CheckMate -650 trial for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC),Opdivo (nivolumab) Plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) Shows Response in Pre-Treated Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,"The P-II CheckMate -650 trial involves assessing of Opdivo (nivolumab, 1mg/kg) + Yervoy (ipilimumab, 3mg/kg) in patients with mCRPC
 P-II study result in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients & patients who progressed after taxane-based CT ORR @ 11.9/13.5 mos. (25%, 10%); GRADE 3AEs or 5AEs (42%, 53%), Presented at ASCO 2019
 Opdivo (nivolumab) is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor targeted for cancer cells and is approved in 65 countries including the US, EU, Japan & China","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) today announced data evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Results from an interim analysis of the Phase 2 CheckMate -650 trial showed that among 32 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients whose disease had progressed after second-generation hormone therapy and who had not received chemotherapy (cohort 1), with a median follow-up of 11.9 months, the objective response rate (ORR) was 25%. Additionally, among 30 patients whose disease progressed after taxane-based chemotherapy (cohort 2), with a median follow-up of 13.5 months, the ORR was 10%.
Across both cohorts, higher response rates were seen in certain patient sub-groups, including patients with high (above median) tumor mutational burden and patients with homologous recombination deficiency.
The overall safety profile was consistent with prior studies of Opdivo in combination with Yervoy with this dosing schedule. Grade three to five treatment-related adverse events occurred in 42% of patients in cohort 1 and 53% of patients in cohort 2.
“The results from CheckMate -650 provide strong rationale for the development of combination immune checkpoint therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer, which is considered a cold tumor with few tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes,” said Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “The clinical results from this study are encouraging and provide the foundation to test the combination strategy in a larger cohort of patients.”
The data were featured today in an oral session (Abstract #142) at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco.
“Assessing the effect of biomarkers on treatment outcomes is an important part of our ongoing multidisciplinary approach to research in translational medicine,” said Arvin Yang, M.D., Ph.D., development lead, melanoma and genitourinary cancers, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “These interim results are exciting and reinforce our commitment to identifying the patient populations most likely to derive benefit from Immuno-Oncology-based regimens across tumor types and in hard-to-treat patient populations.”
About CheckMate -650
CheckMate -650 is an ongoing Phase 2 open-label trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of Opdivo in combination with Yervoy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The trial includes two cohorts: asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients who progressed after second-generation hormone therapy and have not received chemotherapy for mCRPC; and patients who progressed after taxane-based chemotherapy. Patients received Opdivo 1 mg/kg plus Yervoy 3 mg/kg for four doses, followed by Opdivo 480 mg every four weeks. Co-primary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Safety is a secondary endpoint. Exploratory endpoints include correlation of biomarkers with efficacy and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response.
About Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in men, with almost 1.28 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2018. Unlike many early-stage prostate cancers that need normal levels of testosterone to grow, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) continues to grow even when the amount of testosterone in the body is reduced to castrate levels. CRPC patients have a very high likelihood of having or developing metastases, meaning the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. While the five-year survival rate for most stages of prostate cancer is almost 100%, the five-year survival rate for prostate cancer that has spread to distant lymph nodes, bones or other organs is approximately 29%.
Bristol-Myers Squibb: Advancing Oncology Research
At Bristol-Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The focus of our research is to increase quality, long-term survival for patients and make cure a possibility. Through a unique multidisciplinary approach powered by translational science, we harness our deep scientific experience in oncology and Immuno-Oncology (I-O) research to identify novel treatments tailored to individual patient needs. Our researchers are developing a diverse, purposefully built pipeline designed to target different immune system pathways and address the complex and specific interactions between the tumor, its microenvironment and the immune system. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines, like I-O, a reality for patients.
About Opdivo
Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers.
Opdivo’s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 25,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
In July 2014, Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world. Opdivo is currently approved in more than 65 countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan and China. In October 2015, the Company’s Opdivo and Yervoy combination regimen was the first Immuno-Oncology combination to receive regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is currently approved in more than 50 countries, including the United States and the European Union.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS
YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.
Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy, and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests, at baseline and before each dose.
Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis.

Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. Encephalitis occurred in one patient receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg (0.2%) after 1.7 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one RCC patient receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg (0.2%) after approximately 4 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patient (0.8%) receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg after 15 days of exposure.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
Infusion Reactions
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate study in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO
Complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who received allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Outcomes were evaluated in 17 patients from Checkmate 205 and 039, who underwent allogeneic HSCT after discontinuing OPDIVO (15 with reduced-intensity conditioning, 2 with myeloablative conditioning). Thirty-five percent (6/17) of patients died from complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe or refractory GVHD. Grade 3 or higher acute GVHD was reported in 29% (5/17) of patients. Hyperacute GVHD was reported in 20% (n=2) of patients. A steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, without an identified infectious cause, was reported in 35% (n=6) of patients. Two cases of encephalitis were reported: Grade 3 (n=1) lymphocytic encephalitis without an identified infectious cause, and Grade 3 (n=1) suspected viral encephalitis. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in one patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure. Other cases of hepatic VOD after reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD have also been reported. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
Lactation
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.

About Cenobamate
Cenobamate (YKP3089) was discovered by SK Biopharmaceuticals and SK life science and is being investigated for the potential treatment of partial-onset seizures (also known as “focal seizures”) in adult patients. Cenobamate’s mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed to work through two separate mechanisms: enhancing inhibitory currents through positive modulation of GABA-A receptors and decreasing excitatory currents by inhibiting the persistent sodium current.
Global trials for adults with partial-onset seizures are ongoing to evaluate cenobamate safety. An additional clinical trial is investigating cenobamate safety and efficacy for another form of epilepsy in adult patients.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the filing of the New Drug Application for cenobamate for the potential treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults in February 2019.
Cenobamate is not approved by the FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) or any other regulatory authorities. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

9472,Merck Reports Results of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) + Inlyta (axitinib) in P-III KEYNOTE-426 Study in Patients with 1L Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC),KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in Combination with Inlyta (axitinib) Reduced Risk of Death by Nearly Half Compared to Sunitinib as First-Line Treatment for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC),"The P-III KEYNOTE-426 Study involves assessing of Keytruda (pembrolizumab, 200mg, IV, q3w) + Inlyta (axitinib, 5mg, PO, bid) vs sunitinib (50 mg, PO, qd@4w) monothx in 861 patients with 1L Advanced RCC
 P-III KEYNOTE-426 results: Reduction in risk of death 47%, 31% reduction in the risk of progression of disease, ORR (59.3% vs 35.7%), CR (5.8% vs 1.9%), PR (53.5% vs 33.8%), survival rate @12/18 mos. (89.9%, 82.3% vs 78.3%, 72.1%), mPFS (15.1 vs 11.1 mos.), TRAEs (62.9% vs 58.1%), Presented at ASCO GU 2019
 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) 100mg IV is a mAb, used as an anti-D-L1 therapy that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands i.e PD-L1 & PD- L2, further activating T lymphocytes. The US FDA has granted PR to its sBLA for 1L advance RCC with its PDUFA date 20 Jun,2019","Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced presentation of the full results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 trial investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with Inlyta (axitinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at the 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU) (Abstract #543). These data were also simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This is the first combination regimen to significantly improve overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to sunitinib. Results were consistent across all IMDC subgroups, including favorable, intermediate and poor risk groups, and regardless of PD-L1 expression.
As previously announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC based on the results of KEYNOTE-426, and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of June 20, 2019.
“Historically, patients with advanced RCC have faced five-year survival rates of less than 10 percent. Given the aggressive nature of this disease and the poor long-term prognosis, these new survival data with KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib from KEYNOTE-426 offer the potential of a new treatment option for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma,” said Dr. Thomas Powles, lead investigator for KEYNOTE-426, professor of genitourinary oncology, lead for Solid Tumor Research at Barts Cancer Institute, director of Barts Cancer Centre.
Findings from the first interim analysis showed KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib reduced the risk of death by 47 percent – significantly improving OS compared to sunitinib (HR=0.53 [95% CI, 0.38-0.74]; p<0.0001). For the dual primary endpoint of PFS, the KEYTRUDA combination showed a reduction in the risk of progression of disease or death of 31 percent compared to sunitinib (HR=0.69 [95% CI, 0.57-0.84]; p=0.0001). In the study, the ORR was 59.3 percent for patients who received KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib (95% CI, 54.5-63.9) and 35.7 percent for those who received sunitinib (95% CI, 31.1-40.4) (p<0.0001), with a complete response rate of 5.8 percent (n=25) and 1.9 percent (n=8) and a partial response rate of 53.5 percent (n=231) and 33.8 percent (n=145), for patients receiving the KEYTRUDA combination or sunitinib, respectively. Median duration of response was not reached in the KEYTRUDA combination arm (range, 1.4+ to 18.2+ months) and was 15.2 months (range, 1.1+ to 15.4+) in the sunitinib arm. The results for OS, PFS and ORR were consistent across all IMDC risk groups and seen regardless of PD-L1 expression. The observed adverse event profile was as expected based on the known profiles of KEYTRUDA and axitinib. There was a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevation with KEYTRUDA plus axitinib than previously observed with each agent as monotherapy.
“With a reduction in the risk of death by nearly half, these findings are particularly impressive considering the benefit was not limited to one subgroup of patients – we observed an overall survival improvement across all IMDC risk groups and regardless of PD-L1 expression,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are pleased that these findings have been accepted for priority review by the FDA, and hopeful that they will be viewed positively by regulatory authorities worldwide. In the meantime, we are grateful to the investigators and patients for their involvement in this important study.”
“These data build on the single-agent activity of pembrolizumab and axitinib, and represent the first time a kidney cancer regimen has improved overall survival, progression-free survival and objective response rate versus sunitinib. More importantly, they offer patients with this aggressive form of kidney cancer a potential new first-line treatment option,” said Dr. Brian Rini, lead author for the New England Journal of Medicine publication of KEYNOTE-426,medical oncologist at Cleveland Clinic Cancer Center and professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. As reported by the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Rini reports consulting and research funding from Merck.
Merck has filed these data with regulatory authorities worldwide. Merck has an extensive clinical development program in RCC and is advancing multiple potential registration-enabling studies with KEYTRUDA, as monotherapy and in combination with other treatments, including KEYNOTE-564 and KEYNOTE-581.
Study Design and Additional Data from KEYNOTE-426
KEYNOTE-426 is a randomized, double-arm, Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02853331) evaluating the safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib as first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic RCC compared to sunitinib monotherapy. The dual primary endpoints of the study were OS and PFS; key secondary endpoints include ORR, safety, duration of response, PFS at 12, 18 and 24 months and OS at 12, 18 and 24 months. The primary outcome measures were further evaluated based on PD-L1 tumor expression (combined positive score [CPS] <1 [n=325] and ≥1 [n=497]). In the trial, 861 patients determined to be favorable-, intermediate- or poor-risk by IMDC criteria (n=269, n=484, n=108, respectively) were randomly assigned to receive KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks plus axitinib 5 mg orally twice daily for up to 24 months (n=432), or sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for four weeks followed by no treatment for two weeks (n=429).
At the first interim analysis, after a median follow-up of 12.8 months, overall survival was significantly longer in the KEYTRUDA combination arm than in the sunitinib arm (HR=0.53 [95% CI, 0.38-0.74]; p<0.0001). Estimated 12-month survival rates were 89.9 percent (95% CI, 86.4-92.4) in the KEYTRUDA combination arm compared to 78.3 percent (95% CI, 73.8-82.1) in the sunitinib arm; the 18-month survival estimates were 82.3 percent (95% CI, 77.2-86.3) and 72.1 percent (95% CI, 66.3-77.0), respectively. Median survival was not reached in either group. Progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the KEYTRUDA combination arm than in the sunitinib arm (HR=0.69 [95% CI, 0.57-0.84]; p=0.0001). The 12-month PFS rate was 59.6 percent in the KEYTRUDA combination arm and 46.2 percent in the sunitinib arm; the 18-month PFS rate was 41.1 percent in the KEYTRUDA combination arm and 32.9 percent in the sunitinib arm. Median PFS was 15.1 months (95% CI, 12.6-17.7) in the KEYTRUDA combination arm compared to 11.1 months (95% CI, 8.7-12.5) in the sunitinib arm.
Analysis of the OS endpoint based on patient subgroups showed consistent results across each of the IMDC risk categories (favorable, intermediate and poor) (HR=0.64 [95% CI, 0.24-1.68]; HR=0.53 [95% CI, 0.35-0.82]; and HR=0.43 [95% CI, 0.23-0.81], respectively), and regardless of PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 combined positive score [CPS <1 [HR=0.59 (95% CI, 0.34-1.03)] and PD-L1 CPS ≥1 [HR=0.54 (95% CI, 0.35-0.84]). Results were also consistent for PFS across these same IMDC risk categories (HR=0.81 [95% CI, 0.53-1.24]; HR=0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; and HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.35-0.94], respectively), as well as for tumors with PD-L1 CPS <1 (HR=0.87 [95% CI, 0.62-1.23]) and PD-L1 CPS ≥1 (HR=0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.80]). Subgroup analyses were not controlled for multiplicity.
Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 62.9 percent of the 429 treated patients in the KEYTRUDA combination arm and 58.1 percent of the 425 treated patients in the sunitinib arm. TRAEs resulting in discontinuation of any treatment occurred in 25.9 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA combination arm and 10.1 percent of patients in the sunitinib arm; 8.2 percent of patients discontinued both KEYTRUDA and axitinib. The most common grade 3-5 TRAEs (occurring in ≥10% of patients) were hypertension (22.1%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (13.3%) in the KEYTRUDA combination arm and hypertension (19.3%) in the sunitinib arm.
Immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions of any grade occurred in 51.3 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA combination arm and 36.2 percent of patients in the sunitinib arm. The most common immune-mediated adverse events (occurring in ≥10% of patients) were hypothyroidism (35.4%) and hyperthyroidism (12.8%) in the KEYTRUDA combination arm and hypothyroidism (31.5%) in the sunitinib arm. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four patients in the KEYTRUDA combination arm (myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonitis [n=1 each]), and seven patients in the sunitinib arm (acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, fulminant hepatitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, malignant neoplasm progression, pneumonia [n=1 each]).
About Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about 9 out of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men as in women. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, obesity, workplace exposure to certain substances and high blood pressure. There were approximately 403,000 cases of kidney cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2018 and about 175,000 deaths from the disease. In the U.S. alone, there will be an estimated 74,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed in 2019 and about 15,000 people will die from the disease.
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 900 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%), and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Following the change of control, Bayer will be solely responsible for the global development and commercialization of both larotrectinib and BAY 2731954. Bayer is already leading ex-US regulatory activities, and worldwide commercial activities. When the new exclusive licensing arrangement takes effect, the co-promotion in the U.S. will be converted into an exclusive commercialization by Bayer and the sharing of commercial costs and profits on a 50/50 basis for the U.S. market will be replaced by royalties to be paid by Bayer. Bayer will continue to pay royalties on future net sales outside the U.S
In addition, in connection with Bayer’s exercise of the option, certain licenses granted by Loxo to Bayer will become exclusive following anti-trust clearance in the US.
About Larotrectinib and BAY 2731954 (LOXO-195)
Larotrectinib was approved in November 2018 in the US under the brand name VITRAKVI® for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors with a neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation that are either metastatic or where surgical resection will likely result in severe morbidity, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments or have progressed following treatment. Larotrectinib is the first treatment to receive a tumor-agnostic indication at the time of initial FDA approval. In clinical trials of patients with TRK fusion cancer, larotrectinib demonstrated an ORR of 75 percent (N=55) (95% CI: 61, 85%), including a 22 percent complete response (CR) rate.
BAY 2731954 (LOXO-195) is an, oral and selective investigational new drug in clinical development rationally designed for the treatment of patients with cancers that have acquired resistance to initial TRK therapy. In July 2017, a multi-center Phase I/II trial in patients with TRK fusion cancers who have progressed while receiving another TRK inhibitor or are intolerant to another TRK inhibitor was initiated.
NTRK gene fusions are genomic alterations that result in constitutively-activated chimeric TRK fusion proteins, which act as an oncogenic driver, promoting cell proliferation and survival in tumor cell lines. Larotrectinib is a CNS active TRK inhibitor designed to inhibit these proteins. TRK fusions can be found in many types of solid tumors and affect both children and adults. In the clinical trials that were the basis for this approval, larotrectinib showed clinical benefit across numerous unique tumor types, including lung, thyroid, melanoma, GIST, colon, soft tissue sarcoma, salivary gland and infantile fibrosarcoma.

 PRODIGY OIRD risk prediction tool is used to identify patients at the risk of OIRD and guide early intervention using continuous capnography-based monitoring to improve patient safety","Groundbreaking Microstream(TM) Capnography Study Provides Easy-to-Use Risk Prediction Tool
Study Found Greater Than 40 Percent of Patients on Hospital General Care Floor Experience Opiod-Induces Respiratory Depression
DUBLIN and SAN DIEGO – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced preliminary results from PRODIGY, a Medtronic-sponsored, prospective, multi-center study to identify people at high risk for opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), a form of respiratory compromise.
Study results demonstrated that investigators were able to develop an easy-to-use risk prediction tool to identify patients at high risk of developing respiratory compromise, a potentially life-threatening condition causing a progressive inability to breathe adequately. In addition, results showed that more than 40 percent of patients on the general care floor experienced OIRD, which is significantly higher than previously reported in clinical literature.
One goal of the study was to develop and internally validate an accurate risk assessment scoring tool – the PRODIGY score. The PRODIGY score identifies adults on the hospital general care floor receiving opioid medication who are at increased risk for OIRD. Variables used to develop the risk assessment score included age, gender, sleep disorders, chronic heart failure and opioid naïvety. The PRODIGY score performed well, identifying 76 percent of patients with confirmed respiratory depression (AUC=0.7620). Publication of full results is expected in 2019. The study, presented at the Society of Critical Care Medicine’s (SCCM) 48th Critical Care Congress in San Diego, California, was selected for the Star Research Achievement Award recognizing excellence in research.
“Clinical evidence shows that acute and unexpected respiratory compromise on the general care floor is increasingly common. Until now, we have not been successful in predicting which patients are at high risk when recovering on the general care floor,” said Ashish K. Khanna, M.D., primary study investigator and an associate professor of anesthesiology and intensivist at the Wake Forest School of Medicine. “These data validate an easy-to-use OIRD risk prediction tool to identify patients at the highest risk and guide early intervention using continuous capnography-based monitoring. Early identification and intervention in these high-risk patients has the potential to improve patient safety and decrease the economic and clinical burden of unplanned ICU admissions.”
The PRODIGY (PRediction of Opioid-induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY) study included 1,496 patients across 16 sites in the U.S., Europe and Asia. This is the largest known study using continuous capnography and oximetry. The initial study publication, “Seeking Answers from the PRODIGY Trial,” in the Journal of Critical Care, reviewed respiratory compromise on the general care floor and the study methodology.1 Continuous capnography and pulse oximetry data were collected using Medtronic Microstream(TM) and Nellcor(TM) monitoring technology. Data presented by Dr. Khanna at SCCM showed OIRD occurred in 46 percent of patients. Additionally, all patients experiencing these events were reviewed and confirmed by an independent clinical event committee of physicians with expertise in perioperative respiratory medicine.
“The PRODIGY study reflects our commitment to improving solutions for respiratory compromise – a common, costly and deadly but preventable condition,” said Vafa Jamali, senior vice president and president of the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Informatics business, which is part of the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group at Medtronic. “We are encouraged by the data demonstrating the use of the PRODIGY OIRD risk prediction tool. It can help clinicians prioritize resources by identifying those patients at highest risk on the general care floor who should be continuously monitored with capnography and pulse oximetry.”

About Respiratory Compromise
Respiratory compromise is a potentially life-threatening, progressive condition negatively impacting a person’s ability to breathe adequately to maintain oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. Patients with OIRD may experience shallow, slow or no breathing after opioid administration which undetected can lead to cardiopulmonary arrest and death.2 This condition is rapidly becoming the third-most costly hospital inpatient expense in the U.S., and dramatically increases the likelihood of adverse patient outcomes and cost of patient care.3 Not only is respiratory compromise common and dangerous, it has been very difficult to predict.4-6

10018,ï»¿Pfizer Reports Results of Bavencio (avelumab) + Inlyta (axitinib) in P-III JAVELIN Renal 101 trial for 1L Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC),Pivotal Phase Iii Data For Bavencio (Avelumab) Plus Inlyta (Axitinib) In Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Published In The New England Journal Of Medicine,"The P-III JAVELIN Renal 101 trial involves assessing of Bavencio (avelumab) + Inlyta (axitinib) vs Sutent (sunitinib) in 886 patients with previously untreated advanced RCC
 P-III JAVELIN Renal 101 trial results: mPFS (13.8 mos. vs 7.2 mos.); ORR (51.4% vs 25.7%); 39% reduction in risk of disease progression; received anticancer drug therapies (20.8% vs 39.2%); AEs (71.2% vs 71.5%); discontinuations of treatment (7.6% vs 13.4%)
 Bavencio (avelumab) is an anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) Ab, that blocks the interaction between PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors. In Nov 2014 Merck KGaA & Pfizer collaborated to co-develop and co-commercialize Bavencio","JAVELIN Renal 101 shows significant improvement in progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.69 in patients regardless of PD-L1 expression
US FDA has granted Priority Review to BAVENCIO plus INLYTA for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma
Data at 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium reinforce consistency of PFS and ORR benefits across broad population of patients with advanced RCC, including all prognostic risk groups, and show increased time to progression on next-line therapy
Darmstadt, Germany and New York, NY, – Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which operates its biopharmaceutical business as EMD Serono in the US and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced the publication of results from an interim analysis of the pivotal JAVELIN Renal 101 trial online in the New England Journal of Medicine.1 The combination of BAVENCIO® (avelumab) and INLYTA® (axitinib)* significantly extended median progression-free survival (PFS) by more than five months compared with SUTENT® (sunitinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), irrespective of PD-L1 expression (HR: 0.69 [95% CI: 0.56–0.84]; BAVENCIO+INLYTA: 13.8 months [95% CI: 11.1-NE]; SUTENT: 8.4 months [95% CI: 6.9-11.1]; p<0.001). Further, the objective response rate (ORR) was doubled with BAVENCIO+INLYTA versus SUTENT in this population (51.4% [95% CI: 46.6-56.1] vs. 25.7% [95% CI: 21.7-30.0]). The study is continuing for the other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS).
“There is a significant need for patients with advanced RCC to prolong the time until the disease worsens beyond what tyrosine kinase inhibitors alone offer,” said Robert J. Motzer, M.D., Jack and Dorothy Byrne Chair in Clinical Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, US, and principal investigator for JAVELIN Renal 101. “The magnitude and consistency of PFS and response rates seen thus far across populations in the JAVELIN Renal 101 study suggest that many different types of patients, including those with a favorable prognosis, could potentially derive benefit from this particular combination.”
Additional data presented today at the 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium reinforce the consistency of the PFS and ORR results across patient subgroups, including patients with favorable, intermediate and poor prognoses as well as those with PD-L1-positive or negative tumors. In subgroup analyses, approximately two-thirds of patients with favorable risk (66% of patients using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center risk model and 68% with the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk model) achieved a complete or partial response with BAVENCIO+INLYTA. Median PFS for these patients is not yet estimable. BAVENCIO+INLYTA also extended median PFS2, defined as the time from randomization to disease progression on next-line therapy (HR: 0.56 [95% CI: 0.42-0.74]; NE [95% CI: 19.9-NE] vs. 18.4 months [95% CI: 15.7-23.6]) and increased median duration of response by more than four months (95% CI: 2.9-5.1) in the overall population.
“In this study, the combination of avelumab plus axitinib not only prolonged the initial response in treated patients compared to sunitinib, but for patients who went on to subsequent therapy, reduced the risk of disease progression or death on the next treatment,” said Toni K. Choueiri, M.D., Director of the Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology at Dana-Farber, Boston, US, senior and co-corresponding author of JAVELIN Renal 101, and presenter. “Together with the progression-free survival results and objective response rates, these findings show the potential of this combination regimen to be an important new treatment option for patients with advanced RCC.”
The Phase III JAVELIN Renal 101 study is evaluating the combination of BAVENCIO+INLYTA compared with SUTENT in 886 patients with previously untreated advanced RCC. BAVENCIO+INLYTA significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 39% in patients with PD-L1-positive (≥1%) tumors, a primary endpoint (HR: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.47–0.79], p<0.001; median PFS: 13.8 months [95% CI: 11.1-NE] vs. 7.2 months [95% CI: 5.7-9.7]). In the overall population, which was tested after achieving statistical significance for the primary endpoint, the risk was reduced by 31%. The confirmed ORR in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors was 55.2% (95% CI: 49.0-61.2) with BAVENCIO+INLYTA vs. 25.5% (95% CI: 20.6-30.9) with SUTENT.
In the BAVENCIO+INLYTA arm, 20.8% of patients received subsequent anticancer drug therapies, compared with 39.2% in the SUTENT arm. In the SUTENT arm, about two-thirds (66.7%) of patients who received subsequent anticancer therapy were known to have been treated with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 agent.
Adverse events of grade 3 or higher during treatment (treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAEs]) occurred in 71.2% of patients in the BAVENCIO+INLYTA arm and 71.5% in the SUTENT arm); grade 3 or higher TEAEs that occurred in more than 5% of patients receiving the combination were hypertension (25.6%), diarrhea (6.7%), increased alanine aminotransferase level (6.0%) and hand–foot syndrome (5.8%). In the combination arm, 9.0% of patients experienced grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events. Grade 5 events occurred in three patients in the BAVENCIO+INLYTA arm (myocarditis, necrotizing pancreatitis, sudden death; n=1 each); and in one patient in the SUTENT arm (intestinal perforation). There were fewer discontinuations due to adverse events that occurred during treatment with BAVENCIO+INLYTA, compared with SUTENT (7.6% vs. 13.4%).
On February 11, 2019, the alliance announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA for patients with advanced RCC. The application has been given a target action date in June 2019. A supplemental application for BAVENCIO+INLYTA in unresectable or metastatic RCC was submitted in Japan on January 30, 2019. In December 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for BAVENCIO in combination with INLYTA for treatment-naïve patients with advanced RCC. Despite available therapies, the outlook for patients with advanced RCC remains poor.2
*The combination of BAVENCIO and INLYTA is under clinical investigation for advanced RCC, and there is no guarantee this combination will be approved for advanced RCC by any health authority worldwide. In the US, INLYTA is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced RCC after failure of one prior systemic therapy. INLYTA is also approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the EU in adult patients with advanced RCC after failure of prior treatment with SUTENT or a cytokine.
 
About Renal Cell Carcinoma
RCC is the most common form of kidney cancer, accounting for about 2% to 3% of all cancers in adults.3,4 The most common type of RCC is clear cell carcinoma, accounting for approximately 70% of all cases.3 In 2019, an estimated 73,820 new cases of kidney cancer will be diagnosed in the US, and approximately 14,770 people will die from the disease.5 Approximately 20% to 30% of patients are first diagnosed at the metastatic stage.6 The five-year survival rate for patients with metastatic RCC is approximately 12%.2 
 
About the JAVELIN Clinical Development Program
The clinical development program for avelumab, known as JAVELIN, involves at least 30 clinical programs and more than 9,000 patients evaluated across more than 15 different tumor types. In addition to RCC, these tumor types include breast, gastric/gastro-esophageal junction, and head and neck cancers, Merkel cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and urothelial carcinoma.
 
About BAVENCIO® (avelumab)
BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.7-9BAVENCIO has also been shown to induce NK cell-mediated direct tumor cell lysis via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro.9-11 In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.
 
Approved Indications in the US
In the US, the FDA granted accelerated approval for BAVENCIO for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
BAVENCIO is currently approved for patients with MCC in more than 45 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.
 
Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis, and evaluate suspected cases with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis occurred in 1.2% (21/1738) of patients, including one (0.1%) patient with Grade 5, one (0.1%) with Grade 4, and five (0.3%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) immune-mediated hepatitis until resolution and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis was reported in 0.9% (16/1738) of patients, including two (0.1%) patients with Grade 5, and 11 (0.6%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold BAVENCIO until resolution for moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) colitis, and permanently discontinue for life-threatening (Grade 4) or recurrent (Grade 3) colitis upon reinitiation of BAVENCIO. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.5% (26/1738) of patients, including seven (0.4%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Manage hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy and hyperthyroidism with medical management. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) thyroid disorders. Thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, were reported in 6% (98/1738) of patients, including three (0.2%) with Grade 3.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus including diabetic ketoacidosis: Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Withhold BAVENCIO and administer antihyperglycemics or insulin in patients with severe or life-threatening (Grade ≥ 3) hyperglycemia, and resume treatment when metabolic control is achieved. Type 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative etiology occurred in 0.1% (2/1738) of patients, including two cases of Grade 3 hyperglycemia.
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) nephritis until resolution to Grade 1 or lower. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.1% (1/1738) of patients.
BAVENCIO can result in other severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions involving any organ system during treatment or after treatment discontinuation. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate to confirm or rule out an immune-mediated adverse reaction and to exclude other causes. Depending on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and initiate hormone replacement therapy, if appropriate. Resume BAVENCIO when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or lower following a corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for any severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 1738 patients treated with BAVENCIO: myocarditis with fatal cases, myositis, psoriasis, arthritis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, hypopituitarism, uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and systemic inflammatory response.
BAVENCIO can cause severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Patients should be premedicated with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to the first 4 infusions and for subsequent doses based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25% (439/1738) of patients, including three (0.2%) patients with Grade 4 and nine (0.5%) with Grade 3.

About INLYTA® (axitinib)
INLYTA is an oral therapy that is designed to inhibit tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2 and 3; these receptors can influence tumor growth, vascular angiogenesis and progression of cancer (the spread of tumors). In the US, INLYTA is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of one prior systemic therapy. INLYTA is also approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the EU in adult patients with advanced RCC after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine.
 
INLYTA Important Safety Information
Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor for hypertension and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension, despite use of antihypertensive medications, reduce the dose. Discontinue INLYTA if hypertension is severe and persistent despite use of antihypertensive therapy and dose reduction of INLYTA, and discontinuation should be considered if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis.
Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk or who have a history of these events.
Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. If any bleeding requires medical intervention, temporarily interrupt the INLYTA dose.
Cardiac failure has been observed and can be fatal. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require permanent discontinuation of INLYTA.
Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment.
Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment.
No formal studies of the effect of INLYTA on wound healing have been conducted. Stop INLYTA at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery.
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been observed. If signs or symptoms occur, permanently discontinue treatment.
Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. For moderate to severe proteinuria, reduce the dose or temporarily interrupt treatment.
Liver enzyme elevation has been observed during treatment with INLYTA. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment.
For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose should be decreased. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving INLYTA.
Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors. If unavoidable, reduce the dose. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase INLYTA plasma concentrations and should be avoided.

About SUTENT® (sunitinib malate)
Sunitinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, some of which are implicated in tumor growth, pathologic angiogenesis, and metastatic progression of cancer. Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET).
SUTENT is indicated in the US for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate; the treatment of advanced RCC; the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent RCC following nephrectomy; and the treatment of progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.
 
SUTENT Important Safety Information
Boxed Warning/Hepatotoxicity has been observed in clinical trials and postmarketing experience. Hepatotoxicity may be severe, and in some cases fatal. Monitor hepatic function and interrupt, reduce, or discontinue dosing as recommended. Fatal liver failure has been observed. Monitor liver function tests before initiation of treatment, during each cycle of treatment, and as clinically indicated. Interrupt SUTENT for Grade 3 or 4 drug-related hepatic adverse reactions and discontinue if there is no resolution. Do not restart SUTENT if patients subsequently experience severe changes in liver function tests or have signs and symptoms of liver failure.
Cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction declines to below the lower limit of normal and cardiac failure including death have occurred. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Discontinue SUTENT for clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure. In patients without cardiac risk factors, a baseline evaluation of ejection fraction should be considered. Baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction should also be considered while these patients are receiving SUTENT.
SUTENT can cause QT Prolongation in a dose-dependent manner, which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including Torsades de Pointes, which has been seen in <0.1% of patients. Monitor patients that are at a higher risk for developing QT interval prolongation, including those with a history of QT interval prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. Consider monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations and dose reduction of SUTENT should be considered.
Hypertension may occur. Monitor blood pressure and treat as needed with standard antihypertensive therapy. In cases of severe hypertension, temporary suspension of SUTENT is recommended until hypertension is controlled.
Hemorrhagic events, including tumor-related hemorrhage, and viscus perforation (both with fatal events) have occurred. These events may occur suddenly, and in the case of pulmonary tumors, may present as severe and life-threatening hemoptysis or pulmonary hemorrhage. Perform serial complete blood counts (CBCs) and physical examinations.
Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (some fatal) have been reported. Patients generally at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Monitor these patients closely and treat as clinically indicated.
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, sometimes leading to renal failure or a fatal outcome, has been reported in patients who received SUTENT as monotherapy and in combination with bevacizumab. Discontinue SUTENT in patients developing TMA. Reversal of the effects of TMA has been observed after treatment was discontinued.
Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome have been reported. Some of these cases have resulted in renal failure and fatal outcomes. Monitor patients for the development or worsening of proteinuria. Perform baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment, with follow-up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Interrupt treatment for 24-hour urine protein ≥3 grams. Discontinue for repeat episodes of protein ≥3 grams despite dose reductions or nephrotic syndrome.
Dermatologic toxicities: Severe cutaneous reactions have been reported, including cases of necrotizing fasciitis, erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some of which were fatal. If signs or symptoms of EM, SJS, or TEN are present, discontinue SUTENT treatment. If a diagnosis of SJS or TEN is suspected, treatment must not be restarted.
Necrotizing fasciitis, including fatal cases, has been reported, including of the perineum and secondary to fistula formation. Discontinue SUTENT in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis.
Thyroid dysfunction may occur. Monitor thyroid function in patients with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, and treat per standard medical practice.
Hypoglycemia may occur. SUTENT can result in symptomatic hypoglycemia, which may lead to a loss of consciousness or require hospitalization. Reductions in blood glucose levels may be worse in patients with diabetes. Check blood glucose levels regularly during and after discontinuation of treatment with SUTENT. Assess if antidiabetic drug dosage needs to be adjusted to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. Consider preventive dentistry prior to treatment with SUTENT. If possible, avoid invasive dental procedures, particularly in patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonate therapy.
Impaired wound healing has occurred with SUTENT. Temporary interruption of therapy with SUTENT is recommended in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. There is limited clinical experience regarding the timing of reinitiation of therapy following major surgical intervention. Therefore, the decision to resume SUTENT therapy following a major surgical intervention should be based upon clinical judgment of recovery from surgery.
Embryo fetal toxicity and reproductive potential
Females – SUTENT can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with SUTENT and for 4 weeks following the final dose.
Males – Based on findings in animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with SUTENT and for 7 weeks after the last dose.
Male and female infertility – based on findings in animals, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with SUTENT
Lactation: Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from SUTENT, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with SUTENT and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose.
Venous thromboembolic events: In patients treated with SUTENT (N=7527) for GIST, advanced RCC, adjuvant treatment of RCC and pNET, 3.5% of patients experienced a venous thromboembolic event; 2.2% Grade 3-4.
There have been (<1%) reports, some fatal, of subjects presenting with seizures and radiological evidence of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). Patients with seizures and signs/symptoms consistent with RPLS, such as hypertension, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning, and visual loss, including cortical blindness, should be controlled with medical management including control of hypertension. Temporary suspension of SUTENT is recommended; following resolution, treatment may be resumed at the discretion of the treating healthcare provider.
Pancreatic function: In a trial of patients receiving adjuvant treatment for RCC, 1 patient (<1%) on SUTENT and none on placebo experienced pancreatitis.
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers: Dose adjustments are recommended when SUTENT is administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. During treatment with SUTENT, patients should not drink grapefruit juice, eat grapefruit, or take St. John’s Wort.

10126,Japan Ministry of Health Approves Use of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) for Spinal Injuries,Japan approves test of iPS cells for treating spinal injuries,"The Japan Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approves the evaluation of iPS cells in a clinical research for spinal cord injuries at Keio University in Tokyo, with expected onset in H1’2019
 The study is will be conducted enrolling 4 adults with spinal cord injuries whose sensation and bodily mobility have been completely lost, transplating 2M cells of iPS with the usage of immunosuppressant drugs to control transplant rejection
 iPSCs are adult cells genetically reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell for expressing genes & properties of embryonic stem cell. In 2014 & 2018, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology & Kyoto University initiated trials using iPSCs for treat eye disorder & Parkinson’s disease respectively","TOKYO (Reuters) – Japanese scientists will test the use of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) to treat spinal cord injuries, a health ministry panel that approved the research project said on Monday.
The research team from Tokyo’s Keio University planned to inject about two million iPS cells into the damaged areas of an individual patient and review the results over the course of a year, according to the plan approved by the health ministry.
So-called iPS cells are made by removing mature cells from an individual – often from the skin – and reprogramming them to behave like embryonic stem cells.
Last year, clinical trials began in Japan on using reprogrammed stem cells in a treatment for Parkinson’s disease.
The health ministry panel has already given a greenlight to use iPS cells for treating patients with rare eye disease or blood disease.
The Keio University team headed by professors Hideyuki Okano and Masaya Nakamura will seek four patients, aged 18 or older, who have lost mobility and sensory functions due to a spinal cord injury sustained two to four weeks earlier.
The professors were not immediately available for comment.

Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is a TRK inhibitor, inhibiting TRK A/B/C and ROS1 proteins with expected FDA approval on 18 Aug,2019","Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s New Drug Applications (NDAs) and granted Priority Review for entrectinib for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours who have either progressed following prior therapies or as an initial therapy when there are no acceptable standard therapies, and for the treatment of people with metastatic, ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These NDAs are based on results from the integrated analysis of the pivotal Phase II STARTRK-2, Phase I STARTRK-1 and Phase I ALKA-372-001 trials, and data from the Phase I/Ib STARTRK-NG study. The FDA is expected to make a decision on approval by 18 August 2019.
“Entrectinib represents a unique approach to cancer treatment that can potentially target a range of hard-to-treat and rare NTRK fusion-positive tumours regardless of their site of origin, as well as treat ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “By combining comprehensive genomic profiling with actionable targeted therapies, like entrectinib, we are advancing our personalised healthcare goal to find the right treatment for each patient. We are working closely with the FDA to make this potential new option available as soon as possible.”
The FDA grants Priority Review to medicines determined to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. Entrectinib was also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA); and Sakigake designation by the Japanese health authorities for the treatment of NTRK fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours in adult and paediatric patients who have either progressed following prior therapies or have no acceptable standard therapies.[1] BTD is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and to help ensure people have access to them through FDA approval as soon as possible.
Roche is leveraging its expertise in developing personalised medicines and advanced diagnostics, in conjunction with Foundation Medicine, to develop a companion diagnostic that will help identify people with ROS1 and NTRK gene fusions.
About the integrated analysis
The integrated analysis included data from 53 people with ROS1-activating gene fusions and 54 people with locally advanced or metastatic NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours (10 tumour types, >19 histopathologies) from the Phase II STARTRK-2, Phase I STARTRK-1 and Phase I ALKA-372-001 trials.[2,3] In addition, data from the Phase I/Ib STARTRK-NG study in paediatric patients were also included in the NDAs. The studies enrolled people across 15 countries and more than 150 clinical trial sites.[2,3] Tumour types evaluated in the studies to date included breast, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, gynaecological, neuroendocrine, non-small cell lung, salivary gland, pancreatic, sarcoma and thyroid cancers.[3]

STARTRK-2 is a Phase II, global, multicentre, open-label basket study in people with solid tumours that harbour an NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK-positive gene fusion.[4] The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR) is a secondary endpoint.[4] Other secondary outcome measures include time to response, clinical benefit rate, intracranial tumour response, progression-free survival (PFS), central nervous system (CNS) PFS and overall survival (OS).[4]
STARTRK-1 is a Phase I, multicentre, open-label dose escalation study of a daily continuous dosing schedule in people with solid tumours with NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK gene fusions in the US and South Korea.[5] The trial assessed the safety and tolerability of entrectinib via a standard dose escalation scheme and determined the recommended Phase II dose.[5]
ALKA-372-001 is Phase I, multicentre, open-label dose escalation study of an intermittent and continuous entrectinib dosing schedule in people with advanced or metastatic solid tumours with TRKA/B/C, ROS1 or ALK gene fusions in Italy.[1]
STARTRK-NG is a Phase I/II dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating the safety and efficacy of entrectinib in children and adolescent patients with no curative first-line treatment option, recurrent or refractory extracranial solid tumours or primary CNS tumours, with or without TRK, ROS1 or ALK fusions.[6]
Results from the integrated analysis showed entrectinib shrank tumours (ORR) in more than half (57.4 percent) of people with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours.[3] Objective responses to entrectinib were seen across 10 different solid tumour types (median DoR = 10.4 months), including in people with and without CNS metastases at baseline.[3] In these studies, entrectinib shrank tumours that had spread to the brain in more than half of people (intracranial response [IC ORR] = 54.5 percent), with more than a quarter of these people having a complete response.[3]
Entrectinib shrank tumours in 77.4 percent of people with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC.[2] In addition, entrectinib demonstrated a durable response of more than two years (median DoR = 24.6 months).[2] Importantly, entrectinib was shown to shrink intracranial tumours in more than half of people with CNS metastases at baseline (IC ORR = 55.0 percent).[2]
The safety profile of entrectinib was consistent with that seen in previous analyses.[2,3] The most commonly reported adverse reactions included fatigue, constipation, altered sense of taste (dysgeusia), swelling (edema), dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, nervous system disorders (dysesthesia), shortness of breath (dyspnea), pain, anemia, cognitive disorders, weight increased, vomiting, cough, blood creatinine increase, joint pain (arthralgia), fever (pyrexia), and muscle pain (myalgia).[2,3]

About entrectinib
Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, oral medicine in development for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours that harbour NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions. It is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit the kinase activity of the TRK A/B/C and ROS1 proteins, whose activating fusions drive proliferation in certain types of cancer.[7,8] Entrectinib can block ROS1 and NTRK kinase activity and may result in the death of cancer cells with ROS1 or NTRK gene fusions.[7,8] Entrectinib is being investigated across a range of solid tumour types, including breast, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, gynaecological, neuroendocrine, non-small cell lung, salivary gland, pancreatic, sarcoma and thyroid cancers.[1,4-6]

About NTRK fusion-positive cancer
Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive cancer occurs when the NTRK1/2/3 genes fuse with other genes, resulting in altered TRK proteins (TRKA/TRKB/TRKC) that can activate signaling pathways involved in proliferation of certain types of cancer. NTRK gene fusions are tumour-agnostic, meaning they are present in tumours irrespective of site of origin. These fusions have been identified in a broad range of solid tumour types, including breast, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, gynaecological, neuroendocrine, non-small cell lung, salivary gland, pancreatic, sarcoma and thyroid cancers.[3] There is a high unmet medical need for treatments for people with life-threatening and hard-to-treat NTRK fusion-positive tumours.

About ROS1-positive NSCLC
ROS1 is a tyrosine kinase, which plays a role in controlling how cells grow and proliferate. When a ROS1 gene fusion occurs, cancer cells grow and proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. Blocking this abnormal signalling can cause tumour cells to shrink or die.[9]
ROS1 gene fusions account for 1-2% of NSCLC.[9] Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death across the world.[10] Each year, more than one and a half million people die as a result of the disease globally, equating to more than 4,000 deaths every day.[10] NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer and accounts for 85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.[11] While the ROS1 gene fusion can be found in any patient with NSCLC, young never-smokers with NSCLC have the highest incidence of ROS1 gene fusions.[9]

The data were presented by Brian Rini, MD, Professor of Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, and Director, Cleveland Clinic Genitourinary Cancer Program, during an oral presentation titled, “TIVO-3: A Phase 3, Randomized, Controlled, MultiCenter, Open-Label Study to Compare Tivozanib to Sorafenib in Subjects with Refractory Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)” at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium held February 14-16, 2019 in San Francisco. A copy of the presentation will be available in the Publications & Presentation section of the Company’s website. “Tivozanib continues to demonstrate a unique activity and tolerability profile among VEGF TKIs in the treatment of kidney cancer,” said Dr. Rini. “This is underscored by a significant improvement in progression free survival and overall response rate compared to sorafenib in patients with treatment-refractory advanced RCC. I look forward to understanding how this improvement impacts overall survival as the TIVO-3 study continues to mature.” “We remain committed to our goal of improving outcomes and patient experience in RCC,” saidMichael Bailey, president and chief executive officer of AVEO. “The improvement in progression
free survival in the TIVO-3 study, particularly in patients who received prior immunotherapy, is noteworthy. We are hopeful that these positive PFS outcomes translate into an improved overall survival hazard ratio when we report a more mature interim OS outcome in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect to make a new drug application filing decision following the availability of more mature OS results.”
TIVO-3 Topline Study Results The TIVO-3 trial is a Phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label study designed to compare tivozanib (FOTIVDA®) to sorafenib in 350 subjects with highly refractory advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The trial met its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival (PFS). Tivozanib demonstrated a 44% improvement in median PFS and 26% reduction in the risk of progression or death (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.74, p=0.02, see Figure 1). Median PFS was 5.6 months for tivozanib compared to 3.9 months for sorafenib. The TIVO-3 trial enrolled patients with RCC who have failed at least two prior regimens. Among
these, approximately 26% of patients received checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy in earlier lines of treatment. PFS for tivozanib was longer than sorafenib both in patients who received prior CPI therapy and those who received two prior VEGF TKI therapies. Patients who received prior CPI
therapy had a median PFS of 7.3 months with tivozanib and 5.1 months with sorafenib (HR=0.55, p=0.03, see Figure 2). One- and two-year PFS in patients who received tivozanib following CPI herapy was 35% and 25%, respectively, and 4% and n/a for patients receiving sorafenib following
CPI therapy at those respective time periods. The secondary endpoint of overall response rate for patients receiving tivozanib was 18% compared to 8% for patients receiving sorafenib (p=0.02). Median duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving tivozanib was not reached (95% CI:12.9,—) and was 5.7 months for patients receiving sorafenib (95% CI:5.6,—). DOR probability at 1 year was 71% and 46% for tivozanib
and sorafenib, respectively, and 55% and 0% at two years. The analysis of the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not mature at the time of the final PFS analysis, and currently reflects ~50% of potential OS events. As previously disclosed, the updated preliminary OS analysis conducted at an October 4, 2018 data cutoff date, which included additional patients previously lost to follow-up, showed a non-statistically significant difference in OS favoring sorafenib (HR=1.12, p=0.44). The Company intends to conduct an additional interim OS analysis in August 2019, the results of which are expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Tivozanib was generally well-tolerated, with grade 3 or higher adverse events consistent with those observed in previous tivozanib trials. Infrequent but severe adverse events reported in greater
number in the tivozanib arm were thrombotic events similar to those observed in previous tivozanib studies. The most common adverse event in patients receiving tivozanib was hypertension, an adverse event known to reflect effective VEGF pathway inhibition.
About Tivozanib (FOTIVDA)
Tivozanib (FOTIVDA®) is an oral, once-daily, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) discovered by Kyowa Hakko Kirin and approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. It is a potent, selective and long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities, potentially resulting in improved efficacy and minimal dose modifications.1,2 Tivozanib has been shown to significantly reduce regulatory T-cell production in preclinical models3 , and has demonstrated synergy in combination with nivolumab (anti PD-1) in a Phase 2 study in RCC. Tivozanib has been investigated in several tumor types, including renal cell, hepatocellular, colorectal and breast cancers. About AVEO

 P-III TIVO-3 results: 44% improvement in mPFS; 26% reduction in the risk of progression or death; mPFS (5.6 vs 3.9 mos.); ORR (18% vs 8%), presented at ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, 2019
 FOTIVDA (tivozanib, qd, PO) is a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted & approved in EU for RCC and is evaluated in P-II in combination with nivolumab (anti PD-1) for RCC","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. – – AVEO Oncology (NASDAQ:AVEO) today announced the presentation of data from the Phase 3 TIVO-3 study of tivozanib (FOTIVDA) versus sorafenib in refractory advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The data were presented by Brian Rini, MD, Professor of Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, and Director, Cleveland Clinic Genitourinary Cancer Program, during an oral presentation titled, “TIVO-3: A Phase 3, Randomized, Controlled, MultiCenter, Open-Label Study to Compare Tivozanib to Sorafenib in Subjects with Refractory Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)” at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium held February 14-16, 2019 in San Francisco. A copy of the presentation will be available in the Publications & Presentation section of the Company’s website. “Tivozanib continues to demonstrate a unique activity and tolerability profile among VEGF TKIs in the treatment of kidney cancer,” said Dr. Rini. “This is underscored by a significant improvement in progression free survival and overall response rate compared to sorafenib in patients with treatment-refractory advanced RCC. I look forward to understanding how this improvement impacts overall survival as the TIVO-3 study continues to mature.” “We remain committed to our goal of improving outcomes and patient experience in RCC,” saidMichael Bailey, president and chief executive officer of AVEO. “The improvement in progression
free survival in the TIVO-3 study, particularly in patients who received prior immunotherapy, is noteworthy. We are hopeful that these positive PFS outcomes translate into an improved overall survival hazard ratio when we report a more mature interim OS outcome in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect to make a new drug application filing decision following the availability of more mature OS results.”
TIVO-3 Topline Study Results The TIVO-3 trial is a Phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label study designed to compare tivozanib (FOTIVDA®) to sorafenib in 350 subjects with highly refractory advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The trial met its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival (PFS). Tivozanib demonstrated a 44% improvement in median PFS and 26% reduction in the risk of progression or death (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.74, p=0.02, see Figure 1). Median PFS was 5.6 months for tivozanib compared to 3.9 months for sorafenib. The TIVO-3 trial enrolled patients with RCC who have failed at least two prior regimens. Among
these, approximately 26% of patients received checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy in earlier lines of treatment. PFS for tivozanib was longer than sorafenib both in patients who received prior CPI therapy and those who received two prior VEGF TKI therapies. Patients who received prior CPI
therapy had a median PFS of 7.3 months with tivozanib and 5.1 months with sorafenib (HR=0.55, p=0.03, see Figure 2). One- and two-year PFS in patients who received tivozanib following CPI herapy was 35% and 25%, respectively, and 4% and n/a for patients receiving sorafenib following
CPI therapy at those respective time periods. The secondary endpoint of overall response rate for patients receiving tivozanib was 18% compared to 8% for patients receiving sorafenib (p=0.02). Median duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving tivozanib was not reached (95% CI:12.9,—) and was 5.7 months for patients receiving sorafenib (95% CI:5.6,—). DOR probability at 1 year was 71% and 46% for tivozanib
and sorafenib, respectively, and 55% and 0% at two years. The analysis of the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not mature at the time of the final PFS analysis, and currently reflects ~50% of potential OS events. As previously disclosed, the updated preliminary OS analysis conducted at an October 4, 2018 data cutoff date, which included additional patients previously lost to follow-up, showed a non-statistically significant difference in OS favoring sorafenib (HR=1.12, p=0.44). The Company intends to conduct an additional interim OS analysis in August 2019, the results of which are expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Tivozanib was generally well-tolerated, with grade 3 or higher adverse events consistent with those observed in previous tivozanib trials. Infrequent but severe adverse events reported in greater

 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) 100mg IV is a mAb, used as an anti-D-L1 therapy that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands i.e PD-L1 & PD- L2, further activating T lymphocytes","Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, for the adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma with involvement of lymph node(s) following complete resection based on results from the EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054 trial. This pivotal Phase 3 trial, which was conducted in collaboration with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), demonstrated that KEYTRUDA significantly prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS), reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 43 percent compared to placebo in patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma (HR=0.57 [95% CI, 0.46, 0.70]; p<0.001). KEYTRUDA is the first anti-PD-1 therapy studied in the adjuvant setting across patients with stage IIIA (>1 mm lymph node metastasis), IIIB and IIIC melanoma.
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, severe skin reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below.
“In the fight against cancer, progress is made one step at a time, and today we’re pleased to take another important step – making KEYTRUDA available as an adjuvant therapy for patients with stage III melanoma,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “At Merck, we are committed to transforming the treatment of cancer, as is exemplified by this important advance in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma.”
“The collaborative study from EORTC and Merck demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of cancer returning after surgery,” said Dr. Alexander Eggermont, study chair, Director General at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute, Professor of Oncology, University of Paris-Saclay. “This approval in the adjuvant setting marks another milestone in the treatment of melanoma patients, who often have a high risk of disease recurrence.”
“As physicians, we are always looking to find ways to prevent cancer from returning in our patients,” said Dr. Alain Algazi, associate clinical professor of medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center. “KEYTRUDA has demonstrated significant improvement in recurrence-free survival among stage III melanoma patients when compared to a placebo, and we now have a new option to help patients who have a high risk of recurrence.”
“Not too long ago, there were limited treatment options for patients with advanced melanoma,” said Marc Hurlbert, Ph.D., chief science officer, Melanoma Research Alliance. “Today’s approval of KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting provides melanoma patients with another option to prevent their cancer from returning, giving hope to those facing this disease.”
About EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054
The approval was based on data from the EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054 trial, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in patients with completely resected stage IIIA (>1 mm lymph node metastasis), IIIB or IIIC melanoma. In total, the study enrolled 1,019 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive KEYTRUDA 200 mg every three weeks (n=514) or placebo (n=505) for up to one year or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition (AJCC) stage (IIIA vs. IIIB vs. IIIC 1-3 positive lymph nodes vs. IIIC ≥4 positive lymph nodes) and geographic region (North America, European countries, Australia and other countries as designated). Patients must have undergone lymph node dissection and, if indicated, radiotherapy within 13 weeks prior to starting treatment. The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed RFS in the whole population and in the population with PD-L1 positive tumors where RFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional or distant metastasis) or death, whichever occurs first. Patients underwent imaging every 12 weeks after the first dose of KEYTRUDA for the first two years, then every six months from year three to five, and then annually.
Among the 1,019 patients, the baseline characteristics were median age of 54 years (range, 19 to 88 years; 25% age 65 or older); 62 percent male; and ECOG PS of 0 (94%) and 1 (6%). Sixteen percent had stage IIIA; 46 percent had stage IIIB; 18 percent had stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes) and 20 percent had stage IIIC (≥4 positive lymph nodes); 50 percent were BRAF V600 mutation positive, and 44 percent were BRAF wild-type; and 84 percent had PD-L1 positive melanoma determined by tumor proportion score (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] ≥1%) measured with an investigational use only (IUO) assay.
Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were ineligible. The most common adverse reaction (reported in at least 20% of study patients) was diarrhea (28%).

About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 900 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%), and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

 ALKS 4230 is an interleukin-2 (IL-2) variant immunotherapy targeted for activating tumor-killing immune cells. Rucaparib is an oral PARP inhibitor, stimulating an anti-tumor immune response on tumor cells. Lucitanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR1-3 & FGFR1-3","Combinations of ALKS 4230 with Rucaparib and Lucitanib to be Evaluated in Multiple Preclinical Tumor Models —
DUBLIN and BOULDER, Colo. , Feb. 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Alkermes plc (Nasdaq: ALKS) and Clovis Oncology,
Inc. (Nasdaq: CLVS) today announced that the companies have entered into a research collaboration to evaluate
ALKS 4230, Alkermes’ investigational engineered interleukin-2 (IL-2) variant immunotherapy, in combination with
rucaparib, Clovis’ marketed PARP inhibitor, and lucitanib, Clovis’ investigational tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The
collaboration will explore the potential anti-cancer eects of both treatment combinations in preclinical models
across multiple tumor types. Results of this research may form the basis for potential future clinical studies of the
novel combinations of ALKS 4230 with rucaparib and/or lucitanib.
“Our preclinical partnership with Clovis reects our ongoing eorts to explore the numerous combination options
aorded to ALKS 4230. The collaboration will allow us to examine combinations in two areas of keen interest, PARP
and tyrosine kinase inhibition pathways,” said Mark Namchuk , Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Research,
Pharmaceutical and Non-Clinical Development at Alkermes. “Evidence of combined benet of ALKS 4230 with
rucaparib and/or lucitanib from these preclinical studies may provide a strong rationale to advance into clinical

mechanism of action and ecacy of the combinations of ALKS 4230 with rucaparib and ALKS 4230 with lucitanib in
multiple tumor models. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will share costs related to the preclinical
studies, and each will contribute their respective compounds to the research collaboration.
About ALKS 4230
ALKS 4230 is an investigational, novel, engineered fusion protein designed to selectively activate tumor-killing
immune cells while avoiding the expansion of immunosuppressive cells by preferentially binding to the
intermediate-anity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor complex. The selectivity of ALKS 4230 is designed to leverage the
proven anti-tumor eects of existing IL-2 therapy while mitigating certain limitations.
About Rucaparib
Rucaparib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes PARP-1, PARP-2,
and PARP-3, which play a role in DNA repair. Rucaparib stimulates an anti-tumor immune response through the
activation of the stimulator of interferon ( STING ) pathway and tumor cell death, resulting in the inltration of
multiple immune subsets including CD8 positive T-cells. 1
Rucaparib is being developed in multiple tumor types, including ovarian, metastatic castration-resistant prostate,
and bladder cancers, as monotherapy, and in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Exploratory studies in
other tumor types are also underway. Clovis holds worldwide rights for rucaparib. Rucaparib is an unlicensed
medical product outside of the U.S. and Europe .
About Lucitanib
Lucitanib is an oral, potent inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1
through 3 (VEGFR1-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDFGRα/β) and broblast growth
factor receptors 1 through 3 (FGFR1-3).
Emerging clinical data support the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors and immunotherapy to increase
eectiveness in multiple cancer indications. 2 Angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
are frequently up-regulated in tumors and create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. 3 Use of
antiangiogenic drugs reverses this immunosuppression and can augment response to immunotherapy.
Lucitanib is an unlicensed medical product.

10324,ï»¿Pfizer and Lilly Report Result of Tanezumab in P-III A4091059 Study for Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP),PFIZER AND LILLY ANNOUNCE TOP-LINE RESULTS FROM PHASE 3 STUDY OF TANEZUMAB IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN,"The P-III A4091059 study involves assessing of tanezumab (5mg,10mg) vs PBO vs tramadol (prolonged release) in 1,832 in the ratio 2:2:2:3 with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain (CLBP) in North America, EU and Asia for 56 wks.
 The P-III A4091059 study results: well tolerated @56wks.; RPOA (1.4% vs 0.1%); ratio of RPOA type 1 (accelerated joint space narrowing) RPOA type 2 (damage or deterioration of the joint), 6:1; Subchondral insufficiency fracture (0.4%); total joint replacement (0.7%); no events of osteonecrosis
 Tanezumab (5mg, 10mg, SC) is a mAb, NGF inhibitor and has also received FDA’s FT designation in Jun,2017. In 2013, Pfizer and Lilly collaborated to jointly develop and commercialize tanezumab","Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced positive top-line results from a Phase 3 study evaluating tanezumab in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain (CLBP). In the study, treatment with tanezumab 10 mg met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in pain at 16 weeks compared to placebo. The tanezumab 5 mg arm demonstrated a numerical improvement in pain, but did not reach statistical significance compared to placebo at the week 16 analysis. Full results from this study will be submitted for future scientific publication and presentation. Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that is part of an investigational class of non-opioid pain medications known as nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitors.
In this study, CLBP was defined as low back pain that had persisted for more than three consecutive months. Patients enrolled suffered from moderate-to-severe pain and had experienced inadequate pain relief from or intolerance to at least three different classes of analgesics. On average, they had CLBP for 10 years, and they reported a significant impact of their pain on their ability to function in everyday life. An estimated 33 million Americans have CLBP, and approximately eight million of these patients suffer from moderate-to-severe CLBP. The condition is a leading cause of disability, and currently available treatment options for CLBP do not meet the needs of all patients.
Tanezumab 5 mg or 10 mg was administered subcutaneously (SC) every eight weeks. Preliminary safety data showed that tanezumab was generally well tolerated during the 56-week treatment period. The trial also included a 24-week safety follow-up period, for a total of 80 weeks of observation. Overall, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA) was observed among 1.4 percent of patients receiving tanezumab and 0.1 percent of patients in the other treatment groups. The ratio of RPOA type 1 (accelerated joint space narrowing) to RPOA type 2 (damage or deterioration of the joint) observed with tanezumab in the study was 6:1. Subchondral insufficiency fracture and total joint replacement were observed in 0.4 percent and 0.7 percent of tanezumab-treated patients, respectively, and were not observed in the other treatment groups. There were no events of osteonecrosis in the study.
“This study demonstrates the potential of tanezumab to treat individuals suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain who have been unable to achieve relief with currently available medicines,” said Ken Verburg, tanezumab development team leader, Pfizer Global Product Development. “This is one of the longest studies conducted to date in chronic low back pain. We look forward to further analyzing these results, and believe the data from this study will support our planned future global regulatory submissions in chronic low back pain.”
“Many patients living with chronic low back pain suffer from constant pain, which significantly impacts their ability to perform everyday tasks,” said Christi Shaw, president, Lilly Bio-Medicines. “Lilly and Pfizer recognize the unmet needs for those living with this life-altering and debilitating condition, and continue to advance tanezumab as an innovative non-opioid treatment for these patients.”
In addition to CLBP, the ongoing Phase 3 program for tanezumab includes studies in osteoarthritis (OA) pain and cancer pain (due to bone metastases). Positive results from two Phase 3 OA pain studies evaluating 16 and 24 weeks of treatment with tanezumab were previously reported. One additional Phase 3 study in OA pain and one additional Phase 3 study in CLBP will read out this year.
About Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP)
CLBP, or low back pain that lasts longer than three months, impacts an estimated 33 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Approximately eight million of these patients suffer from moderate-to-severe CLBP. The cause of CLBP is complex and not well understood, and management of the condition often requires medication in addition to non-pharmacologic treatment. Currently available treatment options for CLBP do not meet the needs of all patients, and many find themselves cycling through therapies to try to find relief from their pain. Living with CLBP can limit patients’ ability to physically function, which can force compromises in everyday life and cause feelings of isolation, frustration and anxiety.
About the Study
Study A4091059 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-and active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group Phase 3 trial in subjects with moderate-to-severe CLBP. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SC administration of tanezumab compared to placebo for a total of 16 weeks, and oral tramadol prolonged release (PR) for a total of 56 weeks. The study was conducted in North America, Europe and Asia.
The primary endpoint evaluated change in the daily average Low Back Pain Intensity (LBPI) score from baseline to week 16, as measured by an 11-point numeric rating scale, for tanezumab vs. placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated tanezumab treatment through 16 and 56 weeks, including comparisons to tramadol PR. The long-term safety of tanezumab through 80 weeks (56 weeks of treatment plus the 24-week safety follow-up period) was also evaluated.
Patients were not eligible to participate in the study if they met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for OA of the hip or knee, or had symptoms and radiographic findings consistent with OA of the shoulder. Patients with mild radiographic evidence of knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≤ 2) but no pain, and patients with no or possible radiographic evidence of hip OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≤1), were eligible to participate. Patients in the study had experienced inadequate pain relief from or intolerance to at least three different classes of analgesics. On average, these patients had CLBP for 10 years and reported significant impact of their pain on their ability to function in everyday life.
A total of 1,832 patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups in a 2:2:2:3 ratio: one group received placebo every eight weeks to week 16; at week 16, patients in this group who met the efficacy responder criteria were switched equally to either tanezumab 5 mg or tanezumab 10 mg every eight weeks to week 56; the second group received tanezumab 5 mg every eight weeks to week 56; the third group received tanezumab 10 mg every eight weeks to week 56; and the fourth group received oral tramadol PR daily to week 56.
About Tanezumab
Tanezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that works by selectively targeting, binding to and inhibiting NGF. NGF levels increase in the body as a result of injury, inflammation or in chronic pain states. By inhibiting NGF, tanezumab may help to keep pain signals produced by muscles, skin and organs from reaching the spinal cord and brain. Tanezumab has a novel mechanism that acts in a different manner than opioids and other analgesics, including NSAIDs, and in studies to date, tanezumab has not demonstrated a risk of addiction, misuse or dependence.
In 2013, Pfizer and Lilly entered into a worldwide co-development and co-commercialization agreement for the advancement of tanezumab. In June 2017, Pfizer and Lilly announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for tanezumab for the treatment of OA pain and CLBP. Tanezumab is the first NGF inhibitor to receive Fast Track designation, a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies that treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs. If approved, tanezumab would be a first-in-class treatment for OA pain and CLBP.

10338,ï»¿Merck Reports Results of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in P-III KEYNOTE-240 Study for 1L Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),"Merck Provides Update on KEYNOTE-240, a Phase 3 Study of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma","The P-III KEYNOTE-240 Study involves assessing of Keytruda (200mg, q3w) vs PBO in 413 patients with 1L advance HCC
 The study resulted in unmet 1EPs & 2EPs as OS, PFS & ORR, DOR, disease control rate and time to progression respectively in the trial
 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) 100mg IV is a mAb, used as an anti-D-L1 therapy that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands i.e PD-L1 & PD- L2, further activating T lymphocytes","Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-240 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, plus best supportive care, for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were previously treated with systemic therapy, did not meet its co-primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo plus best supportive care. In the final analysis of the study, there was an improvement in OS for patients treated with KEYTRUDA compared to placebo, however these OS results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.611-0.998]; p=0.0238). Results for PFS were also directionally favorable in the KEYTRUDA arm compared with placebo but did not reach statistical significance (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.61-0.99]; p=0.0209). The key secondary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) was not formally tested, since superiority was not reached for OS or PFS. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and have been shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for discussion.
“While we are disappointed KEYNOTE-240 did not meet its co-primary endpoints, the results for overall survival, progression-free survival and objective response rate are generally consistent with findings from the Phase 2 study, KEYNOTE-224, which led to the accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this study and are committed to helping patients diagnosed with this common and difficult-to-treat type of liver cancer.”
KEYTRUDA is being studied across multiple settings and lines of therapy for HCC through our broad clinical program that includes 10 clinical trials sponsored by Merck or in collaborations. As monotherapy in second-line HCC, in addition to KEYNOTE-240 and KEYNOTE-224, KEYTRUDA is being investigated in the ongoing Phase 3, KEYNOTE-394 trial, a randomized, double-blind trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with best supportive care, compared to placebo in combination with best supportive care, in Asian patients with advanced HCC who were previously treated with systemic therapy. In addition, there are several ongoing trials investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with other treatments, including therapies through our collaborations.
About KEYNOTE-240
KEYNOTE-240 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02702401) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus best supportive care compared to placebo plus best supportive care in patients with advanced HCC who were previously treated with systemic therapy. The primary endpoints are OS and PFS. The secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response, disease control rate and time to progression. The study enrolled 413 patients who were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks for up to 35 cycles of treatment [up to approximately two years]) plus best supportive care (including pain management and management of other potential complications including ascites per local standards of care) or placebo plus best supportive care.
About Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer in adults, which is the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Risk factors for liver cancer include gender, ethnicity, chronic viral hepatitis (Hep-B or Hep-C) infection, cirrhosis, alcohol use and metabolic syndrome. Hepatocellular carcinoma – which is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage – has one of the highest mortality rates of solid cancers, with a five-year survival rate of less than 15 percent.
About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 900 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%), and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.
Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.
Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.
The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials and postmarketing use.
Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.
Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.
In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.
Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

10374,AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab) Receives Health Canada Approval for Chronic Non-Infectious Anterior Uveitis in Pediatric Patients,AbbVie's HUMIRA (Adalimumab) Approved by Health Canada to Treat Pediatric Patients with Chronic Non-infectious Anterior Uveitis,"The approval is based on SYCAMORE study assessing Humira (20mg, 40 mg, based on body wt.) + methotrexate vs methotrexate + PBO in 114 patients in a ratio (2:1) with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment aged > 2yrs.
 The SYCAMORE study resulted in meeting 1EPs, with delayed treatment failure (27% vs 60%)
 Humira (adalimumab, SC, q2w) is a mab blocking TNF-a protein targeted for an inflammatory response of immune-mediated diseases and is approved in 90 countries for 15 indications","The approval marks HUMIRA as the only approved biologic treatment option in Canada for pediatric patients from two years of age with chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis who have had inadequate response to conventional therapy
The approval is based on results from SYCAMORE, an investigator-initiated clinical trial, which showed that HUMIRA combined with methotrexate significantly delayed the time to treatment failure compared to methotrexate plus placebo in children with active JIA-associated uveitis1
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common systemic disorder associated with non-infectious uveitis in children, accounting for more than 75 percent of cases of pediatric anterior uveitis2
MONTREAL,, a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that Health Canada has approved HUMIRA® (adalimumab) for the treatment of chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in pediatric patients from two years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. HUMIRA is now the only approved biologic treatment option for chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in children aged two years and older in Canada.
“This approval marks an important milestone for pediatric uveitis patients and their caregivers who, up until this point, had no biologic treatment options available to them,” said Stéphane Lassignardie, General Manager of AbbVie Canada. “This label expansion for HUMIRA further demonstrates AbbVie’s dedication to addressing the unmet medical needs for both adult and pediatric patients living with serious immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.”
Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which includes the iris, choroid and the ciliary body in the eye.3 If left untreated, it can lead to vision loss, including cataracts, glaucoma and cystoid macular edema (CME).4,5 Severe vision loss has been estimated to occur in 25 to 30 percent of pediatric uveitis cases, making early diagnosis and treatment essential to preserve vision in children with the disease.4,6 JIA is the most common systemic disorder associated with uveitis in children accounting for more than 75 percent of cases of pediatric anterior uveitis.2
“For many children, the diagnosis of uveitis carries a significant burden in terms of number of visits to the hospital, threat to the patient’s vision and anxiety for the whole family,” explained Dr. Eric Fortin, ophthalmologist at the University of Montreal Ophthalmology Center. “Having this approval for the indication of pediatric uveitis will hopefully lead to easier access to HUMIRA for those patients who need it. That is something that is very important both to me and my patients.”
“Pediatric uveitis is a debilitating and potentially blinding condition, which poses overwhelming challenges to children and their families,” said Christina Pelizon, Medical Director, AbbVie Canada. “The SYCAMORE study showed that HUMIRA in combination with methotrexate significantly delayed the time to treatment failure compared with methotrexate plus placebo. These results demonstrate HUMIRA has the potential to help many children who have failed standard treatments preserve their eyesight from the ocular complications associated with chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis.”
The SYCAMORE clinical trial is a randomized controlled study of the clinical efficacy and safety of HUMIRA combined with methotrexate versus methotrexate plus placebo for the treatment of active JIA-associated uveitis. It was sponsored by the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and coordinated by the Clinical Trials Research Centre at the University of Liverpool. The Independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (IDSMC) recommended unmasking the trial early after 90 randomized patients with active JIA-associated uveitis because it showed that HUMIRA combined with methotrexate controlled ocular inflammation better and was associated with a significantly lower rate of treatment failure, defined according to several criteria, including multiple components of intraocular inflammation, than placebo.1
About the SYCAMORE Trial1
The SYCAMORE clinical trial was sponsored by the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and coordinated by the Clinical Trials Research Centre at the University of Liverpool. The study was supported by grants from the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme and Arthritis Research UK. In this multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, researchers assessed the efficacy and safety of HUMIRA in children and adolescents two years of age and older who had active JIA-associated uveitis noninfectious anterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment.
Patients who were taking a stable dose of methotrexate were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either HUMIRA (at a dose of 20 mg or 40 mg, according to body weight) or placebo, administered subcutaneously every two weeks. Patients continued the trial regimen until treatment failure or until 18 months had elapsed. Including a 6 months off-study drug period, they were followed for up to two years after randomization. The primary endpoint was the time to treatment failure, defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria: multiple components of intraocular inflammation, worsening or development of ocular comorbidities, use of concomitant medications that were not allowed or that did not follow pre-specified criteria, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time.
Study results showed that the addition of HUMIRA to methotrexate significantly delayed the time to treatment failure as compared with placebo, and the pre-specified stopping criteria were met after the enrollment of 90 of 114 patients. Researchers observed 16 treatment failures in 60 patients (27 percent) in the HUMIRA group versus 18 treatment failures in 30 patients (60 percent) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 99.9 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.08 to 0.79; P<0.0001 [the pre-specified stopping boundary]).
About HUMIRA
HUMIRA resembles antibodies normally found in the body. It works by blocking TNF-α, a protein that, when produced in excess, plays a central role in the inflammatory responses of many immune-mediated diseases.
HUMIRA is one of the most comprehensively studied biologics available. The overall clinical database for HUMIRA spans 20 years across 15 indications globally (11 in Canada), including more than 71 clinical trials with more than 23,000 patients. HUMIRA is approved in 90 countries and used by more than one million patients worldwide.
Any medicines can have side effects. Like all medicines that affect the immune system, HUMIRA can cause serious side effects.7 Before initiation of, during and after treatment with HUMIRA, patients should be evaluated for active or inactive tuberculosis infection with a tuberculin skin test. For further information, please see the HUMIRA Product Monograph1available at www.abbvie.ca.
mportant Safety Information
HUMIRA is a TNF blocker medicine that affects the immune system and can lower the body’s ability to fight infections. Serious infections have happened in people taking HUMIRA. These serious infections include tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria that have spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. People should be tested for TB before HUMIRA use and monitored for signs and symptoms of TB during therapy. People at risk of TB may be treated with medicine for TB before starting HUMIRA. Treatment with HUMIRA should not be started in a person with an active infection, unless approved by a doctor. HUMIRA should be stopped if a person develops a serious infection. People should tell their doctor if they live in or have been to a region where certain fungal infections are common, have had TB or hepatitis B, are prone to infections, or have symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, or sores.
For people taking TNF blockers, including HUMIRA, the chance of getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. Some people have developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results in death. If using TNF blockers, including HUMIRA, the chance of getting two types of skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell) may increase. These types are generally not life-threatening if treated.
Other possible serious side effects with HUMIRA include hepatitis B infection in carriers of the virus; allergic reactions; nervous system problems; blood problems; certain immune reactions including a lupus-like syndrome; liver problems; and new or worsening heart failure or psoriasis. The use of HUMIRA with other biologics DMARDS (e.g. anakinra or abatacept) or other TNF antagonists is not recommended. People using HUMIRA should not receive live vaccines.
Common side effects of HUMIRA include injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain or bruising), cough and cold symptoms, headache, rash, nausea, pneumonia, fever and abdominal pain.
HUMIRA is given by injection under the skin.
The benefits and risks of HUMIRA should be carefully considered before starting therapy.

10387,AbbVie &amp; Eisai's Humira (adalimumab) Receives Approval for Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Japan,AbbVie and Eisai Announce Fully Human Anti-TNF-α Monoclonal Antibody HUMIRA is the First in Japan to be Approved for the Treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa,"The approval is based on Japanese P-III study results assessing Humira (adalimumab) in patients with moderate-to-severe HS, evaluating its efficacy and safety
 The study resulted in meeting its 1EPs as HiSCR @12 wks. in 13/15 patients, ADRs in 6/15
 Humira (adalimumab) is an anti-TNF-α mAb approved in Japan for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), plaque psoriasis, arthritic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis","AbbVie, a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, (Headquarters: Minato-ku, Tokyo, President: James Feliciano) and Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) today announced that they have received approval for an additional indication of HUMIRA® (generic name: adalimumab [recombinant], “HUMIRA”), a fully human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). With this approval, HUMIRA has become the first treatment indicated for HS in Japan, and is now approved for 11 indications in Japan.
 
The approval of this additional indication is based on the data from a Japanese Phase III study1 and overseas clinical trials.2 In these trials, the efficacy and safety of HUMIRA were evaluated in patients with moderate to severe HS. In the clinical trial conducted in Japan, the percentage of patients who achieved the primary endpoint of HiSCR* at Week 12 after treatment was 13 of 15 patients.3 In the same trial, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were observed in 6 of 15 patients at Week 24 of treatment; ADRs observed in two or more patients were nasopharyngitis and cellulitis, and other ADRs including dental caries, erythrasma, folliculitis, lymphocyte count increased, erythema, pruritus, and skin exfoliation were observed in one patient each.3
 
HS is a painful, inflammatory skin disease with a chronic course which typically presents after puberty. Inflammatory symptoms are frequently observed in the axillary, inguinal, breast-fold, and gluteal regions. The main symptom is red, swollen boil-like lumps, and the progression of symptoms leads to formation of nodules, abscesses, and even fistulas. Repeated recurrence causes thickening of the affected areas, resulting in scarring.4 Severe symptoms may limit the patients’ daily activities and sometimes force them to stop working.5 The epidemiology data in Japan is unknown,6 and the prevalence outside Japan is reported to be 1%.7Since the disease is poorly recognized and difficult to diagnose, overseas reports indicate that the average time to definitive diagnosis is seven years, which is longer than that of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases, and patients with HS visit hospitals more often.
 
“This approval will be a major step for patients with HS. HS is a recurrent disease with pain and pus discharge. It has a significant impact on patients’ quality of life, affecting their work or study performance and, in advanced cases, requiring major surgery with skin grafting,” said Dr. Tadashi Terui, Professor, Division of Cutaneous Science, Department of Dermatology, Nihon University School of Medicine. “Only limited options have been available for the treatment of HS until now. The additional indication of HUMIRA for HS is expected to significantly contribute to the improvement in patients’ quality of life.”
 
AbbVie and Eisai will continue to promote and provide information on the proper use of HUMIRA® while making further contributions to improve the quality of life of patients.
 
* HiSCR stands for Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response, and is defined as at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the abscess and inflammatory nodule counts, with no increase in abscess or draining-fistula counts.
 
About HUMIRA
HUMIRA® is a fully human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody formulation. In Japan, it is approved for the indications of “the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (including inhibition of the progression of structural damage), the treatment of plaque psoriasis, arthritic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,** intestinal Behçet’s disease, non-infectious uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis, induction and maintenance therapy for moderate to severely active Crohn’s disease (administer HUMIRA to patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy), and treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (administer HUMIRA to patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy ).”
**: HUMIRA® for Subcutaneous Injection 80 mg Syringe 0.8 mL and HUMIRA® for Subcutaneous Injection 80 mg Pen 0.8 mL are yet to be approved for this indication.
Only HUMIRA® for Subcutaneous Injection 20 mg Syringe 0.4 mL and HUMIRA® for Subcutaneous Injection 20 mg Syringe 0.2 mL are approved for this indication.

 In 2006, Amgen & Cytokinetics collaborated to develop therapeutics for the activation of cardiac sarcomere for heart failure. The second P-III METEORIC-HF Study is conducted by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Amgen and to be fund by Servier
 Omecamtiv Mecarbil is a cardiac muscle activator evaluated in global P-III GALACTIC-HF study versus PBO for patients with heart failure or have had a hospitalization or admission to an emergency room for heart failure within one year prior to screening","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., and SURESNES– Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), Cytokinetics, Incorporated (NASDAQ: CYTK) and Servier today announced that METEORIC-HF (Multicenter Exercise Tolerance Evaluation of Omecamtiv Mecarbil Related to Increased Contractility in Heart Failure), the second Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil, a novel cardiac myosin activator, is open to enrollment. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed for the potential treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
METEORIC-HF is designed to evaluate the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo on exercise capacity as determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients with HFrEF. Cytokinetics is conducting METEORIC-HF in collaboration with Amgen, with funding and strategic support from Servier.
“The start of this second Phase 3 clinical trial marks an important milestone in the expansion of our clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil, testing the hypothesis that improving cardiac function with a drug candidate that directly increases myocardial contractility may improve exercise capacity,” said Fady I. Malik, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president of Research & Development at Cytokinetics. “Exercise intolerance, typically manifested by shortness of breath and fatigue on exertion, is a predominant symptom of chronic heart failure and often the first symptom that prompts patients to seek medical care. If positive, this clinical trial may provide key clinically relevant evidence.”
METEORIC-HF Clinical Trial Design
METEORIC-HF is a Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo on exercise capacity as determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following 20 weeks of treatment. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 270 patients with HFrEF at sites throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. In order to be eligible to participate in METEORIC-HF, patients must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35 percent, be New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure class II or III and have reduced exercise capacity compared to age matched controls. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to omecamtiv mecarbil, which will be started at 25 mg twice daily and titrated to 25, 37.5 or 50 mg twice daily based on the same PK-guided dosing regimen as is used in GALACTIC-HF, the ongoing Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial of omecamtiv mecarbil, or to placebo. The primary endpoint is the change in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2) on CPET from baseline to Week 20. Secondary endpoints include the change in total workload during CPET from baseline to Week 20 and the change in the average daily activity units measured over a 2-week period from baseline (Week -2 to Day 1) to Week 18-20 as determined using accelerometry. Additional information about METEORIC-HF can be found on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03759392.
About Omecamtiv Mecarbil and the Phase 3 Clinical Trials Program
Omecamtiv mecarbil is a novel, selective cardiac myosin activator that binds to the catalytic domain of myosin. Preclinical research has shown that cardiac myosin activators increase cardiac contractility without affecting intracellular myocyte calcium concentrations or myocardial oxygen consumption.1,2,3 Cardiac myosin is the cytoskeletal motor protein in the cardiac muscle cell that is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into the mechanical force resulting in cardiac contraction. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed for the potential treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) under a collaboration between Amgen and Cytokinetics, with funding and strategic support from Servier.
Omecamtiv mecarbil is the subject of a comprehensive Phase 3 clinical trials program comprised of GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure), a large, Phase 3 global cardiovascular outcomes study, and METEORIC-HF. Amgen is conducting GALACTIC-HF in collaboration with Cytokinetics and Servier.
GALACTIC-HF is designed to enroll approximately 8,000 patients at over 900 sites in 35 countries who are either currently hospitalized for a primary reason of heart failure or have had a hospitalization or admission to an emergency room for heart failure within one year prior to screening. The trial is designed to evaluate whether treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil, when added to standard of care, reduces the risk of heart failure events (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure) and cardiovascular (CV) death in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
Enrollment in GALACTIC-HF is nearing 90 percent completion, with over 7,000 patients randomized to date from across the spectrum of the NYHA classification (class II to IV). Completion of patient enrollment in GALACTIC-HF is expected to occur during the first half of 2019.
About Heart Failure
Heart failure is a grievous condition that affects more than 26 million people worldwide,4,5 about half of whom have reduced left ventricular function.6,7 It is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmission in people age 65 and older.8,9 Despite broad use of standard treatments and advances in care, the prognosis for patients with heart failure is poor.10 An estimated one in five people over the age of 40 are at risk of developing heart failure, and approximately 50 percent of people diagnosed with heart failure will die within five years of initial hospitalization.11,12

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.
Amgen’s results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen’s products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen’sresearch, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen’s business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen’s business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. While Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key manufacturing facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen’s products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen’s distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen’s products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen’s efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies Amgen has acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen’s systems and Amgen’s data. Amgen’sstock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen’s business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.
The scientific information discussed in this news release related to Amgen’s product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

Janssen to get exclusive option to license integrin therapies post IND submission and will fund the clinical trials
 If the option is exercised, Janssen to get exclusive WW development and commercialization rights of the products
 Morphic’s Integrins are receptors present on human cells responsible for cell survival, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and cell migration focusing on fibrosis, autoimmune diseases, and immuno-oncology","Deal extends reach of Morphic discovery across all known human integrins
Therapeutic potential of Morphic pipeline expanded by inclusion of both integrin inhibitor and activator research
Collaboration facilitated by Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Boston
Morphic Therapeutic (Morphic), a biotechnology company developing oral integrin therapies, announced today that it has entered into a research and development collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) to discover and develop novel integrin therapeutics for patients with conditions not adequately addressed by current therapies. Johnson & Johnson Innovation LLC facilitated the transaction. The collaboration focuses on several undisclosed integrin targets and will explore both inhibitors and activators of integrin function.
To date, Morphic has built a leadership position in novel oral small molecule integrin inhibitors by leveraging the breakthrough structural research of its scientific founder, Dr. Tim Springer. Applying this platform to all 24 known human integrins, including αI integrin targets, potentially expands Morphic’s drug discovery capabilities, pipeline and the therapeutic applications of its drug candidates across a diverse set of diseases. This reflects integrins’ important role in many cellular processes.
“Our team is pleased to have a partner of Janssen’s caliber join our network of collaborators working together to drive the development of a new generation of oral integrin medicines using our in-house platform,” said Praveen Tipirneni, M.D., president and chief executive officer, Morphic Therapeutic. “The dysregulation of the diverse integrin family is implicated in many conditions, creating an urgency which drives our team’s mission to rapidly and systematically interrogate this target class both from an inhibition and activation perspective. This partnership offers exciting opportunities to advance oral integrin development into new areas of research which creates value for all our internal programs and accelerates the refinement and validation of our platform.”
Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will collaborate through preclinical development to identify and advance candidates. Upon completing Investigational New Drug enabling studies, Janssen may exclusively option the licensed compounds, and then Janssen will be responsible for global clinical development and commercialization. Janssen will pay Morphic an undisclosed upfront payment and will fund research activities. In addition, Morphic will receive from Janssen multiple preclinical development, clinical and commercial milestone payments totaling over $725 million if such milestones are achieved. Morphic will also receive royalties on worldwide net sales for any products resulting from the collaboration.
About Integrins
Integrins are a ubiquitous family of receptors expressed on the surface of most human cells. Integrins are dimers comprising one α (alpha) subunit and one β (beta) subunit. Integrin signaling controls a wide range of cellular processes, including cell survival, cell cycle progression, immune system activation, cell differentiation, and cell migration. Aberrant integrin signaling contributes to a diverse array of human diseases, including each of Morphic’s focus areas of fibrosis, autoimmune diseases, and immuno-oncology.
αI (pronounced ‘alpha-eye’) domain integrins represent a distinct structural class of the 24-member integrin family. The presence of the αI domain in the α (alpha) subunit of the integrin dimer gives it a different mechanism of ligand binding. αI domain integrins are distinct from the α1 (alpha-one) subunit of the integrin dimer. Activators of integrin function may be useful in the treatment of diseases where cell function is weakened due to loss of integrin-mediated interactions with the microenvironment.
Research in the Springer laboratory has shown that, historically, compounds designed to inhibit integrin function inadvertently worked to activate it, leading to the failure of investigational oral integrin drugs. Morphic’s platform is designed to avoid these pitfalls and deliver effective oral therapeutic candidates including both inhibitors and activators of integrin function.
About Morphic Therapeutic
Morphic Therapeutic is a biotechnology company developing a new generation of oral integrin therapies. Drawing on integrin biology breakthroughs from the lab of noted entrepreneur and scientific founder Tim Springer, Morphic has developed an exclusive platform to build on these discoveries to model integrins and discover effective orally delivered integrin therapies. This platform is complemented by a partnership with computational chemistry leader Schrödinger, Inc., that facilitates the rapid and iterative design of clinical candidates.

 The P-III study resulted in meeting its 1EPs with the reduction in the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to aspirin alon
 Brilinta (ticagrelor) is an oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist inhibits platelet activation, when administered in combination with aspirin prevents atherothrombotic events in adults with ACS","Brilinta reduced cardiovascular events in patients with no prior heart attack or stroke
The Phase III THEMIS trial met its primary endpoint and demonstrated that Brilinta (ticagrelor), taken in conjunction with aspirin, showed a statistically-significant reduction in a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to aspirin alone.
THEMIS was conducted in over 19,000 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type-2 diabetes (T2D) with no prior heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI) or stroke. Preliminary safety results were consistent with the known profile of Brilinta.A full evaluation of the THEMIS data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
Elisabeth Björk, Senior Vice President, Head of late Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism, R&D BioPharmaceuticals, said: “Approaches to help reduce cardiovascular morbidity further in patients with coronary artery disease and type-2 diabetes are urgently needed. The positive result from the THEMIS trial may offer a potential benefit for this high-risk patient population.”
Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, THEMIS co-Chair and Executive Director of Interventional Cardiovascular Programs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a Professor at Harvard Medical School said: “The THEMIS trial is the largest randomised trial of patients with type-2 diabetes performed to date and was designed to evaluate whether more-intense antiplatelet therapy is a promising approach. The results could help us refine our understanding of the role of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients across the atherothrombotic spectrum.”
Gabriel Steg, MD, THEMIS co-Chair and Professor at Université Paris-Diderot, Paris and Professor at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London said: “Patients who have both stable coronary artery disease and diabetes are a sizeable group which remains at particularly high risk of major adverse cardiac events. The optimal long-term antiplatelet therapy in that group is not fully established. We look forward to presenting the full results from the THEMIS trial later this year.”
About THEMIS
THEMIS (Effect of Ticagrelor on Health Outcomes in DiabEtes Mellitus Patients Intervention Study) is an AstraZeneca-sponsored, multi-national, randomised, double‑blinded trial in patients with CAD and T2D with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke. THEMIS was designed to test the hypothesis that Brilinta plus aspirin would reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke, in patients with CAD and T2D with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke, vs. aspirin alone. CAD was defined as a prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), bypass surgery or at least a 50% narrowing of a coronary artery.
The trial was initiated in early 2014, duration was event-driven across 42 countries and more than 19,000 patients were randomised in order to collect 1,385 independently-adjudicated primary endpoint events.
About Brilinta
Brilinta (ticagrelor) is an oral, reversible, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works by inhibiting platelet activation. Brilinta, together with aspirin, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or CV death), in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI.
Brilinta, co-administered with aspirin is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS, or for patients with a history of MI and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event.

10448,Santhera Reports Results of Raxone (Idebenone) in P-III DELOS trial for Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)ï»¿,Santhera’s SYROS Study Shows Long-term Efficacy with Idebenone in Slowing Respiratory Function Loss in Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"The P-III DELOS trial involves assessing of idebenone (900mg/day) vs PBO in 64 patients with DML for 52 wks.
 P-III DELOS study results: 50% reduction in annual rates of forced vital capacity; treatment effect remained 6 yrs.; reduction in risk of important patient-relevant outcomes including bronchopulmonary AEs and hospitalizations; reductions in the rate of both inspiratory and expiratory respiratory function loss
 Idebenone is a benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme NAD(P)H H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) approved for Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in the EU including n, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Israel and Serbia","Pratteln, Switzerland, Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) announces results
from the SYROS study demonstrating that long-term treatment with idebenone consistently reduced
the rate of respiratory function loss in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) for up to 6
years in a real-world setting. This long-term data further support the potential for idebenone to
modify the course of respiratory function decline and delay the time to clinically relevant milestones.
The SYROS study was a prospectively planned collection of long-term, retrospective real-world data from
patients who completed the positive Phase III DELOS trial (18 out of 64) and were subsequently treated
with idebenone (900 mg/day) for on average 4.2 years (range 2.4-6.1 years) under Expanded Access
Programs (EAPs). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term evolution of the
respiratory function in patients who maintained treatment with idebenone for up to 6 years compared
to their preceding off-idebenone period.
The result of this study, which is consistent with outcomes from the pivotal DELOS study, demonstrated
that:
 Switching to and maintaining long-term treatment with idebenone reduced the annual rate of
decline in forced vital capacity percent of predicted (FVC%p) by 50%.
 The treatment effect was consistently maintained year-on-year for up to 6 years.
 These findings are further supported by consistent reductions in the rate of both inspiratory and
expiratory respiratory function loss over the same period.
 Prolonged treatment with idebenone also reduced the risk of important patient-relevant outcomes,
including bronchopulmonary adverse events and hospitalizations due to respiratory causes.
“We are very excited to see that the significant treatment effect with idebenone observed in our 52-
week Phase III DELOS study is maintained over the long-term,” said Kristina Sjöblom Nygren, MD, Chief
Medical Officer and Head of Development at Santhera. “The new findings are highly relevant for DMD
patients in respiratory decline who have an urgent need for a therapy to modify the declining course of
respiratory function decline and ultimately delay the need for assisted ventilation.”
The findings from the SYROS study have been accepted for presentation at the 2019 MDA Clinical &
Scientific Conference (April 13-17, 2019, in Orlando) and will be submitted for publication in a peerreviewed journal.
Santhera’s SYROS Study Shows Long-term Efficacy with Idebenone in Slowing
Respiratory Function Loss in Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
February 25, 2019 / Page 2 of 3
About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
DMD is one of the most common and devastating types of progressive muscle weakness and
degeneration starting at an early age and leading to early morbidity and mortality due to respiratory
failure. It is a genetic, degenerative disease that occurs almost exclusively in males with an incidence of
up to 1 in 3,500 live male births worldwide. DMD is characterized by a loss of the protein dystrophin,
leading to cell damage, impaired calcium homeostasis, elevated oxidative stress and reduced energy
production in muscle cells. With age, progressive respiratory muscle weakness affecting thoracic
accessory muscles and the diaphragm causes respiratory disease, impaired clearance of airway
secretions, recurrent pulmonary infections due to ineffective cough, and eventually respiratory failure.
There is currently no treatment approved for slowing loss of respiratory function in patients with DMD.
About Idebenone in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Idebenone is a synthetic short-chain benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase (NQO1) capable of stimulating mitochondrial electron transport, reducing and
scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and supplementing cellular energy levels.
DELOS was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study which randomized 64 patients,
not taking concomitant steroids, to receive either idebenone (900 mg/day) or matching placebo. The
study met its primary endpoint, the change from baseline in Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) expressed as
percent of predicted, which demonstrated that idebenone can slow the loss of respiratory function.
Additional respiratory function and clinical outcomes supported the results of the primary endpoint [1-5].
SYROS was a prospectively planned collection of long-term, retrospective real-world respiratory function
data from 18 patients who completed the DELOS study and subsequently received idebenone (900
mg/day) under Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). These long-term data showed that the previously
observed beneficial effect of idebenone in reducing the rate of respiratory function decline was
maintained over a >4 year average treatment period.

AbbVie to get a WW option to license rights to futher develop and commercialize one or more vectorized alpha-synuclein Abs for Parkinson’s and other synucleinopathies
 If AbbVie exercises its option to license, Voyager will receive $245M as P-I option, $1.2B milestones including regulatory & commercial sales and royalties on global sales of products
 Voyager’s technology is an AVV gene therapy technology enabling the development of therapies utilizing blood-brain barrier penetrant AVV capsids in neurological disorders including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease & Friedreich’s ataxia","Deal expands collaborative efforts on vectorized antibodies to target pathological species of alpha-synuclein 
– Voyager to receive $65 million upfront and up to $245 million in preclinical and Phase 1 option payments as well as potential development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments and royalties
AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a global biopharmaceutical company, and Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: VYGR), a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing treatments for severe neurological diseases, today announced an exclusive, global strategic collaboration and option agreement to develop and commercialize vectorized antibodies directed at pathological species of alpha-synuclein for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other diseases (synucleinopathies) characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein.
The delivery of sufficient quantities of antibodies across the blood-brain barrier is one of the major limitations of current biologic therapies for neurodegenerative diseases that require frequent systemic injections with large amounts of antibodies. Voyager’s vectorized antibody platform and approach aims to circumvent this limitation by delivering, with a potential, one-time intravenous administration, the genes that encode for the production of therapeutic antibodies utilizing Voyager’s blood-brain barrier penetrant adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids. This approach could result in the potential for higher levels of therapeutic antibodies in the brain compared with current systemic administration of antibodies.
“The expansion of AbbVie’s partnership with Voyager represents the potential we see in the ability of its vectorized antibody platform to surpass the blood-brain barrier and more effectively deliver biologic therapies,” said Jim Summers, Ph.D., vice president, discovery neuroscience research, AbbVie. “We are hopeful that Voyager’s technology will enable further development of transformative treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.”
“Our scientific platform allows us to develop unique AAV gene therapies that are designed to knock down disease-causing gene expression, increase the expression of missing proteins, or enable the expression of therapeutic antibodies through vectorization,” said Andre Turenne, president and chief executive officer of Voyager Therapeutics. “We are excited to expand our efforts towards pathological species of alpha-synuclein given its role in the progression of disease, and AbbVie is the ideal partner to advance this new target and therapeutic modality.”
Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. A hallmark of Parkinson’s disease is the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein that can eventually lead to the formation of protein deposits and progressive neurodegeneration. Approaches to interfere with this process could potentially delay the progression of Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies including Lewy Body Dementia and multiple system atrophy.
Details of the Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration and Financial Terms
Under the terms of the collaboration and option agreement, Voyager will perform research and preclinical development work to vectorize antibodies directed against alpha-synuclein that are designated by AbbVie, after which AbbVie may select one or more vectorized antibodies to advance into IND-enabling studies and clinical development. Voyager will be responsible for the research, IND-enabling and Phase 1 clinical activities and costs. Following completion of Phase 1 clinical development, AbbVie has an option to license the vectorized alpha-synuclein antibody program for further clinical development and global commercialization for indications including Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies.
Voyager will receive an upfront cash payment of $65 million and has the potential to earn up to $245 million in preclinical and Phase 1 option payments. Voyager is also eligible to receive up to an additional $728 million in potential development and regulatory milestone payments for each alpha-synuclein vectorized antibody compound.

10480,Novartis Exercises its Option to License AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from Akcea,AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx Advances as Leading Pharmaceutical Company Exercises Option to License,"Akcea to receive $150M as option license fee with equal sharing with Ionis as equity investment in Akcea. Novartis to get exclusive WW development and commercialization rights for Akcea’s AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx (TQJ230) and will initiate P-III trial for cardiovascular outcomes
 In Jan,2107 Akcea and its subsidiary Ionis collaborated with Novartis to develop & commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx & AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. for cardiovascular disorders
 AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx antisense drug developed using Ionis’ LIgand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, taregeted for inhibiting apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a) protein & established CVD and has been evaluated in P-II demonstrated reduction in Lp(a), LDL-C, apoB, OxPL-apoB, OxPL-apo(a) levels","BOSTON and CARLSBAD, Calif., Akcea Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKCA), an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS), today announced that Novartis has exercised its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, a drug to treat patients with elevated levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), and established cardiovascular disease (CVD). AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, referred to by Novartis as TQJ230, was discovered by Ionis and co-developed by Akcea and Ionis.
Elevated Lp(a) is an independent genetic risk factor for CVD that cannot be managed by lifestyle modifications, including diet or exercise, or with treatment using existing cholesterol-lowering therapies1,2. It is estimated that there are more than eight million patients living with CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a).
“We are very pleased that Novartis, an established global leader in drug development and commercialization, will now shepherd this landmark therapy through late-stage clinical development and toward the market,” said Paula Soteropoulos, chief executive officer at Akcea. “The Phase 2 study results presented last year at AHA showed that AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx significantly reduced Lp(a) levels below the recognized threshold for cardiovascular risk in patients living with cardiovascular disease and elevated Lp(a) levels with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is the first and only medicine to do this. We believe that this therapy has the potential to be a significant advance for millions of people affected by cardiovascular disease around the world.”
Novartis will assume responsibility for all future development activities for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, including a planned global Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study and, pending regulatory approval, global commercialization activities.
AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is an antisense drug developed based on Ionis’ proprietary LIgand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology platform. Ionis’ proprietary LICA technology platform has the potential to produce new drugs that can be used at lower doses and with less frequent administration compared to non-LICA antisense drugs. AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is designed to inhibit production of apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a) protein, thereby reducing systemic levels of Lp(a).
“The Ionis LICA platform is a game-changing breakthrough for our antisense technology. AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, our most advanced LICA medicine, is a particularly exciting and important new medicine because of its potential to treat millions of patients with cardiovascular disease. This treatment represents one of many important new medicines within our LICA pipeline and illustrates our continued commitment to innovation and in bringing transformative medicines to patients in great need,” said Brett Monia, chief operating officer at Ionis.
Based on the strategic collaboration agreement between Akcea and Novartis, Akcea will receive a $150 million license fee that will be split equally with Ionis. Akcea will settle its $75 million obligation to Ionis in Akcea common stock.
ABOUT AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx AND THE PHASE 2 STUDY
AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx is an antisense drug that uses Ionis’ advanced LIgand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology. AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx inhibits the production of apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a), protein, thereby reducing Lp(a).
The Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and to determine the appropriate dose and dose regimen for a planned Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2 study included 286 patients with established CVD and high Lp(a) levels (baseline mean of 100mg/dL [250 nmol/L]- more than three times the upper limit of normal). Results from the study showed statistically significant dose-dependent reductions of Lp(a) compared to placebo at all dose levels, including low monthly doses of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. In the phase 2 study, 98% of patients in the 20mg weekly cohort and 81% of patients in the 60mg every 4 week cohort achieved clinically significant reductions in Lp(a) levels bringing them below the recommended threshold of risk for CVD events (<50 mg/dL). Treatment with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx was associated with decreases in LDL-C, apoB, OxPL-apoB, OxPL-apo(a). Most adverse events were mild. The most frequent adverse events were injection site reactions (ISRs). ISRs occurred in 26% of patients and were mostly mild and one patient discontinued due to an ISR. There were no safety concerns related to platelet counts, liver function or renal function. Approximately 90% of patients completed treatment and the rate of discontinuation was comparable between the active and placebo groups. All patients were treated for at least six months, with some patients treated up to one year.
ABOUT Lp(a)
Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is made up of apo(a) protein bound to LDL cholesterol and contains oxidized phospholipids, resulting in an atherogenic, pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic lipoprotein. Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of cardiovascular disease present in approximately 20-30% of the population. Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and, therefore, lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels.
For additional information about Lp(a), please see the Lipoprotein(a) Foundation at http://www.lipoproteinafoundation.org/.

Acquisition to transform Ipsen’s Rare Disease portfolio by leveraging Clementia’s expertise and Ipsen’s global commercial footprint to provide life-altering treatments to patients with unmet medical needs
Ipsen to acquire all outstanding shares of Clementia for a purchase price of US$25.00 per share in cash upfront plus a contingent value right (CVR) of US$6.00 per share related to the multiple osteochondromas indication for a total transaction value of up to US$1.31 billion
Ipsen to host conference call today at 2:00pm CET
 
Paris and Montréal, 25 February 2019 – Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and Clementia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CMTA) today announced that they have entered into an agreement for Ipsen to acquire Clementia Pharmaceuticals, including its key late-stage clinical asset palovarotene, an investigational retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) selective agonist, for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), multiple osteochondromas (MO) and other diseases. The acquisition will proceed by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement pursuant to the Canada Business Corporations Act.
 
Continuing the transformation of Ipsen:

Accelerating a global Rare Disease organization with the mission to bring treatment options for ultra-orphan diseases to patients worldwide
Executing on a key strategic objective to increase the value of the pipeline with innovative first-in-class or best-in-class assets
Acquiring a near-term launch opportunity of a largely de-risked asset with limited competition which enhances sustainable growth of the company with significant upside potential from additional indications
 
Palovarotene inhibits excess bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling which is linked to the progression of FOP and MO, two well-characterized, ultra-rare/rare and severely-disabling bone disorders for which there are currently no treatment options available.
A New Drug Application (NDA) for palovarotene for episodic flare-up treatment of FOP is expected to be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2019, and subject to FDA approval, a first commercial launch is expected in mid-2020. A Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating a chronic dosing regimen for FOP, a Phase 2 trial for MO, and a Phase 1 trial for dry eye disease are also ongoing. Palovarotene has received Orphan Drug designation for FOP and MO from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Rare Pediatric Disease designations for FOP from the FDA.
David Meek, Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen, commented, “The acquisition of ClementiaPharmaceuticals accelerates the ongoing transformation of Ipsen as we are successfully executing on our external innovation strategy to identify and acquire innovative medicines to serve patients with unmet medical needs. Through this transaction, we will gain scientific expertise, exceptional talent, and a cornerstone ultra-rare disease drug candidate with rare pediatric disease and breakthrough therapy designations, potential U.S. approval in 2020 and additional indications to follow. We look forward to working closely with Clementia to successfully integrate two companies that share a similar patient-centric culture and the ambition to deliver new treatments to patients with unmet medical needs.”
Dr. Clarissa Desjardins, Chief Executive Officer of Clementia, commented, “I am proud of the entire Clementia team, whose tireless efforts have rapidly advanced palovarotene towards a planned NDA submission, and we are all grateful for the dedication of the patient community and our clinical trial investigators who have supported us along the way. Ipsen’s global commercial presence and capabilities will expedite our shared vision of bringing palovarotene to patients around the world as quickly as possible. We anticipate a smooth transition of our operations into the Ipsen organization that will continue Clementia’s vision of delivering palovarotene to patients worldwide.”
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Ipsen will pay US$25.00 per share in cash upfront on completion of the transaction, for an initial aggregate consideration of US$1.04 billion, plus deferred payments on the achievement of a future regulatory milestone in the form of a contingent value right (CVR) of US$6.00 per share upon FDA acceptance of the NDA filing for palovarotene for the treatment of MO, representing an additional potential payment of US$263 million. The initial cash consideration represents a premium of 77% to Clementia’s 30-day volume-weighted average stock price.
 
The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen’s existing cash and lines of credit and significantly increases the level of net debt. It is expected to have a limited dilutive impact on Ipsen’s core operating margin for 2019 and 2020 given the costs of the ongoing clinical trials and preparation for the commercial launch of palovarotene. Consequently, Ipsen is updating its 2019 financial objectives and now expects:

Sales growth of greater than 13.0% at current exchange rates (unchanged)
Core operating margin of around 30.0% of net sales (previous guidance of around 31.0% of net sales), excluding other potential investments in pipeline expansion initiatives
The transaction will also be dilutive at the Consolidated Net Income level.
 
The Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the transaction. Completion of the transaction is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2019, subject to satisfaction of all closing conditions. The acquisition will proceed by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement pursuant to the Canada Business Corporations Act and will require, at the special meeting of Clementia shareholders expected to be held on or about April 9, 2019, the approval of at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Clementia’s shareholders present in person or represented by proxy as well as the approval of a majority of the votes cast by Clementia’s disinterested shareholders present in person or represented by proxy. A proxy circular relating to the special meeting of shareholders of Clementia and containing further details regarding the Arrangement and the agreement will be mailed to Clementia’s shareholders and made available on SEDAR and EDGAR.
 
The Board of Directors of Clementia, acting on the unanimous recommendation of the transaction committee comprised of independent directors and after having received an opinion from its financial advisor to the effect that the consideration to be received by Clementia shareholders pursuant to the plan of arrangement is fair from a financial point of view, has unanimously approved the arrangement. OrbiMed Private Investments IV, LP, Clementia’s largest shareholder with approximately 27.5% of Clementia’s total shares outstanding (on a non‑diluted basis) as of the date hereof, has entered into a support and voting agreement with Ipsen pursuant to which it has agreed to vote its Clementia shares in favor of the transaction. In addition, directors and officers of Clementia holding an aggregate of approximately 3.2% of the Clementia shares (on a non‑diluted basis) as of the date hereof have entered into support and voting agreements with Ipsen.
 
In addition to shareholders’ and court approval, the arrangement is also subject to other customary conditions. The arrangement agreement is subject to customary “fiduciary out” provisions, and a right in favor of Ipsen to match any superior proposal. A termination fee is payable to Ipsen in certain specified circumstances, including if it fails to exercise its right to match in the context of a superior proposal supported by Clementia.

About Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) 
FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling disorder characterized by heterotopic ossification (HO), or bone that forms outside the normal skeleton, in muscles, tendons or soft tissue. In FOP, HO progressively restricts movement by locking joints, leading to a cumulative loss of function, progressive disability, and increased risk of early death. FOP is caused by a mutation in the ACVR1 gene, resulting in excess signaling in the bone morphogenetic pathway, a key pathway controlling bone growth and development, by way of both ligand-dependent and independent mechanisms. The prevalence of FOP is approximately 1.3 individuals per million lives, or approximately 9,000 patients globally. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

MO, also called multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is a rare, severely disabling, progressive, chronic disease in which multiple benign bone tumors, also known as osteochondromas (OCs) or osteocartilaginous exostoses, develop on bones. MO is typically diagnosed in early childhood when OCs become visible with a median age at diagnosis of four years. Because of their development around joints, children develop limb deformity and restricted movement as they grow. Today, the only available treatments for MO are surgery and palliative care, and many patients will undergo surgery, some as many as 30 surgeries, before adulthood. MO is estimated to affect 20 individuals per million lives, or approximately 150,000 globally. MO is among the most common inherited bone disorders with multiple family members in multiple generations affected.

10499,ï»¿Amgen Reports In-Favor Uphold of its Two Patents for Repatha from Delaware Jury,Jury Upholds Amgen's Patents On Repatha (evolocumab),"Amgen receives in-favor upholding validity for Repatha from Delaware Jury, with two out of five asserted claims based on its patents meeting the legal requirements of written description and enablement
 In Mar,2016 Sanofi and Regeneron admitted infringement of Amgen’s patents, regaining Amgen with two patents of Repatha but was overturned on appeal in the US District Court for the District of Delaware
 Sanofi and Regeneron plans to file appeal to the Court of Appeals, in addition to the District Court for overturning the jury’s verdict with the onset of new trial 
 Repatha (evolocumab) is mAb inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and is approved in 60 countries including the US, Japan, Canada & EU","THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., – Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that a Delawarejury delivered a verdict in Amgen’s favor upholding the validity of two Amgen patents related to PCSK9 antibodies. These patents describe and claim antibodies, like Amgen’s innovative Repatha® (evolocumab) product, that bind to a specific region on PCSK9 and reduce LDL-C levels in the body. This verdict follows a previous trial in March 2016 where Sanofi and Regeneron admitted infringement of Amgen’s patents and where a prior jury also upheld the validity of Amgen’s patents. The prior jury decision was partially reversed on appeal and the case was remanded to the district court for a new trial on two validity issues. In today’s verdict, the jury found that the Amgen patents meet the legal requirements of written description and enablement.
“Today’s decision protects intellectual property which is essential to innovators who are bringing forward new medicines for patients with serious diseases. Amgen scientists discovered and developed Repatha, which can play a key role in the fight against cardiovascular disease,” said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer at Amgen. “We are thankful that the jury weighed the evidence carefully and recognized the validity of Amgen’s patents.”
Today’s decision follows recent decisions in the European Patent Office and the Japanese Patent Office which also rejected challenges to the validity of Amgen’s PCSK9 antibody patents brought by Sanofi, Regeneron and other potential competitors. Amgen is seeking to enforce these patents in the national courts in Europe and Japan against Sanofi and Regeneron.
About Repatha® (evolocumab)
Repatha® (evolocumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.
Repatha is approved in more than 60 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.
Important U.S. Product Information
Repatha is a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) inhibitor antibody indicated:
to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular disease.
as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe), for treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C.
The safety and effectiveness of Repatha have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old or in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.
Important U.S. Safety Information
Contraindication: Repatha is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema have occurred in patients treated with Repatha.
Allergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. angioedema, rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.
Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of patients treated with Repatha and occurring more frequently than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions.
From a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials: Local injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising.
Allergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).
The most common adverse reactions in the Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (>5% of patients treated with Repatha and occurring more frequently than placebo) were: diabetes mellitus (8.8% Repatha, 8.2% placebo), nasopharyngitis (7.8% Repatha, 7.4% placebo), and upper respiratory tract infection (5.1% Repatha, 4.8% placebo).
Among the 16,676 patients without diabetes mellitus at baseline, the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus during the trial was 8.1% in patients assigned to Repatha compared with 7.7% in those assigned to placebo.
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): The adverse reactions that occurred in at least two patients treated with Repatha and more frequently than placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, gastroenteritis, and nasopharyngitis.

 Darzalex (daratumumab) is IgG1k mAb, with broad spectrum cytotoxic activity targeting CD38 and has received two BT designation from FDA as monothx & combination therapy. In Aug,2012 Janssen Biotech collaborated with Genmab to develop and commercialise daratumumab","Company Announcement
Phase III COLUMBA study comparing the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab to the intravenous formulation in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma met both co-primary endpoints
Results show that daratumumab administered subcutaneously was non-inferior in efficacy and pharmacokinetics as compared to daratumumab administered intravenously
Data will be discussed with health authorities to prepare for regulatory filings in support of bringing convenience of subcutaneous daratumumab option to patients
Copenhagen, Denmark; February 25, 2019 – Genmab A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: GEN) announced today topline results from the Phase III COLUMBA study (MMY3012) of subcutaneous (SC) versus intravenous (IV) daratumumab for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The results showed that SC administration of daratumumab co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 is non-inferior to IV administration of daratumumab with regard to the co-primary end points of overall response rate (ORR) and Maximum Trough concentration (Ctrough) of daratumumab on day 1 of the third treatment cycle.
The ORR for patients treated with SC daratumumab was 41.1% (n=263) versus 37.1% in patients treated with IV daratumumab (n= 259). The lower limit of the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the ratio of the two met the specified non-inferiority criterion for this co-primary endpoint. The geometric mean of Ctrough for patients treated with SC daratumumab was 499 mg/mL (n=149) versus 463 mg/mL in patients treated with IV daratumumab (n= 146). The lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of the two met the specified non-inferiority criterion for this co-primary endpoint.
No new safety signals were detected and Janssen Biotech, Inc., which licensed daratumumab from Genmab in 2012, will discuss the potential for a regulatory submission for this formulation with health authorities, and plans to submit the data to an upcoming medical conference and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

 The P-III POLO study results: improvement in PFS (7.4 vs 3.8mos.); @1yr & 2yrs. no disease progression ( 34% & 22% vs 15% & 10%) respectively
 Lynparza (olaparib) is a PARP inhibitor targeted for DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, including BRCA mutations. In 2017, Merck and AstraZeneca collaborated to co-develop and co-commercialize Lynparza globally","Phase III POLO trial met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival
AstraZeneca and MSD’s Lynparza is the first PARP inhibitor to demonstrate
benefit in gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer in a Phase III trial
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced positive results from the Phase III POLO trial.
Results from the trial showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with Lynparza (olaparib) vs. placebo. The safety and tolerability profile of Lynparza was consistent with previous trials.
POLO is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial exploring the efficacy of Lynparza tablets as 1st-line maintenance monotherapy in patients with germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (pancreatic cancer) whose disease has not progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Oncology, said: “This is the first positive Phase III trial of any PARP inhibitor in germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer, a devastating disease with critical unmet need. The results of POLO provide further evidence of the clinical benefit of Lynparza across a variety of BRCA-mutated tumour types. We will discuss these results with global health authorities as soon as possible.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Trials like POLO demonstrate the shared commitment of MSD and AstraZeneca to assess treatments for difficult-to-treat cancers. The clinically-meaningful results of this trial potentially support the value of testing for germline BRCA mutations in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.”
AstraZeneca and MSD plan to present the full data from the trial at a forthcoming medical meeting.
About POLO
POLO is a Phase III randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial of Lynparza tablets (300mg twice daily) as maintenance monotherapy vs. placebo. The trial randomised 154 patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed on 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomised (3:2) to receive Lynparza or placebo until disease progression. The primary endpoint was PFS and key secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to second disease progression, overall response rate, disease control rate and health-related quality of life.
About Lynparza
Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRR), such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.
Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, is approved for multiple indications in advanced ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer and has been used in over 20,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.

About pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic cancer is the 12th most common cancer worldwide,1 with 466,000 new cases in 2018 alone.1 Germline BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer accounts for five to seven percent of all cases globally.2 With the worst survival rate of the most common cancers,3 it is the 4th leading cause of cancer death,4 and less than seven percent of patients survive more than five years after diagnosis.3 Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is difficult, as often there are no symptoms until it is too late.5 Around 80% of patients are diagnosed at the metastatic stage.6
About BRCA mutations
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role in maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.
About the AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

 In H2’19, companies plan for the onset of the trial based on ACTolog IMA101-101 study protocol at MD Anderson Cancer Center to kill cancer cells by blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints
 Tecentriq (atezolizumab) is a mAb inhibiting PD-L1 while blocking its interaction with PD-1 and B7.1 receptor. IMA101 is a P-I candidate based on Immatics’s ACTolog therapy (endogenous T-cell therapy) targeted for multiple advanced/ metastatic solid tumors","Houston, Texas and Tuebingen, Germany, – Immatics today announced a collaboration with Roche to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMA101, Immatics’ investigational autologous cell therapy, in combination with atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ), in patients with solid cancers.
IMA101 is a personalized, multi-targeted investigational immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple advanced/ metastatic solid tumors. IMA101 is based on Immatics’ ACTolog approach, which follows the principle of expanding target-specific endogenous T-cells, a technique pioneered by Cassian Yee, M.D., Professor of Melanoma Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
The combination trial will evaluate potential synergistic effects generated by using the investigational immunotherapies together, as atezolizumab may enhance IMA101’s ability to kill cancer cells by blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints.
The combination clinical trial which is expected to begin later this year under an amendment to the ACTolog®IMA101-101 study protocol (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02876510) will be conducted at MD Anderson, led by Apostolia Tsimberidou, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at MD Anderson.
Stephen Eck, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at Immatics US, Inc., said: “Our innovative ACTolog® process allows us to utilize a patient’s own T cells to generate a targeted approach for treating solid tumors with increased safety and efficacy potential. We are extremely pleased that, in collaboration with our long-term partner, we are now combining this promising personalized cell therapy with atezolizumab.”
 
About ACTolog T-cell therapy
The ACTolog IMA101 phase 1 clinical trial is led by Prof. Apostolia Tsimberidou, Professor at the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and co-funded by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). The ACTolog concept is based on the principle of endogenous T-cell therapy pioneered by Professor Cassian Yee, M.D. Unlike tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, ACTolog T-cell products are generated from peripheral blood cells with defined target selectivity. Utilizing its proprietary antigen discovery platform XPRESIDENT, Immatics has created a warehouse of eight cancer targets. From this warehouse, the most suitable targets for each patient’s tumor are identified by analyzing the tumor biomarkers. Up to four personalized T-cell products are then activated and manufactured for each patient by isolation and enrichment of the patient’s endogenous T cells in vitro. Billions of such activated and specific T cells are then re-infused into the cancer patient to attack the tumor. The ACTolog T-cell products are manufactured at The Evelyn H. Griffin Stem Cell Therapeutics Research Laboratory in collaboration with The University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston (UTHealth).

 The study resulted in low rates of repeat revascularization 1.1%, cardiac death 2.2%, minimal stent thrombosis 0.06% and safe results
 Resolute Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) platform includes Resolute Onyx and Resolute Integrity DES targeted for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease who have de novo chronic total occlusion (CTO)","FDA Approval Allows Interventional Cardiologists Access to Resolute DES Technology to Treat De Novo CTO

DUBLIN – Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its Resolute Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) platform (including the Resolute Onyx(TM) and Resolute Integrity(TM) DES) for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease who have de novo chronic total occlusion (CTO), a complex vessel condition involving complete blockage of a coronary artery. CTO is considered more difficult to treat with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a greater risk of complications.
“Revascularization of CTO presents physicians with many challenges – both regarding procedural technique and tools – given the patient and disease complexity. In part because of these challenges, CTO remains undertreated in interventional cardiology,” said David Kandzari, M.D., director of interventional cardiology and chief scientific officer, Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta, Ga., and principal investigator in the PERSPECTIVE Study, from which data were used to obtain FDA approval. “The newest-generation, thin-strut Resolute Onyx DES, in particular, is well-suited to address the procedural challenges of deliverability and conformability, with now demonstrated excellent early and late safety and efficacy.”
Affecting approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients undergoing routine diagnostic coronary angiography, CTO occurs when there is heavy build-up of atherosclerotic plaque within the artery, one of the complications of coronary artery disease. Currently, approximately 5-7 percent of the patients who are diagnosed with a CTO are able to undergo PCI.
The expanded CTO indication was supported by data from the PERSPECTIVE Study, a single-center, observational study of 183 CTO patients who underwent a stent procedure with the older-generation Resolute Integrity(TM) DES. Results showed that patients treated with the Resolute DES exhibited low rates of repeat revascularization (1.1 percent), cardiac death (2.2 percent) and minimal stent thrombosis (0.6 percent) at one year.
“This expanded indication will allow physicians the option to treat these more complex CTO cases with the Resolute Onyx DES, which has shown strong clinical performance across a variety of vessel sizes and anatomies,” said Dave Moeller, vice president and general manager of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. “Medtronic is committed to helping interventional cardiologists better treat the tough, complex coronary cases that have historically required more invasive treatment options, such coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or open-heart surgery.”
Physicians will have an opportunity to learn more about Resolute Onyx for the treatment of CTO at the Chronic Total Occlusion Summit, an interventional cardiology meeting in New York City, sponsored by the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, with sessions focused on advanced techniques and evidence-based medicine.
Approved in the U.S. in 2017 following Resolute Integrity DES, the newest-generation Resolute Onyx is the first and only DES to feature Core Wire Technology, a unique Medtronic method of stent manufacturing that involves forming a single strand of cobalt alloy wire into a sinusoidal wave to construct a stent. Core Wire Technology enables greater deliverability and conformability to the vessel wall, along with thinner struts while maintaining structural strength. With a size matrix covering 2.0-5.0 mm, physicians can use Resolute Onyx in complex CTO lesions in a broad range of vessel sizes.

— Sarepta to Acquire Myonexus’ Portfolio of Five Gene Therapy Candidates to Treat Distinct Forms of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) —

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., — Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, announced today that it has exercised its option to acquire Myonexus Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing transformative gene therapies for five LGMDs: LGMD2E, LGMD2D, LGMD2B, LGMD2C and LGMD2L. Subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, Sarepta will pay the Myonexus shareholders $165 million.

LGMDs represent a group of distinct genetic neuromuscular diseases with a generally common set of symptoms, including progressive, debilitating weakness and wasting that begins in muscles around the hips and shoulders before progressing to muscles in the arms and legs. Many LGMD sub-types, including the five programs progressing with Myonexus, are seriously life-limiting and often life-ending diseases.

In May 2018, Sarepta and Myonexus entered into an exclusive partnership to develop Myonexus’ five LGMD gene therapy candidates, which target the most severe and common forms of the disease. Three of the programs are in clinical development and two are in the pre-clinical stage and ready to progress into the clinic. As part of the agreement, Sarepta had an exclusive option to acquire Myonexus.

As previously announced, Sarepta will host a webcast and conference call at 8:00 am ET today, February 27, 2019, during which the Company will present results from the first 3-patient cohort of the MYO-101 study in patients with LGMD2E. Details to participate in the call are below.

“The five LGMD gene therapies being developed fit brilliantly with Sarepta’s mission to develop therapies with the potential to rescue the lives of patients with serious life-limiting rare genetic diseases,” said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta. “Our confidence in these programs has come from the fact that our micro-dystrophin gene therapy and the Myonexus programs have much in common, including inventors from Nationwide Children’s Hospital, a shared vector in AAVrh74 and, to date, similar pre-clinical safety data. We are excited to acquire Myonexus, which will allow us to move rapidly to find solutions for LGMD patients and continue to build out and validate our gene therapy engine.”

Mr. Ingram continued, “We would also like to take this opportunity to thank Myonexus and Nationwide Children’s Hospital for their contributions, as it was their dedication and tireless efforts that advanced these programs to where they are today.”

Like Sarepta’s micro-dystrophin program, all five Myonexus LGMD sub-type programs employ the AAVrh74 vector, designed to systemically and robustly deliver treatment to cardiac and skeletal muscle, including the diaphragm, without promiscuously crossing the blood brain barrier, making it an ideal candidate to treat muscle disease. The MHCK7 promoter used in MYO-101, which is also used in the micro-dystrophin program, was chosen for 3 of the 5 LGMD programs because it is generally more productive in muscle than other MCK promoters and it robustly expresses in the heart, which is critically important for patients with LGMD2E, LGMD2B, and LGMD2C, many of whom die from pulmonary or cardiac complications.

“We partnered with Sarepta less than a year ago, as we shared the mutual goal of developing LGMD therapies on behalf of patients with debilitating and fatal disease,” said Michael Triplett, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer, Myonexus. “This acquisition solidifies a commitment to rapidly advance therapies on behalf of patients who currently don’t have treatment options.”

Conference Call Details

The 8:00 a.m. ET conference call presenting the MYO-101 LGMD results may be accessed by dialing (844) 534-7313 for domestic callers and (574) 990-1451 for international callers. The passcode for the call is 1693875. Please specify to the operator that you would like to join the “Sarepta-hosted LGMD Results Call.”

 Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is an SGLT2 inhibitor targeted as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D mellitus","Updated label confirms the well-established efficacy and safety profile for FARXIGA and XIGDUO XR

WILMINGTON, Del.-AstraZeneca today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a label update for FARXIGA® (dapagliflozin) and XIGDUO® XR (dapagliflozin and metformin HCl extended-release) expanding use in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and moderate renal impairment (chronic kidney disease with an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m2). FARXIGA is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. XIGDUO XR is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both dapagliflozin and metformin is appropriate.
The updated labels lower the eGFR threshold to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 from 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, expanding the potential population of patients with T2D and impaired renal function who may benefit from the medicine. FARXIGA and XIGDUO XR are not recommended when the eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and remains contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), end-stage renal disease, or in patients on dialysis.
The updates were based on the results of DERIVE, a Phase 3 study of patients with inadequately controlled T2D (HbA1c 7.0%-11.0%) and an eGFR of 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 who received either FARXIGA (dapagliflozin 10 mg) or placebo over 24 weeks. At Week 24, FARXIGA (dapagliflozin 10 mg) provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared with placebo. The safety profile following a treatment duration of 24 weeks was similar to that seen in the overall FARXIGA (dapagliflozin) clinical trial program.
Jim McDermott, PhD., Vice President, US Medical Affairs, Diabetes at AstraZeneca, said: “The DERIVE study, which further confirmed the well-established efficacy and safety profile for FARXIGA and XIGDUO XR, has resulted in important label changes for patients with type 2 diabetes that enable a broader population with impaired renal function to potentially benefit from these important treatment options.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 30.3 million people in the US have diabetes, and T2D accounts for 90% to 95% of all diabetes cases. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease, and approximately 1 in 4 adults with diabetes has kidney disease.
Indication and Limitations of Use for FARXIGA® (dapagliflozin)
FARXIGA is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
FARXIGA is not recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Important Safety Information for FARXIGA® (dapagliflozin)
Contraindications
Prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to FARXIGA
Severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), end-stage renal disease, or patients on dialysis
Warnings and Precautions

Hypotension: FARXIGA causes intravascular volume contraction, and symptomatic hypotension can occur. Assess and correct volume status before initiating FARXIGA in patients with impaired renal function, elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics. Monitor for hypotension
Ketoacidosis has been reported in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes receiving FARXIGA. Some cases were fatal. Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue FARXIGA, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating FARXIGA, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients on FARXIGA may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation in situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis
Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function: FARXIGA causes intravascular volume contraction and renal impairment, with reports of acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization and dialysis. Consider temporarily discontinuing in settings of reduced oral intake or fluid losses. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue and promptly treat.
FARXIGA increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function may be more susceptible to these changes. Before initiating FARXIGA, evaluate renal function and monitor periodically. FARXIGA is not recommended when the eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2
Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk for urinary tract infections [UTIs] and serious UTIs have been reported with FARXIGA. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of UTIs and treat promptly
Hypoglycemia: FARXIGA can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when coadministered with insulin and insulin secretagogues. Consider lowering the dose of these agents when coadministered with FARXIGA
Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier’s Gangrene): Rare but serious, life-threatening cases have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors including FARXIGA. Cases have been reported in females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, surgeries, and death. Assess patients presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise. If suspected, institute prompt treatment and discontinue FARXIGA.
Genital Mycotic Infections: FARXIGA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections, particularly in patients with prior genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat appropriately
Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) occur with FARXIGA. Monitor LDL-C and treat per standard of care
Bladder cancer: An imbalance in bladder cancers was observed in clinical trials. There were too few cases to determine whether the emergence of these events is related to FARXIGA, and insufficient data to determine whether FARXIGA has an effect on pre-existing bladder tumors. FARXIGA should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer. Use with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer
Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with FARXIGA
Adverse Reactions
In a pool of 12 placebo-controlled studies, the most common adverse reactions (≥5%) associated with FARXIGA 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo respectively were female genital mycotic infections (8.4% vs 6.9% vs 1.5%), nasopharyngitis (6.6% vs 6.3% vs 6.2%), and urinary tract infections (5.7% vs 4.3% vs 3.7%).
Use in Specific Populations

Pregnancy: Advise females of potential risk to a fetus especially during the second and third trimesters.
Lactation: FARXIGA is not recommended when breastfeeding.
Please see accompanying US Full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for FARXIGA.
Indication and Limitations of Use for XIGDUO® XR (dapagliflozin and metformin HCl extended-release)
XIGDUO XR is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both dapagliflozin and metformin is appropriate.
XIGDUO XR is not recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis.
Important Safety Information for XIGDUO® XR (dapagliflozin and metformin HCl extended-release)
WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS
Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Symptoms included malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL.
Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs, age >65 years old, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information.
If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue XIGDUO XR and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended.

10564,Janssen's Tremfya (guselkumab) Receives FDA's Approval for Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis in Adults,Janssen Announces U.S. FDA Approval of Novel TREMFYA (guselkumab) One-Press Patient-controlled Injector for Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"The approval is based on P-III study results assessing Tremfya (guselkumab, 100mg) vs PBO in 78 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis
 P-III ORION study: IGA score of 0/1 or PASI 90 @16wks. (81%, 76% vs 0%,0%); IGA score of 0 @16 wk (56% vs 0%); PASI 100 response @16 wks (50% vs 0%)
 Tremfya (guselkumab,100mg, SC) is a mAb offering one-press patient-controlled injector inhibiting interleukin (IL)-23, evaluated in two P-III trials for active psoriatic arthritis & Crohn’s disease and is approved in the US, EU, Canada & Japan for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults","The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TREMFYA One-Press, a single-dose, patient-controlled injector for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. TREMFYA (guselkumab) is the first FDA-approved medication of its kind to offer the One-Press patient-controlled injector. One-Press was designed with patients in mind: it fits comfortably in the hand and offers a controlled injection that hides the needle throughout the process. TREMFYA is administered as a 100 mg subcutaneous injection once every 8 weeks, after starter doses at weeks 0 and 4. TREMFYA is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician, and patients may self-inject with TREMFYA One-Press after physician approval and proper training. TREMFYA One-Press is now available in the U.S.
At times, patients living with plaque psoriasis may struggle with self-administering treatments due to a number of factors, including needle phobia. In the Phase 3, multicenter and randomized ORION study, patient experience with One-Press was assessed through a validated Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ), which evaluated patient experience at weeks 0, 4 and 12 on a scale of 0 (worst) to 10 (best) across six domains (feelings about injections, self-image, self-confidence, pain and skin reactions during or after the injection, ease of use of the self-injection device and satisfaction with self-injection). The mean score for “Satisfaction with Self Injection” was 9.18 (with 10 indicating “Very Satisfied”) and the mean score for “Ease of Use” was 9.24 (with 10 indicating “Very Easy”).
The efficacy and safety of TREMFYA administered with One-Press in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis was also evaluated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled ORION study. In the study, a greater proportion of patients in the TREMFYA group achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 or a PASI 90 response at week 16 (81 percent and 76 percent, respectively) than in the placebo group (0 percent for both endpoints). The proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 at week 16 was higher in the TREMFYA group compared to the placebo group (56 percent vs. 0 percent). The proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 100 response at week 16 was higher in the TREMFYA group compared to the placebo group (50 percent vs. 0 percent). The majority of injection-site reaction symptoms with One-Press were mild and transient in nature.1
“The results of the ORION study showed the administration of TREMFYA with One-Press was safe and effective, providing patients with a new, more convenient way to inject their treatment,” said Laura Ferris, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor, Department of Dermatology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center*. “These findings are also exciting as they demonstrated that treatment with TREMFYA helped half the patients achieve complete clearance with a PASI 100 response at week 16.”
The design of One-Press allows patients to control the rate and pressure of their injection. A soft click indicates when administration is complete resulting in nearly 99 percent of patients reporting a successful first injection;1 One-Press also includes a safety system that protects the needle after use. After three injections, patients still reported favorable outcomes with the usability of the One-Press device.1
“Patients living with plaque psoriasis often struggle with a conventional syringe when administering treatment,” said Newman Yeilding, M.D., Head of Immunology Development, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “With the approval of One-Press, patients now have the option to self-administer TREMFYA with a novel device that is both simple and intuitive to use.”
About ORION
ORION is a Phase 3 study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of TREMFYA® (guselkumab) administered with the One-Press injector. In this study, 78 patients were randomized to receive either TREMFYA (100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter) [n=62], or placebo [n=16]. Baseline characteristics for patients were comparable to those observed in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 0/1 and the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 90 response at Week 16, the same as VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 at week 16 and the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 100 response at week 16.
About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory disorder that results in the overproduction of skin cells, characterized by raised, inflamed, red lesions, or plaques, which can cause physical pain and itching.2 It is estimated that more than 7.5 million Americans live with the disease.3 Approximately 80 percent of those affected with psoriasis have mild to moderate disease, while 20 percent have moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.2
About TREMFYA® (guselkumab)
TREMFYA® is a human monoclonal antibody developed by Janssen that selectively blocks the protein interleukin (IL)-23 and is approved in the U.S., Canada, European Union, Japan and a number of other countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet or UV light). Ongoing trials include: Two Phase 3 programs evaluating TREMFYA in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis and a Phase 3 program in Crohn’s disease.
The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson maintain exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA®.

Galafold is a capsule taken once every other day, at the same time of day. The FDA has approved Galafold for 348 amenable GLA variants. Galafold is the first oral medicine for Fabry disease, and the first new therapy approved to treat Fabry disease in the United States in more than 15 years.
John F. Crowley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., stated, “This FDA approval of Galafold is a transformative moment for people in the U.S. living with Fabry disease, as it gives adult patients with amenable GLA variants a new treatment option for the first time in more than 15 years. The Fabry disease community has had an active voice in every stage of development of this medicine. We are grateful to this wonderful and passionate community, particularly the patients and physicians who have made this research possible through their participation in the clinical trials, as well as to the U.S. regulators and our ever-persistent and dedicated Amicus team. This achievement highlights our company’s mission, which is focused on transforming the lives of people living with rare diseases. With our new and highly motivated U.S. leadership team, we are poised to make Galafold available to as many appropriate patients as possible.”
Fabry disease is a rare, progressive genetic disorder characterized by a defective gene (GLA) that causes an enzyme deficiency. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down disease substrate that, when deficient in patients with Fabry disease, builds up in the kidneys, which is one of the organ systems impacted by Fabry disease. In the U.S., it is estimated that more than 3,000 people are living with Fabry disease, and an estimated more than 50 percent of these diagnosed patients are currently untreated. Globally, it is estimated that 35 to 50 percent of Fabry disease patients may have an amenable GLA variant.
“People with rare diseases often have limited treatment options, so research leading to new therapies is critical. As a physician and researcher, I treated the first patient ever to receive Galafold in a clinical trial. Today, many years later, I am pleased that more patients will have access to this precision medicine,” said Raphael Schiffmann, M.D., M.H.Sc., Director, Baylor Scott & White Research Institute, Kimberly H. Courtwright and Joseph W. Summers Institute of Metabolic Disease – Dallas.
The FDA approval was based on data from a Phase 3 pivotal Fabry disease study in treatment-naïve patients (Study 011, or FACETS), which demonstrated the efficacy of Galafold, including a reduction in the amount of damaging disease substrate accumulated in the kidney capillaries. The most common side effects related to Galafold were headache, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, nausea and pyrexia.
“Today is a long-awaited day of celebration for all of us living with and advocating for people with Fabry disease, especially those who have participated in the development of Galafold in the United States,” said Jack Johnson, Founder and Executive Director, Fabry Support & Information Group. “With the FDA approval of Galafold, certain members of the U.S. Fabry disease patient community finally have a second treatment option. Through their unwavering commitment and scientific innovation, Amicus has provided a much-needed new treatment option for many Fabry patients.”
Amicus Therapeutics will launch Galafold immediately, and will begin shipping to a limited distribution network in the coming week. Amicus Assist, a service that will provide product assistance and support to patients to help gain access to Amicus Therapeutics’ medications, will also be initiated immediately; for more information please call +1-833-AMICUS-A (+1-833-264-2872).

10630,Shire's Motegrity (prucalopride) Receives FDA Approval for Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) in Adults,"FDA approves Shire’s Motegrity (prucalopride), the only serotonin-4 receptor agonist for adults with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC)","The approval is based on six trials assessing Motegrity vs PBO in 2,484 patients with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) in adults
 P-III study results: normalization of BM frequency (19-38% vs 10-20%); no increase in the risk of MACE events
 Motegrity (prucalopride) is a qd serotonin-4 receptor agonist (5-HT4) with its expected launch in 2019 in the US","FDA approves Shire’s Motegrity (prucalopride), the only serotonin-4 receptor agonist for adults with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC)

Unlike other prescription CIC treatments, Motegrity works differently by enhancing natural movements of the colon muscle, known as peristalsis1,2
Motegrity was shown to help normalize complete spontaneous bowel movement frequency (avg. ≥3 CSBMs/week over 12 weeks) across five of six controlled clinical studies1
Cambridge, Mass. – – Shire plc (LSE: SHP, NASDAQ: SHPG) has announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Motegrity™ (prucalopride), a once-daily, oral treatment option for adults with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC).1
Motegrity, a selective serotonin-4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist, provides a different class of treatment for CIC that works by enhancing colonic peristalsis to increase bowel motility.1-3 Motegrity is expected to launch in 2019 in the United States, where an estimated 35 million adults are living with CIC.4,5* While not all patients may be right for treatment, Motegrity represents an important new option.
“The approval of Motegrity marks a new day in the treatment of CIC,” said Howard Mayer, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Shire. “This significant milestone reinforces our continued commitment to the GI community and advances our goal of addressing the unmet need of patients suffering from rare, specialized and common GI conditions.”
The efficacy of once-daily treatment with Motegrity was evaluated in six double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical studies lasting 12 weeks (studies 1-5) or 24 weeks (study 6).1 Of the 2,484 patients, most were female (76%) and Caucasian (76%), with an average age of 47 (+/- 16 years).1
“As a gastroenterologist, it’s important for me to help patients with CIC find a treatment that works well for them,” said Brooks Cash, M.D., Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. “It’s exciting to be able to now offer my patients a new treatment option that addresses colonic peristalsis.”
During studies, significantly more patients taking Motegrity achieved the primary endpoint (an average of ≥3 complete spontaneous bowel movements [CSBMs] per week over 12 weeks, considered normalization of BM frequency) than those in the placebo group (19-38% Motegrity ≤2 mg vs. 10-20% placebo) across five of six trials. A rapid response was seen with Motegrity as early as week 1, with improvements maintained throughout 12 weeks of treatment.1 The FDA has requested that Shire conduct five post-marketing studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of Motegrity in pediatric patients with CIC (6 months old to less than 18 years of age) and pregnant and lactating women with CIC treated with Motegrity.6
Motegrity is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to Motegrity. Reactions include dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema have been observed. Motegrity is also contraindicated in patients with intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, obstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and toxic megacolon/megarectum.1
In clinical trials, suicides, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation have been reported. A causal association between treatment with Motegrity and an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Monitor all patients treated with Motegrity for persistent worsening of depression or the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Counsel patients, their caregivers, and family members of patients to be aware of any unusual changes in mood or behavior and alert the healthcare provider. Instruct patients to discontinue Motegrity immediately and contact their healthcare provider if they experience any of these symptoms.1
Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence and fatigue.1 Overall, discontinuation due to adverse events was low (5% Motegrity 2 mg once daily; 3% placebo). If reported, adverse events of diarrhea or headache typically resolved within a few days.1 In addition, cardiovascular safety was evaluated in a MACE† (major adverse cardiovascular events) analysis of the double-blind, placebo-controlled and open-label studies. It was also assessed in a retrospective observational study, which demonstrated no increase in the risk of MACE† with Motegrity relative to polyethylene glycol (PEG).1
CIC is a common condition affecting roughly 14% of the adult population.4,5 Symptoms can range from straining and bloating, to infrequent, or incomplete bowel movements.7 While “idiopathic” by definition (meaning the exact cause is not known), it is believed that CIC may be caused by insufficient movement of the colon muscle.7

10634,ï»¿Catalyst's Firdapse (amifampridine) Receives FDA's Approval for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome,"FDA approves first treatment for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder","The approval is based on two clinical trial results assessing Firdapse vs PBO in 64 patients with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
 The study measured Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (assessing muscle weakness) and demonstrated overall impression having effective results vs PBO
 Firdapse (amifampridine) is an EU approved drug in Dec 2009, indicated for symptomatic treatment of adults with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) and has also received FDA’s PT, BT & ODD","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Firdapse (amifampridine) tablets for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in adults. LEMS is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the connection between nerves and muscles and causes weakness and other symptoms in affected patients. This is the first FDA approval of a treatment for LEMS.
“There has been a long-standing need for a treatment for this rare disorder,” said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Patients with LEMS have significant weakness and fatigue that can often cause great difficulties with daily activities.”
In people with LEMS, the body’s own immune system attacks the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and muscles) and disrupts the ability of nerve cells to send signals to muscle cells. LEMS may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, but more commonly occurs in patients with cancer such as small cell lung cancer, where its onset precedes or coincides with the diagnosis of cancer. The prevalence of LEMS is estimated to be three per million individuals worldwide.
The efficacy of Firdapse was studied in two clinical trials that together included 64 adult patients who received Firdapse or placebo. The studies measured the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (a 13-item physician-rated categorical scale assessing muscle weakness) and the Subject Global Impression (a seven-point scale on which patients rated their overall impression of the effects of the study treatment on their physical well-being). For both measures, the patients receiving Firdapse experienced a greater benefit than those on placebo.
The most common side effects experienced by patients in the clinical trials were burning or prickling sensation (paresthesia), upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, elevated liver enzymes, back pain, hypertension and muscle spasms. Seizures have been observed in patients without a history of seizures. Patients should inform their health care provider immediately if they have signs of hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, hives, itching, fever, swelling or trouble breathing.
The FDA granted this application Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. Firdapse also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.
The FDA granted the approval of Firdapse to Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

 P-III HannaH, SafeHER, PrefHER study: pCR (absence of invasive cancer cells in breast) (45.4% vs 40.7%); mean level of trastuzumab (78.7mcg/ml vs 57mcg/ml); no new safety signals, tolerable
 Herceptin Hylecta (trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk, SC) based on Halozyme’s Enhanze drug delivery technology targeted for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer","Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Herceptin Hylecta™ (trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk) for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection for the treatment of certain people with HER2-positive early breast cancer (node-positive, or node-negative and ER/PR-negative or with one high-risk feature) in combination with chemotherapy and HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel or alone in people who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease.[1] This new treatment includes the same monoclonal antibody as intravenous Herceptin® (trastuzumab) in combination with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20, an enzyme that helps to deliver trastuzumab under the skin. Herceptin Hylecta is a ready-to-use formulation that can be administered in two to five minutes, compared to 30 to 90 minutes for intravenous Herceptin.[2]
“Over the past 20 years, Herceptin has significantly advanced treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer,” said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “The approval of Herceptin Hylecta gives physicians and patients in the United States a new option to select treatment based on individual needs and preferences.”
The FDA approval is based on results from three clinical studies in HER2-positive early breast cancer:[1]
The phase III HannaH study compared neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery) Herceptin Hylecta to intravenous Herceptin, both in combination with chemotherapy. Subcutaneous administration of Herceptin Hylecta resulted in non-inferior levels of trastuzumab in the blood (pharmacokinetics) and non-inferior clinical efficacy (pathological complete response rate; pCR) compared to intravenous Herceptin.[1]
The phase III SafeHER study of adjuvant Herceptin Hylecta identified no new safety signals, with safety and tolerability consistent with the known safety profiles of intravenous Herceptin and Herceptin Hylecta.[1]
The PrefHER patient preference study of adjuvant Herceptin Hylecta followed by intravenous Herceptin, or the reverse sequence, found the majority (86%) of people preferred Herceptin Hylecta over intravenous Herceptin.[1]
The most common side effects in people receiving Herceptin Hylecta for early breast cancer were feeling tired, joint pain, diarrhoea, injection site reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, muscle pain, nausea, headache, swelling, flushing, fever, cough, and pain in extremity.[1]

About Herceptin Hylecta
Herceptin Hylecta (subcutaneous Herceptin) is a combination of trastuzumab and Halozyme Therapeutics’ Enhanze® drug delivery technology. Trastuzumab is the same monoclonal antibody in intravenous Herceptin that targets the HER2 receptor, a protein found on the outside of many normal cells and in high quantities on the outside of cancer cells in HER2-positive cancers.[3] Herceptin is designed to block HER2 signalling that is believed to play a role in tumour growth and survival.[4] Binding of Herceptin to HER2 may also signal the body’s immune system to destroy the cancer cells.[4] Halozyme’s Enhanze technology is based on a proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), an enzyme that temporarily degrades hyaluronan, a glycosaminoglycan or chain of natural sugars in the body, to aid in the dispersion and absorption of other injected therapeutic drugs.
The subcutaneous formulation of Herceptin was first approved in Europe in 2013 and is now approved in 100 countries worldwide.

 The study resulted in early treatment allow 100% progressive gains in motor function, reduction in mortality in infants, 88% able to walk and safe and efficacious profile
 Spinraza (nusinersen) is antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) developed using Ionis’ antisense technology delivered using intrathecal injection directly to CSF targeted to treat SMA and is approved in 40 countries for SMA","SPINRAZA is the standard of care for treating infants, children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease

SPINRAZA was approved under the China National Medical Products Association priority review process evaluating therapies with urgent clinical needs

Over 6,600 patients have been treated with SPINRAZA in more than 40 countries and have been followed for up to six years

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.,(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that SPINRAZA (nusinersen) has been approved by the China National Medical Products Association (NMPA) for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), expanding the company’s presence in China. Approximately 95 percent of all SMA cases are 5q SMA, making it the most common form of the disease. SPINRAZA is the first approved treatment in China for SMA, a leading genetic cause of death in infants that is marked by progressive, debilitating muscle weakness.1

The NMPA evaluation of SPINRAZA was based on the largest clinical data set currently available in SMA, including more than 300 patients with infantile and later-onset SMA. A global Biogen study, NURTURE, demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in treating patients pre-symptomatically. The study included infants up to six weeks of age at time of first dose, who were genetically diagnosed with SMA and had not experienced any symptoms by the time of first dose. The NURTURE data showed that earlier treatment of pre-symptomatic infants allows for progressive gains in motor function and milestones that are more consistent with normal development.
“We commend China’s regulatory authorities for their expedited review and approval of SPINRAZA, the first and only treatment for SMA,” said Michel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen. “SMA is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality and a major cause of disability in adults. We are working diligently with the government agencies, patient groups and physicians who all have an incredible sense of urgency to expand access to a broad group of patients in China.”
In May 2018 the China National Health Commission included SMA in the country’s first national list of rare diseases, which was developed to support diagnosis and treatment of rare conditions. In July 2018 the NMPA announced a priority review process that would evaluate innovative treatments using clinical evidence from trials conducted in advanced markets. In September 2018 SPINRAZA was accepted by the NMPA for priority review approval as a clinically urgent new drug that has been approved overseas for a rare disease.
“This is great news. SPINRAZA has the largest clinical data set in SMA with findings that demonstrate its efficacy and safety in a broad range of individuals, including significant improvements in motor development and reduction in mortality in infants,” said Professor Yi Wang, head of the National Rare Diseases Group of Chinese Pediatrics Society, Chinese Medical Association. “These improvements provide new hope to the community where there previously were no approved treatments. As the first approved therapy for SMA in China, SPINRAZA is a breakthrough within the rare disease space. The clinical treatment for SMA is entering a new historic stage.”
About SPINRAZA® (nusinersen)2-5
SPINRAZA is the first and only approved medicine for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and is currently available in more than 40 countries. As of December 31, 2018 over 6,600 individuals with SMA are being treated with SPINRAZA worldwide, based on patients across the post-marketing setting, Expanded Access Program (EAP) and clinical trial participants.
SPINRAZA is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) developed using Ionis’ proprietary antisense technology that is designed to treat the root cause of SMA. SPINRAZA alters the splicing of SMN2 pre-mRNA in order to increase production of full-length SMN protein. ASOs are short synthetic strings of nucleotides designed to selectively bind to target RNA and regulate gene expression. Through use of this technology, SPINRAZA has been shown to increase the amount of full-length SMN protein in individuals with SMA. SPINRAZA is administered via intrathecal injection, which delivers therapies directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the spinal cord, where motor neurons degenerate in individuals with SMA due to insufficient levels of SMN protein.
In the clinical trial program, SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile. The most common adverse reactions that occurred in the SPINRAZA group were respiratory infection and constipation. Serious adverse reactions of atelectasis were more frequent in SPINRAZA-treated patients. Coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia, including acute severe thrombocytopenia, have been observed after administration of some ASOs. Individuals may be at increased risk of bleeding complications. Renal toxicity has been observed after administration of some ASOs. SPINRAZA is present in and excreted by the kidney.
Biogen licensed the global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPINRAZA from Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: IONS), a leader in antisense therapeutics. Biogen and Ionis conducted an innovative clinical development program, the largest of its kind in SMA, that moved SPINRAZA from its first dose in humans in 2011 to its first regulatory approval in five years.
About the SPINRAZA Clinical Program
NURTURE is an ongoing, open-label study of infants up to six weeks of age at time of first dose, who were genetically diagnosed with SMA and had not experienced any symptoms by the time of first dose. Data presented at the World Muscle Society in October 2018 demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in treating patients pre-symptomatically. In that analysis, all NURTURE study participants were alive and did not require permanent ventilation, in contrast to natural history of SMA. Study participants achieved motor milestones with 100 percent sitting independently and 88 percent able to walk. All NURTURE study participants were 14 months or older at the time of the analysis. Participants included infants with two copies of the SMN2 gene (n=15) who are likely to develop a fatal, early-onset form of SMA known as Type 1, and infants with three copies of the SMN2 gene (n=10) who typically develop SMA Type 2 or 3. People living with SMA Types 2 and 3 may never be able to walk or will lose that ability over time. No new safety concerns were identified.
The ENDEAR study was a thirteen-month, international, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled study of 121 patients with infantile-onset SMA (most likely to develop Type 1). Results from the pivotal study, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, evaluated the efficacy and safety in patients that onset of signs and symptoms of SMA before six months of age. Patients treated with SPINRAZA in the ENDEAR study achieved clinically meaningful improvement in achievement of motor milestones compared to untreated study participants with 51 percent vs. 0 percent demonstrating Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination section 2 (HINE-2) motor milestone response, an assessment which evaluates eight motor-milestone categories, based on the defined criteria.
CHERISH was a fifteen-month, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study investigating SPINRAZA in 126 non-ambulatory patients with later-onset SMA (most likely to develop SMA Type 2 or 3). Patients included had onset of signs and symptoms at greater than 6 months of age, and an age of 2 to 12 years at screening. The final analysis of CHERISH data found that children receiving SPINRAZA experienced a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in motor function compared to those who did not receive treatment with a treatment difference of 4.9 points on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile in the study.
About SMA6
SMA is a rare, genetic, neuromuscular disease that is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. About 1 in 10,000 live births have a diagnosis of SMA. Ultimately, individuals with SMA can lose the ability to walk and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, such as breathing and swallowing, which results in significant healthcare intervention and caregiver assistance. Left untreated, the majority of infants with the most severe form of the disease (Type 1) do not live beyond their second birthday without respiratory intervention. People with childhood or adult onset SMA (Type 2 or 3) produce greater amounts of SMN protein resulting in less severe, but still life-altering forms of the disease.2
Due to a deletion of, or mutation in, the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein an individual has. People with Type 1 SMA, the form that requires the most intensive and supportive care, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or typically live beyond two years without respiratory support. People with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of SMA.2

 Daurismo (glasdegib) is an oral qd Hedgehog pathway inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML in adult patients who are >75 years","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — AnTolRx, Inc., a private biotechnology company and a leader in immune tolerance, today announced that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) has exercised the option granted under a June 2016 agreement to license an immune tolerance therapy from AnTolRx’s Type 1 diabetes research program.

The option gives Pfizer exclusive rights to pursue development of AnTolRx’s lead immunotherapeutic for Type 1 diabetes. Pfizer will be responsible for any further optimization, development and potential commercialization. AnTolRx will receive an upfront payment and is eligible to receive potential milestone and royalty payments from Pfizer.

AnTolRx is aiming to develop targeted antigen-specific therapies, based upon immune tolerance induction rather than broader immune suppression, for several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

“We are delighted to confirm that the discovery phase of the program at AnTolRx has transitioned successfully to Pfizer for further development of our antigen-specific immunotherapy for Type 1 diabetes,” said Mark Carthy, CEO of AnTolRx.

AnTolRx is focused on building on the pioneering immunoregulatory research of Francisco Quintana, a professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, as well as the company’s scientific founder and Chief Scientific Advisor.

“This agreement with Pfizer supports the industry’s mounting interest in developing therapeutics based upon antigen-specific tolerance and underscores its potential to deliver innovative new medicines for patients with immunological diseases,” said Professor Quintana.

Michael Vincent, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer said, “At Pfizer’s Immunology and Inflammation Research Unit, our ultimate goal is to advance potential cures for autoimmune disease, and we see AnTolRx’s approach to re-educate the immune response as one potentially promising strategy to achieve that goal for patients.”

JDRF, the world’s leading funder of Type 1 diabetes research and long-time supporter of Quintana’s work, applauded the transition. “There is an urgent need for disease-modifying Type 1 diabetes immunotherapies to slow down the autoimmune process and delay or block progression to symptomatic insulin-dependent diabetes,” said JDRF President and CEO Derek Rapp.

“The AnTolRx story is an excellent example of a research foundation, an academic institution, a biotech company and a major pharmaceutical company working together to advance promising translational research with the hope that it can potentially deliver key breakthroughs for the Type 1 diabetes community,” Rapp said.

About T1D
T1D is a chronic, life-threatening autoimmune disease that can strike children and adults at any age. It requires rigorous 24/7 monitoring of blood glucose levels—even overnight—to avoid potentially lethal highs and lows in blood sugar, as well as other devastating complications like kidney, eye and nerve diseases. While T1D’s causes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved. Its onset is sudden and is not related to diet or lifestyle. In T1D, the body’s immune system destroys cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, meaning the body produces little to no insulin to regulate blood sugar and get energy from food. There is nothing you can do to prevent T1D, and—at present—nothing you can do to get rid of it.

About AnTolRx

AnTolRx is a Cambridge, Mass.-based research and development biotechnology company focused on immune tolerance with active programs in Type 1 Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Celiac Disease, and various dermatology diseases including Pemphigus Vulgaris. AnTolRx’s antigen-specific immune tolerance technology also has potential to block immune responses to foreign proteins, certain therapeutic recombinant proteins and viral gene therapy products. AnTolRx’s proprietary formulation co-delivers an immunomodulatory aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist with specific antigens to generate disease specific Tregs to treat immunological disorders. The AnTolRx technology expects to overcome safety concerns of products that generate general immune suppression. AnTolRx expects to nominate candidates to treat additional immune disorders in 2019. AnTolRx, Inc. was founded in 2016 by Professor Francisco Quintana, Dr. Satish Jindal and Mark Carthy with initial equity investment from Pfizer Inc., JDRF International and Orion Equity Partners, LLC.

10660,Sobi's Gamifant (emapalumab) Receives FDA Approval for Primary Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH),"FDA approves Gamifant (emapalumab), the first and only treatment for primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)","The approval is based on P-II/III (NCT01818492) study results assessing Gamifant IV in patients with primary HLH, evaluating its safety, efficacy and tolerability
 The P-II/III study resulted in meeting 1EPs with meaningful and significant overall response and 70% achieved HSCT 
 Gamifant (emapalumab) IV is a mAb with its directed usage of over one hour twice per week, binds to neutralizes interferon gamma (IFNy) and has also received ODD & PRIME designation from EMA","Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi™) (STO: SOBI), an international biopharmaceutical company dedicated to rare diseases, and Novimmune SA, a Swiss biotech company, today announce that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Gamifant® (emapalumab-lzsg), an interferon gamma (IFNγ) blocking antibody for the treatment of paediatric (new born and older) and adult patients with primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with refractory, recurrent or progressive disease or intolerance to conventional HLH therapy. Primary HLH is an ultra-rare syndrome of hyperinflammation with high morbidity and mortality and for which there was previously no approved drug. Gamifant represents a major advance in the treatment of these patients through a targeted mode of action.
“The FDA approval of Gamifant marks an important milestone in Sobi’s vision to bring transformative treatments to patients with a high medical need,” says Sobi President and CEO Guido Oelkers. “Gamifant will add significant strength to Sobi’s Immunology franchise, along with Kineret and the recent acquisition of the US rights to Synagis®. We would like to acknowledge the excellent work done by Novimmune to develop and bring this important treatment to approval and Sobi will now focus on ensuring a successful commercialisation of Gamifant for the benefit of HLH patients in the US.”
The FDA approval is based on data from the pivotal phase 2/3 study which enrolled patients with primary HLH. The study primary endpoint in patients with either refractory, recurrent, or progressive disease during conventional HLH therapy or who were intolerant of conventional HLH therapy was achieved, with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant proportion of patients demonstrating an overall response at the end of treatment. In addition, 70 per cent of patients proceeded to haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20 per cent) were infections, hypertension, infusion-related reactions and fever. Results from the pivotal study will be presented at forthcoming international meetings.
Milan Zdravkovic, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research & Development at Sobi, says: “Primary HLH is a very rare disease with significant morbidity and mortality. The approval of Gamifant as the first treatment for primary HLH is a significant step in our journey of helping these patients.”
“We are extremely glad to make a new medicine available for patients suffering from primary HLH,” says Cristina de Min, Chief Medical Officer at Novimmune. “Gamifant is the first drug specifically targeted to neutralise IFNγ. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the patients, families and the healthcare providers who participated in the emapalumab clinical study and whose efforts helped make today’s approval possible. We would also like to thank the FDA for their continuous support during emapalumab development. Based on the clinical validation of this new target, additional clinical studies are ongoing or being planned with emapalumab in diseases for which IFNγ is considered pathogenic.”
“HLH is a disorder of immune regulation in which many cytokines are deranged, but interferon gamma appears to play a critical role. While we have long understood the pivotal role of this cytokine in HLH, until emapalumab’s approval we did not have a medicine that could specifically hit this target,” says Michael Jordan, MD, a physician-scientist in the division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center HLH Center of Excellence, and Primary Investigator in the emapalumab clinical trial. “Emapalumab represents an entirely new approach to treating primary HLH and helping these very sick patients reach haematopoietic stem cell transplant.”
In the US, Gamifant was reviewed under Priority Review and received Orphan Drug Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA. Novimmune is eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) with the approval. In Europe, emapalumab was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in August 2018 and has been granted orphan designation and PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) status by the EMA.
Gamifant was developed and submitted for approval to the FDA by Novimmune. Sobi acquired the global rights to Gamifant from Novimmune through an exclusive licensing agreement announced in July 2018.

About primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
Primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an ultra-rare, rapidly progressive, often-fatal syndrome of hyperinflammation in which massive hyperproduction of interferon gamma (IFNy) is thought to drive immune system hyperactivation, ultimately leading to organ failures. It is estimated that fewer than 100 cases of primary HLH are diagnosed each year in the US, but this is believed to represent under diagnosis. Diagnosis is challenging due to the variability in signs and symptoms, which may include fevers, swelling of the liver and spleen, severe low red and white blood cell counts, bleeding disorders, infections, neurological symptoms, organ dysfunction and organ failure. Primary HLH can rapidly become fatal if left untreated, with median survival of less than two months. The immediate goal of treatment is to quickly control the hyperinflammation and to prepare for haematopoietic stem-cell transplant. The current conventional treatment prior to transplant includes steroids and chemotherapy and are not specifically approved to treat primary HLH.
About Gamifant® (emapalumab)
Emapalumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and neutralises interferon gamma (IFNy). In the US, Gamifant is indicated for paediatric (new born and older) and adult primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients with refractory, recurrent or progressive disease, or intolerance to standard-of-care HLH therapy. Gamifant is the first and only medicine approved in the US for primary HLH, an ultra-rare syndrome of hyperinflammation that usually occurs within the first year of life and can rapidly become fatal unless diagnosed and treated. The FDA approval is based on data from the pivotal phase 2/3 study (NCT01818492). Gamifant is indicated to be administered through intravenous (IV) infusion over one hour twice per week until haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

10666,Pfizer's Lorbrena (lorlatinib) Receives FDA Approval for Patients with 1L ALK- Positive Metastatic NSCLC,U.S. FDA Approves LORBRENA (lorlatinib) for Previously-Treated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC,"The approval is based on P-I/II (B7461001) study assessing Lorbrena (100mg, qd) in 215 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, who were treated with one or more ALK TKIs
 The P-I/II (B7461001) study resulted in ORR (48%) with intracranial response rate 60% with serious AEs 32% out of 295 patients
 Lorbrena (lorlatinib) is a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) TKI indicated for patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic NSCLC and is currently approved in Japan for ALK fusion gene-positive unresectable advanced and/or recurrent NSCLC with resistance or intolerance to ALK TKI","NEW YORK—-Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved LORBRENA® [lor-BREN-ah] (lorlatinib), a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on crizotinib and at least one other ALK inhibitor for metastatic disease; or whose disease has progressed on alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK inhibitor therapy for metastatic disease. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. This represents the third FDA approval Pfizer has received for an oncology treatment, including two lung cancer medicines, within two months.
“Over the years, Pfizer has transformed research, management and treatment for patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Building upon our extensive understanding of tumor complexity and treatment resistance, LORBRENA was discovered by Pfizer scientists and developed specifically to inhibit tumor mutations that may drive resistance to other ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors,” said Andy Schmeltz, Global President, Pfizer Oncology. “We believe that LORBRENA will benefit patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that have progressed on prior therapy and continue to deliver on our commitment to addressing unmet needs of cancer patients.”
Since Pfizer introduced XALKORI® (crizotinib) as the first TKI for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in 2011, the availability of these medicines has created an opportunity to provide patients with treatment options other than chemotherapy. However, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death around the world.
While many ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients respond to initial TKI therapy, they typically experience tumor progression.1,2 Additionally, options for patients who progress after treatment with second-generation ALK TKIs, alectinib, brigatinib and ceritinib, are limited.3 The approval of LORBRENA represents a new option for patients who have progressed on a second-generation ALK TKI, providing an opportunity to remain on oral therapy.
“The last decade has witnessed dramatic improvements in the treatment of metastatic ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer due to earlier generation ALK biomarker-driven therapies. Yet almost all patients still relapse due to drug resistance, with a large proportion of patients developing new or worsening brain metastases,” said Alice T. Shaw, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Director of the Center for Thoracic Cancers at Massachusetts General Hospital. “In a clinical study which included patients with or without brain metastases, LORBRENA demonstrated clinical activity in patients with metastatic ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer who had failed other ALK biomarker-driven therapies.”
The approval was based on a non-randomized, dose-ranging and activity-estimating, multi-cohort, multicenter Phase 1/2 study, B7461001, evaluating LORBRENA for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, who were previously treated with one or more ALK TKIs. A total of 215 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC were enrolled across various subgroups based on prior treatment. Among these patients, overall response rate (ORR) was 48 percent (95% CI: 42%, 55%) and importantly, 57 percent had previous treatment with more than one ALK TKI. In the trial, 69 percent of patients had a history of brain metastases and intracranial response rate was 60 percent (95% CI: 49%, 70%).
“Since leading with the first approval of a biomarker-driven treatment for ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer in 2011, Pfizer scientists and clinicians have remained committed to researching and developing medicines that can further advance the care of these patients,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “LORBRENA’s approval is an important milestone for patients, having demonstrated marked activity in a study that included a broad range of individuals with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. This includes patients who were heavily pretreated and facing limited options after receiving first- and second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors.”
Among 295 ALK-positive or ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC patients who received LORBRENA 100 mg once daily in study B7461001, the most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions were edema, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive effects, dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, arthralgia, mood effects, and diarrhea. The most common (≥20%) laboratory abnormalities were hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, anemia, hyperglycemia, increased AST, hypoalbuminemia, increased ALT, increased lipase, and increased alkaline phosphatase. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 32 percent of the 295 patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported were pneumonia (3.4%), dyspnea (2.7%), pyrexia (2%), mental status changes (1.4%), and respiratory failure (1.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.7 percent of patients and included pneumonia (0.7%), myocardial infarction (0.7%), acute pulmonary edema (0.3%), embolism (0.3%), peripheral artery occlusion (0.3%), and respiratory distress (0.3%). Permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA for adverse reactions occurred in eight percent of patients; approximately 48 percent of patients required dose interruptions and 24 percent required at least one dose reduction. The full prescribing information for LORBRENA can be found here.
Pfizer is committed to ensuring that patients living with lung cancer have access to this innovative therapy. Patients in the U.S. who are prescribed LORBRENA have access to Pfizer Oncology TogetherTM, which offers personalized patient support including financial assistance and additional resources to help them manage day-to-day life with their condition.
About LORBRENA® (lorlatinib)
LORBRENA is indicated for the treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on crizotinib and at least one other ALK inhibitor for metastatic disease; or whose disease has progressed on alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK inhibitor therapy for metastatic disease.
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
LORBRENA is currently approved in Japan for the treatment of ALK fusion gene-positive unresectable advanced and/or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer with resistance or intolerance to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s).
IMPORTANT LORBRENA SAFETY INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION
Contraindications: LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers, due to the potential for serious hepatotoxicity.
Risk of Serious Hepatotoxicity with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inducers: Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in 10 of 12 healthy subjects receiving a single dose of LORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. Grade 4 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 50% of subjects, Grade 3 in 33% of subjects, and Grade 2 in 8% of subjects. Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with moderate CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, monitor AST, ALT, and bilirubin 48 hours after initiating LORBRENA and at least 3 times during the first week after initiating LORBRENA. Depending upon the relative importance of each drug, discontinue LORBRENA or the CYP3A inducer for persistent Grade 2 or higher hepatotoxicity.
Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: A broad spectrum of CNS effects can occur. These include seizures, hallucinations, and changes in cognitive function, mood (including suicidal ideation), speech, mental status, and sleep. Withhold and resume at the same or reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity.
Hyperlipidemia: Increases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides can occur. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in total cholesterol occurred in 17% and Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides occurred in 17% of the 332 patients who received LORBRENA. Eighty percent of patients required initiation of lipid-lowering medications, with a median time to onset of start of such medications of 21 days. Initiate or increase the dose of lipid-lowering agents in patients with hyperlipidemia. Monitor serum cholesterol and triglycerides before initiating LORBRENA, 1 and 2 months after initiating LORBRENA, and periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at same dose for the first occurrence; resume at same or reduced dose of LORBRENA for recurrence based on severity.
Atrioventricular (AV) Block: PR interval prolongation and AV block can occur. In 295 patients who received LORBRENA at a dose of 100 mg orally once daily and who had a baseline electrocardiography (ECG), 1% experienced AV block and 0.3% experienced Grade 3 AV block and underwent pacemaker placement. Monitor ECG prior to initiating LORBRENA and periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at reduced or same dose in patients who undergo pacemaker placement. Permanently discontinue for recurrence in patients without a pacemaker.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Severe or life-threatening pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with ILD/pneumonitis can occur. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.5% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis in 1.2% of patients. Promptly investigate for ILD/pneumonitis in any patient who presents with worsening of respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Immediately withhold LORBRENA in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue LORBRENA for treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis of any severity.
Embryo-fetal Toxicity: LORBRENA can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception, since LORBRENA can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment with LORBRENA and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for 3 months after the final dose.
Adverse Reactions: Serious adverse reactions occurred in 32% of the 295 patients; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (3.4%), dyspnea (2.7%), pyrexia (2%), mental status changes (1.4%), and respiratory failure (1.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.7% of patients and included pneumonia (0.7%), myocardial infarction (0.7%), acute pulmonary edema (0.3%), embolism (0.3%), peripheral artery occlusion (0.3%), and respiratory distress (0.3%). The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were edema, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive effects, dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, arthralgia, mood effects, and diarrhea; the most common (≥20%) laboratory abnormalities were hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, anemia, hyperglycemia, increased AST, hypoalbuminemia, increased ALT, increased lipase, and increased alkaline phosphatase.
Drug Interactions: LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers. Avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inducers and strong CYP3A inhibitors. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin as recommended. If concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the LORBRENA dose as recommended. Concomitant use of LORBRENA decreases the concentration of CYP3A substrates.
Lactation: Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, instruct women not to breastfeed during treatment with LORBRENA and for 7 days after the final dose.
Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. The recommended dose of LORBRENA has not been established for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The recommended dose of LORBRENA has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment.
About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.4 NSCLC accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat, particularly in the metastatic setting.5 Approximately 75 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with metastatic or advanced disease where the five-year survival rate is only five percent.2,6,7
ALK gene rearrangement is a genetic alteration that drives the development of lung cancer in some patients.8,9 Epidemiology studies suggest that approximately three to five percent of NSCLC tumors are ALK-positive.10,11

About XALKORI® (crizotinib)
XALKORI is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test. XALKORI has received approval for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in more than 90 countries including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea and the European Union. XALKORI is also approved for ROS1-positive NSCLC in more than 60 countries.
XALKORI® Important Safety Information
Hepatotoxicity: Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with XALKORI across clinical trials (n=1719). Transaminase elevations generally occurred within the first 2 months. Monitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, then once a month, and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing for increased liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Permanently discontinue for ALT/AST elevation >3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin elevation >1.5 times ULN (in the absence of cholestasis or hemolysis); otherwise, temporarily suspend and dose-reduce XALKORI as indicated.
Interstitial Lung Disease (Pneumonitis): Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur. Across clinical trials (n=1719), 2.9% of XALKORI-treated patients had any grade ILD, 1.0% had Grade 3/4, and 0.5% had fatal ILD. ILD generally occurred within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Monitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Exclude other potential causes and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients with drug-related ILD/pneumonitis.
QT Interval Prolongation: QTc prolongation can occur. Across clinical trials (n=1616), 2.1% of patients had QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) ≥500 ms and 5.0% had an increase from baseline QTcF ≥60 ms by automated machine-read evaluation of ECGs. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Monitor ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or who are taking medications that prolong the QT interval. Permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients who develop QTc >500 ms or ≥60 ms change from baseline with Torsade de pointes, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia. Withhold XALKORI in patients who develop QTc >500 ms on at least 2 separate ECGs until recovery to a QTc ≤480 ms, then resume at a reduced dose.
Bradycardia: Symptomatic bradycardia can occur. Across clinical trials, bradycardia occurred in 12.7% of patients treated with XALKORI (n=1719). Avoid use in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. In cases of symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening, hold XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥60 bpm, re-evaluate the use of concomitant medications, and adjust the dose of XALKORI. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening bradycardia due to XALKORI; however, if associated with concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia or hypotension, hold XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥60 bpm. If concomitant medications can be adjusted or discontinued, restart XALKORI at 250 mg once daily with frequent monitoring.
Severe Visual Loss: Across clinical trials, the incidence of Grade 4 visual field defect with vision loss was 0.2% (n=1719). Discontinue XALKORI in patients with new onset of severe visual loss (best corrected vision less than 20/200 in one or both eyes). Perform an ophthalmological evaluation. There is insufficient information to characterize the risks of resumption of XALKORI in patients with a severe visual loss; a decision to resume should consider the potential benefits to the patient.
Vision Disorders: Most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, blurred vision or vitreous floaters, occurred in 63.1% of 1719 patients. The majority (95%) of these patients had Grade 1 visual adverse reactions. 0.8% of patients had Grade 3 and 0.2% had Grade 4 visual impairment. The majority of patients on the XALKORI arms in Studies 1 and 2 (>50%) reported visual disturbances which occurred at a frequency of 4-7 days each week, lasted up to 1 minute, and had mild or no impact on daily activities.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 45 days (females) or 90 days (males) respectively, following the final dose of XALKORI.
ROS1-positive Metastatic NSCLC: Safety was evaluated in 50 patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC from a single-arm study, and was generally consistent with the safety profile of XALKORI evaluated in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. Vision disorders occurred in 92% of patients in the ROS1 study; 90% of patients had Grade 1 vision disorders and 2% had Grade 2.
Adverse Reactions: Safety was evaluated in a phase 3 study in previously untreated patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC randomized to XALKORI (n=171) or chemotherapy (n=169). Serious adverse events were reported in 34% of patients treated with XALKORI, the most frequent were dyspnea (4.1%) and pulmonary embolism (2.9%). Fatal adverse events in XALKORI-treated patients occurred in 2.3% of patients, consisting of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Common adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in ≥25% and more commonly (≥5%) in patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy were vision disorder (71% vs 10%), diarrhea (61% vs 13%), edema (49% vs 12%), vomiting (46% vs 36%), constipation (43% vs 30%), upper respiratory infection (32% vs 12%), dysgeusia (26% vs 5%), and abdominal pain (26% vs 12%). Grade 3/4 reactions occurring at a ≥2% higher incidence with XALKORI vs chemotherapy were QT prolongation (2% vs 0%), esophagitis (2% vs 0%), and constipation (2% vs 0%). In patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy, the following occurred: elevation of ALT (any grade [79% vs 33%] or Grade 3/4 [15% vs 2%]); elevation of AST (any grade [66% vs 28%] or Grade 3/4 [8% vs 1%]); neutropenia (any grade [52% vs 59%] or Grade 3/4 [11% vs 16%]); lymphopenia (any grade [48% vs 53%] or Grade 3/4 [7% vs 13%]); hypophosphatemia (any grade [32% vs 21%] or Grade 3/4 [10% vs 6%]). In patients treated with XALKORI vs chemotherapy, renal cysts occurred (5% vs 1%). Nausea (56%), decreased appetite (30%), fatigue (29%), and neuropathy (21%) also occurred in patients taking XALKORI.
Drug Interactions: Exercise caution with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers and inhibitors. Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range in patients taking XALKORI. If concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range is required in patients taking XALKORI, dose reductions of the CYP3A substrates may be required due to adverse reactions.
Lactation: Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise females not to breastfeed during treatment with XALKORI and for 45 days after the final dose.
Hepatic Impairment: Crizotinib concentrations increased in patients with pre-existing moderate (any AST and total bilirubin >1.5x ULN and ≤3x ULN) or severe (any AST and total bilirubin >3x ULN) hepatic impairment. Reduce XALKORI dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. The recommended dose of XALKORI in patients with pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment is 200 mg orally twice daily or with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment is 250 mg orally once daily.
Renal Impairment: Decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate occurred in patients treated with XALKORI. Administer XALKORI at a starting dose of 250 mg taken orally once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr

 On 11 Jun,2018 Pfenex & Alvogen collaborated for the development and commercialization of Pfenex’s PF708 in the US
 Pfenex’s PF708 (teriparatide, biosimilar) is evaluated in P-III study for patients with osteoporosis and is expected to be approved by the US FDA in Q4’19","SAN DIEGO, Pfenex Inc. (NYSE American: PFNX) and Alvogen Ltd. today announced entering into agreements expanding their collaboration to develop and commercialize Pfenex’s lead product candidate, PF708, a proprietary teriparatide therapeutic equivalent candidate to Eli Lilly & Company’s Forteo®/Forsteo®, to the EU, to certain countries in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) the ROW territories (the latter defined as all countries outside of the EU, US and MENA, excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand). This collaboration leverages Alvogen’s established international experience and expertise in regulatory, IP and supply chain activities, as well as its established network of specialty marketing and sales pharmaceutical companies in these regions. Subject to applicable regulatory approvals, PF708 will be commercialized in Europe and Switzerland by Theramex, a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to Women’s Health, in MENA by SAJA, a Tamer Group company, and in ROW by Alvogen’s current and/or future commercialization partners. Under the terms of the agreements, Alvogen will be responsible for the local activities through Theramex, SAJA and its other commercialization partners and for overseeing any clinical development, regulatory, litigation, commercial manufacturing and commercialization. Pfenex will be eligible to receive additional upfront and milestone payments of $2.5 million for EU and MENA and additional potential milestone payments for ROW. For EU, MENA and ROW, Pfenex may also be eligible to receive a gross profit split of up to 60% on product sales, depending on geography and cost of goods sold.
“Collaborating with Alvogen in Europe, MENA and ROW centralizes the development, regulatory and commercialization activities of PF708 and leverages Alvogen’s global supply chain and market access experience to maximize potential of commercial success in these markets. Combining these operational capabilities with the favorable financial terms of the agreements, makes partnering on regional commercialization for PF708 the optimal strategy,” said Eef Schimmelpennink, Chief Executive Officer of Pfenex. “We believe working with Alvogen, coupled with the established and credible commercial partnerships with Theramex, Tamer Group (SAJA) and its other commercialization partners significantly enhances our commercialization strategy. We chose to expand our relationship with Alvogen on PF708 because the overall deal terms proposed were superior to the other regional players that we considered.”
“We continue to be excited by the market opportunity that PF708 offers as a therapeutic equivalent candidate to Forteo®. We believe this new collaboration in the EU, MENA and ROW will allow us to leverage our commercialization efforts in the U.S. and capture a larger piece of the teriparatide global market, which was approximately $1.6 billion in global sales in 2018,” stated Robert Wessman, Chief Executive Officer of Alvogen.
Anish Mehta, Chief Executive Officer at Theramex said, “As a leading women’s health company, we are delighted to be commercializing Pfenex’s proprietary teriparatide across Europe and Switzerland. The addition of teriparatide to our already broad portfolio of medications for the treatment of osteoporosis reinforces our commitment to helping women manage this potentially debilitating condition.”
“As part of SAJA’s long-stated vision to strategically invest in long-term partnerships with global pharma/biotech companies to bring solutions to patients in the MENA region, we are thrilled to welcome Pfenex/Alvogen as our new collaborator to bring new solutions to patients in the MENA region,” stated Riad Fanus, CEO of SAJA.
PF708 is being developed as a therapeutic equivalent to Forteo®. In December 2018, we submitted our new drug application (NDA) for PF708 to the FDA and the FDA accepted the submission in February 2019, leading to potential launch in the U.S., if approved by regulators, as early as the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to regulatory approval and other factors. The NDA submission for PF708 is based on positive data from the PF708-301 Phase III clinical study announced in 2018, which showed comparable overall profiles between PF708 and Forteo after 24 weeks of daily injection in osteoporosis patients. In addition, the NDA includes data from the PF708-101 study, a single-dose, 2-way crossover study comparing the pharmacokinetics of PF708 and Forteo in healthy subjects.

10676,"Pfizer's Talzenna (talazoparib) Receives FDA Approval for BRCA-Mutated, HER2-Negative LA or MBC",FDA approves talazoparib for gBRCAm HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer,"The approval is based on EMBRACA trial results assessing Talzenna (1mg) vs CT in 431 patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer for a duration of 11.2 mos.
 EMBRACA study results: mPFS (8.6 mos. vs 5.6mos.); ORR (62.6% vs 27.7%); reduction in risk of death 46%
 Talzenna (talazoparib) is an PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline (inherited) BRCA-mutated HER2-negative LA or mBC in adults","On October 16, 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved talazoparib (TALZENNA, Pfizer Inc.), a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm), HER2‑negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients must be selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for talazoparib.
Approval was based on EMBRACA (NCT01945775), an open‑label trial randomizing 431 patients (2:1) with gBRCAm HER2‑negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer to receive talazoparib (1 mg) or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). All patients were required to have a known deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation and must have received no more than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients were required to have received treatment with an anthracycline and/or a taxane (unless contraindicated) in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and/or metastatic treatment setting.
The primary efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review. Estimated median PFS was 8.6 and 5.6 months in the talazoparib and chemotherapy arms, respectively (HR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.71; p<0.0001).
The prescribing information includes warnings and precautions for myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, myelosuppression, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of any grade were fatigue, anemia, nausea, neutropenia, headache, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea, decreased appetite.
FDA also approved the BRACAnalysis CDx test (Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc.) to identify patients with breast cancer with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm who are eligible for talazoparib. The effectiveness of the BRACAnalysis CDx test was based on the EMBRACA trial population for whom deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm status was confirmed with either prospective or retrospective testing with BRACAnalysis CDx.
The recommended talazoparib dose is 1 mg taken as a single oral daily dose, with or without food.

10687,ï»¿Ionis' Tegsedi (inotersen) Receives FDA Approval for Polyneuropathy of Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated Amyloidosis in Adults,TEGSEDI is an effective treatment choice that allows self-administration at a time and place that works for the patient,"The approval is based on P-III NEURO-TTR study trial assessing Tegsedi vs PBO in 172 patients in ratio (2:1) with hATTR amyloidosis with symptoms of polyneuropathy
 The study resulted in effective results in measures of neuropathy and QoL while measuring with a Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) & Norfolk QOL-DN total score with 80% reduction in TTR
 Tegsedi (inotersen) is a qw SC RNA-targeting drug used for the reduction in the production of TTR protein and has also received EU and Health Canada approval for 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR. In April, 2018 Ionis granted Akcea worldwide rights to commercialize Tegsedi","BOSTON and CARLSBAD, Calif., — Akcea Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKCA), an affiliate of Ionis
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
approved TEGSEDITM (inotersen) for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults. TEGSEDI is now
approved in the U.S., European Union and Canada.
“TEGSEDI is the first and only RNA-targeting therapeutic that powerfully reduces the production of TTR protein through a once-weekly subcutaneous
injection offering patients an effective treatment for people living with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. We believe this profile will make
TEGSEDI an excellent choice for many patients and that it’s self-administration gives the flexibility to treat at a time that works for them which could
change the way this progressive and debilitating disease is treated and managed,” said Paula Soteropoulos, chief executive officer at Akcea
Therapeutics. “As we execute on our multi-country launch, we are committed to delivering a comprehensive treatment experience for people taking
TEGSEDI. Beyond the drug itself, this includes ensuring patients who need this therapy have access to it, offering personalized support programs and
enabling patients to administer treatment on their own terms.”
In hATTR amyloidosis, transthyretin (TTR) protein misfolds and accumulates as amyloid deposits throughout the body. TEGSEDI targets the disease
at its source by reducing the production of TTR protein. In the NEURO-TTR study, treatment with TEGSEDI produced up to a 79% mean decrease
from baseline in serum TTR protein in patients regardless of TTR mutation, sex, age, or race.
“Although the true incidence is not known of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, there is no doubt that it is currently significantly
underdiagnosed,” said Isabelle Lousada, founder and chief executive officer of the Amyloidosis Research Consortium. “This approval represents a
significant advancement for the patients, families, caregivers and healthcare professionals in the U.S. who need more options for the medical
management of this disease. I am now more optimistic than ever that we can increase awareness of this rare disease, support faster diagnosis and
provide better treatment.”
The FDA’s approval of TEGSEDI was based on results from the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with symptoms of
polyneuropathy. Results from that study demonstrated that patients treated with TEGSEDI experienced significant benefit compared to patients
treated with placebo across both co-primary endpoints: the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) and modified
Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7), a measure of neuropathic disease progression.
TEGSEDI is associated with risk of thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis. Enhanced monitoring is required to support early detection and
management of these identified risks. For TEGSEDI’s full prescribing information, including boxed warning, please visit www.TEGSEDI.com and
please see Important Safety Information below. TEGSEDI is being marketed with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
“hATTR amyloidosis is a fatal disease that affects multiple organs and body systems and robs people of so much – the ability to work, the ability to
carry out daily tasks – all the things that make them feel in control of their lives,” said Morie Gertz, M.D., hematologist and Chair Emeritus of Internal
Medicine at Mayo Clinic. “TEGSEDI has demonstrated a nearly 80% reduction in TTR, which is now a validated approach to treating this disease. The
rapid and sustained improvements compared to placebo and reversal in measures of disease seen in a substantial proportion of patients coupled with
the independence offered through self injection provide a sense of hope not only to patients, but to their caregivers and families as well.”
To assist hATTR amyloidosis patients in gaining access to TEGSEDI, Akcea has created Akcea ConnectTM, a patient support program made up of
dedicated, regionally-based nurse case managers who have a wide range of medical knowledge and experience.This program offers free, private and
personalized support to patients and their caregivers and families across the United States. Akcea Connect is now accepting patient enrollment and
authorization forms.For more information, please see the contact information for Akcea Connect below.
“hATTR amyloidosis is a devastating disease that takes so much from patients. Akcea is ready to help patients take something back,” said Sarah
Boyce, president of Akcea Therapeutics. “We understand that managing a rare disease goes beyond providing a new medicine and our highly skilled
team is fully prepared to provide an effective, safe and comprehensive treatment experience. Our industry-leading patient support program, Akcea
Connect, is poised to help patients through every stage of their TEGSEDI treatment journey, and we are well advanced in discussions with leading
payers to facilitate access. We are excited and ready to execute on our launch plans and bring TEGSEDI to patients.”
“The U.S. approval of TEGSEDI represents another important addition to the expanding Ionis commercial pipeline, a product of 30 years of innovation.
We are thrilled to see our efforts result in an important new medicine for people with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis,” said Brett P.
Monia, Ph.D., chief operating officer of Ionis Pharmaceuticals. “We are confident that the experienced team at Akcea will deliver on the promise of
TEGSEDI. We are grateful to all of the patients and physicians who participated in the TEGSEDI clinical program and who made this landmark
approval possible.”
In April, Akcea licensed the worldwide rights to commercialize TEGSEDI from Ionis. Based on the U.S. approval of TEGSEDI, Ionis will receive a $50
million milestone payment that may be made in Akcea common stock or cash. Commercial profits and losses from TEGSEDI will be split 60 percent to
Ionis and 40 percent to Akcea.

ABOUT TEGSEDITM (INOTERSEN)
TEGSEDI was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated
(hATTR) amyloidosis in adults. TEGSEDITM (inotersen), discovered and developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, is the world’s first and only
subcutaneous RNA-targeting drug designed to reduce the production of human transthyretin (TTR) protein. TEGSEDI also received marketing
authorization in the European Union and Canada for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin
amyloidosis (hATTR).
The approval is based on data from the NEURO-TTR study that was a Phase 3 randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 15-month,
international study in 172 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with symptoms of polyneuropathy. In NEURO-TTR, TEGSEDI demonstrated significant
benefit compared to placebo in measures of neuropathy and quality of life as measured by the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7)
and in the Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) total score. Patients treated with TEGSEDI experienced similar
benefit regardless of subgroups such as age, sex, race, region, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS), Val30Met mutation status, and disease stage.
The approval is also based on data from the NEURO-TTR Open Label Extension (OLE) that is an ongoing study for patients who completed the
NEURO-TTR study, designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of TEGSEDI.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
TEGSEDI can cause serious side effects including:
Low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia): TEGSEDI may cause the number of platelets in your blood to be reduced. This is a common side effect of
TEGSEDI. When your platelet count is too low, your body cannot form clots. You could have serious bleeding that could lead to death. Call your
healthcare provider immediately if you have:
Unusual bruising or a rash of tiny reddish-purple spots, often on the lower legs
Bleeding from skin cuts that does not stop or oozes
Bleeding from your gums or nose
Blood in your urine or stools
Bleeding into the whites of your eyes
Sudden severe headaches or neck stiffness
Vomiting or coughing up blood
Abnormal or heavy periods (menstrual bleeding)
Kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis): Your kidneys may stop working properly. Glomerulonephritis can lead to severe kidney damage and
kidney failure that need dialysis. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you have:
Puffiness or swelling in your face, feet, or hands
New onset or worsening shortness of breath and coughing
Blood in your urine or brown urine
Foamy urine (proteinuria)
Passed less urine than usual
Because of the risk of serious bleeding caused by low platelet counts and because of the risk of kidney problems, TEGSEDI is available
only through a restricted program called the TEGSEDI Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Talk to your healthcare
provider about how to enroll in the TEGSEDI REMS Program.
Do not use TEGSEDI if you have:
A platelet count that is low
Had kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis) caused by TEGSEDI
Had an allergic reaction to inotersen or any of the ingredients in TEGSEDI. See the end of the Medication Guide for a
complete list of ingredients in TEGSEDI
Before you start TEGSEDI, tell your healthcare provider about all of your health issues, including if you:
Have or had bleeding problems
Have or had kidney problems
Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if TEGSEDI can harm your unborn baby
Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if TEGSEDI can pass into your breast milk or harm your baby. Talk
with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby while you are taking TEGSEDI
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal
supplements. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take vitamin A or beta-carotene supplements, blood thinners (anticoagulants), or drugs
that affect blood clotting.
Required monitoring
Your healthcare provider will test your blood and urine to check your platelet counts and kidney and liver function before you start TEGSEDI. While you
are receiving TEGSEDI, you will be monitored closely for symptoms, which includes checking your platelet counts every week (or more frequently as
needed), kidney function every 2 weeks, and liver function every 4 months. If your healthcare provider has you stop taking TEGSEDI, you will need to
continue to get your blood and urine tested for 8 more weeks after treatment.
TEGSEDI may cause serious side effects, including:
Stroke. TEGSEDI may cause a stroke. One person taking TEGSEDI had a stroke, which occurred within 2 days after the first dose. Get emergency
help immediately if you have symptoms of stroke, including sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; severe headache or
neck pain; confusion; problems with vision, speech, or balance; droopy eyelids.
Inflammatory and immune system problems. Some people taking TEGSEDI had serious inflammatory and immune system problems. Symptoms of
inflammatory and immune system problems included unexpected change in walking, weakness and spasms in legs, back pain, weight loss, headache,
vomiting, and problems with speech.
Liver effects. TEGSEDI may cause liver problems. Your healthcare provider should do laboratory tests to check your liver before you start TEGSEDI
and while you are using it. Tell your healthcare provider if you have symptoms that your liver may not be working right, which could include unexpected
nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, being not hungry, yellowing of the skin, or having dark urine.
Allergic reactions. TEGSEDI may cause serious allergic reactions. These allergic reactions often occur within 2 hours after injecting TEGSEDI. Get
emergency help immediately if you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including joint pain, chills, redness on palms of hands, muscle
pain, chest pain, flushing, tremor or jerking movements, flu-like symptoms, high blood pressure, or difficulty swallowing.
Eye problems (low vitamin A levels). Treatment with TEGSEDI will lower the vitamin A levels in your blood. Your healthcare provider will tell you
how much supplemental vitamin A to take every day; only take the amount they tell you to take. Call your healthcare provider if you get eye problems,
such as having difficulty seeing at night or in low-lit areas (night blindness).
The most common side effects of TEGSEDI include injection site reactions (such as redness or pain at the injection site), nausea, headache,
tiredness, low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), and fever. These are not all of the possible side effects of TEGSEDI. Talk to your healthcare
provider about any side affects you may be experiencing.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

ABOUT HEREDITARY TRANSTHYRETIN (hATTR) AMYLOIDOSIS
hATTR amyloidosis is a severe, progressive, and life-threatening disease caused by the abnormal formation of the TTR protein and aggregation of
TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs throughout the body, including in peripheral nerves, heart and intestinal tract. The progressive
accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these organs often leads to intractable peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or
cardiomyopathy, as well as other disease manifestations. hATTR amyloidosis causes significant morbidity and progressive decline in quality of life,
severely impacting activities of daily living. The disease often progress rapidly and can lead to premature death. The median survival is 4.7 years
following diagnosis1. Additional information on hATTR amyloidosis, including a full list of organizations supporting the hATTR amyloidosis community

10696,Leadiant Biosciences Revcovi's (elapegademase-lvlr) Receives FDA Approval for Adenosine Deaminase Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) in Pediatric and Adult Patients,"FDA Approves Revcovi, a New Enzyme Replacement Therapy Developed by Leadiant Biosciences, for the Treatment of ADA-SCID in Pediatric and Adult Patients","The approval is based on two study results assessing Revcovi in patients and demonstrated in an increase in ADA activity, reduction in concentration of toxic metabolites with an improvement in total lymphocyte counts
 Leadiant Biosciences’ Revcovi has received FDA’s Fast Track, Priority Review & ODD designation on 7 Jun, 2017, 27 Jun, 2018 & 19 Mar, 2015 respectively
 Revcovi (elapegademase-lvlr) is a recombinant adenosine deaminase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) indicated for ADA-SCID in pediatric and adult patients","Gaithersburg, MD –– Leadiant Biosciences, Inc. today announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval to Revcovi™ (elapegademase-lvlr) injection in the U.S. Revcovi is a new enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of adenosine deaminase severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) in pediatric and adult patients.
“We are gratified by the FDA’s timely recognition of Revcovi as an effective and safe treatment for ADA-SCID, which, in addition to being ultra-rare, is one of the most devastating genetic disorders,” said Michael Minarich, Chief Executive Officer, Leadiant Biosciences, Inc. “We extend our deepest gratitude to the patients who participated in the clinical trials and their families and caregivers who supported them. We also appreciate the hard work of the investigators, clinicians, and study staff to bring this therapy to patients in need. We look forward to continuing to work together to serve the ADA-SCID community.”
Revcovi is a PEGylated recombinant adenosine deaminase (rADA) enzyme developed by Leadiant Biosciences to treat ADA-SCID. The product of recombinant technology, Revcovi eliminates the need to source the enzyme from animals and works by supplementing levels of an essential enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA).
ADA-SCID is an ultra-rare, inherited genetic disorder, caused by a deficiency in the ADA enzyme that is fatal if left untreated. Patients affected by ADA-SCID have compromised immune systems that leave them unprotected from infection-producing bacteria, viruses, and fungi. ADA-SCID primarily affects infants and young children. The disease is typically diagnosed within the first few months of life. Undiagnosed babies with ADA-SCID usually die before they reach age two due to infections. SCID newborn screening in most states has allowed detection of ADA-SCID in newborns and has led to early initiation of ADA enzyme therapy and improved outcomes.
“For decades, physicians, patients, and their families have relied upon enzyme replacement therapy as a life-saving treatment for adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency, a disease in which the buildup of toxic metabolites can cripple children’s immune systems,” said Morna Dorsey, M.D., MMSc, Professor of Pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. “Individuals with ADA-SCID are at an increased risk of severe and recurrent infections and often fail to thrive. By providing specific and direct replacement of the adenosine deaminase enzyme, Revcovi can reduce patients’ risk of potentially serious, life-threatening infections and their debilitating complications.”
The approval is based on results from two multicenter, open-label clinical trials which demonstrate that Revcovi increases ADA activity, reduces concentrations of toxic metabolites that are the hallmark of ADA-SCID and improves total lymphocyte counts.
“This is a great day for people living with ADA-SCID and their families as the approval of Revcovi gives them a path forward,” commented John Boyle, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Immune Deficiency Foundation. “We commend Leadiant Biosciences for bringing this innovative enzyme replacement therapy to market, and for helping to advance scientific understanding of ADA-SCID.”
“The competence and dedication of our staff was instrumental to obtain this important achievement for the ADA-SCID community,” said Dr. Marco Brughera, Chief Executive Officer, Leadiant Biosciences Corporate. “With the FDA’s approval of Revcovi, we reaffirm our commitment and rare dedication to providing a reliable supply of quality, innovative therapies that serve the needs of rare disease communities.”
Leadiant is working with physicians, payers, and policymakers to bring Revcovi to patients who need it. The Company offers comprehensive treatment support, from educating about the disease, to navigating reimbursement, to offering patient assistance programs. The Company’s post-marketing commitment includes a clinical study, which will record information about the health status of patients using Revcovi. This initiative will help Leadiant better understand and track information about Revcovi following approval as well as provide critical information about Revcovi’s efficacy and safety, especially in newly diagnosed patients.
Leadiant is a research-based pharmaceutical company that dedicates considerable scientific and financial resources to the research, development, and distribution of novel and effective therapies to address the needs of people living with rare diseases. The Company markets five rare disease products in North America and has been working in the enzyme replacement therapy space for more than 30 years. The Company is committed to serving the needs of patients, caregivers, and families affected by ADA-SCID.
The FDA granted this application Fast Track and Priority Review. Revcovi also received Orphan Drug designation.
About Revcovi
Revcovi (elapegademase-lvlr) is a recombinant adenosine deaminase indicated for the treatment of adenosine deaminase severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) in pediatric and adult patients. In the two multicenter trials, Revcovi supplemented ADA levels, reduced concentrations of toxic metabolites that are the hallmark of ADA-SCID and improved total lymphocyte counts.1 Revcovi is the product of recombinant technology, thus eliminating the need to source the adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme from animals.

Important Safety Information for Revcovi
Indication
Revcovi (elapegademase-lvlr) is indicated for the treatment of adenosine deaminase severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) in pediatric and adult patients.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:

Injection site bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia: Increased risk of local bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia; should not be used if thrombocytopenia is severe.
Delay in improvement of immune function: Protect immune deficient patients from infections until improvement in immune function.
ADVERSE REACTIONS:
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were cough and vomiting.
In addition, the following post-marketing reports for the same class of enzyme replacement therapy used in the treatment of ADA-SCID, may also be seen with Revcovi treatment:

Hematologic events: hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia
Dermatological events: injection site erythema, urticaria
Lymphomas
IMPORTANT MONITORING INFORMATION:
Treatment with Revcovi should be monitored by measuring trough plasma ADA activity and trough dAXP levels for maintenance of therapeutic targets. If a persistent decline in plasma ADA activity occurs, immune function and clinical status should be monitored closely, and precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of infection.
Please refer to Revcovi’s Full Prescribing Information.

About ADA-SCID
Adenosine deaminase severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) is an ultra-rare, inherited genetic disorder, caused by a deficiency in the adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme that is fatal when left untreated. ADA-SCID primarily affects infants and young children whose compromised immune system leaves them unprotected from infection-producing bacteria, viruses, and fungi. ADA-SCID is characterized by severe and recurrent opportunistic infections, failure to thrive, profound lymphopenia (reduced number of lymphocytes in the blood) with absent or severely impaired immune function, and metabolic abnormalities (abnormally high intracellular accumulation of purine nucleotides). Patients with ADA-SCID are also predisposed to recurrent illnesses caused by pathogens that often begin within the first few weeks of life.2,3ADA-SCID is typically diagnosed within the first few months of life.4 Left untreated, babies with ADA-SCID usually die before they reach the age of 2 due to recurrent infections unless they are diagnosed early and effective treatment is started.5
ADA-SCID results from mutations in the ADA gene, which provides instructions for producing the ADA enzyme.6 When functioning properly, ADA eliminates molecules called adenosine and deoxyadenosine, which are toxic to lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. ADA converts adenosine to inosine and deoxyadenosine to deoxyinosine, molecules that do not harm lymphocytes. However, mutations in the ADA gene reduce or eliminate the protective activity of adenosine deaminase, allowing the buildup of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to toxic levels. These toxic levels cause specialized lymphocytes called T-cells and B-cells to accumulate biologic chemicals that would normally be processed by ADA. The buildup of these biologic products in excess of normal causes the T-cells and B-cells to die, leaving affected individuals with no significant immune defense and increasing their risk of infection.6
ADA-SCID is estimated to occur in approximately one in 200,000 to one in 1,000,000 newborns around the world.3 The disorder is responsible for approximately 15% of SCID cases.7

 Nuzyra (omadacycline) is a qd IV PO tetracycline class antibacterial drug indicated to treat CABP and ABSSSI
 Post marketing approval, Paratek’s plans to evaluate Nuzyra for the treatment of CABP and pediatrics, with its expected marketing in Q1’19","Modernized Tetracycline for the Treatment of Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) and Acute Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) specifically designed to overcome tetracycline resistance –

– First and only once-daily IV and oral antibiotic approved to treat both CABP and ABSSSI patients in nearly 20 Years –

– US launch expected first quarter 2019 –

BOSTON, — Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRTK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved NUZYRA™ (omadacycline) for the treatment of adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and acute skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). NUZYRA, a modernized tetracycline, is a once-daily IV and oral antibiotic that exhibits activity across a spectrum of bacteria, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypicals, and drug resistant strains. The Company plans on making NUZYRA available in the first quarter 2019.
“In the face of ever-increasing antibiotic resistance, the FDA approved NUZYRA with a label having full approval for both CABP and ABSSSI. We are excited to bring to physicians an effective, well-tolerated monotherapy option for patients,” said Evan Loh, M.D., President, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Medical Officer, Paratek. “NUZYRA offers clinicians the ability to treat patients with the IV and transition them home to complete treatment with the oral formulation. This potentially helps reduce hospitalizations and the costs associated with hospital stays.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that drug-resistant bacteria cause 2 million illnesses and approximately 23,000 deaths each year in the United States. The main bacteria causing CABP, Streptococcus pneumoniae, is responsible for 1.2 million infections and 7,000 deaths, whereas ABSSSI is responsible for more than 750,000 hospitalizations. The increase of antibiotic resistance continues to drive the need for new, effective therapies.
“Treating pneumonia and skin infections has become increasingly complex as existing antibiotic therapies sometimes have reduced efficacy as resistance continues to grow. This reality makes it increasingly challenging to provide safe and effective treatments to patients,” said Keith Kaye, M.D., MPH, Director of Clinical Research, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan. “There continues to be a need for novel antibiotics with both IV and oral formulations, such as NUZYRA, to help physicians stay ahead of the evolving resistance landscape.”
The approval of NUZYRA is supported by multiple clinical trials within the company’s global development program. Nearly 2,000 adult patients received NUZYRA and it was found to be efficacious and generally safe and well tolerated. As part of the approval, Paratek has agreed to conduct post marketing studies in CABP and pediatrics.
“The approval of NUZYRA is an historic milestone for Paratek as it represents 20 years of research and development of this life-saving antibiotic for patients affected by community-acquired infections,” said Michael F. Bigham, Chairman and CEO, Paratek. “There are countless champions of NUZYRA who have been tireless in their efforts to ensure its advancement to commercialization – from patients, clinicians and study investigators to our Paratek team. We are grateful to all who played a role in making NUZYRA available to patients in need. We are excited to launch NUZYRA early next year.”
Conference Call and Webcast 
Paratek’s conference call for the NUZYRA approval will be broadcast tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. EDT on October 3, 2018. The webcast can be accessed under “Events and Presentations” in the Investor Relations section of Paratek’s website at www.ParatekPharma.com.

Warnings and Precautions
Mortality imbalance was observed in the CABP clinical trial with eight deaths (2%) occurring in patients treated with NUZYRA compared to four deaths (1%) in patients treated with moxifloxacin. The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established. All deaths, in both treatment arms, occurred in patients > 65 years of age; most patients had multiple comorbidities. The causes of death varied and included worsening and/or complications of infection and underlying conditions. Closely monitor clinical response to therapy in CABP patients, particularly in those at higher risk for mortality.
The use of NUZYRA during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia.
The use of NUZYRA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with NUZYRA. Life-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. NUZYRA is structurally similar to other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. Discontinue NUZYRA if an allergic reaction occurs.
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs.
NUZYRA is structurally similar to tetracycline-class of antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions. Adverse reactions including photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, pancreatitis, and abnormal liver function tests, have been reported for other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs, and may occur with NUZYRA. Discontinue NUZYRA if any of these adverse reactions are suspected.
Prescribing NUZYRA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are nausea, vomiting, infusion site reactions, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, hypertension, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, and constipation.
Drug Interactions
Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage while taking NUZYRA.
Absorption of tetracyclines, including NUZYRA is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate and iron containing preparations.
Use in Specific Populations
Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NUZYRA.

10706,TaiMed Biologics' Trogarzo (ibalizumab-uiyk) Receives Approval for Multidrug Resistant (MDR)-HIV,FDA approves new HIV treatment for patients who have limited treatment options,"The approval is based on clinical study results assessing Trogarzo (ibalizumab, IV) in 40 patients with MDR-HIV
 The study resulted in depletion of HIV-RNA level in blood in 43% patients after 24 weeks when given with other antiretroviral drugs
 Trogarvo (ibalizumab, IV) is an antiretroviral drug used in treatment of MDR-HIV and received FDA’s FT, PR, OD and breakthrough therapy in 2003, 2017, 2014 & 2015 respectively.","Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trogarzo (ibalizumab-uiyk), a new type of antiretroviral medication for adult patients living with HIV who have tried multiple HIV medications in the past (heavily treatment-experienced) and whose HIV infections cannot be successfully treated with other currently available therapies (multidrug resistant HIV, or MDR HIV).Trogarzo is administered intravenously once every 14 days by a trained medical professional and used in combination with other antiretroviral medications.
“While most patients living with HIV can be successfully treated using a combination of two or more antiretroviral drugs, a small percentage of patients who have taken many HIV drugs in the past have multidrug resistant HIV, limiting their treatment options and putting them at a high risk of HIV-related complications and progression to death,” said Jeff Murray, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Antiviral Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Trogarzo is the first drug in a new class of antiretroviral medications that can provide significant benefit to patients who have run out of HIV treatment options. New treatment options may be able to improve their outcomes.”
The safety and efficacy of Trogarzo were evaluated in a clinical trial of 40 heavily treatment-experienced patients with MDR HIV-1 who continued to have high levels of virus (HIV-RNA) in their blood despite being on antiretroviral drugs. Many of the participants had previously been treated with 10 or more antiretroviral drugs. The majority of participants experienced a significant decrease in their HIV-RNA levels one week after Trogarzo was added to their failing antiretroviral regimens. After 24 weeks of Trogarzo plus other antiretroviral drugs, 43 percent of the trial’s participants achieved HIV RNA suppression.
The clinical trial focused on the small patient population with limited treatment options and demonstrated the benefit of Trogarzo in achieving reduction of HIV RNA. The seriousness of the disease, the need to individualize other drugs in the treatment regimen, and safety data from other trials were considered in evaluating the Trogarzo development program.
A total of 292 patients with HIV-1 infection have been exposed to Trogarzo IV infusion. The most common adverse reactions to Trogarzo were diarrhea, dizziness, nausea and rash. Severe side effects included rash and changes in the immune system (immune reconstitution syndrome).
The FDA granted this application Fast Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. Trogarzo also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.
The FDA granted approval of Trogarzo to TaiMed Biologics USA Corp.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

 DUO study results: PFS: no of events (55% vs 70%); progression disease (44% vs 62%); Death (11 vs 8); mPFS (16.4 vs 9.1 mos.); ORR (74% vs 39%); PR (74% vs 39%): DYNAMO study results: ORR 42%, CR 1%, PR 41%, patience maintaining response @ 6mos, 12 mos. (43%, 17%)
 Copiktra (duvelisib) is an PO inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and a novel dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma indicated for adult with 2L+ r/r CLL/SLL or 2l+ r/r FL","BOSTON— Verastem, Inc. (Nasdaq:VSTM) (Verastem Oncology or the Company), focused on developing and commercializing medicines to improve the survival and quality of life of cancer patients, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved COPIKTRA™, an oral inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and the first approved dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma. COPIKTRA is approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) after at least two prior therapies.
COPIKTRA also received accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies. The indication in FL is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
“With today’s FDA approval of COPIKTRA, Verastem Oncology is delivering upon our commitment to patients with cancer by bringing a new oral medicine to market,” said Robert Forrester, President and Chief Executive Officer of Verastem Oncology. “We are pleased to be able to introduce COPIKTRA during National Blood Cancer Awareness Month. At Verastem Oncology, we are driven by the strength and courage of those battling cancer, and we are committed to advancing therapies such as COPIKTRA with the potential to make a significant impact for patients, their caregivers and physicians. We are immensely grateful to the many patients who participated in the duvelisib clinical trial program over the years leading to this pivotal moment.”
“COPIKTRA is an important addition to the evolving treatment paradigm for patients with CLL/SLL and FL,” said Ian Flinn, MD, PhD, Director of the Lymphoma Research Program at Sarah Cannon Research Institute and lead investigator of the DYNAMO™ and DUO™ studies. “The approval of COPIKTRA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL after at least two prior therapies, or relapsed or refractory FL after at least two prior systemic therapies, is based on clinical trial data gathered from the treatment of over 400 adult patients. COPIKTRA is a significant addition to physicians’ treatment armamentarium that I believe will address an unmet need for patients who have limited options once they have progressed after two prior therapies.”
Use of COPIKTRA is associated with a BOXED WARNING for four fatal and/or serious toxicities: infections, diarrhea or colitis, cutaneous reactions, and pneumonitis. Verastem Oncology is implementing an informational Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to provide appropriate dosing and safety information to better support physicians in managing their patients on COPIKTRA.
Additionally, use of COPIKTRA is also associated with adverse reactions which may require dose reduction, treatment delay or discontinuation of COPIKTRA. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS are provided for infections, diarrhea or colitis, cutaneous reactions, pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, and embryo-fetal toxicity. The most common ADVERSE REACTIONS (reported in ≥ 20% of patients) were diarrhea or colitis, neutropenia, rash, fatigue, pyrexia, cough, nausea, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia.
Please see www.COPIKTRAHCP.com/prescribinginformation for full Prescribing Information including BOXED WARNING and Medication Guide in addition to the full Important Safety Information provided below.
Lymphoma is the most common blood cancer, and CLL/SLL and FL are common types of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (iNHL). There are an estimated 681,000 people living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the US alone, including nearly 350,000 cases of CLL/SLL or FL.1 Many of these patients will eventually relapse or develop refractory disease.
“Each lymphoma patient’s experience is unique, and today’s approval offers patients with CLL/SLL and FL a new treatment option and a new opportunity for hope,” said Meghan Gutierrez, Chief Executive Officer of the Lymphoma Research Foundation. “We applaud the FDA, Verastem and the patients who participated in the clinical trials for their roles in advancing treatment options for people living with CLL/SLL and FL.”
The New Drug Application for COPIKTRA received Priority Review. Priority Review is reserved for medicines that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications. The FDA had previously granted COPIKTRA Fast Track Designation in CLL and FL as well as Orphan Drug Designation for CLL/SLL and FL. For the indication of FL, COPIKTRA was approved under FDA regulations for accelerated approval.
“We are excited to offer a new treatment that can allow patients to manage their disease with an oral monotherapy,” said Joseph Lobacki, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of Verastem Oncology. “We continue to hear from physicians and patients that there is a great need for additional treatment options to fight chronic cancers such as CLL/SLL and FL. In preparation for this approval, we have assembled an experienced oncology commercial team, established our distribution network, and we are ready to make COPIKTRA commercially available to patients.”
COPIKTRA will be available in the U.S. market immediately. Verastem Oncology is committed to helping patients with CLL/SLL and FL access COPIKTRA through our Verastem Cares™ program. Verastem Cares is a comprehensive, personalized program designed to provide information and assistance to patients who have been prescribed COPIKTRA.
Patients, physicians, pharmacists, or other healthcare professionals with questions about COPIKTRA should contact 1-833-570-2273 (CARE) or visit www.COPIKTRA.com.

COPIKTRA Clinical Trials
Efficacy in Relapsed or Refractory CLL/SLL
A randomized, multicenter, open-label trial (DUO™; NCT02004522) compared COPIKTRA versus ofatumumab in 319 adult patients with CLL (N = 312) or SLL (N = 7) after at least one prior therapy. The study randomized patients with a 1:1 ratio to receive either COPIKTRA 25mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or ofatumumab for 7 cycles.
The approval of COPIKTRA was based on efficacy and safety analysis of patients with at least 2 prior lines of therapy, where the benefit:risk appeared greater in this more heavily pretreated population compared to the overall trial population.
In this subset (95 randomized to COPIKTRA, 101 to ofatumumab), the median patient age was 69 years (range: 40 to 90 years), 59% were male, and 88% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Forty-six percent received 2 prior lines of therapy, and 54% received 3 or more prior lines. At baseline, 52% of patients had at least one tumor ≥ 5 cm, and 22% of patients had a documented 17p deletion.
During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to COPIKTRA was 13 months (range: 0.2 to 37), with 80% of patients receiving at least 6 months and 52% receiving at least 12 months of COPIKTRA. The median duration of exposure to ofatumumab was 5 months (range: < 0.1 to 6).
Efficacy was based on progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). Other efficacy measures included overall response rate (ORR). Efficacy of COPIKTRA compared to ofatumumab specifically in patients treated with at least two prior therapies is below.

Efficacy in Relapsed or Refractory FL
Efficacy of COPIKTRA in patients with previously treated FL is based on a single-arm, multicenter trial (DYNAMO™; NCT01882803).
In DYNAMO, COPIKTRA 25 mg BID was administered in patients with FL (N = 83) who were refractory to rituximab and to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy. Refractory disease was defined as less than a partial remission or relapse within 6 months after the last dose. The trial excluded patients with Grade 3b FL, large cell transformation, prior allogeneic transplant, and prior exposure to a PI3K inhibitor or to a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
The median age was 64 years (range: 30 to 82 years), 68% were male, and 37% had bulky disease assessed at baseline (target lesion ≥ 5 cm). Patients had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range: 1 to 10), with 94% being refractory to their last therapy and 81% being refractory to 2 or more prior lines of therapy. Most patients (93%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.
The median duration of exposure to COPIKTRA was 5 months (range: 0.4 to 24), with 41% of patients receiving at least 6 months and 10% receiving at least 12 months of COPIKTRA.
Efficacy was based on overall response rate and duration of response as assessed by an IRC, as shown below.

Fatal and/or serious pneumonitis occurred in 5% of COPIKTRA-treated patients. Monitor for pulmonary symptoms and interstitial infiltrates. Withhold COPIKTRA.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections: Serious, including fatal (18/442; 4%), infections occurred in 31% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). The most common serious infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and lower respiratory infections. Median time to onset of any grade infection was 3 months (range: 1 day to 32 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 6 months. Treat infections prior to initiation of COPIKTRA. Advise patients to report new or worsening signs and symptoms of infection. For grade 3 or higher infection, withhold COPIKTRA until infection has resolved. Resume COPIKTRA at the same or reduced dose.
Serious, including fatal, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) occurred in 1% of patients taking COPIKTRA. Provide prophylaxis for PJP during treatment with COPIKTRA and following completion of treatment with COPIKTRA until the absolute CD4+ T cell count is greater than 200 cells/μL. Withhold COPIKTRA in patients with suspected PJP of any grade, and permanently discontinue if PJP is confirmed.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation/infection occurred in 1% of patients taking COPIKTRA. Consider prophylactic antivirals during COPIKTRA treatment to prevent CMV infection including CMV reactivation. For clinical CMV infection or viremia, withhold COPIKTRA until infection or viremia resolves. If COPIKTRA is resumed, administer the same or reduced dose and monitor patients for CMV reactivation by PCR or antigen test at least monthly.
Diarrhea or Colitis: Serious, including fatal (1/442; <1%), diarrhea or colitis occurred in 18% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). Median time to onset of any grade diarrhea or colitis was 4 months (range: 1 day to 33 months), with 75% of cases occurring by 8 months. The median event duration was 0.5 months (range: 1 day to 29 months; 75th percentile: 1 month).
Advise patients to report any new or worsening diarrhea. For patients presenting with mild or moderate diarrhea (Grade 1-2) (i.e., up to 6 stools per day over baseline) or asymptomatic (Grade 1) colitis, initiate supportive care with antidiarrheal agents, continue COPIKTRA at the current dose, and monitor the patient at least weekly until the event resolves. If the diarrhea is unresponsive to antidiarrheal therapy, withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g., budesonide). Monitor the patient at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea, consider restarting COPIKTRA at a reduced dose.
For patients presenting with abdominal pain, stool with mucus or blood, change in bowel habits, peritoneal signs, or with severe diarrhea (Grade 3) (i.e., > 6 stools per day over baseline), withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g., budesonide) or systemic steroids. A diagnostic work-up to determine etiology, including colonoscopy, should be performed. Monitor at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea or colitis, restart COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. For recurrent Grade 3 diarrhea or recurrent colitis of any grade, discontinue COPIKTRA. Discontinue COPIKTRA for life-threatening diarrhea or colitis.
Cutaneous Reactions: Serious, including fatal (2/442; <1%), cutaneous reactions occurred in 5% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). Fatal cases included drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Median time to onset of any grade cutaneous reaction was 3 months (range: 1 day to 29 months, 75th percentile: 6 months) with a median event duration of 1 month (range: 1 day to 37 months, 75th percentile: 2 months).
Presenting features for the serious events were primarily described as pruritic, erythematous, or maculo-papular. Less common presenting features include exanthem, desquamation, erythroderma, skin exfoliation, keratinocyte necrosis, and papular rash. Advise patients to report new or worsening cutaneous reactions. Review all concomitant medications and discontinue any medications potentially contributing to the event. For patients presenting with mild or moderate (Grade 1-2) cutaneous reactions, continue COPIKTRA at the current dose, initiate supportive care with emollients, antihistamines (for pruritus), or topical steroids, and monitor the patient closely. Withhold COPIKTRA for severe (Grade 3) cutaneous reaction until resolution. Initiate supportive care with steroids (topical or systemic) or antihistamines (for pruritus). Monitor at least weekly until resolved. Upon resolution of the event, restart COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. Discontinue COPIKTRA if severe cutaneous reaction does not improve, worsens, or recurs. For life-threatening cutaneous reactions, discontinue COPIKTRA. In patients with SJS, TEN, or DRESS of any grade, discontinue COPIKTRA.
Pneumonitis: Serious, including fatal (1/442; <1%), pneumonitis without an apparent infectious cause occurred in 5% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). Median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis was 4 months (range: 9 days to 27 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 9 months. The median event duration was 1 month, with 75% of cases resolving by 2 months.
Withhold COPIKTRA in patients with new or progressive pulmonary signs and symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, interstitial infiltrates on a radiologic exam, or a decline by more than 5% in oxygen saturation, and evaluate for etiology. If the pneumonitis is infectious, patients may be restarted on COPIKTRA at the previous dose once the infection, pulmonary signs and symptoms resolve. For moderate non-infectious pneumonitis (Grade 2), treat with systemic corticosteroids and resume COPIKTRA at a reduced dose upon resolution. If non-infectious pneumonitis recurs or does not respond to steroid therapy, discontinue COPIKTRA. For severe or life-threatening non-infectious pneumonitis, discontinue COPIKTRA and treat with systemic steroids.
Hepatotoxicity: Grade 3 and 4 ALT and/or AST elevation developed in 8% and 2%, respectively, of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). Two percent of patients had both an ALT or AST > 3 X ULN and total bilirubin > 2 X ULN. Median time to onset of any grade transaminase elevation was 2 months (range: 3 days to 26 months), with a median event duration of 1 month (range: 1 day to 16 months).
Monitor hepatic function during treatment with COPIKTRA. For Grade 2 ALT/AST elevation (> 3 to 5 X ULN), maintain COPIKTRA dose and monitor at least weekly until return to < 3 X ULN. For Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation (> 5 to 20 X ULN), withhold COPIKTRA and monitor at least weekly until return to < 3 X ULN. Resume COPIKTRA at the same dose (first occurrence) or at a reduced dose for subsequent occurrences. For grade 4 ALT/AST elevation (> 20 X ULN), discontinue COPIKTRA.
Neutropenia: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 42% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442), with Grade 4 neutropenia occurring in 24% of all patients. Median time to onset of grade ≥3 neutropenia was 2 months (range: 3 days to 31 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 4 months.
Monitor neutrophil counts at least every 2 weeks for the first 2 months of COPIKTRA therapy, and at least weekly in patients with neutrophil counts < 1.0 Gi/L (Grade 3-4). Withhold COPIKTRA in patients presenting with neutrophil counts < 0.5 Gi/L (Grade 4). Monitor until ANC is > 0.5 Gi/L, then resume COPIKTRA at same dose for the first occurrence or at a reduced dose for subsequent occurrences.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, COPIKTRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Conduct pregnancy testing before initiating COPIKTRA treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with a strong CYP3A inducer may reduce COPIKTRA efficacy. Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers.
CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor may increase the risk of COPIKTRA toxicities. Reduce COPIKTRA dose to 15 mg BID when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.
CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of COPIKTRA with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates may increase the risk of toxicities of these drugs. Consider reducing the dose of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate and monitor for signs of toxicities of the coadministered sensitive CYP3A substrate.
About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are cancers that affect lymphocytes and are essentially the same disease, with the only difference being the location where the cancer primarily occurs. When most of the cancer cells are located in the bloodstream and the bone marrow, the disease is referred to as CLL, although the lymph nodes and spleen are often involved. When the cancer cells are located mostly in the lymph nodes, the disease is called SLL. The symptoms of CLL/SLL include a tender, swollen abdomen and feeling full even after eating only a small amount. Other symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, anemia, bruising easily, night sweats, weight loss, and frequent infections. However, many patients with CLL/SLL will live for years without symptoms. There are approximately 200,000 patients in the US affected by CLL/SLL with nearly 20,000 new diagnoses this year alone. While there are therapies currently available, real-world data reveals that a significant number of patients either relapse following treatment, become refractory to current agents, or are unable to tolerate treatment, representing a significant medical need. The potential of additional oral agents, particularly as a monotherapy that can be used in the general community physician’s armamentarium, may hold significant value in the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL.
About Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is typically a slow-growing or indolent form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that arises from B-lymphocytes, making it a B-cell lymphoma. This lymphoma subtype accounts for 20 to 30 percent of all NHL cases, with more than 140,000 people in the US with FL and more than 13,000 newly diagnosed patients this year. Common symptoms of FL include enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, abdomen, or groin, as well as fatigue, shortness of breath, night sweats, and weight loss. Often, patients with FL have no obvious symptoms of the disease at diagnosis. Follicular lymphoma is usually not considered to be curable, but more of a chronic disease, with patients living for many years with this form of lymphoma. The potential of additional oral agents, particularly as a monotherapy that can be used in the general community physician’s armamentarium, may hold significant value in the treatment of patients with FL.
About COPIKTRA™ (duvelisib)
COPIKTRA is an oral inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and the first approved dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma, two enzymes known to help support the growth and survival of malignant B-cells. PI3K signaling may lead to the proliferation of malignant B-cells and is thought to play a role in the formation and maintenance of the supportive tumor microenvironment.2,3,4 COPIKTRA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) after at least two prior therapies and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies.

10722,Rigel Pharmaceuticals' Tavalisse (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) Receives FDA Approval for Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Adults,Rigel Announces FDA Approval of TAVALISSE™ (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) for Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Adult Patients,"The approval is based on three FIT studies results assessing Tavalisse (100/150mg, bid) vs Placebo in 150 patients with chronic ITP in ratio 2:1
 The FIT studies result: FIT-1 (NCT02076399) stable platelets response (SPR) (18% vs 0%); FIT-2 (NCT02076412) SPR (16% vs 4%); FIT-3 (23%)
 Tavalisse (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate, PO) is a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor and has received OD designation in Jan,2018","Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:RIGL) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TAVALISSE™ (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. TAVALISSE is an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor that targets the underlying autoimmune cause of the disease by impeding platelet destruction, providing an important new treatment option for adult patients with chronic ITP. Rigel plans to launch TAVALISSE in the United States in late May 2018.
“Chronic ITP is challenging to treat because the heterogeneity of the disease makes it difficult to predict how an individual patient will respond to available treatments and not all patients can find a treatment that works well for them,” said James Bussel, M.D., professor emeritus of pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine and the principal study investigator on the FIT Phase 3 program. Dr. Bussel has served as a consultant and paid member of the advisory board for Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “The FDA approval of fostamatinib arms physicians with a new treatment option, which works via a novel mechanism.”
The FDA approval of TAVALISSE was supported by data from the FIT clinical program, which included two randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials (Studies 047 and 048) and an open-label extension (Study 049), as well as an initial proof of concept study. The New Drug Application (NDA) included data from 163 ITP patients and was supported by a safety database of more than 4,600 subjects across other indications in which fostamatinib has been evaluated.
“People living with chronic ITP often feel they have an invisible disease — one that can not only impact quality of life, but also be life threatening,” said Caroline Kruse, executive director of the Platelet Disorder Support Association, a patient advocacy organization dedicated to ITP patients. “That’s why we encourage members of our community to learn about their disease, understand treatment strategies, and seek support so that they can advocate for their best care. The availability of a new treatment option provides the ITP community with more choices.”
Different Treatment Approach
TAVALISSE is designed to inhibit SYK, a key signaling component in the body’s immune process that can lead to platelet destruction in ITP patients. TAVALISSE may address an underlying autoimmune cause of ITP by impeding platelet destruction.
“We are excited to bring this new medicine to the population of adult patients with chronic ITP in need of additional therapies. I want to thank the patients, caregivers and physicians who contributed to our fostamatinib clinical program, and also the Rigel team for all of their dedication and hard work to bring the company to this historic day,” said Raul Rodriguez, president and CEO of Rigel Pharmaceuticals. “This regulatory milestone, our first product approval, validates the therapeutic effect of SYK inhibition in an autoimmune disease.”
Rigel will be providing product information at the ASCO Annual Meeting being held June 1-5, 2018 in Chicago, Booth #24160, or you can visit www.TAVALISSE.com.
About ITP
In patients with ITP, the immune system attacks and destroys the body’s own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. Common symptoms of ITP include excessive bruising, bleeding and fatigue. People suffering with chronic ITP may live with an increased risk of severe bleeding events that can result in serious medical complications or even death. Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPOs) and splenectomy. However, not all patients have an adequate treatment response with existing therapies. As a result, there remains a significant medical need for additional treatment options for patients with ITP.
About TAVALISSE
Indication
TAVALISSE™ (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment.
Important Safety Information
Warnings and Precautions
Hypertension can occur with TAVALISSE treatment. Patients with pre-existing hypertension may be more susceptible to the hypertensive effects. Monitor blood pressure every 2 weeks until stable, then monthly, and adjust or initiate antihypertensive therapy for blood pressure control maintenance during therapy. If increased blood pressure persists, TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation may be required.
Elevated liver function tests (LFTs), mainly ALT and AST, can occur with TAVALISSE. Monitor LFTs monthly during treatment. If ALT or AST increase to >3 x upper limit of normal, manage hepatotoxicity using TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation.
Diarrhea occurred in 31% of patients and severe diarrhea occurred in 1% of patients treated with TAVALISSE. Monitor patients for the development of diarrhea and manage using supportive care measures early after the onset of symptoms. If diarrhea becomes severe (≥Grade 3), interrupt, reduce dose or discontinue TAVALISSE.
Neutropenia occurred in 6% of patients treated with TAVALISSE; febrile neutropenia occurred in 1% of patients. Monitor the ANC monthly and for infection during treatment. Manage toxicity with TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation.
TAVALISSE can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise pregnant women the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiating TAVALISSE. It is unknown if TAVALISSE or its metabolite is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during TAVALISSE treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose.
Drug Interactions

Concomitant use of TAVALISSE with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases exposure to the major active metabolite of TAVALISSE (R406), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Monitor for toxicities that may require a reduction in TAVALISSE dose.
It is not recommended to use TAVALISSE with strong CYP3A4 inducers, as concomitant use reduces exposure to R406.
Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of some CYP3A4 substrate drugs and may require a dose reduction of the CYP3A4 substrate drug.
Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of BCRP substrate drugs (eg, rosuvastatin) and P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate drugs (eg, digoxin), which may require a dose reduction of the BCRP and P-gp substrate drug.
Adverse Reactions

Serious adverse drug reactions in the ITP double-blind studies were febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, pneumonia, and hypertensive crisis, which occurred in 1% of TAVALISSE patients. In addition, severe adverse reactions occurred including dyspnea and hypertension (both 2%), neutropenia, arthralgia, chest pain, diarrhea, dizziness, nephrolithiasis, pain in extremity, toothache, syncope, and hypoxia (all 1%).
Common adverse reactions (≥5% and more common than placebo) from FIT-1 and FIT-2 included: diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, dizziness, ALT and AST increased, respiratory infection, rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, chest pain, and neutropenia.

10728,Merck's Pifeltro (doravirine) Receives FDA Approval for Patients with HIV-1 in Appropriate Patients,FDA Approves Merck’s Pifeltro (doravirine) for the Treatment of HIV-1 in Appropriate Patients,"The approval is based on P-III DRIVE-FORWARD study assessing Pifeltro (qd) vs darunavir + ritonavir (DRV+r) (800mg, 100 mg, qd) each in combination with emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF or abacavir (ABC)/3TC in patients with HIV-1 infection
 P-III DRIVE-FORWARD study results: @48 wks. viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL (83% vs 79%); @96 wks. (72% vs 64%); patients discontinued treatment (2% vs 3%) ; LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol (-4.6,-5.4 mg/DL vs 9.5, 13.7 mg/DL)
 Pifeltro (doravirine, 100mg) is a qd NNRTI in combination with antiretroviral medicines indicated and approved for the HIV-1 infection","KENILWORTH, N.J.) Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pifeltro (doravirine, 100 mg), a new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to be administered in combination with other antiretroviral medicines. Pifeltro is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients with no prior antiretroviral treatment experience, and is administered orally once daily with or without food. Pifeltro does not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS.
The FDA also approved Delstrigo, a once-daily fixed-dose combination tablet of doravirine (100 mg), lamivudine (3TC, 300 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, 300 mg).
Pifeltro is contraindicated when co-administered with drugs that are strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A enzyme inducers as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations may occur, which may decrease the effectiveness of Pifeltro.

Data Supporting the Approval of Pifeltro (doravirine)
The FDA approvals of Delstrigo and Pifeltro are based on findings from the pivotal, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active controlled Phase 3 trials, DRIVE-AHEAD and DRIVE-FORWARD, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Delstrigo and Pifeltro, respectively, in participants infected with HIV-1 with no antiretroviral treatment history.

The DRIVE-FORWARD Clinical Trial
In DRIVE-FORWARD, 766 participants with no antiretroviral treatment history were randomized and received at least one dose of either Pifeltro once daily or darunavir 800 mg + ritonavir 100 mg (DRV+r) once daily, each in combination with emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF or abacavir (ABC)/3TC selected by the investigator. Pifeltro demonstrated sustained viral suppression through 48 weeks, meeting its primary endpoint of non-inferior efficacy compared to DRV+r, each in combination with FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC (84% in the Pifeltro group achieved viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL vs. 80% in the DRV+r group; treatment difference: 3.9%, [95% CI:] -1.6%, 9.4%). Of the 20 percent of study participants with a high viral load at baseline (HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL), 77 percent in the Pifeltro group and 74 percent in the DRV+r group achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48.
At Week 48, Pifeltro-treated participants showed statistically significant superior lipid profiles as measured by changes from baseline in LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol (LDL-C: -4.6 mg/dL in the Pifeltro group vs. 9.5 mg/dL in the DRV+r group; treatment difference: -14.4 mg/dL, [95% CI:] -18.0, -10.8, p<0.0001; non-HDL-C: -5.4 mg/DL in the Pifeltro group vs. 13.7 mg/dL in the DRV+r group, treatment difference: -19.4 mg/dL, [95% CI:] -23.4, -15.4, p<0.0001). However, the clinical benefit of these findings has not been demonstrated.
The rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events in either treatment group was low (2% in the Pifeltro group and 3% in the DRV+r group). Clinical adverse reactions of all grades occurring in ≥5 percent of participants in the Pifeltro treatment group included nausea (7%), headache (6%), fatigue (6%), diarrhea (5%) and abdominal pain (5%). No adverse reactions of Grade 2 or higher (moderate or severe) occurred in ≥2 percent of participants treated with Pifeltro.
Pifeltro can be co-administered with a wide range of antiretroviral agents and non-antiretroviral agents. Pifeltro cannot be co-administered with enzalutamide, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifapentine, mitotane or St. John’s wort. If Pifeltro is co-administered with rifabutin, patients need to increase the Pifeltro dosage to one tablet twice daily approximately 12 hours apart. Use of Pifeltro with efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine is not recommended.
No clinically significant changes in concentration have been observed following the co-administration of doravirine and the following drugs: dolutegravir, ritonavir, TDF, 3TC, elbasvir and grazoprevir, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, ketoconazole, aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/simethicone containing antacid, pantoprazole, atorvastatin, an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, metformin, methadone, and midazolam.

Overall Viral Resistance Profile
In the Delstrigo and Pifeltro treatment arms of the DRIVE-AHEAD and DRIVE-FORWARD trials (n=747), a total of 11 participants showed the emergence of doravirine-associated resistance substitutions, among the 28 participants in the resistance analysis subset (participants with HIV-1 RNA >400 copies per mL at virologic failure or early study discontinuation and having resistance data). Of these 11 participants, seven showed both genotypic and phenotypic resistance to doravirine, with at least a 100-fold reduction in susceptibility to doravirine. The other four participants had substitutions that were associated with less than twofold reduction in susceptibility to doravirine.
In the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment arm of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial (n=364), 12 participants showed the emergence of efavirenz-associated resistance substitutions among 20 participants in the resistance analysis subset. In the DRV+r treatment arm of the DRIVE-FORWARD trial (n=383), no participants showed the emergence of DRV+r associated resistance substitutions among the nine participants with resistance data.
Cross-resistance has been observed among NNRTIs, including doravirine. Treatment-emergent doravirine resistance-associated substitutions can confer cross-resistance to efavirenz, rilpivirine, nevirapine and etravirine. No significant cross-resistance has been demonstrated between doravirine-resistant HIV-1 variants and 3TC, FTC or tenofovir or between 3TC or tenofovir-resistant variants and doravirine.

Pifeltro (doravirine) Availability and Access
The approval of Pifeltro comes ahead of the original FDA target action date of Oct. 23, 2018. Merck anticipates that Pifeltro will be stocked through wholesalers within one month. Merck is working to obtain access for patients in government-sponsored programs, including Medicare Part D, Medicaid and AIDS Drug Assistance Programs. Upon approval, Pifeltro will be covered under the Merck Patient Assistance Program and will be available to eligible patients when the medicine is available. Doravirine is also under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Selected Safety Information about Pifeltro (doravirine)
Pifeltro is contraindicated when co-administered with drugs that are strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A enzyme inducers (including the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin; the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide; the antimycobacterials rifampin and rifapentine; the cytotoxic agent mitotane; and the herbal product St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)), as significant decreases in Pifeltro plasma concentrations may occur, which may decrease the effectiveness of Pifeltro. Immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Co-administration of Pifeltro with efavirenz, etravirine or nevirapine is not recommended. If co-administered with rifabutin, increase Pifeltro dosage to one tablet twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart).
Consult the full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for important potential drug-drug interactions. The safety of Pifeltro is based on two studies, DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD. In DRIVE-FORWARD, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%, all intensities) were nausea (7%), headache (6%), fatigue (6%), diarrhea (5%) and abdominal pain (5%). In DRIVE-AHEAD, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%, all intensities) were dizziness (7%), abnormal dreams (5%) and nausea (5%).

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to Pifeltro during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry at 1-800-258-4263. Mothers infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving Pifeltro due to the potential for HIV transmission.

10734,Therapeutics MD's Annovera (Segesterone Acetate/Ethinyl Estradiol) Receives FDA Approval for the Prevention of Pregnancyï»¿,TherapeuticsMD Announces FDA Approval of ANNOVERA (Segesterone Acetate/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal System) for Birth Control,"The approval is based on 17 clinical trials results assessing Annovera in 2,308 women aged ≤35yrs
 The study demonstrated in prevention of 97.3% pregnancy, Pearl Index (PI) 2.98/100 women with overall satisfaction rate is 89%
 Annovera is a combination of estrogen (ethinyl estradiol, 0.15 mg/day) & Nestorone (segesterone acetate,0.013 mg/day) used for prevention of ovulation for a year (13 cycle) without any medical help","TherapeuticsMD, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXMD), an innovative women’s healthcare company, today announced that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ANNOVERA™ (segesterone acetate/ethinyl estradiol vaginal system), the first long-acting prescription birth control that is patient-controlled, procedure-free and reversible. The ANNOVERA contraceptive vaginal system is a small, soft flexible ring that prevents ovulation for an entire year (13 cycles) and can be inserted and removed by a woman at her discretion in repeated four-week cycles (remaining in place continuously for three weeks followed by removal for one week).
The segesterone acetate component of the ANNOVERA contraceptive vaginal system is expected to be classified as a “new chemical entity,” or NCE, by the FDA and thus will likely be entitled to five years of regulatory exclusivity under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. This unique contraceptive vaginal system technology combines low doses of a novel progestin, Nestorone® (segesterone acetate), with a widely used estrogen (ethinyl estradiol). The contraceptive vaginal system works by releasing an average continuous daily dose of 0.15 mg/day of segesterone acetate and 0.013 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol to prevent pregnancy.
“The U.S. contraceptive market is shifting toward long-acting solutions and we believe ANNOVERA represents an exciting new entrant for women and healthcare providers by providing the first woman-controlled, procedure-free, long-acting, reversible birth control product putting the woman in control of both her fertility and menstruation,” said Dr. Brian Bernick, Co-Founder of TherapeuticsMD. “We believe ANNOVERA can help meet the needs of women who are looking for long-acting solutions, including women who have never given birth and women who are not in a monogamous relationship, who are often counseled not to use many of the currently available long-acting contraceptive products.”
ANNOVERA was developed by the global non-profit research organization, Population Council, a leading developer of long-acting, reversible contraceptives. The FDA approval of ANNOVERA is based in part on data from 17 clinical trials, including safety and efficacy data from three open-label trials that included 2,308 healthy women in total. The data showed that ANNOVERA was 97.3% effective in preventing pregnancy when used as directed – making it among the most effective women-controlled methods of contraception. Based on pooled data from the two trials of 2,111 females ≤35 years of age, the primary endpoint Pearl Index (PI) was 2.98 per 100 woman-years of ANNOVERA use. Results from the Phase 3 acceptability sub-study of 905 women support an overall satisfaction rate of 89%, which was related to ease of use, side effects, expulsions/feeling the product and effects during sexual activity. The trials also demonstrated high rates of adherence and continuation for a full year.1 The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation by ≥ 1% of ANNOVERA-treated women included irregular bleeding (metrorrhagia/menorrhagia) (1.7%), headache/migraine (1.3%), vaginal discharge/vulvovaginal mycotic infections (1.3%), and nausea/vomiting (1.2%). Consistent with other combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from CHC use. Women over 35 years old who smoke should not use ANNOVERA. Also consistent with other CHCs, women are at increased risk for a venous thrombotic event (VTE) when using the one-year contraceptive vaginal system. Limited data are available in women with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 29 kg/m2 because this population was excluded from the clinical trials after VTEs were reported. A post-approval observational study will be performed to measure the risk of venous thromboembolism. Important safety information for ANNOVERA, including the boxed warning, is provided below.
“ANNOVERA’s approval and designation as a ‘vaginal system’ potentially creates a new class of contraception that private health plans will be required to cover with no patient out-of-pocket costs under the Affordable Care Act (ACA),” said Robert Finizio, TherapeuticsMD CEO and Co-Founder. “TherapeuticsMD intends to leverage its existing infrastructure to commercialize ANNOVERA. Together with our prescription menopausal hormone products and prenatal vitamins, TherapeuticsMD aims to become the premier women’s healthcare company, offering a full portfolio of products across the woman’s lifespan from contraception and pregnancy through menopause.”
The U.S. market for prescription contraceptives generated more than $5 billion in net sales in 2017.2 An estimated 43 million women in the U.S. are at risk of unintended pregnancy of which 18 million women want to avoid pregnancy and nearly half of all pregnancies that occur each year in the U.S. are unintended.3,4 According to the National Center for Health and Statistics, use of long-acting reversible contraceptives increased nearly 5-fold in the last decade among women aged 15 to 44.5
TherapeuticsMD intends to leverage the Population Council’s existing relationships with the supplier of segesterone acetate and the manufacturer of the clinical trial supply of the one-year contraceptive vaginal system to scale-up commercial manufacturing of ANNOVERA. TherapeuticsMD currently estimates that ANNOVERA will be commercially available as early as the third quarter of 2019 with the commercial launch as early as the fourth quarter of 2019 or first quarter of 2020. The ACA mandates that private health plans provide coverage with no out-of-pocket costs for one treatment per class of in each of the classes identified by the FDA for women in its Birth Control Guide. As part of its license agreement with the Population Council, TherapeuticsMD has agreed to provide significantly reduced pricing to federally designated Title X family planning clinics serving lower-income women.

About ANNOVERA
The ANNOVERA one-year contraceptive vaginal system combines a widely used estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) with a new progestin segesterone acetate (Nestorone®) into a single ring to prevent ovulation for an entire year (13 cycles; used in repeated four-week cycles (remaining in place continuously for three weeks followed by removal for one week)). Designed to empower women to be in complete control of their fertility and menstruation, ANNOVERA represents the first and only long-acting birth control product that is reversible and does not require a medical procedure for insertion or removal. The soft, flexible ring can be inserted and removed by the woman herself and without the help of a healthcare professional. The one-year vaginal system represents a new option for women, including nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) desiring long-acting reversible contraception. The one-year contraceptive vaginal system does not require refrigeration.
Indication
ANNOVERA is a progestin/estrogen CHC indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy. (Limitation of use: Not adequately evaluated in females with a BMI of > 29 kg/m2).
Important Safety Information
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of cardiovascular events from CHC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in females over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked.CHCs should not be used by females who are over 35 years of age and smoke.
Due to increased risks of serious side effects, ANNOVERA should not be used in females with certain medical conditions, including females who have a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases; who have or have had breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancer; who have liver tumors, acute hepatitis, severe cirrhosis, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, or hypersensitivity to any ingredients in ANNOVERA; who use certain Hepatitis C drug combinations; or who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Risks from use of a CHC, like ANNOVERA, particularly in females with any condition listed above, include venous thrombotic events; cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events such as stroke and myocardial infarction; liver disease; elevated liver enzymes with concomitant Hepatitis C treatment; hypertension; carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects; headache; bleeding irregularities and amenorrhea.
ANNOVERA does not protect against HIV-infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections.

– Broad Product Label for Treatment of cIAI –

– Commercial Launch Expected in the Fourth Quarter of 2018 –

– Conference Call Scheduled for Today at 4:30 p.m. ET –

WATERTOWN, Mass., — Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTPH), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel antibiotics to treat life-threatening multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval of XERAVA™ (eravacycline) for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). In clinical trials, XERAVA was well-tolerated and achieved high clinical cure rates in patients with cIAI, demonstrating statistical non-inferiority to two widely used comparators – ertapenem and meropenem.
XERAVA is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in patients 18 years of age and older. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XERAVA and other antibacterial drugs, XERAVA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.
“The approval of XERAVA is an extraordinary achievement, one for which we thank the patients who have participated in our clinical studies, study investigators and physicians as well as our dedicated employees,” said Guy Macdonald, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tetraphase. “We are thrilled to have received FDA approval, and a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in Europe all within the same quarter. Each milestone is a significant accomplishment on its own and achieving both underscores the potential for Tetraphase and the medical need for XERAVA.”
Mr. Macdonald added, “We will now turn our efforts towards delivering XERAVA to patients suffering from cIAI in the United States, an important goal we expect to begin executing on in the fourth quarter of this year. We look forward to a successful launch and commercialization moving forward.”
“Complicated intra-abdominal infections are the second-most prevalent infection site in intensive care units (ICUs), as well as the second leading cause of infection-related mortality in ICUs,” said Philip S. Barie, MD, MBA, Professor of Surgery and Professor of Public Health in Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, and an attending surgeon at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. “With the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance, treatment options for these polymicrobial infections are limited following surgery or percutaneous drainage, and the causative pathogens may be multi-drug resistant. Current empiric treatments for cIAI have limitations, and there is a need for new and novel treatments. Eravacycline has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and a clinical profile that addresses this unmet medical need.”
Dr. Barie added, “Eravacycline also has a favorable safety profile as observed in clinical trials, and no dose adjustment is required when given to patients with renal impairment, which is advantageous for seriously ill patients who may have impaired kidney function. Additionally, the drug may be given safely to patients who are allergic to penicillin. This new and novel treatment may be of great benefit to patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections.”
Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) is a common problem in clinical practice and comprises a wide variety of disease processes. IAI is classified as uncomplicated or complicated based on the extent of the infection. Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) extend beyond the source organ into the peritoneal space (the space between the two membranes that separate the organs in the abdominal cavity from the abdominal wall) as a result of perforation or other damage to the gastrointestinal tract. cIAI diagnoses include intra-abdominal abscess, stomach or intestinal perforation, peritonitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis, or diverticulitis. Different bacterial pathogens are responsible for cIAI, including Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria. Early detection, containment and appropriate antimicrobial treatment are essential to the successful treatment of IAI. This is even more critical with increasing rates of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria, which limit the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics.
“Today’s FDA approval of XERAVA provides a new weapon in the battle against antibiotic resistance and addresses an unmet medical need for patients suffering from multi-drug resistant infections and other serious infections” said Rick A. Bright Ph.D., Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). “We are pleased to have provided support to Tetraphase since 2012, through its collaboration with CUBRC, to develop this new antibiotic treatment. The drug’s approval underscores the value of public-private partnerships in addressing global health threats and the challenge of antibiotic resistance.”

Important Safety Information
XERAVA is a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of complicated intra‑abdominal infections in patients 18 years of age and older.
XERAVA is not indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections.
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XERAVA and other antibacterial drugs, XERAVA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.
XERAVA is contraindicated for use in patients with known hypersensitivity to eravacycline or to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. Life-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with XERAVA.
The use of XERAVA during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia.
The use of XERAVA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth.
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.
The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials (incidence ≥ 3%) were infusion site reactions, nausea, and vomiting.
XERAVA is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions.

10753,ï»¿Eli Lilly's Olumiant (baricitinib) Receives FDA Approval for Moderately-to-Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in Adults,FDA Approves OLUMIANT (baricitinib) 2-mg Tablets for the Treatment of Adults with Moderately-to-Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis,"The approval is based on P-III RA-BEACON study results assessing Olumiant vs PBO in 527 patients with inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies
 P-III RA-BEACON study results: ACR20 (49% vs 27%) physical function based on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) before/ after treatment (1.71, 1.78/ 1.31, 1.59)
 Olumiant (baricitinib, 2mg) is an oral drug indicated for patients with RA who have inadequate response to TNF antagonist therapies and is approved in 50 countries including the US, EU and Japan. In Dec,2009 Lilly and Incyte collaborated to develop and commercialize Olumiant for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases","The approval of OLUMIANT is based on the Phase 3 clinical trial program that demonstrated efficacy for difficult to treat patients1

INDIANAPOLIS,- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the 2-mg dose of OLUMIANT® (baricitinib), a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies.1 Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.1 OLUMIANT may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic DMARDs.1 
“We are pleased to provide RA patients in the U.S. an effective treatment option with OLUMIANT, as people with RA who have had an inadequate response to TNF inhibitors are generally considered to be some of the most difficult to treat RA patients,” said Christi Shaw, president, Lilly Bio-Medicines.
The OLUMIANT clinical trial program included the RA-BEACON study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which patients were randomly assigned to receive OLUMIANT 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg or placebo, in addition to conventional DMARDs that they were currently using.1 This study included 527 patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies.1 Patients could have had prior therapy with other bDMARDs.1
The study results showed that significantly higher ACR20 response rates and improvement in all individual ACR20 component scores were observed at Week 12 with OLUMIANT.1 The study found that patients treated with OLUMIANT had significantly higher rates of ACR20 response versus placebo-treated patients at Week 12 (49% of OLUMIANT-treated patients versus 27% of placebo-treated patients).1 OLUMIANT also demonstrated early symptom relief, with ACR20 responses seen as early as Week 1.1 Patients treated with OLUMIANT reported significant improvements in physical function based on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) (recording an average score of 1.71 before treatment and 1.31 at Week 12) compared to placebo-treated patients (who recorded an average score of 1.78 before treatment and 1.59 at Week 12).1
OLUMIANT is approved with a Boxed Warning for the risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.1 Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis and bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients receiving OLUMIANT.1 Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with OLUMIANT as well.1 Additionally, thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and arterial thrombosis, some fatal, have occurred in patients treated with OLUMIANT.1 Other warnings and precautions include gastrointestinal perforations, laboratory abnormalities (including neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, liver enzyme elevations, and lipid elevations) and a warning against the use of live vaccines with OLUMIANT.1 The most common adverse events (occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of OLUMIANT 2 mg- and baricitinib 4 mg-treated patients in placebo-controlled trials) included upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, herpes simplex and herpes zoster.1 See Important Safety Information including Boxed Warning below.
As part of the approval, the companies have agreed to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the long-term safety of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
“Despite the advancements we’ve seen in the RA treatment landscape over the past several decades, many patients are still failing to achieve their disease management goals,” said Seth Ginsberg, co-founder and president of CreakyJoints and the Global Healthy Living Foundation. “As it’s important for RA patients to have multiple treatment options available to best suit their disease characteristics and experiences, the approval of OLUMIANT is very encouraging for our community.”
RA is a chronic, painful and progressive form of arthritis.2-3 It is estimated that about two-thirds of established RA patients will not reach clinical remission with their first TNF inhibitor therapy, and a significant percentage will not maintain efficacy as time goes on.4
“In my clinical practice, I continue to see patients who experience debilitating symptoms and who are waiting for a medicine that may be right for them,” said Elizabeth L. Perkins, M.D., Rheumatology Care Center, Birmingham, Alabama. “OLUMIANT is an important option for rheumatologists to help address these patients’ unmet needs.”
“RA patients continue to experience unique challenges accessing the treatments prescribed by their healthcare providers. Therefore, we are determined to continue our work with stakeholders to demonstrate value across the healthcare system so providers have greater choice in prescribing treatments to fit individual patient needs,” said Shaw.
Lilly will launch OLUMIANT in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter of 2018. The price of OLUMIANT will be 60% less than the leading TNF inhibitor.5 Lilly will be offering a patient support program, Olumiant Together™. For more information about this program, please call 1-844-OLUMIANT.
Incyte is now eligible to receive a $100 million milestone payment from Lilly as a result of the OLUMIANT approval, which Incyte expects to recognize in the second quarter of 2018.
Indications and Usage
OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets
WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with OLUMIANT are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt OLUMIANT until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:
Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating OLUMIANT and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to OLUMIANT use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of OLUMIANT prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.
Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with OLUMIANT, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.
MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with OLUMIANT.
THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with OLUMIANT compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with OLUMIANT included pneumonia, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with OLUMIANT. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid OLUMIANT in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating OLUMIANT in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Monitor patients for infections during and after OLUMIANT treatment. Interrupt OLUMIANT if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume OLUMIANT until the infection is controlled.
Tuberculosis – Before initiating OLUMIANT, evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimicrobial therapy. OLUMIANT should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating OLUMIANT in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during OLUMIANT treatment.
Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt OLUMIANT treatment until the episode resolves.
The impact of OLUMIANT on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating OLUMIANT.
MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in OLUMIANT clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of OLUMIANT prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing OLUMIANT in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with OLUMIANT. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in OLUMIANT-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use OLUMIANT with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.
GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in OLUMIANT clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use OLUMIANT with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.
LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
Neutropenia – OLUMIANT treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in OLUMIANT clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with OLUMIANT, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in OLUMIANT clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Liver Enzyme Elevations – OLUMIANT treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to ≥5x and ≥10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in OLUMIANT clinical trials.
Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt OLUMIANT until this diagnosis is excluded.
Lipid Elevations – Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following OLUMIANT initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.
VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with OLUMIANT. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating OLUMIANT therapy.

About OLUMIANT
OLUMIANT is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF inhibitor therapies.1 There are four known JAK enzymes: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. JAK-dependent cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.6 OLUMIANT has greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.1 OLUMIANT is approved in more than 40 countries.
About Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and progressive destruction of joints.2,3 Approximately three times as many women as men have the disease.7 Current treatment of RA includes the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) — such as methotrexate, the current standard of care, and injectable, biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) that target selected mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of RA.7 Despite current treatment options, many patients do not reach their therapeutic goals.9,10 There remains an important need to provide additional treatment options to improve overall patient care.

10756,GSK's Krintafel (tafenoquine) Receives FDA Approval Preventing the Relapse of P.vivax Malariaï»¿,US FDA approves Krintafel (tafenoquine) for the radical cure of P. vivax malaria,"The approval is based on Detective Part 1 & Part 2 (TAF112582) and Gather (TAF116564) studies results assessing Krintafel (tafenoquine, 300mg) in 800 patients with relapse P.vivax malaria
 The study demonstrated with safety & effective results in global clinical development P.vivax relapse program built in collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture(MMV)
 Krintafel (tafenoquine, 300mg) is a novel single dose 8-aminoquinoline used as anti-relapse of P.vivax malaria, active against all stages of P.vivax lifecycle with its awaited TGA, Australia. Additionally, GSK received priority review voucher from FDA for Krintafel’s approval","GSK and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved, under Priority Review, single-dose Krintafel(tafenoquine) for the radical cure (prevention of relapse) of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) malaria in patients aged 16 years and older who are receiving appropriate antimalarial therapy for acute P. vivax infection.
Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, GSK, said: “Today’s approval of Krintafel, the first new treatment for Plasmodium vivax malaria in over 60 years, is a significant milestone for people living with this type of relapsing malaria. Together with our partner, Medicines for Malaria Venture, we believe Krintafel will be an important medicine for patients with malaria and contribute to the ongoing effort to eradicate this disease.”
Dr. David Reddy, Chief Executive Officer of MMV said: “The US FDA’s approval of Krintafel is a major milestone and a significant contribution towards global efforts to eradicate malaria. The world has waited decades for a new medicine to counter P. vivax malaria relapse. Today, we can say the wait is over. Moreover, as the first ever single-dose for this indication, Krintafelwill help improve patient compliance. We are proud to have worked side-by-side with GSK for more than a decade to reach this point. Our focus is now on working to ensure the medicine reaches the vulnerable patients that need it most.”
The approval was based on efficacy and safety data from a comprehensive global clinical development P. vivax radical cure programme designed in agreement with the FDA. Thirteen studies in healthy volunteers and patients directly supported the programme. The primary evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of the 300mg single-dose, to which more than 800 subjects were exposed, was provided by three randomised, double-blind studies: DETECTIVE Part 1 and Part 2 (TAF112582) and GATHER (TAF116564). The results of the two phase III studies were announced in June 2017. The submission included data analysed from a total of thirty-three studies involving more than 4,000 trial subjects exposed to the 300mg single-dose and other doses of tafenoquine.
With the approval of Krintafel, the FDA awarded GSK a tropical disease priority review voucher. The tropical disease priority review voucher programme is designed to encourage development of new drugs and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain neglected tropical diseases affecting millions of people throughout the world.
The new drug application (NDA) was submitted by GSK to the FDA in November 2017 and a regulatory submission was also made to the Australian Therapeutics Good Administration (TGA) in December 2017. A decision from the TGA is awaited. Approvals by FDA and TGA will be informative to other regulatory agencies for their own approval process in malaria-endemic countries where tafenoquine will be provided as a not-for-profit medicine to maximise access to those who need it most.
About Krintafel (tafenoquine)
Krintafel is an 8-aminoquinoline derivative with activity against all stages of the P. vivaxlifecycle, including hypnozoites. It was first synthesised by scientists at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in 1978. GSK’s legacy in the research and development of tafenoquine as a potential medicine for malaria commenced over 20 years ago. In 2008, GSK entered into a collaboration with the not-for-profit drug research partnership, MMV, to develop tafenoquine as an anti-relapse medicine for patients infected with P. vivax. The tafenoquine clinical programme is part of GSK’s global health programme aimed at improving healthcare for vulnerable populations.
About Plasmodium vivax malaria
The Plasmodium parasite is a complex organism with a lifecycle spanning both humans and mosquitoes. After an infected mosquito bite, the P. vivax parasite infects the blood and causes an acute malaria episode. It also has the ability to lie dormant in the liver (in a form known as hypnozoite) from where it periodically reactivates to cause relapses of P. vivax malaria. Hence, a single P. vivax infection can give rise to multiple episodes of malaria, in the absence of a new mosquito bite. These relapses can occur weeks, months or even years after the initial infection. The dormant liver forms of the parasite cannot be readily treated with most anti-malarial treatments active against the blood-stage parasite. The 8-aminoquinoline, primaquine, is currently the only FDA approved medicine that targets the dormant liver stage to prevent relapse. It must be taken for 14 days to be effective, a regimen that is associated with poor compliance.
The use of a medicine that targets the dormant liver forms of the parasite, co-administered with currently available anti-malarials such as chloroquine or artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) is known as radical cure.
P. vivax malaria has a significant public health and economic impact, primarily in South-Asia, South-East Asia, Latin America and the horn of Africa. The disease is estimated to cause around 8.5 million clinical infections every year. The clinical features of P. vivax malaria include fever, chills, vomiting, malaise, headache and muscle pain, and in some cases, can lead to severe malaria and be fatal.
GSK’s commitment to malaria
Malaria remains one of the greatest global healthcare challenges. Whilst good progress has been made in the fight against malaria this progress is fragile. GSK supports the WHO target to cut malaria cases and deaths by 90% by 2030 and believes that with renewed global commitment from all stakeholders working together, this goal can be met. GSK is playing its part by building on its 40-year commitment to work with partners to fight malaria in the lab and on the ground.
Important safety information
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Krintafel should not be administered to:
patients who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or have not been tested for G6PD deficiency
patients who are breastfeeding a child known to have G6PD deficiency or one that has not been tested for G6PD deficiency
patients who are allergic to tafenoquine or any of the ingredients in Krintafel or who have had an allergic reaction to similar medicines containing 8-aminoquinolines.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Hemolytic Anemia
Breakdown of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia) may occur in a patient who has G6PD deficiency. G6PD testing must be performed before prescribing Krintafel. Treatment with Krintafel is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency or unknown G6PD.
G6PD Deficiency in Pregnancy or Lactation
The use of Krintafel during pregnancy may cause hemolytic anemia in a G6PD-deficient fetus. Krintafel is not recommended during pregnancy. Females of reproductive potential should avoid pregnancy or use effective contraception for 3 months after the dose of Krintafel.
A G6PD-deficient infant may be at risk for hemolytic anemia from exposure to Krintafelthrough breast milk. Infant G6PD status should be checked before breastfeeding begins. Krintafel is contraindicated in breastfeeding women when the infant is found to be G6PD deficient or the G6PD status of the infant is unknown. A woman with a G6PD-deficient infant or if the G6PD status of the infant is not known should not breastfeed for 3 months after the dose of Krintafel.
Methemoglobinemia
Asymptomatic elevations in methemoglobin have been observed in the clinical trials of Krintafel. Physicians should carefully monitor individuals with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent methemoglobin reductase deficiency and advise patients to seek medical attention if signs of methemoglobinemia occur.
Psychiatric Effects
Serious psychiatric adverse reactions have been observed in patients with a previous history of psychiatric conditions at doses higher than the approved dose. The benefit of treatment with Krintafel must be weighed against the potential risk for psychiatric adverse reactions in patients with a history of psychiatric illness. Due to the long half-life of Krintafel (15 days), any signs or symptoms of psychiatric adverse reactions that may occur could be delayed in onset and/or duration.
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema) have been observed with administration of Krintafel. Due to the long half-life of Krintafel (15 days), any signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity adverse reactions that may occur could be delayed in onset and/or duration.

10759,AstraZeneca's Lokelma Receives FDA's Approval for Patients with Hyperkalaemia in Adults,Lokelma approved in the US for the treatment of adults with hyperkalaemia,"The approval is based on five studies assessing Lokelma vs PBO in patients with hyperkalaemia
 The study resulted in onset of action was at 1.0 hour and the median time to achieving normal potassium levels in the blood was 2.2 hours, 92% of patients achieved normal potassium level in 48 hrs. and was effective for 12 mos.
 Lokelma insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate formerly known as ZS-9, and has received EU’s approval on 22 Mar,2018","Lokelma provides rapid and sustained potassium control for patients
in a condition with high unmet need
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), formerly ZS-9, for the treatment of adults with hyperkalaemia,1 a serious condition characterised by elevated potassium levels in the blood associated with cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases.2
The risk of hyperkalaemia increases significantly for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and for those who take common medications for heart failure (HF), such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, which can increase potassium in the blood.2,3 To help prevent the recurrence of hyperkalaemia, RAAS-inhibitor therapy is often modified or discontinued, which can compromise cardio-renal outcomes and increase the risk of death.3,4
Sean Bohen, Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Chief Medical Officer at AstraZeneca, said: “We are pleased by today’s FDA approval of Lokelma as it enables us to help address a long-standing clinical need with a new medicine that offers rapid and sustained treatment for adults with hyperkalaemia. The consequences of hyperkalaemia can be very serious and it’s reassuring for treating physicians that Lokelma has demonstrated lowering of potassium levels in patients with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes and those taking RAAS inhibitors.”
Lokelma is a highly-selective, oral potassium-removing agent.1 The FDA approval is supported by data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and two open-label trials, which showed that for patients receiving Lokelma the onset of action was at 1.0 hour and the median time to achieving normal potassium levels in the blood was 2.2 hours, with 92% of patients achieving normal potassium levels within 48 hours from baseline.1,8 The treatment effect was maintained for up to 12 months.1,5,6,7,8
Steven Fishbane, MD, Professor, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra Northwell, New York, said: “This FDA approval represents an exciting milestone, as it stands to deliver a rapid, effective and generally well-tolerated treatment option to patients suffering from hyperkalaemia in the US.”
The European Commission granted marketing authorisation for Lokelma in the European Union on 22 March 2018.
NOTES TO EDITORS
About Hyperkalaemia
The risk of hyperkalaemia increases significantly for patients with CKD and for those who take common medications for HF, such as RAAS inhibitors, which can increase potassium in the blood. Hyperkalaemia occurs in 23% to 47% of patients with CKD and/or HF, with an estimated 200 million and 38 million people, respectively, living with each condition worldwide. Hyperkalaemia may lead to cardiac arrest and death, with mortality being up to 30% in patients with severe hyperkalaemia, if not treated rapidly.
About Lokelma
Lokelma is an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension, that acts as a highly-selective potassium-removing agent. It is administered orally, is odourless, tasteless and stable at room temperature. It has been studied in three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and in two 12-month open label clinical trials in adult patients with hyperkalaemia.

 The study resulted in 50% reduction of monthly migraine days sustained up to 15 months with the use of acute migraine drugs
 Aimovig (erenumab-aooe) is a novel drug used for targeting Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Receptor (CGRP-R), with its awaited EMA approval","Migraine is a Severe Neurologic Disease That Profoundly Impacts Millions of Patients in the United StatesAimovig is the First and Only FDA-Approved Treatment to Block the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Receptor (CGRP-R), Which Plays an Important Role in MigraineAimovig was Consistently Shown to Reduce Monthly Migraine Days, Including in More Difficult-to-Treat Populations, With Many Patients Achieving at Least a 50 Percent Reduction

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., — Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Aimovig™ (erenumab-aooe) for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. Aimovig is a novel therapeutic approach as the first and only FDA-approved treatment specifically developed to prevent migraine by blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRP-R) – which is believed to play a critical role in migraine. Aimovig 70 mg is self-administered once monthly via Amgen’s device, the SureClick® autoinjector, and does not require a loading dose. Some patients may benefit from a dosage of 140 mg once monthly.

“Migraine is a serious neurological disease that has dramatic effects on patients’ lives. Migraine patients experience excruciating headache pain, often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, and many live in constant dread of the next attack,” said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. “The FDA approval of Aimovig represents a long-awaited and important therapeutic development for patients and their physicians who are in need of additional treatment options for the prevention of migraine.”
In Phase 2 and 3 studies in chronic and episodic migraine, Aimovig resulted in significant reductions in monthly migraine days and use of acute migraine medications compared to placebo. These effects on monthly migraine days have been shown to be sustained for up to 15 months in an ongoing open-label extension study in episodic migraine (four to 14 headache days per month).
A dedicated Phase 3b study (LIBERTY) in difficult-to-treat populations – those with episodic migraine who have failed two to four prior treatments – showed that patients taking Aimovig had nearly three-fold higher odds of having their migraine days cut by half or more compared to placebo.
The efficacy, tolerability and safety of Aimovig has been assessed in more than 3,000 patients, including LIBERTY and an ongoing open-label extension of up to five years in duration. In clinical studies of Aimovig, the most common adverse reactions were injection site reactions and constipation.
“Having a treatment designed to specifically address the complex nature of migraine is an important and welcome step forward in headache medicine. Aimovig offers self-administration with proven efficacy across a spectrum of patients, including in those who have previously tried other preventive therapies without success,” said Stewart J. Tepper, M.D., professor of neurology at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. “Importantly, in clinical trials, Aimovig patients were able to start and stay on therapy – with a discontinuation rate of two percent due to adverse events – and experienced sustained migraine prevention.”
“For years, the migraine community has been advocating for new treatment options that are specifically designed to treat migraine, a debilitating and often stigmatized disease,” said Kevin Lenaburg, executive director of the Coalition For Headache And Migraine Patients (CHAMP), which represents 12 national headache and migraine patient advocacy groups. “Today we celebrate the tireless work of researchers to better understand the biology of migraine and their ability to bring a new therapeutic approach to the millions of Americans who are seeking fewer migraine days. On behalf of the community, we would also like to thank the thousands of clinical trial patients whose unwavering commitment made this progress possible.”
Amgen and Novartis are committed to supporting the migraine community and to helping appropriate patients with affordable access to Aimovig. The Aimovig Ally™ product support program has been created to help patients navigate insurance coverage and identify potential access resources for those who are uninsured or underinsured.
The U.S. list price of Aimovig is $575 for once monthly 70 or 140 mg single-use prefilled SureClick® autoinjector(s), or $6,900 annually. The price of Aimovig reflects the value it brings to patients and society, including the financial impact on sufferers, caregivers and employers, while also factoring in critical issues such as patient affordability, and fair and timely access.
While out-of-pocket costs will vary depending on insurance status, the Aimovig Copay Program may be able to help reduce a patient’s out-of-pocket costs to as little as $5 per month for eligible patients with commercial insurance. For more information about Aimovig Ally™ and the Aimovig Copay Program, please visit www.aimovig.com.
Aimovig is expected to be available to patients within one week.
“In addition to bringing a new therapeutic option to patients in the U.S., Amgen also has a commitment to reshape the public’s perception of this stigmatized disease,” said Anthony C. Hooper, executive vice president of Global Commercial Operations at Amgen. “We have pledged a mission to help change misconceptions, stereotyping and even judgment that people with migraine face on a daily basis. Through educational programs and initiatives, we hope to promote more meaningful connectivity and dialogue among patients, physicians, employers and payers.”
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Aimovig is under review. The companies expect approval in the EU in the coming months.

About Aimovig™ (erenumab-aooe)
Aimovig is the only FDA-approved treatment specifically developed to prevent migraine by blocking the CGRP-R, which is associated with migraine. Aimovig has been studied in several large global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess its efficacy and safety in migraine prevention. More than 3,000 patients have participated in the Aimovig clinical program across four placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies and their open-label extensions.
About LIBERTY
LIBERTY (NCT03096834) is a Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Aimovig in patients with episodic migraine (defined in the trial as four to 14 migraine days per month at baseline) who have failed up to four prior preventive treatments for migraine. In the study, 246 participants with episodic migraine who had two to four previous treatment failures were randomized to receive Aimovig 140 mg or placebo during the 12-week double-blind treatment phase. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with at least a 50 percent reduction of monthly migraine days from baseline over the last four weeks of the double-blind treatment phase of the study (weeks 9-12).1
U.S. Aimovig Indication
Aimovig is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.
U.S. Aimovig Important Safety Information
The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies (≥ 3% of Aimovig™-treated patients and more often than placebo) were injection site reactions and constipation.

About Migraine
People with frequent migraine may lose more than half their life to migraine. They endure debilitating pain, physical impairment, and live in constant dread of the next attack – all of which is compounded by a widespread misperception of the disease.2 The 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study ranks migraine among the top 10 causes of years lived with disability worldwide.3 Migraine is associated with personal and societal burdens of pain, disability, and financial cost, and it remains under-recognized and under-treated.2
About Amgen and Novartis Neuroscience Collaboration
In August 2015, Amgen entered into a global collaboration with Novartis to develop and commercialize pioneering treatments in the field of migraine and Alzheimer’s disease. The collaboration focuses on investigational Amgen drugs in the migraine field, including Aimovig (approved by the FDA in May 2018 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults) and AMG 301 (currently in Phase 2 development). In April 2017, the collaboration was expanded to include co-commercialization of Aimovig in the U.S. For the migraine programs, Amgen retains exclusive commercialization rights in the U.S. (other than for Aimovig as described above) and Japan, and Novartis has exclusive commercialization rights in Europe, Canada and rest of world. Also, the companies are collaborating in the development and commercialization of a beta-secretase 1 (BACE) inhibitor program in Alzheimer’s disease. The oral therapy CNP520 (currently in Phase 3 for Alzheimer’s disease) is the lead molecule and further compounds from both companies’ pre-clinical BACE inhibitor programs may be considered as follow-on molecules. At the center of the Amgen and Novartis neuroscience collaboration is the shared mission to fight migraine and the stereotypes and misperceptions surrounding this debilitating disease.
About the Amgen and Novartis Migraine Mission
Migraine has gone under-appreciated and under-treated for too long. In addition to bringing Aimovig to market, Amgen and Novartis have committed to leading the charge together against migraine misperceptions. Through outreach and education our goal is to challenge public perception of migraine disease, assist people in getting the treatment they need and facilitate informed communication among people with migraine and those who live and work with them, including co-workers, employers and insurers. Future initiatives will include a focus on addressing how stigma against migraine manifests in the workplace: migraine gets in between people and their careers, and in between employee and employer. We hope our workplace program will serve as an example to coworkers, employers and human resources to help each party understand why and how they should treat migraine as a serious disease.

Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.
Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by several events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

10771,Agios Pharmaceuticals' Tibsovo (ivosidenib) Receives Approval For R/R Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and IDH1 Mutationï»¿,"FDA Grants Approval of TIBSOVO, the First Oral, Targeted Therapy for Adult Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia and an IDH1 Mutation","The approval is based on P-I AG120-C-011 (NCT02074839) study results assessing Tibsovo (ivosidenib, 500mg) in 174 patients with r/r AML and IDH1 mutation aged 67 yrs.
 P-I AG120-C-011 study results: CR+CRh rate 32.8%; CR rate 24.7%; median CR+CRh 8.2 mos.; median time to best response of CR or CRh 2.0mos.; median duration to exposure 3.9mos.; 41/110 (37.3%) patient became independent from RBC or platelet transfusion; 21/174 (12%) are on stem cell transplantation + Tibsovo treatment
 Tibsovo (ivosidenib, 500mg) is a novel PO isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) inhibitor targeted for r/r AML with IDH1 mutation","Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGIO), a leader in the field of cellular metabolism to treat cancer and rare genetic diseases, today announced that TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib) was granted approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation as detected by an FDA approved test. TIBSOVO®, an oral, targeted inhibitor of the IDH1 enzyme, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation1.

“The FDA approval of TIBSOVO® – our first wholly owned drug and the second approved medicine from our research platform in less than a year – is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company and, importantly, for the approximately 6-10% of AML patients with an IDH1 mutation who have been waiting for new treatment options that work radically different than conventional chemotherapy,” said David Schenkein, M.D., chief executive officer at Agios. “I want to thank the patients and their caregivers, nurses and physicians who participated in our clinical trials. With their support and the dedication of Agios’ employees, we are well on our way to becoming a sustainable multi-product biopharmaceutical company delivering medicines that have the potential to change how serious diseases are treated.”

AML is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow marked by rapid disease progression and is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults with approximately 20,000 new cases estimated in the U.S. each year.3,4 The majority of patients with AML eventually relapse. Relapsed or refractory AML has a poor prognosis.5 The five-year survival rate is approximately 27%.3 For 6 to 10 percent of AML patients, the mutated IDH1 enzyme blocks normal blood stem cell differentiation, contributing to the genesis of acute leukemia.2

“AML patients who relapse or are refractory to available therapies have few, if any, treatment options,” said Hagop M. Kantarjian, M.D., professor and chair of the Department of Leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “The clinical study demonstrated that TIBSOVO® has the potential to deliver strong, durable responses as a single agent and can help patients achieve and maintain transfusion independence. IDH inhibitors represent a new class of noncytotoxic, targeted therapies for AML patients with IDH mutations.”

TIBSOVO® Safety and Efficacy Data1

The FDA approval was based on the clinical data from an open-label, single-arm, multicenter dose-escalation and expansion trial of adult patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation (Study AG120-C-001, NCT02074839). TIBSOVO® was approved concurrently with the Abbott RealTime™ IDH1 companion diagnostic test for selection of patients with R/R AML for treatment with TIBSOVO®.

The efficacy of TIBSOVO® was evaluated in 174 adult patients with R/R AML with an IDH1 mutation identified or confirmed by the Abbott RealTime™ IDH1 assay. TIBSOVO® was given orally at a starting dose of 500 mg daily until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients had a median age of 67 years (range of 18 to 87) and received a median of two prior anticancer therapies (ranging from one to six). More than half (63%) were refractory to previous therapy and 33% had secondary AML. The primary endpoint is the combined complete remission (CR) and complete remission with partial hematologic improvement (CRh) rate. CRh is defined as <5% of blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets >50,000/microliter and ANC >500/microliter).

In this trial, TIBSOVO® demonstrated:

CR+CRh rate of 32.8% (57 of 174 patients) (95% CI: 25.8, 40.3).
The CR rate was 24.7% (43 of 174 patients) (95% CI 18.5, 31.8) and the CRh rate was 8% (14 of 174 patients) (95% CI 4.5, 13.1).
Median duration of CR+CRh was 8.2 months (95% CI: range 5.6, 12 months).
For patients who achieved a CR or CRh, the median time to best response of CR or CRh was 2.0 months (range, 0.9 to 5.6 months).
Among the 110 patients who were dependent on red blood cell (RBC) and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 41 (37.3%) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56-day post-baseline period.
Of the 64 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline, 38 (59.4%) remained transfusion independent during any 56-day post-baseline period.
Twenty-one of the 174 patients (12%) went on to stem cell transplant following TIBSOVO® treatment.
The safety profile of single-agent TIBSOVO® was evaluated in 179 patients with R/R AML with an IDH1 mutation treated with a dose of 500 mg daily. The median duration of exposure to TIBSOVO® was 3.9 months (range 0.1 to 39.5 months). In the clinical trial, 19% (34/179) of patients treated with TIBSOVO® experienced differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal if not treated. QTc interval prolongation and Guillain-Barré Syndrome occurred in patients treated with TIBSOVO®. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade were fatigue, leukocytosis, arthralgia, diarrhea, dyspnea, edema, nausea, mucositis, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, rash, pyrexia, cough and constipation. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥5%) were differentiation syndrome (10%), leukocytosis (10%) and electrocardiogram QT prolonged (7%).

About TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib)

TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib) is an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. For more information, visit TIBSOVO.com.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME
Patients treated with TIBSOVO have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal if not treated. Symptoms may include fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, rapid weight gain or peripheral edema, hypotension, and hepatic, renal, or multi-organ dysfunction. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Differentiation Syndrome: See Boxed WARNING. In the clinical trial, 19% (34/179) of patients with relapsed or refractory AML treated with TIBSOVO experienced differentiation syndrome. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal if not treated. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with TIBSOVO included noninfectious leukocytosis, peripheral edema, pyrexia, dyspnea, pleural effusion, hypotension, hypoxia, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, pericardial effusion, rash, fluid overload, tumor lysis syndrome, and creatinine increased. Of the 34 patients who experienced differentiation syndrome, 27 (79%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of TIBSOVO. Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 3 months after TIBSOVO initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis.

If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours (or an equivalent dose of an alternative oral or IV corticosteroid) and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement. If concomitant noninfectious leukocytosis is observed, initiate treatment with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis, as clinically indicated. Taper corticosteroids and hydroxyurea after resolution of symptoms and administer corticosteroids for a minimum of 3 days. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroid and/or hydroxyurea treatment. If severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids, interrupt TIBSOVO until signs and symptoms are no longer severe.

QTc Interval Prolongation: Patients treated with TIBSOVO can develop QT (QTc) prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. One patient developed ventricular fibrillation attributed to TIBSOVO. Concomitant use of TIBSOVO with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., anti-arrhythmic medicines, fluoroquinolones, triazole anti-fungals, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists) and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation. Conduct monitoring of electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes. In patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or in those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval, more frequent monitoring may be necessary.

Interrupt TIBSOVO if QTc increases to greater than 480 msec and less than 500 msec. Interrupt and reduce TIBSOVO if QTc increases to greater than 500 msec. Permanently discontinue TIBSOVO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs or symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred in <1% (2/258) of patients treated with TIBSOVO in the clinical study. Monitor patients taking TIBSOVO for onset of new signs or symptoms of motor and/or sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, paresthesias, or difficulty breathing. Permanently discontinue TIBSOVO in patients who are diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade were fatigue (39%), leukocytosis (38%), arthralgia (36%), diarrhea (34%), dyspnea (33%), edema (32%), nausea (31%), mucositis (28%), electrocardiogram QT prolonged (26%), rash (26%), pyrexia (23%), cough (22%), and constipation (20%).
The most frequently reported ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions (≥5%) were electrocardiogram QT prolonged (10%), dyspnea (9%), leukocytosis (8%), tumor lysis syndrome (6%), and differentiation syndrome (5%).
Serious adverse reactions (≥5%) were differentiation syndrome (10%), leukocytosis (10%), and electrocardiogram QT prolonged (7%). There was one case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
DRUG INTERACTIONS

Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce TIBSOVO dose with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Monitor patients for increased risk of QTc interval prolongation.

Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO.

Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO.

QTc Prolonging Drugs: Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO. If co-administration is unavoidable, monitor patients for increased risk of QTc interval prolongation.

LACTATION

Many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TIBSOVO and for at least 1 month after the last dose.

10774,Janssen's Erleada (apalutamide) Receives FDA Approval for Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (NM-CRPC),"ERLEADA (apalutamide), a Next-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor, Granted U.S. FDA Approval for the Treatment of Patients with Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer","The approval is based on P-III SPARTAN study results assessing Erleada (240 mg,qd) vs PBO in 1,207 patients with NM-CRPC in ratio (2:1) in patients with (NM-CRPC)
 P-III SPARTAN study results: 72% reduction in risk of distant metastasis or death; mPFS (40.51 mos. vs 16.20 mos.); 24% required number of events
 Erleada (apalutamide) is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor targeted for patients with NM-CRPC","ERLEADA is the first FDA-approved therapy to treat patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
Approval is based on Phase 3 SPARTAN clinical trial data which showed ERLEADA™ decreased the risk of distant metastasis or death by 72 percent and improved median metastasis-free survival by more than two years
The major efficacy outcome was supported by statistically significant improvements for secondary endpoints, including time to metastasis, progression-free survival, and time to symptomatic progression

HORSHAM, PA, February 14, 2018 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ERLEADA™ (apalutamide), a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor,[1] for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC). ERLEADA™ is the first FDA-approved treatment for these patients. Today’s approval follows an FDA Priority Review designation based upon data from the Phase 3 SPARTAN study, which demonstrated a 72 percent reduction in risk of distant metastasis or death, and an increase in median metastasis-free survival (MFS) by more than two years (difference of 24.31 months) in patients with NM-CRPC.
 
“The need to delay metastasis is critical to the treatment of prostate cancer. Nearly 90 percent of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer will eventually develop bone metastases, at which point the prognosis sharply worsens,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We are excited about what this approval means for patients living with prostate cancer, and that physicians now have an important and much-needed treatment option that has been shown to delay the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.”
ERLEADA™ received FDA approval based on the Phase 3 data from the SPARTAN clinical trial, which assessed the efficacy and safety of ERLEADA™ versus placebo in patients with NM-CRPC who had a rapidly rising PSA while receiving continuous androgen deprivation therapy.[2] The study was recently presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU) on Thursday, February 8, 2018 in San Francisco and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.2,[3]
“The SPARTAN trial results demonstrated impressive clinical benefits in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,” said Matthew Smith, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Genitourinary Malignancies Program at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and co-principal investigator of the SPARTAN study. “As an oncologist and clinical investigator, I know how devastating it can be for patients and their families to hear that the cancer has spread. With this approval, doctors now have the chance to offer hope for delaying metastases in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.”
“As the impact of prostate cancer continues to grow, we are reminded every day of the critical need for therapeutic options that offer patients with prostate cancer more time with their loved ones,” Mark Scholz, M.D., Executive Director of the Prostate Cancer Research Institute. “Today’s approval is significant, as it means that patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer now have a treatment option that offers renewed hope.”
SPARTAN, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study, enrolled 1,207 patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.[4] Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ERLEADA™ orally at a dose of 240 mg once daily (n=806), or placebo once daily (n=401).4 All patients in the SPARTAN trial received a concomitant gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or had a bilateral orchiectomy.4
ERLEADA™ decreased the risk of distant metastasis or death by 72 percent compared to placebo (HR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.23-0.35; P<0.0001).4 The median MFS was 40.51 months for ERLEADA™ compared to 16.20 months for placebo, prolonging MFS by more than two years (difference of 24.31 months).4 MFS benefit was consistently seen across patient subgroups including prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) (≤6 months or >6 months), use of a prior bone-sparing agent (yes or no), and locoregional disease (N0 or N1).4
The major efficacy outcome was supported by statistically significant improvements for the following secondary endpoints: time to metastasis (TTM), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to symptomatic progression.4 The median TTM was 40.51 months for ERLEADA™ compared to 16.59 months for placebo (HR=0.27; 95% CI, 0.22-0.34; P<0.0001) and the median PFS was 40.51 months compared to 14.72 months for placebo (HR=0.29; 95% CI, 0.24-0.36; P<0.0001).4 Overall survival data were not mature at the time of final MFS analysis (24% of the required number of events).4
Warnings and Precautions include seizure, falls and fractures.4 In the SPARTAN trial, the most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were fatigue, hypertension, rash, diarrhea, nausea, weight decreased, arthralgia, fall, hot flush, decreased appetite, fracture, and peripheral edema.4
About Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC) refers to a disease state when the cancer no longer responds to medical or surgical treatments that lower testosterone, but has not yet been discovered in other parts of the body using a total body bone scan or CT scan.[5] Features include: lack of detectable metastatic disease;5 rapidly rising prostate-specific antigen while on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and serum testosterone level below 50 ng/dL.[6],[7] Ninety percent of patients with CRPC will eventually develop bone metastases, which can lead to pain, fractures and spinal cord compression.[8] The relative 5-year survival rate for patients with distant stage prostate cancer is 30 percent.[9] It is critical to delay the onset of metastasis in patients with NM-CRPC.
About ERLEADA™
ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.4
ERLEADA™ is an AR inhibitor that binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of the AR. ERLEADA™ inhibits AR nuclear translocation, inhibits DNA binding, and impedes AR-mediated transcription.4 A major metabolite, N-desmethyl apalutamide, is a less potent inhibitor of AR, and exhibited one-third the activity of ERLEADA™ in an in vitro transcriptional reporter assay.4 ERLEADA™ administration caused decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis leading to decreased tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer.4
Full prescribing information will be available soon at www.ERLEADA.com.
Important Safety Information4
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy – ERLEADA™ can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Falls and Fractures – In the SPARTAN study, falls and fractures occurred in 16% and 12% of patients treated with ERLEADA™ compared to 9% and 7% treated with placebo respectively. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone targeted agents.
Seizure – In a randomized study (SPARTAN), two patients (0.2%) treated with ERLEADA™ experienced a seizure. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA™ in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with ERLEADA™. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while receiving ERLEADA™ and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause harm to themselves or others.
 
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse Reactions – The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were fatigue, hypertension, rash, diarrhea, nausea, weight decreased, arthralgia, fall, hot flush, decreased appetite, fracture, and peripheral edema.
 
Laboratory Abnormalities

Hematology: anemia ERLEADA™ 70% (Grade 3-4 0.4%) placebo 64% (Grade 3-4 0.5%) leukopenia ERLEADA™ 47% (Grade 3-4 0.3%) for, placebo 29% (Grades 3-4 0%), lymphopenia ERLEADA™ 41% (Grade 3-4 2%), placebo 21% (Grade 3-4 2%);
Chemistry – hypercholesterolemia ERLEADA™ 76%(Grade3-4 0.1%), placebo 46% (Grade 3-4 0%); hypertriglycemia ERLEADA™ 70%(Grade 3-4 2%) Placebo 59% (0.8%); hypertriglyceridemia ERLEADA™ 67%(Grade 3-4 2%) placebo 49%(Grade 3-4 0.8%); Hyperkalemia ERLEADA™ 32%(Grade 3-4 2%) Placebo 22%(Grade 3-4 0.5%)
 
Rash – Rash was most commonly described as macular or maculo-papular. Adverse reactions were 24% with ERLEADA™ versus 6% with placebo. Grade 3 rashes (defined as covering > 30% body surface area [BSA]) were reported with ERLEADA™ treatment (5%) versus placebo (0.3%).
 
The onset of rash occurred at a median of 82 days. Rash resolved in 81% of patients within a median of 60 days (range: 2 to 709 days) from onset of rash. Four (4%) of patients treated with ERLEADA™ received systemic corticosteroids. Rash recurred in approximately half of patients who were re-challenged with ERLEADA™.
 
Hypothyroidism – Hypothyroidism was reported for 8% of patients treated with ERLEADA™ and 2% of patients treated with placebo based on assessments of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) every 4 months. Elevated TSH occurred in 25% of patients treated with ERLEADA™ and 7% of patients treated with placebo. The median onset was Day 113. There were no Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions. Thyroid replacement therapy, when clinically indicated, should be initiated or dose-adjusted.
 
Effect of Other Drugs on ERLEADA – Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inhibitor is predicted to increase the steady-state exposure of the active moieties. No initial dose adjustment is necessary however, reduce the ERLEADA™ dose based on tolerability [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
 
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Effect of ERLEADA™ on Other Drugs – ERLEADA™ is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and a weak inducer of CYP2C9 in humans. Concomitant use of ERLEADA™ with medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 can result in lower exposure to these medications. Substitution for these medications is recommended when possible or evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued. Concomitant administration of ERLEADA™ with medications that are substrates of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) can result in decreased exposure. Use caution if substrates of UGT must be co-administered with ERLEADA™ and evaluate for loss of activity.
 
P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 substrates – Apalutamide is a weak inducer of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) clinically. Concomitant use of ERLEADA™ with medications that are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1 can result in lower exposure of these medications. Use caution if substrates of P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 must be co-administered with ERLEADA™ and evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued.

10779,ï»¿Helsinn's (fosnetupitant + palonosetron) Receives FDA Approval for Managing Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV),Helsinn Group announces the FDA approval of the IV formulation of AKYNZEO (fosnetupitant/palonosetron) in the United States,"The approval is based on two clinical studies results assessing Akynzeo (NEPA) vs Palonosetron in patients with CINV across 80 centers in 11 countries
 The two clinical studies Trial 1 (NCT#02557035) & Trial 2 (NCT # 02517021) indicated benefits & side effect of Akynzeo in 440 & 404 patients respectively
 Akynzeo is a combination of (fosnetupitant 235mg, a P/neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists, & palonosetron 0.25mg, a serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist), IV) used in combination with dexamethasone to prevent acute and delayed nausea & vomiting occurred during repetitive course of CT","Lugano, Switzerland A– Helsinn, a Swiss pharmaceutical group focused on building quality cancer care products, today announces that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the intravenous formulation of AKYNZEO® (NEPA, a fixed antiemetic combination of fosnetupitant, 235mg, and palonosetron, 0.25mg) as an alternative treatment option for patients experiencing CINV.
The FDA has approved AKYNZEO® IV in combination with dexamethasone in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. AKYNZEO® for injection has not been studied for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy.
Oral AKYNZEO® was previously approved by the FDA as a fixed combination oral agent in 2014 for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy. AKYNZEO® is an oral fixed combination of palonosetron and netupitant: palonosetron prevents nausea and vomiting during the acute phase and netupitant prevents nausea and vomiting during both the acute and delayed phase after cancer chemotherapy.
The bioequivalence of the IV with the oral formulation of netupitant was demonstrated and the safety of IV NEPA was established through a repeated dose safety study in cancer patients to potentially uncover adverse drug reactions that may appear during subsequent clinical practice. No anaphylactic and injection site reactions related to IV NEPA were reported in this study.
Currently a repeated dose safety study is ongoing in patients receiving anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide to further establish the safety profile in this setting.
The prevention of CINV has been refined in treatment guidelines over the past several decades. Currently the combination treatment of antiemetic medicines with different mechanisms of actions are recommended for the prevention of CINV.
The approval of AKYNZEO® in IV formulation will offer to US patients and healthcare providers an alternative route of administration of the only fixed antiemetic combination targeting two distinct CINV pathways in a single dose.
Riccardo Braglia, Helsinn Group Vice Chairman and CEO, commented: “The approval of the intravenous formulation of AKYNZEO® paves the way to bring this important therapeutic option to more patients in a new formulation, and we are delighted that we are now able to push ahead with launching this product in the United States in May 2018”
Helsinn plans to launch AKYNZEO® in IV formulation in the US in May 2018.
About Akynzeo®
INDICATION
AKYNZEO® (netupitant 300mg/palonosetron 0.5mg) capsules was approved in October 2014 in the United States and is indicated in combination with dexamethasone in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
AKYNZEO® (fosnetupitant 235mg/palonosetron 0.25) for injection was approved in April 2018 in the United States and is indicated in combination with dexamethasone in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.
Limitations of Use
AKYNZEO for injection has not been studied for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy.
AKYNZEO is a combination of palonosetron, a serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, and netupitant or fosnetupitant, substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists: palonosetron prevents nausea and vomiting during the acute phase and netupitant/fosnetupitant prevents nausea and vomiting during both the acute and delayed phase after cancer chemotherapy.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Warnings and Precautions
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving palonosetron, one of the components of AKYNZEO, with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.
Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. Serotonin syndrome can be life threatening. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular symptoms, seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, and if symptoms occur, discontinue AKYNZEO and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if AKYNZEO is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs.
Adverse Reactions

Most common adverse reactions for AKYNZEO capsules and injection: headache, asthenia, dyspepsia, fatigue, constipation and erythema
Drug Interactions

Use with caution in patients receiving concomitant medications primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. The plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates can increase when co-administered with AKYNZEO. The inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 can last for multiple days
Dexamethasone doses should be reduced when given with AKYNZEO. A more than two-fold increase in the systemic exposure of dexamethasone was observed 4 days after a single dose of netupitant or a single infusion of fosnetupitant
Consider the potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) when administering with AKYNZEO. When administered with netupitant, the systemic exposure to midazolam was significantly increased
Avoid concomitant use of AKYNZEO in patients on chronic use of a strong CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampin as this may decrease the efficacy of AKYNZEO
Use in Specific Populations

Avoid use of AKYNZEO in patients with severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease
Avoid use in pregnancy, limited data is available, may cause fetal harm.

10783,ï»¿SIGA Technologies' TPOXX (tecovirimat) Receives FDA Approval for Smallpox,U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves SIGA Technologies’ TPOXX (tecovirimat) for the Treatment of Smallpox,"The approval is based on 12 clinical trials results assessing TPOXX (tecovirimat) in 700 patients, demonstrating no adverse effects
 ’ TPOXX (tecovirimat) receives 17-0 votes from FDA’s Antimicrobial Drug Advisory Committee on 05 May, 2018 and also received FDA’s FT, PR & ODD in Dec 2005, 08 Dec, 2017, 07 Jun, 2018 respectively
 TPOXX (tecovirimat) also known as ST-246 is a PO & IV respectively for treating smallpox, developed in collaboration with the US Department of Health & Human Services’ BARDA","SIGA Technologies, Inc. (SIGA) (NASDAQ:SIGA), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the health security market, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved oral TPOXX® (tecovirimat) for the treatment of smallpox to mitigate the impact of a potential outbreak. TPOXX, a small-molecule antiviral treatment for smallpox, is the first therapy specifically approved for this indication. On May 1, 2018, the FDA’s Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee voted unanimously, 17 to 0, that the benefits of TPOXX outweigh its risks.

Concurrent with the approval, FDA granted SIGA’s request for a Priority Review Voucher (PRV). A PRV is a voucher that may be used to obtain an accelerated FDA review of a future SIGA product, or sold to a third party, and this is the first PRV awarded under the Material Threat Countermeasure PRV program enacted by the 2016 21st Century Cures Act. In addition, FDA approved a seven-year expiry for TPOXX. Under SIGA’s existing contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the company will ask BARDA to exercise an option for a $50 million payment to the company based on this extended shelf-life determination. The exercise of this option is at the sole discretion of BARDA.
With the approval, SIGA is entitled to a $41 million hold back payment under the existing contract with BARDA, provided that BARDA confirms that there is no difference between the approved product and the courses of TPOXX that have already been delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).
FDA approval is based on data from 12 clinical trials of oral TPOXX in over 700 healthy human volunteers, which showed no drug-related serious adverse events. Four pivotal trials in non-human primates (NHPs) and two pivotal trials in rabbits demonstrated that TPOXX significantly reduced both mortality and viral load in NHP infected with monkeypox virus (MPXV) and in rabbits infected with rabbitpox virus. The results of these studies were published in the July 5, 2018 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
”TPOXX is proof that public-private partnerships work when the partners are committed to a focused mission,” said Dr. Phil Gomez, Chief Executive Officer of SIGA Technologies, Inc. “The FDA approval of TPOXX achieves an important objective for both SIGA and our lead partner in the U.S. Government, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The approval validates this novel smallpox therapy as an important medical countermeasure in response to a potential smallpox outbreak.”
“We would like to acknowledge the efforts by everyone at SIGA and our many partners who have contributed to the development and approval of TPOXX,” added Dennis Hruby, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of SIGA Technologies, Inc. “These partners include BARDA, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense (including the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases), our academic and clinical collaborators, and our colleagues at the FDA.”
TPOXX will be available initially only through the U.S. government’s Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). SIGA has a $472 million procurement and development contract with BARDA, as part of which 2 million courses of oral TPOXX have been delivered to the SNS. Currently, there is a Request for Proposal outstanding for the maintenance of a smallpox antiviral stockpile within the SNS. SIGA intends to explore additional markets and potential indications for TPOXX in the United States and around the world.
During the May 1, 2018 FDA Advisory committee, several members of the committee also suggested that there could be benefit in exploring additional indications post-FDA approval, including prophylactic use in individuals exposed to smallpox and other orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, which also infects humans. Committee members cited the likely use of TPOXX in the post-exposure prophylaxis setting in the event of a smallpox outbreak and a 15-20% mortality rate in people infected with monkeypox. SIGA will examine these potential markets and the feasibility of expanding the TPOXX label to include these indications.
Smallpox remains a significant bioterrorism threat, and the U.S. government has been focused on the development of medical countermeasures to mitigate that threat. Vaccines are an important component of a response to a smallpox outbreak, but the availability of a therapeutic such as TPOXX is critical to reduce the morbidity and mortality of such an outbreak. The risk of a smallpox outbreak is a global risk with far-reaching consequences. As such, the U.S. FDA approval is an important milestone in highlighting for international governments the safety and efficacy of TPOXX for treatment of smallpox.
TPOXX’s advanced development has been funded in partnership with BARDA.

About Smallpox1
Smallpox is a contagious, disfiguring and often deadly disease that has affected humans for thousands of years. Naturally-occurring smallpox was eradicated worldwide by 1980, the result of an unprecedented global immunization campaign. Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes. This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a biological warfare agent. No cure or treatment for smallpox exists. A vaccine can prevent smallpox, but the risk of the vaccine’s side effects is too high to justify routine vaccination for people at low risk of exposure to the smallpox virus.

10789,BioMarin's Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz) Receives FDA Approval for Phenylketonuria (PKU) in Adults,"BioMarin Receives Standard Approval for Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection for Treatment of Adults with Phenylketonuria (PKU), a Rare Genetic Disease","The approval is based on P-III PRISM-2 study results assessing Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz, 20mg qd or 40mg qd) in patients in ratio (2:1) with high level of phenylalanine (Phe)
 The P-III PRISM-2 study resulted in maintaining blood Phe level vs PBO in patients
 Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz, SC) is an enzyme substitution therapy of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme helping in breaking down of Phe","First Enzyme Therapy to Treat PKU
Palynziq Significantly and Substantially Reduced Blood Phenylalanine Levels Confirmed by a Phase 3 Placebo-Controlled Randomized Withdrawal Study
Palynziq Approval Comes During National PKU Awareness Month
SAN RAFAEL, Calif., — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:BMRN) today announced that BioMarin received standard approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Palynziq™ (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L on existing management. Palynziq, a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme, is the first approved enzyme substitution therapy to target the underlying cause of PKU by helping the body to break down Phe. Palynziq is BioMarin’s second approved treatment for this important condition.
PKU is a rare genetic disease that manifests at birth and results in a variety of cumulative toxic effects on the brain. PKU affects approximately 1 in 12,500 live births in the United States each year. PKU is marked by an inability to break down Phe, an amino acid that is found in all forms of protein. Left untreated, high levels of Phe become toxic to the brain and may lead to serious neurological and neuropsychiatric-related issues, impacting the way a person thinks, feels, and acts. Due to the seriousness of these symptoms, infants are screened at birth to ensure that they are diagnosed early and treated to avoid intellectual disability and other complications. Patients living with PKU require life-long management, including adherence to a challenging and severely restrictive daily diet of medical foods and formula that avoids the ingestion of Phe that is present in most foods.
The approval of Palynziq in the United States marks an important milestone for adults living with PKU who will now have access to an effective new treatment option for controlling their blood Phe.
The approval of Palynziq comes during National PKU Awareness Month. During National PKU Awareness Month, local patient organizations are encouraged to organize events to spread PKU awareness and raise funds for academic research.
“BioMarin is thrilled to be able to offer this important new therapy to adults with PKU who are unable to control their Phe levels with existing options. The approval of Palynziq is the culmination of more than a decade of perseverance by BioMarin employees dedicated to bringing treatments to PKU adult patients,” said Jean-Jacques Bienaimé, chairman and chief executive officer of BioMarin. “We are proud of this medical achievement and appreciate the FDA’s thoughtful review of our application. We also are grateful to the PKU patients and medical communities for their continued partnership and participation in the clinical program that led to the approval of this effective therapy.”
“The goal in treating PKU is to keep blood Phe levels within the range set in the medical guidelines, as elevation of Phe can be toxic and damaging to the brain. Palynziq provides another much needed tool for us to help adult patients control their Phe levels, which previously had not been achievable for many adults living with the condition,” said Cary Harding, M.D., professor at Oregon Health & Science University and investigator for the Phase 3 studies.
“Palynziq has the potential to be a game-changing therapy for adults in the PKU community who have struggled throughout their lives to control their Phe levels, despite rigorous management,” said Christine Brown, MS, executive director of the National PKU Alliance. “BioMarin has provided unwavering support for the PKU community and continues innovative medical research to advance treatment options for this rare genetic disease.”
Palynziq is expected to be available in the United States by the end of June, and BioMarin will begin the promotion of Palynziq immediately. Palynziq is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Palynziq REMS.
BioMarin is also committed to bringing Palynziq to adult PKU patients outside of the United States. In March 2018, the European Medicines Agency accepted BioMarin’s submission of a Marketing Authorization Application for Palynziq.
Clinical Trial Results
Palynziq significantly and substantially reduced blood Phe levels as demonstrated in the pivotal Phase 3 PRISM-2 study, which met the primary endpoint of change in blood Phe compared with placebo (p<0.0001). During the PRISM-2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period trial (RWP), participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either continue their maintenance Palynziq dosage (20 mg once daily or 40 mg once daily) or to receive matching placebo for a total of 8 weeks. Palynziq-treated patients maintained their blood Phe concentrations as compared to their randomized withdrawal baseline, whereas patients randomized to matching placebo returned to their pretreatment baseline blood Phe concentrations.
In the Phase 3 program, 57% of patients were taking medical food at baseline and 16% were on a protein-restricted diet at baseline (defined as receiving greater than 75% of total protein intake from medical food).
About Phenylketonuria
PKU, or PAH deficiency, is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 50,000 diagnosed patients in the regions of the world where BioMarin operates and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme PAH. This enzyme is required for the metabolism of Phe, an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. If the active enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood and becomes toxic to the brain, resulting in a variety of complications including severe intellectual disability, seizures, tremors, behavioral problems and psychiatric symptoms. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU under the age of 40 in countries with newborn screening programs are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon after. PKU can be managed with a Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by low-protein modified foods and Phe-free medical foods; however, the strict diet is difficult for most adult patients to adhere to to the extent needed for achieving adequate control of blood Phe levels.

About ACMG Guidelines
Practice guidelines issued by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) support the need for lifelong management of Phe levels in patients with phenylketonuria or PKU. The new diagnosis and management guidelines were published online in Genetics In Medicine’s Advance Online Publication (AOP) service.
The guidelines state that treatment of PKU should be initiated as early as possible and must be continued throughout adulthood and “lifelong,” with a goal of maintaining blood levels of Phe for all patients between 120 to 360 micromol/L. Patients treated from the early weeks of life with initial good metabolic control, but who lose that control in later childhood or adult life, may experience both reversible and irreversible neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric consequences.
According to the guidelines “the primary goal of therapy is to lower blood Phe, and any interventions, including medications, or combination of therapies that help to achieve that goal in an individual, without other negative consequences, should be considered appropriate therapy.” Evidence for the guidelines are drawn from two previous independent review processes from the National Institutes of Health (2001) and the Agency for Health Research and Quality (2012). The guidelines can be accessed here.

About Palynziq
Palynziq substitutes the deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme in PKU with the PEGylated version of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase to break down Phe. Palynziq is administered using a dosing regimen designed to facilitate tolerability; Palynziq’s safety profile consists primarily of immune-mediated responses, including anaphylaxis, for which robust risk management measures effective in clinical trials are in place.
The dosing and administration of Palynziq follows an induction, titration, and maintenance paradigm. Treatment is individualized to the lowest effective and tolerated dosage. Prescribers may consider increasing to a maximum of 40 mg once daily in patients who have not achieved a response with 20 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks. Prescribers are instructed to discontinue treatment in patients who have not responded after 16 weeks of continuous treatment with the maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily. Periodic blood Phe monitoring is recommended, and patients should be counseled on how to adjust their dietary intake, as needed, based on blood Phe concentrations.

Indication
PALYNZIQ™ (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection is a phenylalanine-metabolizing enzyme indicated to reduce blood phenylalanine concentrations in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood phenylalanine concentrations greater than 600 µmol/L on existing management.
Important Safety Information
BOXED WARNING: RISK OF ANAPHYLAXIS
Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of PALYNZIQ and may occur at any time during treatment with PALYNZIQ.
Administer the initial dose of PALYNZIQ under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection. Prior to self-injection, confirm patient competency with self-administration, and patient’s and observer’s (if applicable) ability to recognize signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and to administer auto-injectable epinephrine, if needed.
Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to all patients treated with PALYNZIQ. Prior to the first dose, instruct the patient and observer (if applicable) on its appropriate use. Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Instruct patients to carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during treatment with PALYNZIQ.
PALYNZIQ is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the PALYNZIQ REMS. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies, is available at www.PALYNZIQREMS.com (site will be live within 24 hours) or by telephone 1-855-758-REMS (1-855-758-7367).
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Anaphylaxis

Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis reported include syncope, hypotension, hypoxia, dyspnea, wheezing, chest discomfort/chest tightness, tachycardia, angioedema (swelling of face, lips, eyes, tongue), throat tightness, skin flushing, rash, urticaria, pruritus, and gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea).
Anaphylaxis generally occurred within 1 hour after injection; however, delayed episodes occurred up to 48 hours after PALYNZIQ administration.
Consider having an adult observer for patients who may need assistance in recognizing and managing anaphylaxis during treatment with PALYNZIQ. If an adult observer is needed, the observer should be present during and for at least 60 minutes after administration of PALYNZIQ, and should be able to administer auto-injectable epinephrine and call for emergency medical support upon its use.
Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with auto-injectable epinephrine. Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to all patients receiving PALYNZIQ and instruct patients to carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during treatment with PALYNZIQ. Prior to the first dose, instruct the patient and observer (if applicable) on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, on how to properly administer auto-injectable epinephrine, and to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Consider the risks associated with auto-injectable epinephrine use when prescribing Palynziq. Refer to the auto‑injectable epinephrine prescribing information for complete information.
Consider the risks and benefits of readministering PALYNZIQ following an episode of anaphylaxis. If the decision is made to readminister PALYNZIQ, administer the first dose under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis and closely observe the patient for at least 60 minutes following the dose. Subsequent dose titration of PALYNZIQ should be based on patient tolerability and therapeutic response.
Consider premedication with an H1-receptor antagonist, H2-receptor antagonist, and/or antipyretic prior to administration of PALYNZIQ based upon individual patient tolerability.
Other hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions other than anaphylaxis have been reported in 196 of 285 (69%) patients treated with PALYNZIQ.
Consider premedication with an H1-receptor antagonist, and/or antipyretic prior to PALYNZIQ administration based upon individual patient tolerability.
Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction, recurrence of the reaction, and the clinical judgment of the healthcare provider, and may include dosage adjustment, temporary drug interruption, drug discontinuation, or treatment with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (at least 20% of patients in either treatment phase) were injection site reactions, arthralgia, hypersensitivity reactions, headache, generalized skin reaction lasting at least 14 days, pruritus, nausea, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue.
Of the 285 patients exposed to PALYNZIQ in an induction/titration/maintenance regimen in clinical trials, 31 (11%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were hypersensitivity reactions (6% of patients)—including anaphylaxis (3% of patients) and angioedema (1% of patients)—arthralgia (4% of patients), generalized skin reactions lasting at least 14 days (2% of patients), and injection site reactions (1% of patients).
The most common adverse reactions leading to dosage reduction were arthralgia (14% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (9% of patients), injection site reactions (4% of patients), alopecia (3% of patients), and generalized skin reactions lasting at least 14 days (2% of patients).
The most common adverse reactions leading to temporary drug interruption were arthralgia (13% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (13% of patients), anaphylaxis (4% of patients), and injection site reactions (4% of patients).
Blood Phenylalanine Monitoring and Diet

Obtain blood phenylalanine concentrations every 4 weeks until a maintenance dosage is established.
After a maintenance dosage is established, periodically monitor blood phenylalanine concentrations.
Counsel patients to monitor dietary protein and phenylalanine intake, and adjust as directed by their healthcare provider.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Effect of PALYNZIQ on other PEGylated products

In a single dose study of PALYNZIQ in adult patients with PKU, 2 patients receiving concomitant injections of medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension (a formulation containing PEG 3350) experienced hypersensitivity reactions, and 1 of the 2 patients also experienced anaphylaxis.
The clinical effects of concomitant treatment with different PEGylated products is unknown. Monitor patients treated with PALYNZIQ and concomitantly with other PEGylated products for hypersensitivity reactions.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Pregnancy and Lactation

PALYNZIQ may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
If PALYNZIQ is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving PALYNZIQ or within 1 month following the last dose of PALYNZIQ, healthcare providers should report PALYNZIQ exposure by calling 1-866-906-6100.

10794,Achaogen's Zemdri (plazomicin) Receives FDA Approval for Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (cUTI),ZEMDRI (plazomicin) Approved by FDA for the Treatment of Adults with Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI),"The approval is based on P-III EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin in cUTI) study results assessing Zemdri (plazomicin, IV) vs Meropenem in 388 patients with cUTI including pyelonephritis aged ≥18 yrs.
 P-IIIEPIC study results: composite cure rate (CCR) @5 day (88.0% vs 91.4%); CCR at test-of-cure (TOC) (81.7% vs 70.1%)
 Zemdri (plazomicin, qd) is an aminoglycoside active against carbapenem-resistant (CRE) & extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae used for targetting bacterias including E.coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae","Achaogen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAO), a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing innovative antibacterial agents to address multidrug resistant (MDR) gram-negative infections, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ZEMDRI™ (plazomicin) for adults with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by certain Enterobacteriaceae in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. ZEMDRI is an intravenous infusion, administered once daily.
“The approval of ZEMDRI marks a significant milestone for Achaogen and we are excited to offer healthcare practitioners a new treatment option for patients with certain serious bacterial infections. ZEMDRI is designed to retain its potent activity in the face of certain difficult-to-treat MDR infections, including CRE and ESBL- producing Enterobacteriaceae,” said Blake Wise, Achaogen’s Chief Executive Officer. “Today’s milestone was made possible by our employees, by patients and investigators involved in our clinical trials, and by BARDA, who contributed significant funding for the development of ZEMDRI. This marks an important step in our commitment to fighting MDR bacteria and we are excited to launch ZEMDRI, a much needed once-daily antibiotic.”
“Bacteria continue to circumvent existing antibiotics, making certain infections notoriously hard to treat and putting some patients at high risk for mortality,” said James A. McKinnell, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine and LA Biomed at Harbor-UCLA. “Aminoglycosides are a familiar and very effective class of antibiotics. I look forward to adding plazomicin to my short list of available treatment options and to its potential impact on patient outcomes.”
Regarding the potential indication for plazomicin for the treatment of bloodstream infection (BSI), the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating that the CARE study does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness of plazomicin for the treatment of BSI. The Company intends to meet with the FDA to determine whether there is a feasible resolution to address the CRL.
Achaogen will work with hospitals, providers, and insurers to ensure patients are able to receive this treatment. Patients, physicians, pharmacists, or other healthcare professionals with questions about ZEMDRI should contact 1.833.252.6400 or visit www.ZEMDRI.com.
ZEMDRI Phase 3 Clinical Results
The approval of ZEMDRI is supported in part by data from the EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin In cUTI) clinical trial, which was the first randomized controlled study of once-daily aminoglycoside therapy for the treatment of cUTI, including pyelonephritis.
In the Phase 3 EPIC cUTI trial, ZEMDRI demonstrated non-inferiority to meropenem for the co-primary efficacy endpoints of composite cure (clinical cure and microbiological eradication) in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT; N=388) population at Day 5 and test-of-cure (TOC) visit (Day 17 + 2). Composite cure rates at Day 5 were 88.0% (168/191) for ZEMDRI vs 91.4% (180/197) for meropenem (difference -3.4%, 95% CI, -10.0 to 3.1). Composite cure rates at TOC were 81.7% (156/191) for ZEMDRI vs 70.1% (138/197) for meropenem (difference 11.6%, 95% CI, 2.7 to 20.3). Composite cure at the TOC visit in patients with concomitant bacteremia at baseline was achieved in 72.0% (18/25) of patients in the ZEMDRI group and 56.5% (13/23) of patients in the meropenem group. The most common side effects (≥1% of patients treated with ZEMDRI) were decreased kidney function, diarrhea, hypertension, headache, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension.1
The FDA approved a breakpoint of <= 2 mcg/mL; greater than 99% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae in U.S. surveillance are susceptible to Zemdri when applying this breakpoint.2
About cUTI
cUTI is defined as a UTI occurring in a patient with an underlying complicating factor of the genitourinary tract, such as a structural or functional abnormality.3 Patients with pyelonephritis, regardless of underlying abnormalities of the urinary tract, are considered a subset of patients with cUTI.4 An estimated 3 million cases of cUTI are treated in the hospital setting in the US each year.5 Enterobacteriaceae are the most common pathogens causing cUTIs6, and resistance within this family is a global concern. High rates of resistance to previous mainstays of therapy necessitate alternative treatment options. Ineffectively managed cUTI can lead to increased treatment failure rates, recurrence of infection, increased re-hospitalization, and increased morbidity and mortality. cUTI infections place an economic burden on hospitals and payers.6,7
About ZEMDRI
ZEMDRI is an aminoglycoside with once-daily dosing that has activity against certain Enterobacteriaceae, including CRE and ESBL- producing Enterobacteriaceae. Achaogen’s EPIC clinical trial successfully evaluated the safety and efficacy of ZEMDRI in adult patients with cUTI, including pyelonephritis. ZEMDRI was engineered to overcome aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, the most common aminoglycoside-resistance mechanism in Enterobacteriaceae, and has in vitroactivity against ESBL- producing, aminoglycoside- resistant, and carbapenem- resistant isolates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has characterized ESBL- producing Enterobacteriaceae as a “serious threat” and CRE as “nightmare bacteria”, which is an immediate public health threat that requires urgent and aggressive action.
Indications & Usage
ZEMDRI (plazomicin) is indicated in patients 18 years of age or older for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis caused by the following susceptible microorganism(s): Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae.
As only limited clinical safety and efficacy data for ZEMDRI are currently available, reserve ZEMDRI for use in cUTI patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options.
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of ZEMDRI and other antibacterial drugs, ZEMDRI should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible microorganisms.
Important Safety Information
BOXED WARNINGS: NEPHROTOXICITY, OTOTOXICITY, NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE AND FETAL HARM

Nephrotoxicity has been reported with ZEMDRI. The risk of nephrotoxicity is greater in patients with impaired renal function, the elderly, and in those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications. Assess creatinine clearance in all patients prior to initiating therapy and daily during therapy. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is recommended for complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) patients with CLcr less than 90 mL/min to avoid potentially toxic levels.
Ototoxicity, manifested as hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vertigo, has been reported with ZEMDRI.Symptoms of aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity may be irreversible and may not become evident until after completion of therapy. Aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity has been observed primarily in patients with a family history of hearing loss, patients with renal impairment, and in patients receiving higher doses and/or longer durations of therapy than recommended.
Aminoglycosides have been associated with neuromuscular blockade. During therapy with ZEMDRI, monitor for adverse reactions associated with neuromuscular blockade particularly in high-risk patients, such as patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders (including myasthenia gravis) or in patients concomitantly receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.
Aminoglycosides, including ZEMDRI, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
Contraindications: ZEMDRI is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside.
Additional Warnings and Precautions

Nephrotoxicity: Reported with the use of ZEMDRI. Most serum creatinine increases were ≤ 1 mg/dL above baseline and reversible. Assess CLcr in all patients prior to initiating therapy and daily during therapy with ZEMDRI, particularly in those at increased risk of nephrotoxicity, such as those with renal impairment, the elderly and those receiving concomitant potentially nephrotoxic medications. In the setting of worsening renal function, the benefit of continuing ZEMDRI should be assessed. Adjust the initial dosage regimen in cUTI patients with CLcr ≥ 15 mL/min and < 60 mL/min. For subsequent doses, TDM is recommended for patients with CLcr ≥ 15 mL/min and < 90 mL/min.
Ototoxicity: Reported with ZEMDRI (manifested as hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vertigo). Symptoms of aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity may be irreversible and may not become evident until after completion of therapy. Aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity has been observed primarily in patients with a family history of hearing loss (excluding age-related hearing loss), patients with renal impairment, and in patients receiving higher doses and/or for longer periods than recommended. The benefit-risk of ZEMDRI therapy should be considered in these patients.
Neuromuscular Blockade: Aminoglycosides have been associated with exacerbation of muscle weakness in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, or delay in recovery of neuromuscular function in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. During therapy with ZEMDRI, monitor for adverse reactions associated with neuromuscular blockade, particularly in high-risk patients, such as patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders (including myasthenia gravis) or those patients concomitantly receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.
Fetal Harm: Aminoglycosides, including ZEMDRI, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Patients who use ZEMDRI during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ZEMDRI should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with ZEMDRI is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other aminoglycosides should be made. Discontinue ZEMDRI if an allergic reaction occurs.
Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD): Reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial drugs alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile. Careful medical history is necessary. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued.
Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria: Prescribing ZEMDRI in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

10803,GW Pharmaceuticals' Epidiolex (cannabidiol) Receives FDA Approval for Epilepsy for 2yrs. or older,GW Pharmaceuticals plc and its U.S. Subsidiary Greenwich Biosciences Announce FDA Approval of EPIDIOLEX (cannabidiol) oral solution – the First Plant-derived Cannabinoid Prescription Medicine,"The approval is based on three P-III studies results assessing Epidiolex (cannabidiol, PO) vs PBO in 516 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome aged ≥ 2yrs.
 The study demonstrated in reduction in frequency of seizures
 Epidiolex (cannabidiol, PO) is an oral anti-epileptic drug and has received FDA’s PR, FT, & OD designation on 27 Jun, 2018, Jun, 2014, & 28 Feb, 2014 respectively and has also received EMA’s ODD for treating west syndrome & TSC","GW Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq:GWPH) (“GW,” “the Company” or “the Group”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform, along with its U.S. subsidiary Greenwich Biosciences, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EPIDIOLEX® (cannabidiol) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age or older. EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days.

“Today’s approval of EPIDIOLEX is a historic milestone, offering patients and their families the first and only FDA-approved CBD medicine to treat two severe, childhood-onset epilepsies,” said Justin Gover, GW’s Chief Executive Officer. “This approval is the culmination of GW’s many years of partnership with patients, their families, and physicians in the epilepsy community to develop a much needed, novel medicine. These patients deserve and will soon have access to a cannabinoid medicine that has been thoroughly studied in clinical trials, manufactured to assure quality and consistency, and available by prescription under a physician’s care.”

LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant.1,2 Most patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome require multiple seizure medications and the majority are resistant to currently approved AEDs.2,3,4 The day-to-day impact of these conditions is significant with high rates of early mortality.5,6

“In my practice, I often see patients with these highly treatment-resistant epilepsies who have tried and failed existing therapies and are asking about CBD,” said Orrin Devinsky, M.D., of NYU Langone Health’s Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and a lead investigator in the EPIDIOLEX clinical program. “I am delighted that my physician colleagues and I will now have the option of a prescription cannabidiol that has undergone the rigor of controlled trials and been approved by the FDA to treat both children and adults.”

“LGS and Dravet syndrome are two of the most severe and difficult-to-treat forms of childhood-onset epilepsy. These children and their families face a long and challenging road and very few achieve adequate seizure control,” said Elizabeth Thiele, M.D., director of the pediatric epilepsy program at Massachusetts General Hospital, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and a lead investigator in the EPIDIOLEX clinical program. “Based on numerous clinical trials, this medication may help meet the need for this specific pediatric patient population and is now the first to be approved by the FDA in Dravet syndrome.”

The EPIDIOLEX clinical development program included three randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trials and an open-label extension study. In the Phase 3 studies, published in The New England Journal of Medicine7,8 and Lancet9, EPIDIOLEX added to other antiepileptic therapies significantly reduced the frequency of seizures in patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome. The most common adverse reactions that occurred in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients were somnolence; decreased appetite; diarrhea; transaminase elevations; fatigue, malaise, and asthenia; rash; insomnia, sleep disorder and poor quality sleep; and infections. The company’s development program represents the only well-controlled clinical evaluation of a cannabinoid medication for patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome.

“For those living with intractable seizures caused by LGS and Dravet syndrome, EPIDIOLEX represents a true medical advancement,” said Philip Gattone, president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation. “Clinical development for these rare and severe conditions is essential, and today’s news brings hope for these patients and their families that a new treatment option may have the potential to help better control their seizures.”

EPIDIOLEX will be marketed in the U.S. by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals plc. As part of the approval process, EPIDIOLEX must be rescheduled from its current Schedule I before it can be made available to patients. Rescheduling is expected to occur within 90 days. Access is expected to be similar to other branded AEDs and EPIDIOLEX is expected to be available to appropriate patients by Fall 2018. More information can be found at Epidiolex.com.

Outside the U.S., this medicine is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency(EMA) for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS and Dravet Syndrome. An EMA decision on whether to recommend approval is expected in the first quarter of 2019.

 Moxidectin (8mg, PO) is macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic medication active against O.volvulus microfilariae and has also received FDA’s PRV on 13 Jun, 2018 with its accelerated NDA review from 10 to 6mos.","Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) and the World Health Organisation Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) announced today that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved moxidectin 8 mg oral for the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis) in patients aged 12 years and older1. The FDA has also awarded MDGH a priority review voucher (PRV).

River blindness is caused by a parasitic worm, Onchocerca volvulus. The disease manifests as severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions and visual impairment, including permanent blindness, caused by the worm’s larvae (microfilariae). The approval of moxidectin was based on data from two randomized, double blind, active controlled clinical studies2,3. Each study met its respective primary endpoints, showing a statistically significant superiority of moxidectin over the current standard of care, ivermectin, in suppressing the presence of the microfilariae in skin. Full results from the Phase III study were published in the Lancet in January 20183 and a safety summary is provided below.

“FDA approval is a momentous achievement for any biopharmaceutical company, but it is a particularly rare and exciting event in the neglected diseases setting” said Mark Sullivan, Founder and Managing Director of MDGH. “It takes a broad community to develop a new medicine. FDA approval represents decades of work by thousands of scientists, disease control specialists, expert advisors, community health workers, funders and study participants. We particularly acknowledge the US$13 million investment from the Global Health Investment Fund (GHIF) as well as the extraordinary persistence and dedication of the team at TDR, without whom this would not have happened.”

TDR (the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases) was instrumental in the development of moxidectin. “We are delighted about the FDA’s decision,” says TDR Director John Reeder. “It is a milestone toward the river blindness endgame and our objective to enable African countries to integrate moxidectin into their elimination strategies.”

This approval is the result of a paradigm-changing approach to the development of new medicines for neglected diseases, enabled by the PRV program. “As neglected tropical diseases are endemic in low and middle-income countries, there are limited markets for medicines. Therefore, finding investors willing to support development in these diseases is extremely difficult” added Mark Sullivan. “However, the introduction of the FDA’s neglected diseases PRV program has created a market around neglected diseases.“

The PRV legislation was designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for neglected diseases. The PRV, a saleable item, permits the holder to accelerate the review of a new drug application (NDA) from the standard 10 months to 6 months. This time saving has significant value to the pharmaceutical industry, thus creating an indirect market for neglected disease treatments.

Dr. Reeder added, “This voucher to MDGH exemplifies the original spirit of the programme – to create incentives for research and development in neglected diseases.”

MDGH is the first not-for-profit company to register a medicine through the tropical disease PRV program. “This is exactly what we had in mind when we proposed the PRV program,” said Duke University’s Professor David Ridley, an author of the 2006 paper on which the voucher scheme is based. “The voucher incentive helped Medicines Development for Global Health attract funding to complete testing and registration for a drug that had been on the shelf. I’m delighted that the voucher program is playing a role in treating patients with river blindness, and one day eliminating the disease.”

“Achieving FDA approval is a critically important milestone for moxidectin, but our work to bring this medicine to those who need it most continues in earnest,” concluded Mr. Sullivan. “MDGH plans to provide the community with additional data, including data in younger children. We are here for the full journey – we have committed our skills and resources to play our part in ridding the world of this disabling disease.”

About River Blindness

River blindness is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted from person to person by black flies that breed in fast flowing rivers in sub-Saharan Africa, Yemen and small foci in South and Central America. The association of rivers and streams, together with the worst manifestation of O. volvulus infection, blindness, led to the adoption of the more commonly known term for the disease, “river blindness”. The millions of larvae (microfilariae) released by the infecting adult parasites invade skin and eyes where they can cause severe manifestations, including permanent blindness, itching and disfiguring skin conditions. Nearly 200 million people are at risk for river blindness, and more than 99% of people infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Chemotherapy with ivermectin (Mectizan®, donated by Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), previously the only drug currently approved by the FDA for onchocerciasis, is the current standard approach to onchocerciasis control and elimination. Ivermectin has significantly reduced the disease burden, but new treatment options are needed to accelerate progress toward eliminating parasite transmission.

About Moxidectin

Moxidectin is a macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic medicine that selectively binds to the parasite’s glutamate-gated chloride ion channels. These channels are vital to the function of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. Moxidectin has activity against O. volvulus microfilariae but does not kill adult O. volvulus parasites.

Patients with river blindness administered moxidectin experienced adverse events consistent with those associated with efficacy. The nature and severity of adverse events in moxidectin recipients was similar to ivermectin. The most common adverse reactions (incidence > 10%) were: eosinophilia, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, headache, lymphopenia, tachycardia, rash, abdominal pain, hypotension, pyrexia, leukocytosis, influenza-like illness, neutropenia, cough, lymph node pain, dizziness, diarrhea, hyponatremia and peripheral swelling1.

The efficacy of repeat administrations of moxidectin has not been assessed. Moxidectin is supplied as 2 mg tablets for administration as an 8 mg dose per oral to patients at least 12 years of age with O. volvulus infection.

Investor conference call today at 8:00 am EST
GAITHERSBURG, Md.- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX) today announced results from Prepare™, a global Phase 3 clinical trial using ResVax, an aluminum adjuvanted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) protein recombinant nanoparticle vaccine. ResVax is being developed to protect infants via maternal immunization against RSV disease. In the Prepare trial, efficacy of ResVax against the primary and two secondary endpoints in per-protocol infants with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) through 90 days of life was:

39% against medically significant RSV LRTI (97.5%CI, -1% to 64%)
44% against RSV LRTI hospitalizations (95%CI, 20% to 62%)
48% against RSV LRTI with severe hypoxemia (95%CI, -8% to 75%)
Pre-specified exploratory analyses of these same vaccine efficacy endpoints, which include additional data ascertained from hospitalization records, were:

41% against medically significant RSV LRTI (95%CI, 16% to 58%)
42% against RSV LRTI hospitalizations (95%CI, 17% to 59%)
60% against RSV LRTI with severe hypoxemia (95%CI, 32% to 76%)
“Pneumonia stubbornly remains the leading killer of children under the age of five worldwide. The new maternal vaccine from Novavax shows promise in the fight against RSV, the most common cause of viral pneumonia in young children,” said Dr. Keith Klugman, Director of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Pneumonia Program. “We are very encouraged that the Novavax maternal RSV vaccine reduced severe RSV hypoxemia by 60% in the first months of life and believe this vaccine has great potential for reducing RSV-associated deaths in young babies.” The Prepare trial was supported by a grant of up to $89.1 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

“Importantly, while this study did not meet the pre-specified success criterion for the primary clinical endpoint of this trial, the data indicate that ResVax protects infants from some of the most serious consequences of RSV, including RSV LRTI hospitalizations and RSV LRTI with severe hypoxemia,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novavax, Inc. “The potential to prevent these most serious outcomes during infants’ most vulnerable months of life could have a profound impact upon the global burden of RSV disease. Our next steps include meeting with U.S. and European regulators to review these data and to discuss the path forward for licensure. We wish to acknowledge and thank the investigators, the Novavax team and the many mothers and their families around the world that participated in this historic trial, bringing the world one step closer to an RSV vaccine.”

Other observations from the Prepare trial:

Reduction in all-cause LRTI hospitalizations (25%) and all-cause LRTI severe hypoxemia (39%) in infants observed through the first 180 days of life
Mothers vaccinated from 28 up to < 33 weeks of pregnancy, showed vaccine efficacy rates against RSV LRTI hospitalization of 53% and severe RSV hypoxemia of 70% through the first 90 days of their infants’ lives, compared with 26% and 44% for mothers vaccinated ≥ 33 weeks of pregnancy
Over 90% of RSV LRTI hospitalizations and RSV LRTI severe hypoxemia in the placebo group occurred in the first 90 days of life
99% of vaccinated mothers had measurable antibody responses to the vaccine, with ≥100% transplacental transfer for all antibody types measured
ResVax appears safe in mothers and their infants through 180 days post-delivery
Novavax intends to present additional results from the Prepare trial at an upcoming medical meeting.

About RSV in Infants

Globally, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) is the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children.1 It is the second leading cause of death in children under one year of age.2 Estimated annual hospitalizations of 1.4 million and an estimated 27,300 in-hospital deaths were due to RSV acute lower respiratory infection in children under six months of age.3 RSV results in a total global economic burden of $6.2 billion annually.

In the U.S., RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants, with estimated annual hospitalizations of up to 76,000.4,5,6 While RSV can impact all infants, babies under six months of age are among those at highest risk, as approximately 77% of all first-year RSV infections occur before six months.7 In the U.S., the total economic burden is $2.7 billion annually.

10872,Biocodex's Diacomit (stiripentol) Receives FDA Approval for Seizures Associated with Dravet Syndrome (DS) in Patients Aged 2 Years or Older,FDA approves DIACOMIT (Stiripentol) for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients 2 years of age and older taking clobazam,"The approval is based on two study STICLO France and STICLO Italy assessing Diacomit vs PBO in patients with Dravet Syndrome aged 2 years of age and older taking clobazam
 STICLO France and STICLO Italy study results: responder rate (71%, 67% vs 5%, 9.1%)
 Diacomit 250mg & 500mg (stiripentol) is an anti-convulsant drug, approved as an adjunctive treatment with clobazam and valproate DS in 27 countries including EU, Canada, Japan in Jan 2007, Dec 2012, Sept 2012 respectively","GENTILLY, France,– BIOCODEX SAS is pleased to announce that on August 20th, 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved DIACOMIT (stiripentol) for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients 2 years of age and older taking clobazam. DIACOMIT is expected to be available in U.S. pharmacies in early January 2019.
“The FDA’s approval of DIACOMIT is a major milestone for Biocodex. It recognizes our R&D excellence in developing therapies for Dravet syndrome and brings a new treatment option to young patients in the USA,” said Jean-Marie Lefèvre, President and CEO of Biocodex. “Diacomit is the result of Biocodex’s own research and has been the subject of substantial investment. Our research work, along with the pre-clinical and clinical studies carried out in close collaboration with teams of university experts from around the world, have enabled us to obtain approval in Europe, Japan, Canada and, as of now, in the United States. Our efforts will not stop there. We are continuing our research on stiripentol in order to do everything in our power to improve treatment for children and adults suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy.”
The FDA approval of DIACOMIT was based on two multicenter placebo-controlled trials similar in terms of disease characteristics and prior treatment of patients, STICLO France and STICLO Italy. The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was the responder rate, with a responder defined as a patient who experienced a greater than 50% decrease in the frequency (per 30 days) of generalized clonic or tonic-clonic seizures during the double-blind treatment period compared to the 4-week baseline period. In STICLO France, the responder rate for patients receiving DIACOMIT was 71% [95% CI: 52% – 91%], compared to 5% [95% CI: 0% – 15%] for patients receiving placebo. In STICLO Italy, the responder rate for patients receiving DIACOMIT was 67% [95% CI: 40% – 93%], compared to 9.1% [95% CI: 0% – 26%] for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 10% of DIACOMIT-treated patients and more frequently than on placebo, included somnolence (67%), decreased appetite (45%), agitation (27%), ataxia (27%), weight decreased (27%), hypotonia (24%), nausea (15%), tremor (15%), dysarthria (12%), and insomnia (12%). There were 2 patients in whom adverse reactions led to discontinuation of DIACOMIT treatment: one patient had an adverse reaction of status epilepticus; the second patient had drowsiness, balance impaired and sialorrhea.
About Dravet Syndrome
Dravet syndrome, also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI), is a catastrophic early onset epileptic syndrome that is thought to affect approximately 2,000 to 8,000 patients in the U.S. Dravet syndrome is characterized by severe epilepsy, psychomotor retardation, and often ataxia. In most cases, the first seizures occur during the first year of life. Status epilepticus is frequent and is thought to be in part responsible for the high mortality rate reported in these patients, ranging from 15.9 to 18%.
About DIACOMIT (stiripentol)
DIACOMIT is a new molecular entity developed by Laboratories Biocodex. Possible mechanisms of action of its anticonvulsant effect in humans include direct effects mediated through the GABAA receptor and indirect effects involving inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity with resulting increase in blood levels of clobazam and its active metabolite. DIACOMIT is now approved by FDA in two formulations (capsules and powder for oral suspension).
DIACOMIT is approved for adjunctive treatment with clobazam and valproate in Dravet syndrome in 27 countries in the EU (January 2007), Canada (December 2012), and Japan (September 2012).
Biocodex received orphan-drug designation for DIACOMIT from the FDA in 2008.

10897,Sanofi's Zynquista (sotagliflozin) and Dupixent (dupilumab) Receives CHMP Recommendation for Type 1 Diabetes and Asthmaï»¿,CHMP recommends ZynquistaTM (sotagliflozin) for the treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes,"Zynquista’s CHMP recommendation is based on P-III TANDEM study assessing Zynquista (200mg &400mg) vs insulin in 3,000 patients with T1D mellitus. The study resulted in reduction in blood sugar level and systolic BP @24wks. & improvement in time to maintain targeted blood sugar range
 Dupixent ‘s CHMP recommendation is based on P-III QUEST and VENTURE studies assessing Dupixent vs PBO in 2,888 patients with asthma. The studies resulted in reduction in asthma attacks (exacerbations), dependency on corticosteroids & improvement in lung function
 Zynquista (200mg &400mg, PO) is an SGLT1 & SGLT2 inhibitor, co-developed by Sanofi and Lexicon with awaited US and EU approval. Dupixent is a mAb, inhibitor of IL-4 & IL-13, co-developed by Sanofi and Regeneron and has received the US FDA & EU approval in asthma & atopic dermatitis respectively","The European Medicines Agency’s
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion
on the Marketing Authorization of ZynquistaTM* (sotagliflozin), developed by Sanofi and
Lexicon.
The CHMP recommended approval of sotagliflozin in the European Union (EU) in both a
200-mg and 400-mg dose for use as an adjunct to insulin therapy to improve blood sugar
(glycemic) control in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) mellitus with a body mass index
≥ 27 kg/m2
, who have failed to achieve adequate glycemic control despite optimal insulin
therapy.
Sotagliflozin is an investigational oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose
regulation known as sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and
SGLT2).1 SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract,2 and
SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney.3
The CHMP opinion is based on evidence including data from the inTandem clinical trial
program, which included three Phase 3 clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of
sotagliflozin in approximately 3,000 adults with inadequately controlled T1D. These three
trials demonstrated that treatment with sotagliflozin, when given to adults with inadequately
controlled T1D as an oral adjunct to insulin, resulted in consistent, significant reductions
from baseline at 24 weeks in average blood sugar (HbA1c), body weight, systolic blood
pressure and a significant improvement of time in target blood sugar range, versus insulin
alone, at both 200-mg and 400-mg doses.
4-7
The European Commission is expected to make a final decision on the Marketing
Authorization Application for sotagliflozin in the EU in the coming months.
Sotagliflozin is also currently being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and has the potential to be the first oral antidiabetic drug approved in the U.S. for
use together with insulin therapy to improve glycemic control in adults living with T1D. The
target FDA action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) is anticipated
to be March 22, 2019.8
* The EMA and FDA have conditionally accepted Zynquista™ as the trade name for sotagliflozin.

 Cosentyx (secukinumab) is a mAb targeting IL-17A responsible for inflammation and development of psoriatic diseases and has approved in more than 80 countries including EU & the US","Phase III study shows close to 9/10 patients who received Cosentyx® 300mg achieved clear or almost clear skin during the first 16 weeks of treatment (87%), with rapid onset of relief seen as early as week 3[1]
Results strengthen unique position of Cosentyx as a rapid and long-lasting complete treatment of psoriatic disease, with over 200,000 patients treated worldwide[2]
Data is being presented at the 2019 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C.
Basel, March 4, 2019 – Novartis announced today new data in 441 Chinese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis from a Phase III study investigating the efficacy and safety of Cosentyx (secukinumab). The data, part of a broader ongoing 52 week Phase III study in 543 patients, show 97.7% of patients treated with Cosentyx 300mg achieved PASI 75 and 80.9% achieved PASI 90 by week 12, with 87% of patients reaching PASI 90 by week 16. In patients treated with Cosentyx 150mg, 87.8% achieved PASI 75 and 66.4% achieved PASI 90 at week 12[1].
“Cosentyx continues to deliver what psoriasis patients need – reimagining care to provide clear skin and a complete treatment,” said Eric Hughes, Global Development Unit Head, Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology, and China Region Development Head. “We’re excited to report for the first time data for a Chinese population, and to see strong support from the data for Cosentyx.”
Cosentyx is backed by a wealth of research with 100 studies and has been proven to offer clear or almost clear skin in 8 out of 10 patients within 16 weeks of treatment[3]. Nearly 100% of response rates are maintained up to 5 years[4]. It is a fully human monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-17A and has demonstrated rapid, long-lasting efficacy and safety in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and the more persistent manifestations of psoriasis, namely scalp, palms, soles and nails[5,6].
About Cosentyx
Cosentyx is a targeted biologic and the first and only fully-human treatment that specifically inhibits IL-17A, a cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation and development of psoriatic disease, including psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)[7-10]. IL-17A is produced by both IL-23 dependent and IL-23 independent pathways, by various cells from both the innate immune system (which can be triggered by mechanical stress) and the adaptive immune system[11]. By acting directly on IL-17A, Cosentyx inhibits this cornerstone cytokine irrespective of where the IL-17A comes from[8].
Cosentyx is an established brand, supported by 5-year sustained efficacy and safety data across three indications (PsO, PsA and AS) and more than 200,000 patients treated[2,6,12,13]. Cosentyx has shown fast and sustained long-term efficacy, as well as a consistently favorable safety profile, with almost zero injection site reactions and pain[6,12,14-17]. It is approved in more than 80 countries, which includes the European Union countries and the US, and is supported by 100 studies in the real world and clinical setting[2,18].

 The P-I study evaluates Takeda’s TAK-079 safety, efficacy, PK/PD and will conduct in 20 research centers including member of Lupus Therapeutics’ Lupus Clinical Investigators Network (LuCIN)
 TAK-079 (SC) is a mAb, targets CD38 protein, reduces the immune cell expressing CD38 protein responsible for producing autoantibodies","New York, The Lupus Research Alliance and its affiliate, Lupus Therapeutics announced a collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, to evaluate the investigational biologic TAK-079 as a potential new therapy for lupus in a Phase 1 trial (NCT03724916). The national study will be conducted in 20 research centers throughout the country, many of which are members of Lupus Therapeutics’ Lupus Clinical Investigators Network (LuCIN).
TAK-079 is a fully human monoclonal antibody, meaning that it is produced in the laboratory using human DNA sequences. In preclinical studies, TAK-079 attached to and inhibited CD38, a protein found on many immune cells that are involved in producing autoantibodies. Data from a study with healthy volunteers suggested that TAK-079 is generally well-tolerated and showed a decrease in the number of immune cells that expressed CD38.
The Phase 1 study will enroll patients with moderate to severe lupus and aims to evaluate the safety of TAK-079 as well as its pharmacokinetics (how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted from the body) and its pharmacodynamics (how it works and affects the body). To join the trial, patients must have moderate to severe disease activity that has not responded well enough to standard lupus treatment. Participants will receive up to four doses of either TAK-079 or placebo, in combination with their ongoing standard lupus treatment.
“We are very excited about this first clinical study looking at the potential for TAK-079 to provide a much-needed treatment option for people with lupus,” commented Albert Roy, Executive Director of Lupus Therapeutics. “The LuCIN sites are ready to enroll patients in the study. We encourage people with lupus to talk with their physician about whether this opportunity to take part in clinical research is right for them.”
About Lupus
Lupus is a chronic, complex autoimmune disease that affects millions of people worldwide. More than 90% of people with lupus are women; lupus most often strikes during the childbearing years of 15-45. African Americans, Latin Americans, Asians and Native Americans are two to three times at greater risk than Caucasians. In lupus, the immune system, which is designed to protect against infection, creates antibodies that can attack any part of the body including the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, blood, skin, and joints.

 NST’s NSR-REP1 & NSR-RPGR are subretinal injections based on AVV vector used for the treatment of choroideremia (CHM) & X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) respectively","Biogen to acquire Nightstar Therapeutics for $25.50 per share

Nightstar Therapeutics is a gene therapy company focused on developing novel treatments for patients suffering from rare inherited retinal diseases that would otherwise lead to blindness

Nightstar has two potentially first-in-class mid- to late-stage clinical assets as well as preclinical programs

Lead asset NSR-REP1 is in Phase 3 development for choroideremia, a rare degenerative disorder that leads to blindness and has no approved treatment options

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 04, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Nightstar Therapeutics (NST; Nasdaq: NITE), a clinical-stage gene therapy company based in London, United Kingdom, which is focused on adeno-associated virus (AAV) treatments for inherited retinal disorders. Under the terms of the proposed acquisition, Biogen will pay $25.50 in cash for each NST share. This offer represents a total transaction value of approximately $800 million on a fully diluted basis, after taking into account expected transaction expenses and anticipated cash at closing.
“Ophthalmology is an emerging growth area for Biogen, and we are excited about the opportunity to work with the talented employees at Nightstar to advance potentially transformative gene therapy programs for rare retinal diseases,” said Michel Vounatsos, Biogen’s Chief Executive Officer. “With this proposed acquisition, we are continuing to bolster our pipeline and further execute on our strategy to develop and expand a multi-franchise neuroscience pipeline across complementary modalities. Nightstar would accelerate our entry into ophthalmology by contributing two mid- to late-stage gene therapy assets, with the potential to create long-term shareholder value.”
NST’s lead asset is NSR-REP1 for the treatment of choroideremia (CHM), a rare, degenerative, X-linked inherited retinal disorder, which leads to blindness and has no approved treatments. CHM primarily affects males and is caused by loss of function in the CHM gene which encodes the Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1). The REP-1 protein plays a role in intracellular protein trafficking, and loss of function in the CHM gene leads to abnormal intracellular protein trafficking and impaired elimination of waste products from the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. Initially, patients with CHM experience poor night vision, and over time progressive visual loss ultimately leads to complete blindness.
NSR-REP1 is comprised of an AAV vector administered by subretinal injection which provides a functioning CHM gene and expression of the REP-1 protein to restore membrane trafficking and thereby slow, stop, or potentially reverse the decline in vision. Data from the Phase 1/2 trial of NSR-REP1 demonstrated potentially meaningful slowing of decline in visual acuity as compared to natural history as well as signs of improved visual acuity in some patients. NSR-REP1 is currently being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 STAR trial with data expected in the second half of 2020.
NST’s second clinical program is NSR-RPGR for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), which is also a rare inherited retinal disease primarily affecting males with no approved treatments. XLRP is characterized by mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene leading to a lack of active protein transport in photoreceptors. This abnormality leads to loss of the photoreceptor cells, resulting in retinal dysfunction by adolescence and early adulthood, progressing to legal blindness when patients reach their 40s.
NSR-RPGR is comprised of an AAV vector administered by subretinal injection which provides a functioning RPGR gene and thus expression of the RPGR protein, which is critical for protein transport in photoreceptors. The restoration of photoreceptor function is intended to slow, stop, or potentially reverse the decline in vision. Phase 1/2 data from the dose escalation portion of the XIRIUS trial for NSR-RPGR demonstrated an increase in central retinal sensitivity. The Phase 2/3 dose expansion portion of the XIRIUS trial is currently ongoing.
NST’s preclinical pipeline includes NSR-ABCA4 for Stargardt disease and potential programs targeting Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease) and other genetic forms of retinitis pigmentosa.
The acquisition of NST is planned to be funded through available cash and accounted for as an acquisition of a business. Biogen expects to complete the acquisition by mid-year 2019.
It is intended that the proposed acquisition will be implemented by means of a U.K. Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the U.K. Companies Act 2006. The closing of the proposed acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval by NST shareholders, the issuance of an order by the U.K. Court and receipt of regulatory approvals. The proposed acquisition does not require the approval of Biogen’s stockholders.
CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST
On March 4, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, Biogen will host a live webcast and conference call to discuss the agreement to acquire Nightstar, which will be accessible through the Investors section of Biogen’s website, www.biogen.com.

 The P-III study results: ORR (78% vs 39%); PFS (16.4mos. vs 9.1 mos.); presented at 23rd Annual International Congress on Hematologic Malignancies
 Copiktra(25mg, q2d) is an oral inhibitor of PI3Ki (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), first approved dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma. On 24 Sept,2018, Copiktra received FDA’s approval for r/r CLL/SLL and accelerated approval for r/r follicular lymphoma (FL)","Verastem, Inc. (Nasdaq:VSTM) (Verastem Oncology or the Company), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing medicines seeking to improve the survival and quality of life of cancer patients, today announced a poster highlighting clinical data from the Phase 3 DUO study evaluating COPIKTRA (duvelisib) in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) after at least two prior therapies was presented at the 23rd Annual International Congress on Hematologic Malignancies (ICHM), which took place February 28 – March 3, 2019, in Miami, FL. COPIKTRA, an oral inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and the first approved dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma, received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this same indication in September 2018.
COPIKTRA also received accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies. The accelerated approval was based on overall response rate and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon confirmatory trials.
“Although the treatment landscape in CLL/SLL has advanced in recent years, there remains an unmet need with many patients progressing or relapsing,” commented Ian Flinn, MD, PhD, Director, Lymphoma/CLL Program at Sarah Cannon Research Institute and lead investigator of the DUO study. “These data from the randomized Phase 3 DUO study, which were calculated from patients who had previously received at least two prior therapies, demonstrate that COPIKTRA achieved a 78% overall response rate and progression-free survival of 16.4 months, compared to 9.1 months for ofatumumab, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL, including in high risk patients with the 17p deletion. With convenient oral administration COPIKTRA has been a valuable addition to the treatment landscape for CLL/SLL patients and for the physicians who treat them.”
Results of the Phase 3 DUO Study Evaluating COPIKTRA in Adult Patients with Relapsed or Refractory CLL/SLL After At Least Two Prior Therapies
The randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 DUO study, compared COPIKTRA versus ofatumumab in 319 adult patients with CLL (n=312) or SLL (n=7) after at least one prior therapy. The study randomized patients with a 1:1 ratio to receive either COPIKTRA 25mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or ofatumumab, an approved standard of care treatment for use in CLL/SLL, for 7 cycles.
The approval of COPIKTRA was based on efficacy and safety analysis of patients with at least 2 prior lines of therapy, where the benefit:risk appeared greater in this more heavily pretreated population compared to the overall trial population.
In this subset (95 randomized to COPIKTRA, 101 to ofatumumab), the median patient age was 69 years (range: 40 to 90 years), 59% were male, and 88% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Forty-six percent received 2 prior lines of therapy, and 54% received 3 or more prior lines. At baseline, 52% of patients had at least one tumor ≥ 5 cm, and 22% of patients had a documented 17p deletion.
During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to COPIKTRA was 13 months (range: 0.2 to 37), with 80% of patients receiving at least 6 months and 52% receiving at least 12 months of COPIKTRA. The median duration of exposure to ofatumumab was 5 months (range: < 0.1 to 6).
Efficacy was based on progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). Other efficacy measures included overall response rate (ORR). Efficacy of COPIKTRA compared to ofatumumab specifically in patients treated with at least two prior therapies is below.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections: Serious, including fatal (18/442; 4%), infections occurred in 31% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). The most common serious infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and lower respiratory infections. Median time to onset of any grade infection was 3 months (range: 1 day to 32 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 6 months. Treat infections prior to initiation of COPIKTRA. Advise patients to report new or worsening signs and symptoms of infection. For grade 3 or higher infection, withhold COPIKTRA until infection has resolved. Resume COPIKTRA at the same or reduced dose.
Serious, including fatal, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) occurred in 1% of patients taking COPIKTRA. Provide prophylaxis for PJP during treatment with COPIKTRA and following completion of treatment with COPIKTRA until the absolute CD4+ T cell count is greater than 200 cells/μL. Withhold COPIKTRA in patients with suspected PJP of any grade, and permanently discontinue if PJP is confirmed.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation/infection occurred in 1% of patients taking COPIKTRA. Consider prophylactic antivirals during COPIKTRA treatment to prevent CMV infection including CMV reactivation. For clinical CMV infection or viremia, withhold COPIKTRA until infection or viremia resolves. If COPIKTRA is resumed, administer the same or reduced dose and monitor patients for CMV reactivation by PCR or antigen test at least monthly.
Diarrhea or Colitis: Serious, including fatal (1/442; <1%), diarrhea or colitis occurred in 18% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). Median time to onset of any grade diarrhea or colitis was 4 months (range: 1 day to 33 months), with 75% of cases occurring by 8 months. The median event duration was 0.5 months (range: 1 day to 29 months; 75th percentile: 1 month).
Advise patients to report any new or worsening diarrhea. For patients presenting with mild or moderate diarrhea (Grade 1-2) (i.e., up to 6 stools per day over baseline) or asymptomatic (Grade 1) colitis, initiate supportive care with antidiarrheal agents, continue COPIKTRA at the current dose, and monitor the patient at least weekly until the event resolves. If the diarrhea is unresponsive to antidiarrheal therapy, withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g., budesonide). Monitor the patient at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea, consider restarting COPIKTRA at a reduced dose.
For patients presenting with abdominal pain, stool with mucus or blood, change in bowel habits, peritoneal signs, or with severe diarrhea (Grade 3) (i.e., > 6 stools per day over baseline), withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g., budesonide) or systemic steroids. A diagnostic work-up to determine etiology, including colonoscopy, should be performed. Monitor at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea or colitis, restart COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. For recurrent Grade 3 diarrhea or recurrent colitis of any grade, discontinue COPIKTRA. Discontinue COPIKTRA for life-threatening diarrhea or colitis.
Cutaneous Reactions: Serious, including fatal (2/442; <1%), cutaneous reactions occurred in 5% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). Fatal cases included drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Median time to onset of any grade cutaneous reaction was 3 months (range: 1 day to 29 months, 75th percentile: 6 months) with a median event duration of 1 month (range: 1 day to 37 months, 75th percentile: 2 months).
Presenting features for the serious events were primarily described as pruritic, erythematous, or maculo-papular. Less common presenting features include exanthem, desquamation, erythroderma, skin exfoliation, keratinocyte necrosis, and papular rash. Advise patients to report new or worsening cutaneous reactions. Review all concomitant medications and discontinue any medications potentially contributing to the event. For patients presenting with mild or moderate (Grade 1-2) cutaneous reactions, continue COPIKTRA at the current dose, initiate supportive care with emollients, antihistamines (for pruritus), or topical steroids, and monitor the patient closely. Withhold COPIKTRA for severe (Grade 3) cutaneous reaction until resolution. Initiate supportive care with steroids (topical or systemic) or antihistamines (for pruritus). Monitor at least weekly until resolved. Upon resolution of the event, restart COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. Discontinue COPIKTRA if severe cutaneous reaction does not improve, worsens, or recurs. For life-threatening cutaneous reactions, discontinue COPIKTRA. In patients with SJS, TEN, or DRESS of any grade, discontinue COPIKTRA.
Pneumonitis: Serious, including fatal (1/442; <1%), pneumonitis without an apparent infectious cause occurred in 5% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). Median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis was 4 months (range: 9 days to 27 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 9 months. The median event duration was 1 month, with 75% of cases resolving by 2 months.
Withhold COPIKTRA in patients with new or progressive pulmonary signs and symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, interstitial infiltrates on a radiologic exam, or a decline by more than 5% in oxygen saturation, and evaluate for etiology. If the pneumonitis is infectious, patients may be restarted on COPIKTRA at the previous dose once the infection, pulmonary signs and symptoms resolve. For moderate non-infectious pneumonitis (Grade 2), treat with systemic corticosteroids and resume COPIKTRA at a reduced dose upon resolution. If non-infectious pneumonitis recurs or does not respond to steroid therapy, discontinue COPIKTRA. For severe or life-threatening non-infectious pneumonitis, discontinue COPIKTRA and treat with systemic steroids.
Hepatotoxicity: Grade 3 and 4 ALT and/or AST elevation developed in 8% and 2%, respectively, of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442). Two percent of patients had both an ALT or AST > 3 X ULN and total bilirubin > 2 X ULN. Median time to onset of any grade transaminase elevation was 2 months (range: 3 days to 26 months), with a median event duration of 1 month (range: 1 day to 16 months).
Monitor hepatic function during treatment with COPIKTRA. For Grade 2 ALT/AST elevation (> 3 to 5 X ULN), maintain COPIKTRA dose and monitor at least weekly until return to < 3 X ULN. For Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation (> 5 to 20 X ULN), withhold COPIKTRA and monitor at least weekly until return to < 3 X ULN. Resume COPIKTRA at the same dose (first occurrence) or at a reduced dose for subsequent occurrences. For grade 4 ALT/AST elevation (> 20 X ULN), discontinue COPIKTRA.
Neutropenia: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 42% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N=442), with Grade 4 neutropenia occurring in 24% of all patients. Median time to onset of grade ≥3 neutropenia was 2 months (range: 3 days to 31 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 4 months.
Monitor neutrophil counts at least every 2 weeks for the first 2 months of COPIKTRA therapy, and at least weekly in patients with neutrophil counts < 1.0 Gi/L (Grade 3-4). Withhold COPIKTRA in patients presenting with neutrophil counts < 0.5 Gi/L (Grade 4). Monitor until ANC is > 0.5 Gi/L, then resume COPIKTRA at same dose for the first occurrence or at a reduced dose for subsequent occurrences.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, COPIKTRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Conduct pregnancy testing before initiating COPIKTRA treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose.

About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are cancers that affect lymphocytes and are essentially the same disease, with the only difference being the location where the cancer primarily occurs. When most of the cancer cells are located in the bloodstream and the bone marrow, the disease is referred to as CLL, although the lymph nodes and spleen are often involved. When the cancer cells are located mostly in the lymph nodes, the disease is called SLL. The symptoms of CLL/SLL include a tender, swollen abdomen and feeling full even after eating only a small amount. Other symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, anemia, bruising easily, night sweats, weight loss, and frequent infections. However, many patients with CLL/SLL will live for years without symptoms. There are approximately 200,000 patients in the US affected by CLL/SLL with nearly 20,000 new diagnoses this year alone. While there are therapies currently available, real-world data reveals that a significant number of patients either relapse following treatment, become refractory to current agents, or are unable to tolerate treatment, representing a significant medical need. The potential of additional oral agents, particularly as a monotherapy that can be used in the general community physician’s armamentarium, may hold significant value in the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL.
About Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is typically a slow-growing or indolent form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that arises from B-lymphocytes, making it a B-cell lymphoma. This lymphoma subtype accounts for 20 to 30 percent of all NHL cases, with more than 140,000 people in the US with FL and more than 13,000 newly diagnosed patients this year. Common symptoms of FL include enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, abdomen, or groin, as well as fatigue, shortness of breath, night sweats, and weight loss. Often, patients with FL have no obvious symptoms of the disease at diagnosis. Follicular lymphoma is usually not considered to be curable, but more of a chronic disease, with patients living for many years with this form of lymphoma. The potential of additional oral agents, particularly as a monotherapy that can be used in the general community physician’s armamentarium, may hold significant value in the treatment of patients with FL.
About COPIKTRA™ (duvelisib)
COPIKTRA is an oral inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and the first approved dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma, two enzymes known to help support the growth and survival of malignant B-cells. PI3K signaling may lead to the proliferation of malignant B-cells and is thought to play a role in the formation and maintenance of the supportive tumor microenvironment.1,2,3 COPIKTRA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) after at least two prior therapies and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies. COPIKTRA is also being developed by Verastem Oncology for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), for which it has received Fast Track status, and is being investigated in combination with other agents through investigator-sponsored studies.4 For more information on COPIKTRA, please visit www.COPIKTRA.com.

ARIEL3 Trial Fact Sheet
On January 24, 2019, the European Commission (EC) expanded rucaparib’s indication beyond its initial marketing authorization in Europe for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in selected patients granted in May 2018. With this label expansion, rucaparib is now approved as maintenance treatment for eligible patients regardless of their BRCA-mutation status. Rucaparib is the first PARP inhibitor licensed for an ovarian cancer treatment indication in the EU and is now the first to be available for both treatment and maintenance treatment among eligible patients.
“I have been treating women with relapsed ovarian cancer under the Rucaparib Access Program and I am confident that rucaparib represents an important treatment option for women here in Germany,” “said Professor Jalid Sehouli, Gynecologic Oncologist and head of the Charité European Competence Center for Ovarian Cancer at the University of Berlin. “There has been a significant need for additional treatment options for women with relapsed ovarian cancer, and rucaparib’s approval in the maintenance setting provides another option for these patients.”
“With this milestone approval in Germany, we are one step closer to ensuring that Rubraca is available to all eligible women who may potentially benefit,” said Patrick J. Mahaffy, President and CEO of Clovis Oncology. “Rubraca has shown further tumor shrinkage as well as prolonged progression-free survival in this maintenance setting, therefore Rubraca represents an important step forward for women with advanced ovarian cancer, regardless of their BRCA status.”
The EC authorization is based on data from the phase 3 ARIEL3 clinical trial, which found that rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival in all ovarian cancer patient populations studied.i
The ARIEL3 trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of rucaparib that enrolled 564 women with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive rucaparib tablets 600mg twice daily (n=375) or placebo (n=189). i
ARIEL3 successfully achieved its primary endpoint of extending investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in all patients treated (intention-to-treat [ITT]), population, regardless of BRCA status (median 10.8 mos vs 5.4 mos); the key secondary endpoint of extending PFS as assessed by independent radiological review (IRR) was also achieved (median 13.7 mos vs 5.4 mos). ii
In a prespecified exploratory analysis of patients in the ITT population with measurable disease at baseline showed a tumor response was reported in 18 percent of patients (n=26) on rucaparib compared to eight percent of patients (n=5) on placebo, including seven percent (n=10) in the rucaparib group who achieved a complete remission. i
The overall safety profile of rucaparib is based on data from 937 patients with ovarian cancer treated with rucaparib monotherapy in clinical trials. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥20% of patients were nausea, fatigue/asthenia, vomiting, anemia, abdominal pain, dysgeusia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations, decreased appetite, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia and creatinine elevations. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). ii
Grade ≥3 adverse reactions occurring in >5% of patients were anemia (23%), ALT elevations (10%), fatigue/asthenia (10%), neutropenia (8%), thrombocytopenia (6%), and nausea (5%). The only serious adverse reaction occurring in > 2% of patients was anemia (5%). ii
Adverse reactions that most commonly led to dose reduction or interruption were anemia (20%), fatigue/asthenia (18%), nausea (16%), thrombocytopenia (15%), and AST/ALT elevations (10%). Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 10% of patients, with thrombocytopenia, nausea, anemia, and fatigue/asthenia being the most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation.ii

About Ovarian Cancer in Europe and Germany
In 2018, ovarian cancer was the sixth most common cancer among women in Europe, with an estimated 68,000 women diagnosed and the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women, with an estimated 45,000 deaths annually. After initial therapy, many women’s disease will still recur, and approximately 70% of patients with ovarian cancer will relapse within the first three years following initial treatment. Germany has the highest incidence of new cases and deaths caused by ovarian cancer in Europe. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2018 there were approximately 6,800 new cases of ovarian cancer and 5,400 ovarian cancer-related deaths in the country.

10945,ï»¿Ascendis Pharma Reports Results of TransCon Growth Hormone in P-III Height Study for Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) in Children,Ascendis Pharma Announces Once-weekly TransCon™ Growth Hormone Demonstrated Superiority on Primary Endpoint Compared to a Daily Growth Hormone in Phase 3 heiGHt Trial for Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency,"The P-III HEIGHT study involves assessing of Transcon Growth Hormone (hGH) n=105 vs Pfizer’s Genotropin (n=56) in 161 children with GHD in ratio 2:1
 The P-III HEIGHT study resulting in meeting its 1EPs, non-inferior/superior to Pfizer’s Genotropin, annualized height velocity (AHV) @52 wks. (11.2 cm/yr. vs 10.3 cm/yr.), AEs (1% vs 1.8%), safe & tolerable and presented at ENDO on 24 Mar,2019
 Transcon hGH (0.24 mg/kg/wk., SC, qw,) is a long acting hGH therapy used to overcome the burden of daily injection on patients with its expected BLA submission in FDA in H1’20","TransCon hGH demonstrated comparable safety and tolerability to a daily hGH –

– Potential once-weekly treatment option to overcome long-standing challenges with administration of daily hGH –

– Currently no available long-acting growth hormone treatment in the US or Europe –

– Ascendis Pharma to host conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time –

COPENHAGEN, Denmark, – Ascendis Pharma A/S(Nasdaq: ASND), a biopharmaceutical company that utilizes its innovative TransCon technology to address unmet medical needs, today announced positive top-line results from the phase 3 heiGHt Trial, a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial that compared once-weekly TransCon Growth Hormone (hGH) to a daily growth hormone (Genotropin®) in children with pediatric growth hormone deficiency (GHD).
The trial met its primary objective, demonstrating that TransCon hGH was observed to be non-inferior and, additionally, superior to the daily hGH on the primary endpoint of annualized height velocity (AHV) at 52 weeks. In the primary analysis of the intent-to-treat population using ANCOVA, TransCon hGH demonstrated an AHV of 11.2 cm/year compared to 10.3 cm/year for the daily hGH. The treatment difference was 0.86 cm/year with a 95 percent confidence interval of 0.22 to 1.50 cm/year. The AHV for TransCon hGH was significantly greater than the daily hGH (p=0.0088).
The AHV was greater for TransCon hGH than for the daily hGH at each visit, with the treatment difference reaching statistical significance from and including week 26 onward. The incidence of poor responders (AHV < 8.0 cm/year) was 4 percent and 11 percent in the TransCon hGH and daily hGH arms, respectively. All sensitivity analyses completed from the trial support the primary outcome, indicating the robustness of these results.
Results from the trial indicate that TransCon hGH was generally safe and well-tolerated, with adverse events consistent with the type and frequency observed with daily hGH therapy and comparable between arms of the trial. Key safety observations:

No serious adverse events related to study drug were observed in either arm
One serious adverse event was observed in each arm (representing 1.0 percent for TransCon hGH and 1.8 percent for daily hGH), both determined to be unrelated to study drug
No treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug were observed in either arm
“The heiGHt Trial results announced today represent a potential breakthrough for patients and future treatment options for growth hormone deficiency,” said Jan Mikkelsen, Ascendis Pharma’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “The heiGHt Trial demonstrated that TransCon hGH had superior efficacy, as well as comparable safety and tolerability to daily growth hormone. We believe these results provide a validation of our TransCon technology platform, which forms the basis of our endocrinology pipeline and has potential application in other therapeutic areas.”
Additional preliminary analyses from the heiGHt Trial:

No neutralizing antibodies detected, and low level (<10 percent) of low-titer non-neutralizing antibodies was similar between the two arms
Height standard deviation score (SDS) at 52 weeks increased over baseline by 1.05 for TransCon hGH and by 0.94 for the daily hGH, and the treatment difference in height SDS increased at each visit over 52 weeks
Body Mass Index (BMI) SDS was stable over 52 weeks and was -0.03 for TransCon hGH and -0.40 for the daily hGH at week 52
Mean hemoglobin A1c values were generally stable over the course of the trial and remained within the normal range for both arms
Observed peak and trough insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) SDS values were 1.3 and -0.5 over 52 weeks, respectively, for TransCon hGH compared to an approximate average IGF-1 SDS of 0.0 for the daily hGH at week 52
In a pre-defined subset of 11 subjects, IGF-1 levels were assessed during week 13 and results were similar to those reported in the TransCon hGH pediatric phase 2 trial
Consecutive IGF-1 SDS values >2.0 were uncommon (<10 percent of subjects) and IGF-1 SDS >3.0 were rare (<3 percent of subjects)
Adverse events leading to dose reduction (IGF-1 levels or clinical symptoms) occurred twice in the TransCon hGH arm (representing 1.9 percent) and once in the daily hGH arm (representing 1.8 percent)
Two subjects in each treatment arm experienced mild injection site reactions that were considered adverse events
The heiGHt Trial evaluated 161 treatment-naïve children with GHD randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either once-weekly TransCon hGH (0.24 mg/kg/week subcutaneously, n=105) or daily Genotropin (34 µg/kg/day or 0.24 mg/kg/week subcutaneously, n=56) for 52 weeks. Of the 161 subjects, two subjects, one from each arm, withdrew from the trial prior to the final visit.
TransCon hGH is designed to deliver unmodified hGH, the same growth hormone used in daily therapies, at a predictable rate over one week. Currently in the U.S. and Europe, the only GHD treatment option for patients and their families is daily hGH injections. Patients receiving daily therapy endure thousands of injections over the course of many years. This often leads to missed doses and patients who fail to meet expected outcomes.
“Results from the pivotal heiGHt Trial demonstrated that TransCon hGH was more effective than daily hGH, with comparable safety and tolerability observed. We are thankful to all those who participated in this important global trial,” said Jonathan Leff, M.D., Ascendis Pharma’s Chief Medical Officer. “Our goal is to alleviate the burden of daily injections so every child has a better opportunity to achieve normal adult height and overall endocrine health – and to look forward to a healthy future.”
These heiGHt Trial data will be presented for the first time as an oral presentation on Sunday, March 24 at ENDO 2019.
The TransCon hGH phase 3 program includes the heiGHt, fliGHt and enliGHten Trials. Top-line data for the fliGHt Trial, evaluating TransCon hGH in subjects who switch from daily hGH, are expected in the second quarter of 2019. The enliGHten Trial is a long-term extension that provides subjects from the heiGHt and fliGHt Trials with the opportunity to continue once-weekly TransCon hGH treatment.
Ascendis plans a clinical database lock for the TransCon hGH phase 3 program in the third quarter of 2019. Subsequently, the company intends to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for TransCon hGH to treat pediatric GHD in the first half of 2020.
Conference Call and Webcast Information
Ascendis Pharma will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss the top-line heiGHt Trial results. Details include:

About TransCon™ Technology
TransCon refers to “transient conjugation.” The proprietary TransCon platform is an innovative technology to create new therapies that optimize therapeutic effect, including efficacy, safety and dosing frequency. TransCon molecules have three components: an unmodified parent drug, an inert carrier that protects it, and a linker that temporarily binds the two. When bound, the carrier inactivates and shields the parent drug from clearance. When injected into the body, physiologic pH and temperature conditions initiate the release of the active, unmodified parent drug in a predictable release manner. Because the parent drug is unmodified, its original mode of action is expected to be maintained. TransCon technology can be applied broadly to a protein, peptide or small molecule in multiple therapeutic areas, and can be used systemically or locally.
About Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)
Pediatric GHD is a serious orphan disease caused when the pituitary gland does not produce enough growth hormone. Children with GHD are not only characterized by short stature, but they also experience metabolic abnormalities, psychosocial challenges, cognitive deficiencies and poor quality of life.
For decades, the standard of care for GHD has been a daily subcutaneous injection of hGH, which improves growth and metabolic effects. For caregivers and patients, the treatment burden with daily injections is high, which leads to poor adherence and reduced overall treatment outcomes.

“We believe it is essential to target multiple dimensions of the immune system in parallel to address the multi-faceted etiologies underlying cancer cell growth in difficult-to-treat tumors such as pancreatic cancer,” said Jonathan Zalevsky, Chief Scientific Officer of Nektar Therapeutics. “This experimental triple combination regimen of BXCL701, NKTR-214 and avelumab is designed to leverage multiple mechanisms of action to better fight pancreatic cancer while potentially generating long-term cancer immunity. We’re pleased to be working with BTI as well as Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer on this program.”

*Avelumab is under clinical investigation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these uses. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for pancreatic cancer by any health authority worldwide.

About BXCL701
BXCL701 is an orally-available systemic innate-immune activator with dual mechanisms of action. It has demonstrated single agent activity in melanoma, with an established safety profile from 700 healthy subjects and cancer patients. Designed to stimulate both the innate and acquired immune systems, BXCL701 works by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 8/9 and blocking immune evasion by targeting Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP). Preclinical combination data evaluating BXCL701, a checkpoint inhibitor and other immuno-oncology agents has demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor types and formation of functional immunological memory. BXCL701’s primary mechanism of action has recently been highlighted in multiple peer reviewed journals, providing an important validation of the scientific rationale behind BXCL701.

About NKTR-214
NKTR-214 preferentially binds to the CD122 receptor on the surface of cancer-fighting immune cells in order to stimulate their proliferation. In clinical and preclinical studies, treatment with NKTR-214 resulted in expansion of these cells and mobilization into the tumor micro-environment. NKTR-214 has an antibody-like dosing regimen similar to the existing checkpoint inhibitor class of approved medicines.

About Avelumab
Avelumab is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. Avelumab has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, avelumab has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.1-3 Avelumab has also been shown to induce NK cell-mediated direct tumor cell lysis via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro.3-5 In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab.

Approved Indications
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in more than 45 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.

Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label
The warnings and precautions for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with BAVENCIO® for mMCC and patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash.

Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a debilitating blood cancer that while treatable is usually considered incurable, resulting in over 100,000 deaths annually on a worldwide basis. Representing a significant unmet medical need, without treatment, survival is typically less than one year. Even with treatment, which typically involves the use of chemotherapy, steroids, targeted therapy, and in some cases, stem cell transplant, survival often can only be extended to 4 to 5 years. The BCMA protein is important in B cell development and preferentially expressed in mature B lymphocytes. BCMA protein is also believed to be involved in the development of multiple myeloma and other blood cancers and is an important target for drug development.
About NantKwest Inc. 
NantKwest, a member of the NantWorks ecosystem of companies, is an innovative clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing the power of the innate immune system by using the natural killer cell to treat cancer and virally induced infectious diseases.
NantKwest is uniquely positioned to implement precision cancer medicine, with the potential to change the current paradigm of cancer care. Natural Killer (NK) cells are a safeguard in the human body designed to recognize and detect cells under stress due to cancer or viral infection. NantKwest’s “off-the-shelf” activated NK cell platform is designed to destroy cancer and virally infected cells from the body. The safety of our NK cells as well as their activity against a broad range of cancers has been tested in phase I clinical trials in Canada and Europe as well as in multiple phase I and II clinical trials in the United States. In addition to being a universal cell-based therapy that does not require individualized patient sourcing or matching, our NK cell products have been largely administered in the outpatient setting as an “off-the-shelf” living drug.
With the capacity to grow active killer cells as a living cancer therapy, our NK cells have been designed to induce cell death against cancers and virally infected cells by several mechanisms, including: innate killing, whereby all of our NK platforms recognize the stress proteins typically found on cancer cells, which, upon binding, release toxic granules to immediately kill their targets; antibody-mediated killing with our haNK® platform, which are NK cells engineered to express antibody receptors that can bind to therapeutic antibody products, thereby enhancing the cancer cell killing effect of that antibody. All three modes of killing (innate, antibody-mediated, and CAR directed killing) are employed by our t-haNK™ platform, which is an innovative combination of our aNK, haNK® and taNK® platforms in a single product.
Our haNK®, and t-haNK™ platforms have been designed to address certain limitations of CAR T-cell therapy including the capability to infuse cell therapy in an outpatient setting which allows for potential reduction of risk for serious cytokine storms and protracted serious adverse events. In Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with late stage cancer, our NK cells have been administered as an investigational outpatient infusion safely with greater than 300 infusions to date at a dose of 2 billion cells per infusion.
By leveraging an integrated and extensive genomics and transcriptomics discovery and development engine, together with a pipeline of multiple, clinical-stage, immuno-oncology programs, we believe NantKwest is uniquely positioned to be the premier immunotherapy company and transform medicine by delivering living drugs in a bag and bringing novel NK cell-based therapies to routine clinical care.

 The P-III JAKARTA study results: meeting its 1EPs & 2EPs i.e, reduction in spleen volume (35%) & reduction in Total Symptom Score (50%) after six one-month treatment cycles
 Fedratinib (400mg/500mg) is JAK2 & FLT3 inhibitor, activates transcription proteins (STAT3/5), and induced apoptotis. Fedratinib has received FDA’s PR & OD designation for primary/secondary myelofibrosis with its expected PDUFA date on 3 Sept, 2019","U.S. Food & Drug Administration sets Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date for Sept. 3, 2019

SUMMIT, N.JCelgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for fedratinib and granted a Priority Review. Fedratinib is a highly selective JAK2 inhibitor intended for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, a serious bone marrow disorder that disrupts the body’s normal production of blood cells.1 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has set its action date as Sept. 3, 2019.
“The acceptance of the NDA and granting of Priority Review for fedratinib represent the first potential new treatment option after many years for patients affected by myelofibrosis.” said Jay Backstrom, M.D., Chief Medical Officer for Celgene. “Patients with myelofibrosis, including the number who are ineligible for or failed existing therapy continues to increase, representing a well-defined unmet medical need. We believe fedratinib can play an important role in the treatment of myelofibrosis and we look forward to working with the FDA as the review process advances.”
The NDA for fedratinib is based on results from a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (JAKARTA)in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis, as well as a single-arm, open-label phase 2 trial (JAKARTA2) in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis previously exposed to ruxolitinib, the only FDA-approved treatment for the disease. Results of these two trials have been previously published in peer-reviewed journals. The FDA has also provided fedratinib Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of secondary and primary myelofibrosis.
Celgene also plans to evaluate fedratinib in combination with luspatercept.
Fedratinib is an investigational compound that is not approved for any use in any country.
About JAKARTA
JAKARTA is a pivotal phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of daily oral doses (400 mg or 500 mg) of fedratinib compared with placebo in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis with splenomegaly. The study included 289 subjects across 94 sites in 24 countries.
The primary endpoint was spleen response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who had a reduction in spleen volume of at least 35% after six one-month treatment cycles with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scan four weeks later. Secondary endpoints included symptom response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in Total Symptom Score after six one-month treatment cycles as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptoms Assessment Form (MFSAF) v2.0 diary.
About JAKARTA2
JAKARTA2 is a phase 2, multicenter, open label, single-arm trial evaluating the efficacy of a once daily dose of fedratinib (400 mg starting dose) in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib and with a diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. The study included 97 subjects across 40 sites in 10 countries.
The primary endpoint was spleen response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who had a reduction in spleen volume of at least 35% as measured by MRI or CT scan after six one-month treatment cycles. Secondary endpoints included symptom response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in Total Symptom Score after six one-month treatment cycles as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptoms Assessment Form (MFSAF) v2.0 diary.
FDA placed a clinical hold on the fedratinib program in November 2013 after potential cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy were reported among subjects (approximately 1%) in clinical trials. The FDA removed the clinical hold in August 2017.
About Fedratinib
Fedratinib is an oral kinase inhibitor with activity against wild type and mutationally activated Janus Associated Kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Fedratinib is a JAK2-selective inhibitor with higher potency for JAK2 over family members JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2. Abnormal activation of JAK2 is associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. In cell models expressing mutationally active JAK2 or FLT3, fedratinib reduced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3/5) proteins, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptotic cell death. In mouse models of JAK2V617F-driven myeloproliferative disease, fedratinib blocked phosphorylation of STAT3/5, increased survival and improved disease-associated symptoms, including reduction of white blood cells, hematocrit, splenomegaly, and fibrosis.
About Myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis is a serious and rare bone marrow disorder that disrupts the body’s normal production of blood cells. Bone marrow is gradually replaced with fibrous scar tissue, which limits the ability of the bone marrow to make red blood cells.1 The disorder can lead to anemia, weakness, fatigue and swelling of the spleen and liver, among other symptoms.1 Myelofibrosis is classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm, a group of rare blood cancers that derive from blood-forming stem cells.2 In the U.S. myelofibrosis occurs in 1.5 of every 100,000 people each year.3 Both men and women are affected and, while the disease can affect people of all ages, the median age at diagnosis ranges from 60 to 67 years4,5

10976,Genentech Announces FDA's Acceptance of sNDA for Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) in Patients with Influenza,FDA Accepts Genentech’s Supplemental New Drug Application for Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) for the Treatment of Influenza in People at High Risk of Complications,"The sNDA application is based on P-III CAPSTONE-2 assessing Xofluza vs placebo & oseltamivir (75 mg) in 2,184 patients with high risk of complications from the influenza including asthma, chronic lung disease, morbid obesity or heart disease, aged > 12yrs.
 The P-III CAPSTONE-2 study results: reduction in improvement time of symptoms (74.6 hrs. vs 100.6 hrs & 101.6 hrs); time to resolve fever (30.8 hrs. vs 50.7 hrs.& 34.3 hrs.); incidence of complications (2.8% vs 10.4% & 4.6%); use of systemic antibiotics (3.4% vs 7.5% & 3.9%); viral shedding time (48 hrs. vs 96 hrs. & 96hrs.)
 Post FDA approval in Oct,2018, Roche’s Xofluza (qd, PO) is a novel antiviral drug active against oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1) and expect its FDA’s approval on sNDA by 4 Nov,2019","Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for XOFLUZA™ (baloxavir marboxil) as a single-dose, oral treatment for people at high risk of complications from the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines people at high risk for serious flu complications to include adults 65 years of age or older, or those who have conditions such as asthma, chronic lung disease, morbid obesity or heart disease. The FDA is expected to make a decision on approval by November 4, 2019.
“Influenza, or ‘flu,’ can be especially debilitating for people considered to be high risk, as they have an increased likelihood of serious complications, worsening of existing health problems and even hospitalization or death,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “XOFLUZA is the first antiviral medicine to demonstrate a significant and clinically meaningful benefit in people at high risk of complications from the flu, for which there are currently no approved medicines.”
The sNDA is based on results from the Phase III CAPSTONE-2 study of a single dose of XOFLUZA compared with placebo or oseltamivir 75 mg, twice daily for five days, in people 12 years of age or older who are at high risk of complications from the flu.
The FDA approved XOFLUZA in October 2018 for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in people 12 years of age or older. It is the first and only single-dose oral medicine approved to treat the flu, and the first new flu medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action in nearly 20 years.
About CAPSTONE-2
CAPSTONE-2 is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single dose of XOFLUZA compared with placebo and oseltamivir in 2,184 people 12 years of age or older who are at high risk of complications from the flu. The primary objective of the study evaluated the efficacy of a single dose of XOFLUZA compared with placebo by measuring the time to improvement of influenza symptoms. Important secondary endpoints compared outcomes in XOFLUZA versus placebo or oseltamivir, including time to resolution of fever, time to cessation of viral shedding, infectious virus detection in swabs of the nose and throat, prescription of antibiotics and influenza-related complications. The study, which was first presented in October 2018 at IDWeek, found that XOFLUZA:

Significantly reduced the time to improvement of influenza symptoms versus placebo in people at high risk of complications from influenza (median time 73.2 hours versus 102.3 hours; p<0.0001);
Demonstrated superior efficacy (reduced time to improvement of influenza symptoms) versus placebo and oseltamivir in influenza type B (median time of 74.6 hours versus 100.6 hours and 101.6 hours, respectively (p=0.0138, p=0.0251);
Demonstrated efficacy for secondary endpoints compared to placebo:
Significantly reduced the time to resolution of fever (median time of 30.8 hours versus 50.7 hours; p<0.0001), the incidence of influenza-related complications (2.8 percent versus 10.4 percent; p<0.05), the use of systemic antibiotics (3.4 percent versus 7.5 percent; p=0.01) and the length of time the virus continued to be released from the body (viral shedding; median time of 48 hours versus 96 hours; p<0.0001).
Similar efficacy results were seen between XOFLUZA and oseltamivir for several secondary endpoints, but a significant difference was observed in the time to cessation of viral shedding favoring XOFLUZA:
No significant reduction in the time to resolution of fever (median time of 30.8 hours for XOFLUZA versus 34.3 hours for oseltamivir; p<0.2425), the incidence of influenza-related complications (2.8 percent for XOFLUZA versus 4.6 percent for oseltamivir; p=0.2558) and the use of systemic antibiotics (3.4 percent for XOFLUZA versus 3.9 percent for oseltamivir; p=0.8478).
Significantly reduced the length of time the virus continued to be released from the body (viral shedding; median time of 48 hours versus 96 hours; p<0.0001).
In CAPSTONE-2, XOFLUZA was well tolerated, with no safety signals identified. XOFLUZA had a numerically lower overall incidence of reported adverse events (25.1 percent) compared with placebo (29.7 percent) or oseltamivir (28.0 percent). The most common adverse events reported in the XOFLUZA group were bronchitis (2.9 percent), diarrhea (2.7 percent), nausea (2.7 percent) and sinusitis (1.9 percent). The study was conducted globally by Shionogo & Co., Ltd.
About XOFLUZA™ (baloxavir marboxil)
XOFLUZA is a first-in-class, single-dose oral medicine with a novel proposed mechanism of action that has demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of influenza viruses, including in vitro activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains and avian strains (H7N9, H5N1) in non-clinical studies. Unlike other currently available antiviral treatments, XOFLUZA is the first in a new class of antivirals designed to inhibit polymerase acidic endonuclease, an enzyme essential for viral replication.
XOFLUZA will be further studied in a Phase III development program including pediatric populations, post-exposure prophylaxis and severely ill hospitalized people with influenza, as well as to assess the potential to reduce transmission in otherwise healthy people.
XOFLUZA was discovered by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and is being further developed and commercialized globally in collaboration with the Roche Group (which includes Genentech in the U.S.) and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Under the terms of this agreement, Roche holds worldwide rights to XOFLUZA excluding Japan and Taiwan, which will be retained exclusively by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.
XOFLUZA U.S. Indication
XOFLUZA is a prescription medicine used to treat the flu (influenza) in people 12 years of age and older who have had flu symptoms for no more than 48 hours.
It is not known if XOFLUZA is safe and effective in children younger than 12 years of age or weighing less than 88 pounds (40 kg).
Limitations of Use: Influenza viruses change over time, and factors such as the virus type or subtype, emergence of resistance or changes in viral virulence could diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Consider available information on drug susceptibility patterns for circulating influenza virus strains when deciding whether to use XOFLUZA.
Important Safety Information
Do not take XOFLUZA if you are allergic to baloxavir marboxil or any of the ingredients in XOFLUZA.
Before you take XOFLUZA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you :

About Genentech in influenza
Influenza, or flu, is one of the most common yet serious infectious diseases. Since 2010, the CDC estimates that the flu has resulted annually in 9.3 to 49 million illnesses, 140,000 to 960,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 79,000 deaths. Although vaccines are an important first line of defense in preventing the flu, there is a need for new medical options for prophylaxis and treatment. Current treatments – including existing vaccines and antiviral drugs – have limitations as flu viruses are constantly changing and new antiviral medicines are necessary. Genentech is committed to addressing the unmet need in this area through its agreement with Shionogi & Co., Ltd. to develop and commercialize XOFLUZA.

MyoScience to receive $120M upfront and $100M as regulatory and commercial milestones. The transaction is expected to close in Apr’2019
 The focus of an acquisition is to strengthen Pacira’s footprints in post-surgical analgesics by adding Myoscience’s iovera system to Pacira’s lead candidate Exparel
 Pacira is planning to change its name to Pacira BioSciences, Inc. to reflect its broad portfolio and expect to complete the acquisition in H2’20","Novel cryoanalgesia treatment highly complementary to EXPAREL —

— Corporate name change to Pacira BioSciences to reflect expanding product portfolio —

— Conference call today at 8:30 AM ET —

PARSIPPANY, N.J. and FREMONT, Calif.,– Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Pacira”) (NASDAQ: PCRX) and MyoScience, Inc. (“MyoScience”), a privately held medical technology company, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the acquisition of MyoScience by Pacira. MyoScience currently markets the ioveraº system, a novel, FDA-approved non-opioid treatment that alleviates pain through a mechanism known as cryoanalgesia, which applies intensely focused cold therapy to a specific nerve to interrupt its ability to transmit a pain signal. Results can be felt immediately after ioveraº treatment with pain relief that can last three months, and in some cases longer, as the nerve regenerates over time.

“We are delighted to announce this strategic acquisition, which is highly complementary to EXPAREL and underscores our corporate mission to provide an opioid alternative to as many patients as possible,” said Dave Stack, chairman and chief executive officer of Pacira. “We believe the ioveraº system has significant growth opportunity given the key role it can play in the management of pain associated with both orthopedic surgery and persistent orthopedic conditions such as osteoarthritis. We will be working to leverage our strong commercial infrastructure, partnership network, including our substantial commercial collaboration with Johnson & Johnson, and deep domain expertise to drive widespread adoption of this exciting treatment. By combining ioveraº with EXPAREL, we are offering healthcare providers an effective, non-opioid multimodal regimen that can help mitigate or even eliminate the use of opioids for managing pain before, during and after surgery.”
“We are pleased to enter into this transaction and are confident that Pacira is the ideal fit to build the ioveraº franchise given their commitment to and proven track record of expanding patient access to non-opioid options,” said Timothy Still, president and chief executive officer of MyoScience. “This acquisition comes at a time when opioid abuse and addiction has reached epidemic proportions and alternative approaches to pain management are being mandated. We believe adding ioveraº to EXPAREL-based opioid-sparing protocols will help create an opioid-free perioperative and postoperative experience for many patients.”
Novel ioveraº system highly complementary to EXPAREL
ioveraº is a handheld cryoanalgesia device used to deliver precise, controlled doses of cold temperature only to targeted nerves. Treated nerves are temporarily stopped from sending pain signals until the nerve regenerates over time and the function is restored. The effect is immediate, leading to decreased pain, opioid consumption and improved length of stay while improving physical function for patients. The product has been used in over 20,000 procedures with a growing body of clinical evidence supporting efficacy. Pacira believes that ioverao used in combination with EXPAREL has the potential for an additive effect with a higher likelihood for a completely opioid-free patient journey. The ioveraº system is 510k cleared in the U.S. for the blocking of pain, pain relief, and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee as well as general surgical use.
Treatment results with ioveraº:

Decreased knee pain. More than 75 percent of the patients who received ioveraº treatment continued to experience pain relief at 150 days.1
Less stiffness. More than 50 percent of the patients treated with the ioveraº system experienced less stiffness 12 weeks after treatment.1
Improved physical function. Majority of the patients in the ioveraº treatment group had improved physical function at 150 days.1
Fewer opioid prescriptions. Patients who received ioveraº treatment requested 45 percent fewer opioid prescription at 12 weeks after knee replacement surgery.2
Reduction in knee pain. 12 weeks after surgery, the majority of patients who received ioveraº treatment experienced less pain.2
Faster recovery. Postsurgical recovery was much faster in patients who received ioveraº treatment before knee replacement surgery.2
Osteoarthritis compromises the quality of life of more than 27 million Americans, with approximately 25% of knee osteoarthritis sufferers complaining of pain while performing daily activities (walking, climbing stairs, kneeling, etc.)1. Osteoarthritis is also associated with a higher likelihood of opioid use with as many as 30% of presurgical patients with end-stage knee, hip or spine osteoarthritis using prescription opioids, according to data published in Arthritis Care & Research. The effect of this disease on the United States economy is estimated to be $60 billion per year2.
Terms of the Agreement
Under the terms of the agreement, Pacira will make an initial payment of $120 million. MyoScience shareholders will be eligible to receive up to an additional $100 million in contingent payments upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. Pacira expects the acquisition to be accretive to net income beginning in the second half of 2020 and increasingly accretive thereafter.
The transaction is expected to close in April 2019 subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Upon the closing of the acquisition, Pacira intends to change its corporate name to Pacira BioSciences, Inc., in order to better reflect a broadening portfolio of innovative non-opioid pain management and regenerative health solutions. Pacira will continue to trade under the symbol “PCRX.” Upon the closing of the transaction, MyoScience will become Pacira CryoTech, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacira.
Deutsche Bank Securities served as financial advisor and Perkins Coie LLP is acting as legal advisor to Pacira in connection with the transaction. Perella Weinberg Partners LLP served as financial advisor and Latham & Watkins LLP is acting as legal advisor to MyoScience.

EXPAREL utilizes DepoFoam®, a unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure, and releases them over a desired period of time. To learn more about Pacira, including the corporate mission to reduce overreliance on opioids, visit www.pacira.com.
About MyoScience
Silicon Valley, California-based MyoScience is a privately-held medical device company committed to making its platform technology, the iovera° system, the standard of care for the treatment of peripheral nerves. The iovera° treatment is powered by a patented device that enables cryoneurolysis. The ioveraº system is 510k cleared in the U.S. for the blocking of pain, the relief of pain and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee for up to 90 days and general surgical use. For more information, please visit www.iovera.com.
About EXPAREL®
EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is indicated for single-dose infiltration in adults to produce postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. Safety and efficacy have not been established in other nerve blocks. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam®, a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing significant reductions in cumulative pain scores with up to a 78 percent decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated. Additional information is available at www.EXPAREL.com.
Important Safety Information
EXPAREL is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% following EXPAREL administration via infiltration were nausea, constipation, and vomiting; adverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% following EXPAREL administration via interscalene brachial plexus nerve block were nausea, pyrexia, and constipation. If EXPAREL and other non-bupivacaine local anesthetics, including lidocaine, are administered at the same site, there may be an immediate release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL. Therefore, EXPAREL may be administered to the same site 20 minutes after injecting lidocaine. EXPAREL is not recommended to be used in the following patient population: patients <18 years old and/or pregnant patients. Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, EXPAREL should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Warnings and Precautions Specific to EXPAREL: Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL. EXPAREL is not recommended for the following types or routes of administration: epidural, intrathecal, regional nerve blocks other than interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, or intravascular or intra-articular use. The potential sensory and/or motor loss with EXPAREL is temporary and varies in degree and duration depending on the site of injection and dosage administered and may last for up to 5 days, as seen in clinical trials. Warnings and Precautions for Bupivacaine-Containing Products: Central Nervous System (CNS) Reactions: There have been reports of adverse neurologic reactions with the use of local anesthetics. These include persistent anesthesia and paresthesia. CNS reactions are characterized by excitation and/or depression. Cardiovascular System Reactions: Toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conductivity and excitability which may lead to dysrhythmias, sometimes leading to death. Allergic Reactions: Allergic-type reactions (eg, anaphylaxis and angioedema) are rare and may occur as a result of hypersensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients. Chondrolysis: There have been reports of chondrolysis (mostly in the shoulder joint) following intra-articular infusion of local anesthetics, which is an unapproved use. Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported with local anesthetic use. Full Prescribing Information is available at www.EXPAREL.com.
About ioveraº
The ioverao system is used to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by applying freezing cold. It can also be used to produce lesions in peripheral nervous tissue by the application of cold to the selected site for the blocking of pain. It is also indicated for the relief of pain and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee for up to 90 days. In one study, the majority of the patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee experienced pain and system relief beyond 150 days.1 The ioverao system’s “1×90” Smart Tip configuration (indicating one needle which is 90 mm long) can also facilitate target nerve location by conducting electrical nerve stimulation from a separate nerve stimulator. The ioverao system is not indicated for treatment of central nervous system tissue.
Important Safety Information
The ioverao system is contraindicated for use in patients with the following: Cryoglobulinemia; Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria; cold urticaria; Raynaud’s disease; open and/or infected wounds at or near the treatment line. Potential complications: As with any surgical treatment that uses needle-based therapy, there is potential for temporary site-specific reactions, including but not limited to: bruising (ecchymosis); swelling (edema); inflammation and/or redness (erythema); pain and/or tenderness; altered sensation (localized dysesthesia). Typically, these reactions resolve with no physician intervention. Patients may help the healing process by applying ice packs to the affected sites, and by taking over-the counter analgesics.

10993,Pfizer Exercised its Option to License AnTolRx's Immune Tolerance Therapy for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D),AnTolRx Announces Pfizer Exercises Option To License Immune Tolerance Therapy For Potential Treatment Of Type 1 Diabetes,"Pfizer to get exclusive rights for development and commercialization of AnTolRx’s lead immunotherapeutic for T1D. AnTolRx to receive upfront, milestones & royalties on sales
 Under the June 2016 agreement, Pfizer exercised its option to license AnTolRx’s T1D candidate
 AnTolRx develops antigen-specific therapies, based on immune tolerance induction, for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including T1D, RA, IBD, and Celiac disease","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — AnTolRx, Inc., a private biotechnology company and a leader in immune tolerance, today announced that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) has exercised the option granted under a June 2016 agreement to license an immune tolerance therapy from AnTolRx’s Type 1 diabetes research program.

The option gives Pfizer exclusive rights to pursue development of AnTolRx’s lead immunotherapeutic for Type 1 diabetes. Pfizer will be responsible for any further optimization, development and potential commercialization. AnTolRx will receive an upfront payment and is eligible to receive potential milestone and royalty payments from Pfizer.

AnTolRx is aiming to develop targeted antigen-specific therapies, based upon immune tolerance induction rather than broader immune suppression, for several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

“We are delighted to confirm that the discovery phase of the program at AnTolRx has transitioned successfully to Pfizer for further development of our antigen-specific immunotherapy for Type 1 diabetes,” said Mark Carthy, CEO of AnTolRx.

AnTolRx is focused on building on the pioneering immunoregulatory research of Francisco Quintana, a professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, as well as the company’s scientific founder and Chief Scientific Advisor.

“This agreement with Pfizer supports the industry’s mounting interest in developing therapeutics based upon antigen-specific tolerance and underscores its potential to deliver innovative new medicines for patients with immunological diseases,” said Professor Quintana.

Michael Vincent, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer said, “At Pfizer’s Immunology and Inflammation Research Unit, our ultimate goal is to advance potential cures for autoimmune disease, and we see AnTolRx’s approach to re-educate the immune response as one potentially promising strategy to achieve that goal for patients.”

JDRF, the world’s leading funder of Type 1 diabetes research and long-time supporter of Quintana’s work, applauded the transition. “There is an urgent need for disease-modifying Type 1 diabetes immunotherapies to slow down the autoimmune process and delay or block progression to symptomatic insulin-dependent diabetes,” said JDRF President and CEO Derek Rapp.

“The AnTolRx story is an excellent example of a research foundation, an academic institution, a biotech company and a major pharmaceutical company working together to advance promising translational research with the hope that it can potentially deliver key breakthroughs for the Type 1 diabetes community,” Rapp said.

About T1D
T1D is a chronic, life-threatening autoimmune disease that can strike children and adults at any age. It requires rigorous 24/7 monitoring of blood glucose levels—even overnight—to avoid potentially lethal highs and lows in blood sugar, as well as other devastating complications like kidney, eye and nerve diseases. While T1D’s causes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved. Its onset is sudden and is not related to diet or lifestyle. In T1D, the body’s immune system destroys cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, meaning the body produces little to no insulin to regulate blood sugar and get energy from food. There is nothing you can do to prevent T1D, and—at present—nothing you can do to get rid of it.

About AnTolRx

AnTolRx is a Cambridge, Mass.-based research and development biotechnology company focused on immune tolerance with active programs in Type 1 Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Celiac Disease, and various dermatology diseases including Pemphigus Vulgaris.

11004,ï»¿Allergan Reports Results of Rapastinel in Four P-III RAP-MD Studies for Major Depressive Disorders (MDD),Allergan Announces Phase 3 Results for Rapastinel as an Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD),"The P-III RAP-MD (01,02,03,04) studies involve assessing of Rapastinel (450mg, 225mg) vs PBO as an adjunctive treatment of MDD
 The P-III RAP-MD-04 study demonstrated unmet 1EPs & 2EPs. RAP-MD (01,02,03) studies resulted that Rapastinel was well tolerated with no psychotomimetic side effects
 Rapastinel (IV, qw) is a novel anti-depressant, enhanced NMDAR activity by acting as a partial agonist at the glycine site","Three acute pivotal studies did not meet their primary endpoint —— Interim analysis of relapse prevention study suggests the primary endpoint will not be met —

DUBLIN, Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) today announced topline results from three pivotal studies of rapastinel as an adjunctive treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). In three acute studies (RAP-MD-01,-02,-03), the rapastinel treatment arms did not differentiate from placebo on the primary and key secondary endpoints. In all three acute studies rapastinel was well tolerated without any signal of psychotomimetic side effects. In addition, an interim analysis of the rapastinel relapse prevention study (RAP-MD-04) suggests the primary and key secondary endpoints will not be met.
“We are deeply disappointed with these results, and they are a vivid reminder that drug development is extremely challenging, especially in mental health. We are grateful to the patients, their caregivers, and the investigators who supported these clinical studies. We remain committed to the development of new life changing medications to combat the rising global toll of mental illness,” said David Nicholson, Chief Research & Development Officer at Allergan. “We will evaluate the impact of these data on the ongoing monotherapy MDD program and suicidality in MDD study. We expect to make a decision on these programs during the course of 2019.”
“As the number of deaths from suicide, alcohol and drugs continue to rise, it is clear that we need effective new approaches for mental illness. We thank Allergan for its long-standing commitment and investment in this important, yet difficult area,” said Michael R. Liebowitz MD, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry, Columbia University, Managing Director, The Medical Research Network in New York City.
These Phase 3 adjunctive MDD trials evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rapastinel, compared to placebo, both in combination with antidepressant therapy (ADT) in patients with MDD who had a partial response to ADT. In all three pivotal clinical trials rapastinel was well tolerated and demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo.
Patients who completed the acute trials were eligible to enter the relapse prevention trial (RAP-MD-04). An interim analysis of (RAP-MD-04) was conducted of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of all randomized patients in the double-blind treatment period. At the time of the analysis, all patients had completed all visits relevant for determining a relapse.
Detailed results from these studies will be presented at future scientific meetings.
Study Overview RAP-MD-01,-02,-03
Studies RAP-MD-01 (N= 457) and RAP-MD-03 (N= 415) were randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, parallel group Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in the United States, in which 450 mg of rapastinel or placebo were evaluated as an adjunctive treatment to an oral antidepressant in patients with MDD. Study medication was given once weekly as a bolus intravenous injection in addition to an oral ADT, to which the patient had experienced inadequate clinical response.
Study RAP-MD-02 (N= 638) was very similar in design, the main difference being the inclusion of a third treatment arm, in which a dose of 225 mg rapastinel was evaluated.
Patients who completed 3 weeks of double-blind treatment were eligible to enter the (RAP-MD-04) maintenance study, alternatively they were to be followed for 1 week in a safety follow-up period.
Eligible patients for study participation were 18 to 65 years of age and met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for MDD, with a current major depressive episode of at least 8 weeks and not exceeding 18 months in duration. In addition, eligible patients had experienced no more than partial response (< 50% improvement) to ongoing treatment with an ADT, administered at a stable and adequate (labeled) dose. Patients were required to continue their oral ADT throughout the entire study at a stable dose.
About Rapastinel
Rapastinel has recently been characterized as a modest and selective positive NMDA receptor modulator with a unique pharmacological mechanism of action fundamentally different from ketamine. In a series of preclinical experiments rapastinel directly enhanced NMDAR activity through a novel site independent of the glycine co-agonist site, and single doses resulted in rapid and sustained antidepressant effects as well as increased synaptic plasticity (Please see the full publication here: https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/… ). In a previously conducted Phase 2 clinical study rapastinel demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant effect within one day, which continued for approximately seven days after a single injection.
About Rapastinel Clinical Program
In addition to the adjunctive MDD program Allergan is conducting a global Phase 3 monotherapy program evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rapastinel compared to placebo. These trials are actively recruiting patients.
Allergan is also conducting a Phase 2 proof of concept suicidality study evaluating efficacy, safety and tolerability of rapastinel, compared to placebo in addition to standard of care (SOC) of patients with MDD at imminent risk of suicide.
About MDD
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) depression is a common disorder with currently 300 million people of all ages affected globally. The WHO lists depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease, constituting the leading cause of disability worldwide. Approximately 16 million Americans are living with MDD, with 6.7 percent of U.S. adults reporting at least one MDD episode in the past year. MDD is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for people between the ages of 15 and 44 and the primary reason why someone dies of suicide about every 12 minutes.

-U.S. NDA and EU MAA planned for the third and fourth quarters of 2019, respectively-

BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Mar. 6, 2019–Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) today announced that treatment with the triple combination of the next-generation corrector VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in statistically significant improvements in lung function (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, or ppFEV1) in two Phase 3 studies in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Data from a pre-specified interim analysis of the Phase 3 study in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation showed a mean absolute improvement in ppFEV1 of 13.8 percentage points from baseline at week 4 of treatment compared to placebo (p<0.0001). In the Phase 3 study in people with two F508del mutations, the addition of VX-445 in patients already receiving tezacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute improvement in ppFEV1 of 10.0 percentage points from baseline at week 4 of treatment compared to the control group in whom placebo was added to tezacaftor and ivacaftor (p<0.0001). The VX-445 triple combination regimen was generally well tolerated, and the safety and efficacy profile from the results released today supports the potential submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for the VX-445 triple combination regimen.
The Phase 3 data announced today for the VX-445 triple combination regimen follow Phase 3 data announced in late 2018 for the triple combination of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor that also showed a safety and efficacy profile supportive of a potential NDA submission. Given the similarity of the data for the 4-week primary efficacy endpoint for the VX-659 and VX-445 regimens and the near-term availability of the final 24-week data for both regimens in the second quarter of 2019, Vertex plans to utilize these final 24-week data to choose the best regimen to submit for regulatory approvals globally. Because these submissions will include the final 24-week data, Vertex will seek approval for patients ages 12 and older with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation and for patients with two F508del mutations concurrently. Vertex plans to submit an NDA to the U.S. FDA in the third quarter of 2019 and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2019 for either the VX-659 or VX-445 triple combination regimen. The company also plans to disclose more detailed data from the Phase 3 studies of the selected triple combination regimen, including 24-week data from the study in patients with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation, in the second quarter of 2019.
“Both the VX-659 and VX-445 triple combination regimens showed highly consistent and significant improvements in lung function across our Phase 3 programs, underscoring the important clinical benefit that a triple combination regimen may provide to patients with two F508del mutations and to those with one F508del and one minimal function mutation,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “We look forward to submitting global regulatory applications for one of these triple combination regimens for both patient populations later this year.”
About the VX-445 Phase 3 Study in People with One F508del Mutation and One Minimal Function Mutation
The data announced today for people ages 12 and older with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation are from an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the triple combination of VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor compared to triple placebo for 24 weeks. The study randomized 405 patients, and 403 patients received at least one dose of either the VX-445 triple combination regimen or triple placebo. In the U.S., the primary endpoint of the study is the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at week 4 of triple combination treatment compared to triple placebo. The data announced today are from a pre-specified interim analysis that evaluated the primary endpoint at week 4. 402 patients had completed the week 4 visit of the study at the time of the interim analysis. The safety and efficacy profile in the interim analysis supports the potential submission of an NDA for the VX-445 triple combination regimen for patients with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation.
Topline Data:
Treatment with the triple combination of VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute improvement in ppFEV1 of 13.8 percentage points from baseline at week 4 compared to triple placebo (p<0.0001), which was the primary endpoint of the study. The mean absolute within-group improvement in ppFEV1 for those who received the VX-445 triple combination regimen was 13.6 percentage points from baseline at week 4. The mean absolute within-group change in ppFEV1 for those who received triple placebo was -0.2 percentage points from baseline at week 4.
The VX-445 triple combination regimen was generally well tolerated in this study. The safety profile reflects all available safety data for all patients at the time of the interim analysis, including 246 patients who had reached the week 12 visit (123 patients who were randomized to the VX-445 triple combination regimen and 123 patients randomized to triple placebo) and 65 patients who had completed the 24-week treatment period (29 patients randomized to receive the VX-445 triple combination regimen and 36 patients randomized to receive triple placebo).
This study is ongoing to evaluate the VX-445 triple combination regimen for a total of 24 weeks and will generate additional safety and efficacy data and data for key secondary endpoints, including the number of pulmonary exacerbations, change in sweat chloride, change in patient-reported outcomes as measured by the respiratory domain score of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and change in body mass index, among others.
Open-Label Extension Study:
All patients who complete treatment in the 24-week study, regardless of treatment assignment, are given the opportunity to enroll in a rollover study where all patients receive the VX-445 triple combination regimen. All patients who had completed the study at the time of the interim analysis elected to enter the open-label extension study.
About the VX-445 Phase 3 Study in People with Two F508del Mutations
The data announced today for people with two F508del mutations are from a randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 study that evaluated four weeks of treatment with the triple combination of VX-445, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor compared to placebo, tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The study randomized 108 patients ages 12 years or older who have two F508del mutations. All patients received tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor during a 4-week run-in prior to randomization, and 107 of the 108 patients who were randomized received at least 1 dose of either the triple combination of VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor or placebo, tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The primary endpoint of the study was the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline (end of the 4-week tezacaftor/ivacaftor run-in) at week 4 of triple combination of VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor compared to placebo in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The data announced today reflect topline data from the primary efficacy and safety analysis conducted once all (n=107) patients completed the study. The safety and efficacy profile in this study supports the potential submission of an NDA for the VX-445 triple combination regimen for patients with two F508del mutations.
Topline Data:
Data from this study showed a mean absolute improvement in ppFEV1 of 10.0 percentage points from baseline at week 4 when VX-445 was added in patients who were already receiving tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor compared to those in whom placebo was added to tezacaftor and ivacaftor (p<0.0001), which was the primary endpoint of the study. The mean absolute within-group improvement in ppFEV1 from baseline for those who received VX-445 in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor was 10.4 percentage points at week 4. The mean absolute within-group change in ppFEV1 from baseline for those who received placebo, tezacaftor and ivacaftor was 0.4 percentage points at week 4.
The VX-445 triple combination regimen was generally well tolerated in this study. All of the 107 patients who received either the triple combination of VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor or placebo, tezacaftor and ivacaftor completed the 4-week triple combination treatment period.
Open-Label Extension Study:
Similar to the study in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation, all patients who completed treatment, regardless of treatment assignment, were given the opportunity to enroll in a rollover study where all patients received the VX-445 triple combination regimen. All 107 of the patients who completed the study elected to enter the open-label extension study.
About CF
CF is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia. CF is caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF. There are approximately 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene. Some of these mutations, which can be determined by a genetic test, or genotyping test, lead to CF by creating non-working or too few CFTR proteins at the cell surface. The defective function or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death. The median age of death is in the mid-to-late 20s.
About Vertex
Vertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious and life-threatening diseases. In addition to clinical development programs in CF, Vertex has more than a dozen ongoing research programs focused on the underlying mechanisms of other serious diseases.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.— Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, announced today that the ENVISION Phase 3 study of givosiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) in development for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), met its primary efficacy endpoint and the majority of secondary endpoints. Specifically, givosiran met the primary endpoint of reduction in the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks relative to placebo (p less than 0.00000001) and achieved statistically significant results for five of nine secondary endpoints (p less than 0.0001), with a safety and tolerability profile that the Company believes is encouraging, especially in this high unmet disease. Based on these results, the Company plans to complete its rolling submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) and file a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in mid-2019.
“Patients living with AHP experience debilitating and sometimes life-threatening neurovisceral attacks as well as chronic disease manifestations which negatively impact their quality of life. We believe the ENVISION results demonstrate a robust therapeutic benefit of givosiran treatment on the debilitating aspects of this disease. Based on these results, we believe givosiran has the potential, if approved, to be a transformative medicine for AHP patients and their families,” said Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., President, R&D at Alnylam. “We extend our profound thanks to all the patients, investigators, and study staff who participated in the ENVISION study.”
“These positive ENVISION results represent another landmark event in Alnylam’s pioneering efforts to advance RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines. Notably, givosiran is the first GalNAc-conjugate siRNA to achieve positive Phase 3 results, and the second example of Alnylam’s R&D strategy bearing fruit due to our focus on genetically validated targets for the advancement of potential high impact medicines,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., CEO of Alnylam. “Assuming favorable regulatory review, we very much look forward to adding givosiran as the second product in our global commercialization efforts. Indeed, we believe today’s news brings us one important step closer to meeting our Alnylam 2020 goals of building a multi-product, global commercial company with a deep clinical pipeline for continued growth and a robust product engine for sustainable innovation.”
Givosiran has received Breakthrough Therapy and Prime designation by the FDA and EMA, respectively, and has Orphan Drug status in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of AHP. The Phase 1 results of givosiran were recently published in TheNew England Journal of Medicine1.FullENVISION study results will be presented in an oral plenary session on Saturday, April 13 at EASL in Vienna, Austria. The ENVISION results have not yet been reviewed by regulatory authorities.
ENVISION Study Results
ENVISION, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, enrolled 94 patients with AHP (including 89 with genetically-confirmed acute intermittent porphyria [AIP], the most common subtype of AHP), at 36 study sites in 18 countries around the world, and is the largest ever interventional study conducted in AHP. Patients were randomized 1:1 to givosiran or placebo, with givosiran administered subcutaneously at 2.5 mg/kg monthly. The primary endpoint for the study was reduction relative to placebo in the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks, defined as those requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or hemin administration, in patients with AIP over six months.
At six months, givosiran met the primary endpoint in patients with AIP (p less than 0.00000001). All the components of the composite primary endpoint and all subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint favored givosiran. Secondary endpoints listed below also demonstrated statistically significant favorable differences in the givosiran arm compared to placebo (p less than 0.0001):

Urinary ALA levels at three months in AIP patients;
Urinary ALA levels at six months in AIP patients;
Urinary PBG levels at six months in AIP patients;
Annualized days of administered hemin doses in AIP patients; and
Annualized attack rate in patients with AHP (including AIP).
The remaining four secondary endpoints did not meet the hierarchical threshold for significance and included: daily worst pain (p equal to 0.053), daily worst fatigue (p equal to 0.29), daily worst nausea (p equal to 0.25), and the physical component summary of the SF-12 health survey in AIP patients (p equal to 0.022).
Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 43/48 (89.6 percent) of givosiran and 37/46 (80.4 percent) of placebo patients and serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 10/48 (20.8 percent) of givosiran and 4/46 (8.7 percent) of placebo patients. There were no deaths in the study. One patient, described below, in the givosiran arm (2.1 percent) discontinued treatment due to an AE. AEs reported in greater than 10 percent of givosiran patients and seen more frequently compared to placebo were: nausea, injection site reactions, chronic kidney disease and fatigue; those reported in greater than 10 percent of placebo patients and seen more frequently than in givosiran-treated patients were headache, urinary tract infection, vomiting and pyrexia. The AEs of chronic kidney disease were reported in five givosiran-treated patients (10.4 percent) and no placebo patients; these events were all in patients with renal dysfunction at baseline and patients continued dosing throughout the study. Liver transaminase increases greater than three times upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 7/48 (14.6 percent) patients on givosiran and 1/46 (2.2 percent) patients on placebo; all had evidence of iron overload or liver disease at baseline. As previously reported and as noted above, one patient on givosiran discontinued treatment due to an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than 8 times ULN, a protocol-defined stopping rule; this elevation did not meet Hy’s Law and subsequently resolved. Peak ALT levels in the other six givosiran-treated patients ranged from 3.0-5.4 times ULN and were not accompanied by bilirubin increases. The patients were asymptomatic, and all events resolved with continued dosing (n=5) or after a brief pause in dosing (n=1).
Upon completion of dosing in the ENVISION double-blind period, all eligible patients (93/94 or 99 percent) enrolled in the ENVISION open-label extension (OLE) study, receiving monthly givosiran administration. In addition, patients continue dosing in the Phase 1/2 OLE study with over two years of exposure to givosiran.

About Acute Hepatic Porphyria
AHP refers to a family of rare, genetic diseases characterized by potentially life-threatening attacks and for some patients chronic debilitating symptoms that negatively impact daily functioning and quality of life. AHP is comprised of four subtypes, each resulting from a genetic defect leading to deficiency in one of the enzymes of the heme biosynthesis pathway in the liver: AIP, hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and ALAD-deficiency porphyria (ADP). These defects cause the accumulation of neurotoxic heme intermediates aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), with ALA believed to be the primary neurotoxic intermediate responsible for causing both attacks and ongoing symptoms between attacks. Common symptoms of AHP include severe, diffuse abdominal pain, weakness, nausea, and fatigue. The nonspecific nature of AHP signs and symptoms can often lead to misdiagnoses of other more common conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, appendicitis, fibromyalgia, and endometriosis, and consequently, patients afflicted by AHP often remain without a proper diagnosis for up to 15 years. In addition, long-term complications of AHP and its treatment can include chronic neuropathic pain, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and liver disease, including iron overload, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, there are no treatments approved to prevent debilitating attacks or to treat the chronic manifestations of the disease.
About Givosiran
Givosiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) in development for the treatment of AHP. Monthly administration of givosiran has the potential to significantly lower induced liver ALAS1 levels in a sustained manner and thereby decrease neurotoxic heme intermediates, aminolevulinic acid ALA and PBG, to near normal levels. By reducing accumulation of these intermediates, givosiran has the potential to prevent or reduce the occurrence of severe and life-threatening attacks, control chronic symptoms, and decrease the burden of the disease. Givosiran utilizes Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability and a wide therapeutic index. The safety and efficacy of givosiran were evaluated in the ENVISION Phase 3 trial with positive results; these results have not been evaluated by the FDA, the EMA or any other health authority and no conclusions should be drawn regarding the safety and effectiveness of this investigational therapeutic.
About RNAi
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.
About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals

 The FDA approval strengthens Baxter’s premix portfolio, enhance patient’s safety by avoiding dosing error and reduces the burden on hospital pharmacist
 Eptifibatide (75mg/100ml) is a platelet aggregation inhibitor, based on Baxter’s galaxy container technology that enhances the shelf life of premixed therapies, currently available in the US","Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), a global leader in sterile medication production and delivery, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and launch of ready-to-use eptifibatide. Baxter’s presentation of eptifibatide is the first of its kind available in a flexible container.
“Hospital pharmacists are unsung heroes working behind the scenes to make sure every dose of medication is delivered accurately and on-time to patients,” said Robert Felicelli, president, Pharmaceuticals, Baxter. “By adding more essential premix medicines—like eptifibatide—to Baxter’s broad portfolio, we can help support pharmacy efficiency, reduce waste and enhance patient safety.”
Eptifibatide is a platelet aggregation inhibitor that prevents platelets—specialized blood cells—from sticking together and clotting. Eptifibatide is indicated for medical treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a broad term that includes heart attack and other emergency conditions in which the blood supply to the heart is suddenly stopped. Eptifibatide is also indicated for treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in which physicians insert a catheter to visualize and open blocked coronary arteries and may, if needed, implant a mesh tube, called a stent, to keep the artery open.
Like other medicines in Baxter’s premix portfolio, eptifibatide uses Baxter’s proprietary GALAXY container technology. GALAXY is a non-PVC and non-DEHP system that enables premixed medicines to have a longer shelf life when stored at room temperature. Premixed formats of standard doses of commonly prescribed drugs offer efficiencies for hospitals by simplifying the preparation process. Premixes may also help enhance patient safety by avoiding potential dosing errors that may occur when medications are compounded, the process of combining different drug agents in specific quantities to fill individualized prescriptions.
Baxter premixed drugs are formulated to adhere to strict Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations established and monitored by the FDA. Eptifibatide is currently available from Baxter in the United States.

 Oncternal’s stockholders will hold 75% of the shares of combined company and GTx will retain 25% of shares. GTx stockholders will receive 50% non-transferable contingent value rights (CVR) from the grant, sale or transfer of rights to SARD
 The newly merged company have strong Octernal’s oncology portfolio with GTx’s Selective Androgen Receptor Degrader (SARD) technology for castration-resistant prostate cancer","Merger will combine Oncternal’s clinical stage oncology pipeline and expertise with GTx’s preclinical Selective Androgen Receptor Degrader (SARD) program for castration-resistant prostate cancer
— Conference call to be held today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time/5:30 a.m. Pacific Time —
MEMPHIS, Tenn. and SAN DIEGO, — GTx, Inc. (Nasdaq: GTXI) and Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company developing potential first-in-class therapeutic candidates for cancers with critical unmet medical need, today jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which the stockholders of Oncternal would become the majority owners of GTx’s outstanding common stock. The proposed merger will create a publicly-traded, clinical-stage oncology company.
The combined company will be named Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. and plans to change its ticker symbol on the Nasdaq Capital Market to ONCT upon closing of the transaction.
The combined company will have a strong balance sheet and deep pipeline of promising oncology drug programs advancing in development:

Oncternal’s lead program, cirmtuzumab, is an investigational, potential first-in-class anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody. Cirmtuzumab is currently in a Phase 1/ 2 clinical trial in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In addition, an investigator-initiated Phase 1 clinical trial of cirmtuzumab in combination with paclitaxel for women with metastatic breast cancer is being conducted at the University of California San Diego (UC San Diego).
TK216, an investigational, potential first-in-class small molecule designed to inhibit the biological activity of ETS-family transcription factor oncoproteins, is being evaluated alone and in combination with vincristine in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma.
A ROR-1 targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) program is in preclinical development at UC San Diego for hematologic and solid tumors.
A Selective Androgen Receptor Degrader (SARD) program, an investigational, potential first-in-class preclinical program designed for oral administration to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer in men who are non-responsive to current androgen targeted therapies.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments for the combined company are expected to be approximately $26 million, if the merger closes by the end of the second quarter of 2019. These funds are expected to be sufficient to advance Oncternal’s programs into the second quarter of 2020, including the Phase 2 study of cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib, and will fund the planned SARD preclinical studies to support the submission of an investigational new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
James Breitmeyer, MD, PhD, cofounder, president and CEO of Oncternal and a 30-year veteran of the pharmaceutical industry, will continue as president and CEO of the combined company. David Hale, cofounder of Oncternal and a 35-year veteran of numerous successful private and public biotech companies, will continue as Chairman of the Board of the combined company.
“This merger introduces Oncternal and its promising oncology pipeline to the public market and provides additional capital resources to advance our programs to potential value inflection points,” said Dr. Breitmeyer. “In addition to clinical data expected from our cirmtuzumab and TK216 programs later this year and during the first half of 2020, we also plan to have preclinical results that get us ready for clinical testing of our ROR1 CAR-T program. The addition of GTx’s SARD technology strengthens our pipeline and augments our entire oncology franchise, which includes a range of therapeutic approaches for a variety of difficult to treat cancers.”
“This transaction with Oncternal reflects the continued commitment of our management team and Board of Directors to deliver value to stockholders and make a difference in patients’ lives,” said Robert J. Wills, PhD, Executive Chairman of GTx. “Following a thorough review of strategic alternatives, we have determined that a reverse merger with Oncternal will enable GTx investors to participate in Oncternal’s broader pipeline of oncology opportunities, including product candidates designed to address rare disease indications, and enable the continued development of our first-in-class SARD technology by a company whose leadership has deep experience in developing oncology medicines.”
About the Proposed Merger
The merger is structured as a stock-for-stock transaction whereby all of Oncternal’s outstanding shares of common stock and securities convertible into or exercisable for Oncternal’s common stock will be converted into GTx common stock and securities convertible into or exercisable for GTx common stock. Immediately following the closing of the transaction, the former stockholders of Oncternal will hold approximately 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company. In addition to retaining an ownership interest representing approximately 25% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company, the GTx stockholders of record as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will receive non-transferable contingent value rights (“CVR”) entitling the holders to receive in the aggregate 50% of any net proceeds derived from the grant, sale or transfer of rights to SARD or selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) technology during the term of the CVR and, if applicable, to receive royalties on the sale of any SARD products by the combined company during the term of the CVR. Under certain circumstances further described in the merger agreement, the exchange ratio of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company may be adjusted upward or downward based on cash levels of each of the companies at closing.
Upon closing of the transaction, GTx will be renamed Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. and will be headquartered in San Diego, California under the leadership of Oncternal’s current management team. Although no GTx employee is expected to remain an employee of the combined company, the merger agreement provides that the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of nine members, including seven designated Oncternal directors as well as Robert J. Wills, PhD and Michael G. Carter, MD, from GTx’s current Board. The combined company is expected to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under a new ticker symbol, ONCT. The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each company. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019, subject to approvals by stockholders of each company and other customary closing conditions.

About GTx
GTx, Inc., headquartered in Memphis, Tenn., is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecules for the treatment of muscle-related diseases and other serious medical conditions.
About Oncternal Therapeutics
Oncternal Therapeutics is a clinical-stage oncology company developing novel, potential first-in-class therapeutic candidates for cancers with critical unmet medical need. The company is leveraging its scientific and development expertise, as well as academic collaborations, to rapidly advance its pipeline.
About Cirmtuzumab
Cirmtuzumab is an investigational, potential first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to bind with high affinity to a biologically important epitope on ROR1 (Receptor-tyrosine kinase-like Orphan Receptor 1). Cirmtuzumab has been developed in collaboration with UC San Diego, and with the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), which funded both previous preclinical development work, as well as previous and ongoing clinical trials. ROR1 is a type 1 transmembrane protein expressed on the plasma membrane with an extracellular domain that is essential for ligand binding and signal transduction. In preclinical studies, it has been observed to bind to many different types of cancer cells, but not to most normal human tissues. Tumor cells that express ROR1 have tumor-initiating features that are associated with a de-differentiated oncogenic state. When expressed by hematologic malignancies such as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL), ROR1 has been observed to act as a receptor for the tumor growth factor Wnt5a. Cirmtuzumab is designed to bind to ROR1 in such a manner that it blocks Wnt5a activation and inhibits tumor-cell proliferation, migration and survival and induces differentiation. Early clinical data suggests that cirmtuzumab may synergize with ibrutinib, and Oncternal is are evaluating this pairing as a potential combination treatment for CLL and MCL.
About TK216
TK216 is an investigational, potential first-in-class small molecule that is designed to inhibit the biological activity of ETS-family transcription factor oncoproteins in a variety of tumor types, in an effort to inhibit cancer cell growth and tumor formation. In Ewing sarcoma, it is designed to target the well-characterized fusion proteins that cause the disease. TK216 is being developed collaboratively by Georgetown University and Oncternal. Oncternal is also planning clinical studies of TK216 in leukemia and performing preclinical studies in prostate cancer.

11058,ï»¿Janssen (J&amp;J) Reports Positive Results of Rilpivirine + Cabotegravir in P-III ATLAS and FLAIR Studies for HIV,Janssen Announces Results Of Two Phase 3 Studies Which Showed Long-Acting Injectable HIV Treatment Regimen Of Rilpivirine And Cabotegravir Demonstrated Comparable Safety And Efficacy To Daily Oral HIV Therapy,"The P-III ATLAS (n= 616) & FLAIR (n= 566) studies involve assessing of Rilpivirine + Cabotegravirin vs oral HIV therapies in virally suppressed HIV patients
 The ATLAS (NCT02951052) & FLAIR (NCT02938520) studies resulted in meeting its 1EPs i.e, plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies per milliliter (c/mL) & patients with virologic failure, non-inferior to Triumeq respectively @48wks.
 Janssen’s Rilpivirine & and ViiV Healthcare’s Cabotegravir (q4w, inj.) is a long-acting combination therapy codeveloped under Jan,2016 agreement b/w the companies","ATLAS and FLAIR studies presented at the 2019 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections met primary endpoints showing long-acting, injectable regimen to be effective in virally suppressed adults living with HIV

CORK, The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson confirmed that the novel, investigational, long-acting two-drug injectable regimen of rilpivirine and cabotegravir met its primary endpoints in two major Phase 3 studies – the Antiretroviral Therapy as Long-Acting Suppression (ATLAS) trial and the First Long-Acting Injectable Regimen (FLAIR) trial. The positive 48-week results from both studies showed that Janssen’s rilpivirine and ViiV Healthcare’s cabotegravir, injected every four weeks, had similar efficacy in maintaining viral suppression in adults living with HIV-1 when compared to a standard of care, daily, oral three-drug regimen. These data were presented at the 2019 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Seattle, Washington. A livestream of the CROI press conference where these studies were highlighted can be viewed here: https://zoom.us/j/755218010
“The Phase 3 results from these studies show that a two-drug injectable treatment regimen may provide people living with HIV the option of managing their virus with just 12 injection regimens a year. If approved by regulators, this will be the first monthly dosing solution for people living with HIV and represents a major step for HIV treatment,” said Brian Woodfall, M.D., Global Head, Development, Infectious Diseases, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV. “At Janssen, we are committed to the ongoing research and development of innovative solutions to fight HIV across the continuum of care. Using heart, science and ingenuity, we are partnering with others and utilizing our scale with the aim to make HIV history.”
ATLAS
The global, pivotal, Phase 3 ATLAS study met its primary endpoint, with rilpivirine and cabotegravir (long acting, or LA regimen) demonstrating non-inferiority to an oral three-drug regimen of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a third agent on viral nonresponse, as measured by the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies per milliliter [c/mL] using the FDA Snapshot algorithm at Week 48 [LA regimen: 5/308 (1.6 percent), current antiretroviral therapy: (CAR) 3/308 (1.0 percent), adjusted difference: 0.6 percent, 95 percent confidence interval: -1.2, 2.5)].
The study found virologic suppression rates (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) at Week 48 were similar between treatment arms [LA regimen: 285/308 (92.5 percent), CAR: 294/308 (95.5 percent), adjusted difference: -3 percent, 95 percent confidence interval: -6.7, 0.7]. Confirmed virologic failure (CVF) was infrequent. Three patients (1 percent) who received the LA regimen developed CVF with subsequent identification of resistance mutations to one or both agents. In two of these cases, pre-existing NNRTI resistance was identified. Two of the three individuals were from Russia and all three had HIV-1 A subtypes, which are seen frequently in Russia, Eastern Europe and East Africa; however, they are seen infrequently in other parts of the world. This unexpected pattern warrants further investigation. In the oral CAR arm, four participants developed CVF, three of whom developed drug resistance mutations.
Patient treatment satisfaction significantly improved after switching to the LA regimen from the previous oral therapy compared to remaining on oral therapy at Week 44 based on the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQs mean difference 5.68; 95 percent CI [4.37, 6.9]; p<0.001). Patient preference data from a single-item question administered at Week 48 showed that 266/308 (86.4 percent) preferred the long-acting injectable regimen whereas 7/308 (2.3 percent) preferred their previous oral therapy.
“The positive safety and efficacy results from the ATLAS study reinforce the potential of rilpivirine and cabotegravir as the first long-acting, injectable regimen option for people living with HIV,” said Susan Swindells, MBBS, Professor, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and ATLAS principal investigator. “This novel approach may help alleviate the burden often associated with daily oral treatment regimens and contribute to making HIV a smaller part of people’s lives.”
Treatment with the LA regimen was generally well-tolerated, with low rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) [13/308 (4.2 percent)] and drug- or injection-related withdrawals. Of the patients who received the LA regimen, 83 percent (250/308) reported an injection site reaction (ISR) at some point through the 48-week study. A majority of injections did not result in ISRs being reported; among a total of 6978 injections administered during the 48-week study, 1460 ISRs were reported. Most ISR events were mild [1156/1460 (79.2 percent)] and lasted an average of three days. Four participants (1.3 percent) withdrew for injection-related events.
FLAIR
The global, pivotal, Phase 3 study met its primary endpoint, with the LA regimen demonstrating non-inferiority to Triumeq®(abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine-ABC/DTG/3TC), as measured by the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies per milliliter [c/mL] using the FDA Snapshot algorithm at Week 48 [LA regimen: 6/283 (2.1 percent), Triumeq® 7/283 (2.5 percent), adjusted difference: -0.4 percent, 95 percent confidence interval: -2.8, 2.1)]. The study found virologic suppression rates (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) at Week 48 were similar between treatment arms [LA regimen: 265/283 (93.6 percent), Triumeq®: 264/283 (93.3 percent), adjusted difference: 0.4 percent. 95 percent confidence interval: -3.7, 4.5].
Confirmed virologic failure (CVF) was infrequent across both treatment arms. Of the individuals who received the LA regimen, there were three confirmed virologic failures (approximately 1 percent), all of whom had treatment-emergent, NNRTI and INSTI resistance. All of these individuals were from Russia and had HIV-1 subtype A1, which is seen frequently in Russia, Eastern Europe and East Africa; however, it is seen infrequently in other parts of the world. This unexpected pattern warrants further investigation. Three participants in the Triumeq® arm developed CVF with no treatment emergent resistance.
Patient treatment satisfaction significantly improved after switching to the LA regimen from the previous oral therapy compared to remaining on oral therapy at Week 48 based on the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQc mean difference 4.1; 95 percent CI [2.8, 5.5], p<0.001). Patient preference data from a single-item question administered at Week 48 showed that 257/283 (90.8 percent) preferred the LA regimen whereas 2/283 (0.7 percent) preferred their previous oral therapy.
“The robust results of the FLAIR study lend further evidence to the potential of rilpivirine and cabotegravir as an alternative option for people currently on daily, oral therapy,” said Chloe Orkin, M.D., Consultant Physician and Clinical Professor at Queen Mary University of London and FLAIR principal investigator. “This long-acting, two-drug regimen may provide an opportunity to change the paradigm for people living with HIV by breaking the cycle of daily pill taking, which has been a defining characteristic of HIV therapy for several decades.”
Treatment with the LA regimen was generally well-tolerated, with low rates of SAEs [18/283 (6.4 percent)] and adverse events (AEs) leading to withdrawal [9/283 (3.2 percent)]. Of the patients who received the LA regimen, 86 percent (239/283) reported an ISR at some point through the 48-week study. A majority of injections did not result in an ISR being reported, with a total of 7704 injections administered during the 48-week study resulting in 2203 ISR events. Nearly all ISRs (99.4 percent) were mild or moderate (mild: 1907/2203, moderate: 282/2203), with a median duration of three days and the frequency of these events decreasing over time. Four participants (1.4 percent) withdrew for injection related events.
In addition to the once-monthly dosing schedule being evaluated in the ATLAS study, a study is ongoing to investigate the LA regimen administered every two months in the ATLAS-2M study. The company plans to use data from the FLAIR and ATLAS studies for future regulatory submissions.
This novel regimen is being co-developed as part of a collaboration with ViiV Healthcare.

11063,Zeiss' CIRRUS HD-OCT Receives FDA's 510 (k) Clearance for Epithelial Thickness Mapping (ETM),"ZEISS Receives FDA Clearance for Epithelial Thickness Mapping for CIRRUS HD-OCT, Enabling More Detailed Assessment of Refractive Surgery Patients","CIRRUS HD-OCT provides a mapping of epithelial thickness (up to 9mm), monitors cornea response in ophthalmic diseases including dry eye & keratoconus
 The FDA’s 510(k) clearance improves Zeiss’ footprints in ophthalmology and is an advancement in the standard of care for identifying retinal and glaucoma diseases
 Zeiss will present new ETM features in CIRRUS software along with its lead product at Vision Expo East in New York","ZEISS Medical Technology Segment announced that it has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the CIRRUS HD-OCT platform, expanding the capabilities of its Anterior Segment Premier Module to include Epithelial Thickness Mapping (ETM).
According to refractive specialist Dr. John Doane of Discover Vision Center in Kansas City, the epithelium is the outermost layer of the cornea and is known to actively remodel itself in response to subtle changes in corneal shape due to pathologies such as early keratoconus that may be missed if using corneal topography alone. “With CIRRUS’ Epithelial Thickness Mapping, I can now better identify eligible patients for refractive surgery, and I can also monitor the cornea’s post-surgical healing response,” Doane said.
ETM with CIRRUS provides a detailed nine-millimeter map of epithelial thickness that enables more thorough assessment of patients before refractive surgery, allows monitoring of the cornea’s response to treatment, and aids in managing patients with ocular surface disorders such as dry eye and progressive corneal diseases such as keratoconus. With ETM, patients can expect a quick, comfortable non-contact exam that takes less than 1-second.
“The addition of this new software is another testament of our continued commitment to providing our customers innovative platforms, so they can provide their patients the highest level of care,” said Jim Mazzo, Global President of Ophthalmic Devices at Carl Zeiss Meditec. “From early detection to post-operative evaluation, we’re here to support to our customers, every step of the way,” he added.
“ZEISS has been at the forefront of industry-defining advancements that have made CIRRUS HD-OCT the industry’s standard of care for identifying retinal and glaucoma disease,” said Dr. Ludwin Monz, President, and CEO of Carl Zeiss Meditec. “This milestone is yet another example to the strength and breadth of our portfolio, expanding CIRRUS’ anterior segment capabilities to serve the needs of all eye care professionals.”
ZEISS will showcase the new ETM feature in the latest CIRRUS Software release, along with other flagship products in Booth LP4003 at the Vision Expo East in New York from March 21-24.

11069,ï»¿Bayer Submits EU's Marketing Authorization Application to EMA for Darolutamide,Bayer submits European marketing authorization application for darolutamide,"The MAA submission is based on P-III ARAMIS study assessing Darolutamide + ADT vs PBO + ADT in 1,509 men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) in ratio 2:1
 The P-III ARAMIS study demonstrated improvement in metastasis-free survival (mFS), presented at ASCO GU in San Francisco with NDA filing & application for marketing in US FDA & MHLW, JAPAN respectively
 Darolutamide (600mg, q2d) is an androgen receptor antagonist, inhibits the growth of growth of prostate cancer cells, with low BBB penetration. Darolutamide is also evaluated in P-III ARASENS study for m-hormone-sensitive prostate cancer","Bayer has submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for darolutamide for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).
“Men are typically asymptomatic at this stage of prostate cancer. Therefore, it is critical that they have treatment options, which not only delay the development of metastases, but also limit burdensome side effects of therapy, so that these men can continue with their day-to-day lives,” said Scott Z. Fields, M.D., senior vice president and head of Oncology Development of Bayer AG’s Pharmaceutical Division. “With this submission, we are taking an important step toward providing patients, caregivers, and physicians with a potential new treatment option for nmCRPC.”
The submission to the EMA is based on data from the Phase III ARAMIS trial in men with nmCRPC, which were recently presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO GU) in San Francisco and published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine, showing a statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival (MFS) for darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).(1)
Bayer recently completed the rolling submission of a New Drug Application to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and submitted an application to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. Bayer is also in discussions with other health authorities regarding submissions.
The compound is being developed jointly by Bayer and Orion Corporation, a globally operating Finnish pharmaceutical company.
About ARAMIS
The ARAMIS trial is a randomized, Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral darolutamide in patients with nmCRPC who are currently being treated with ADT and are at high risk for developing metastatic disease. 1,509 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 600 mg of darolutamide twice a day or placebo along with ADT.
About darolutamide
Darolutamide is a non-steroidal androgen receptor (AR) antagonist with a distinct chemical structure that binds to the receptor with high affinity and exhibits strong antagonistic activity, thereby inhibiting the receptor function and the growth of prostate cancer cells. In preclinical studies, darolutamide demonstrated lower blood-brain barrier penetration compared to other currently available AR antagonists.(2)
In addition to the Phase III trial ARAMIS in men with nmCRPC, darolutamide is also being investigated in a Phase III study in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (ARASENS). Information about these trials can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Darolutamide is not approved by the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency or any other health authority.
About castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men worldwide.(3) In 2018, an estimated 1.2 million men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and about 358,000 died from the disease worldwide.(3) Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men.(3) Prostate cancer results from the abnormal proliferation of cells within the prostate gland, which is part of a man´s reproductive system.(4) It mainly affects men over the age of 50, and the risk increases with age.(5) Treatment options range from surgery to radiation treatment to therapy using hormone-receptor antagonists, i.e., substances that stop the formation of testosterone or prevent its effect at the target location.(6) However, in nearly all cases, the cancer eventually becomes resistant to conventional hormone therapy.(7)
CRPC is an advanced form of the disease where the cancer keeps progressing even when the amount of testosterone is reduced to very low levels in the body. The field of treatment options for castration-resistant patients is evolving rapidly, but until recently, there have been no approved treatment options for CRPC patients who have rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels while on ADT and no detectable metastases. In men with progressive nmCRPC, a rapid PSA doubling time has been consistently associated with reduced time to first metastasis and death.(8)

11091,Roche's Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) Receives FDA's Approval for Identifying Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) as CDxï»¿,Roche’s VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay approved as first companion diagnostic to identify triple-negative breast cancer patients eligible for treatment with Tecentriq in combination with Abraxane,"The approval is based on IMpassion130 study assessing Tecentriq + Abraxane vs PBO + Abraxane in patients with advanced or mTNBC with no prior therapy
 The Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay was used in Roche’s Tecentriq clinical trials to stratify patients and enhances the visual contrast of tumor-infiltrating immune cell staining
 The Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay is a companion diagnostic, performs specific staining of tumor cells with the use of OptiView DAB IHC detection kit with OptiView amplification kit and has received FDA’s Approval for UC & NSCLC with Tecentriq","PD-L1 (SP142) was the enrollment assay used in the IMpassion130 trial, the first positive phase
III immunotherapy regimen study in triple-negative breast cancer
• Each year about 300,000 women are diagnosed globally with triple-negative breast cancer, an
aggressive disease with limited treatment options that represents 15 percent of all breast cancer
cases1
• This approval is an important step in Roche’s personalized healthcare strategy to fit treatments
to patients who can benefit most from a specific medicine
Basel, Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced US Food and Drug
Administration approval of the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay2 as the first companion diagnostic to aid in
identifying triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients eligible for treatment with the Roche cancer
immunotherapy Tecentriq®(atezolizumab)3 plus chemotherapy (Abraxane® [paclitaxel protein-bound
particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound); nab-paclitaxel]). Assessment of PD-L1 biomarker status
on tumor-infiltrating immune cells with the assay is essential for identifying those patients most likely to
benefit from the treatment.
A diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer means that the three most common proteins associated with
breast cancer growth – estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2/neu – are not expressed on the
tumor.
“Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive disease that, until now, has had limited treatment options,”
said Michael Heuer, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “This assay plays a pivotal role in helping physicians identify
patients that can benefit from Tecentriq therapy, providing better patient care. At Roche, we build on our
capacity to research both targeted medicines and companion diagnostics under one roof, so we can provide
the right treatment to the right patient at the right time.”
The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay was developed to enhance visual contrast of tumor-infiltrating
immune cell staining. In triple-negative breast cancer, PD-L1 is primarily expressed on tumor-infiltrating
immune cells rather than on tumor cells themselves.
Launched in 2016, the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay is the primary diagnostic assay within the Tecentriq
clinical development program and was used to enroll and stratify patients in Tecentriq clinical trials. The
assay was the first to evaluate patient PD-L1 biomarker status using immune cell staining and scoring within
the tumor microenvironment.4

About the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay
The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay is available on the fully automated BenchMark ULTRA instrument5
and uses the OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit with OptiView Amplification Kit. The VENTANA PD-L1
(SP142) Assay performs specific staining of tumor cells and immune cells. The assay was previously approved
by the FDA and CE marked for use as a companion diagnostic in urothelial carcinoma (UC)3 and as a
predictive assay in second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Tecentriq. See the Tecentriq
product label for more information on PD-L1 expression levels in therapeutic guidance for various cancer
indications.
About the IMpassion130 study
The IMpassion130 study is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy,
safety and pharmacokinetics of Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel in
people with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have not received
prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (mBC). For details of the study go to www.roche.com.
About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1 expressed on tumour cells
and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By
inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T cells. Tecentriq has the potential to be used as a
foundational combination partner with cancer immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various
chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers.
Tecentriq is already approved in the European Union, United States and more than 85 countries for people
with previously treated metastatic NSCLC and for certain types of untreated or previously treated metastatic
urothelial carcinoma (mUC). Tecentriq was also recently approved in the United States for the initial
treatment of people with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour
aberrations and for the treatment of PD-L1 positive, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

11098,ï»¿MSD Signs a License Agreement with King's College London &amp; Wellcome's Innovations to Develop Chronic Neuropathic Pain Therapies,Pioneering pain research leads to landmark deal,"King’s and Wellcome to receive $340M as development and commercial milestone and royalties on sales. MSD to get a license for conducting lead optimization, preclinical & clinical research
 The focus of an agreement is to develop therapies for chronic pain and to meet unmet medical needs of patients
 Professor McNaughton at King’s identifies target protein, HCN2 which is used by MSD to develop therapies that relieve pain without side effects by blocking HCN2 protein","King’s College London and Wellcome today announce an agreement with the pharmaceutical company MSD (tradename of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA). The collaboration and licence deal, made possible by the pioneering work of Professor Peter McNaughton from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s, could lead to a new class of pain medications.
New medications for managing chronic pain are urgently needed. Current pain drugs are effective at relieving short-term pain but are much less effective for ongoing chronic pain and there is a risk of side-effects when taken at high doses over time. Chronic neuropathic pain, which is caused by nerve damage from traumatic injury or illness, is a particular problem and there are no truly effective treatment options. As many as one in four people with diabetes suffers from neuropathic pain.
Professor McNaughton’s lab in the Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases at the IoPPN has uncovered a fundamental biological mechanism underlying neuropathic pain, building on his 2011 discovery, while at the University of Cambridge, that identified the importance of the protein HCN2 in chronic pain. HCN2 can cause a continuous sensation of pain through the initiation of electrical signals in pain-sensitive nerve fibres, and research at King’s has shown that blocking the activity of HCN2 in animal models can deliver effective pain relief without side effects.
Under the agreement, negotiated by King’s IP & Licensing team and Wellcome’s Innovations team, King’s and Wellcome are eligible to receive up to $340 million (£263 million) in development and sales milestones, as well as royalties if a drug comes to market. MSD will be responsible for conducting lead optimisation, preclinical development and clinical trials. MSD will also provide funding to the McNaughton lab for further research on the biological mechanisms of pain. Since 2012, Wellcome has provided £4.5m in funding to develop Professor McNaughton’s work towards candidate drug compounds for blocking HCN2.
Professor McNaughton says: ‘Chronic pain has a devastating effect on people’s lives. Most pain drugs have been developed from traditional remedies or by repurposing existing medications and in general are not very effective at controlling chronic pain. By targeting the molecular causes of pain we have developed new molecules that we believe can avoid the major side-effects that come with current painkillers.’
Professor Sir Robert Lechler, Senior Vice President/Provost (Health) at King’s and Executive Director of King’s Health Partners says: ‘Moving research beyond the lab requires collaboration and determination to translate discoveries into meaningful outcomes. The deal with MSD gives our research the best chance of being translated into medications that will have a real impact on patient’s lives.

 reSURFACE 1 & reSURFACE 2 studies result: @12wks. PASI 75 (75%); @28wks. PASI 90 (54%), PASI 100 (29%); well tolerated; low AEs & discontinuation rates
 Ilumetri (tildrakizumab, SC, 100mg, q3mt) is a mAb targeting interleukin IL 23 p19 with its expected NICE approval in Apr’19. It has also received EU approval in Sept’18, codeveloped & co commercialize by Almirall & Sun Pharma under an agreement July’16","Final NICE approval is expected in April 2019
From this date, dermatologists in the UK will have an additional biologic treatment option and suitable patients can be considered for treatment with ILUMETRI® (tildrakizumab)
Tildrakizumab is a high-affinity humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the p19 subunit of IL-231, that has demonstrated lasting efficacy and safety through 3 years according to the positive results of a pooled analysis2 of two phase III clinical trials
Tildrakizumab was approved by the European Commission in September 2018, is already available in Germany and is due to be marketed in all EU Member states
 
 
Almirall, S.A. (ALM), announced today that the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, in the UK) has provisionally recommended approval of ILUMETRI® (tildrakizumab), a humanized, high-affinity IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy.1 Following a single health technology assessment submission to NICE in August 2018 and the subsequent questions for clarification and appraisal committee meetings, NICE completed their assessment of tildrakizumab and has now issued a Final Appraisal Determination (FAD) provisionally recommending tildrakizumab as a cost effective treatment option for the NHS for the patients specified in the FAD. Final NICE approval is expected in April 2019.
As remarked by Jacob Anker Rasmussen, Almirall’s General Manager UK & Nordics, “the provisional recommendation by the NICE appraisal committee, who agreed that tildrakizumab is a cost effective option, is excellent news for both dermatologists and patients. It means that dermatologists in the UK now have an additional biologic treatment option and suitable patients can now be considered for tildrakizumab“.
Tildrakizumab is a high affinity, humanised, IgG1 K antibody targeting interleukin IL 23 p19 that represents an evolving treatment strategy in chronic plaque psoriasis.3 Tildrakizumab constitutes an important step forward in the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.3
Tildrakizumab is administered by subcutaneous injection. Its convenient dosing regimen, every 3 months during maintenance, could offer greater convenience and quality of life for patients, potentially achieving an improved treatment satisfaction.4 The low frequency of injections, only 4 doses per year during maintenance, may also encourage adherence.4
Almirall in-licensed tildrakizumab from Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Sun Pharma) in July 2016. The agreement is for development and commercialization of ILUMETRI® (tildrakizumab) in Europe. It was approved by the European Commission in September 2018, is already available in Germany and is due to be marketed in all EU Member states.
 
Approval based on reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 phase III trials positive results
Its approval in Europe is based on reSURFACE 1 and 23 positive results, with the dose of 100mg. Both pivotal phase III clinical trials, which included over 1,800 patients from more than 200 clinical sites worldwide, showed that Tildrakizumab offers clinically meaningful benefits over time, which is promising news for patients and clinicians.3
According to both studies’ data, an average of 62% of patients achieved 75% of skin clearance (Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index or PASI 75) by week 12 and an average of 77% at week 28 after only three doses. Moreover, an average of 54% of patients achieved PASI 90 and an average of 29% reached PASI 100 at week 28.4
The results of a pooled analysis through 3 years2 from reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 phase III trials3show the consistent maintenance of efficacy and safety over three years of tildrakizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were responders at week 28. According to the data, PASI 75 responses were maintained with continued treatment with tildrakizumab in 9 out of 10 patients up to week 148.3,4 More than 50% of patients reported that psoriasis no longer affected their lives after only 3 doses.1,3,4 Tildrakizumab was well-tolerated with very low drug-related serious adverse events and discontinuation rates.1,2
 
About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic immune disease that appears on the skin. It affects an estimated 7.8 million adults in Europe and approximately 125 million people worldwide.5 It is a non-contagious disorder that accelerates the growth cycle of skin cells and results in thick scaly areas of skin. The most common form of psoriasis, called plaque psoriasis, appears as red, raised areas of skin covered with flaky white scales, which may be itchy and painful and can crack and bleed. Despite different treatment options existing, many people with plaque psoriasis continue to struggle with the ongoing, persistent nature of this chronic disease.

 The P-III IMpassion130 study results: mPFS (7.4mos. vs 4.8 mos.); OS (43%); no new safety signals
 Tecentriq + Abraxane is a combination of mAb targeting PD-L1 protein & chemotherapeutic agent. Tecentriq is approved in EU, the US and other 85 countries for NSCLC & mUC","This Tecentriq combination is the first cancer immunotherapy regimen approved for breast
cancer
• Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive disease, with high unmet medical need
Basel, 11 March 2019 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) plus
chemotherapy (Abraxane® [paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound);
nab-paclitaxel]) for the treatment of adults with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) in people whose tumours express PD-L1, as determined by an FDA-approved test.
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on progression-free survival (PFS). Continued
approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a
confirmatory trial(s). The FDA’s Accelerated Approval Programme allows conditional approval of a
medicine that fills an unmet medical need for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
“The FDA approval of this Tecentriq combination is an important treatment advance for people with PD-L1-
positive, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, a disease with high unmet medical need,” said Sandra
Horning, MD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “This Tecentriq
combination is the first cancer immunotherapy regimen to be approved in breast cancer, representing a
meaningful step forward in the understanding of this disease.”
This accelerated approval is based on data from the Phase III IMpassion130 study, which demonstrated that
Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 40%
compared with nab-paclitaxel alone (median PFS=7.4 vs. 4.8 months; HR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.48-0.77, p<0.0001)
in PD-L1-positive patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who had not received
prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Overall survival (OS) results were immature with 43% of events in
all randomised patients (intent-to-treat; ITT), and further data will be shared with the FDA and presented at
an upcoming medical meeting. Safety in the Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel arm appeared consistent with the
known safety profiles of the individual medicines, and no new safety signals were identified with the
combination. The most common Grade 3-4 side effects (≥2%) with Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel were low
white blood cells, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, neutrophil count decreased, feeling tired, low
red blood cells, low blood potassium level, pneumonia and increased blood level of a liver enzyme (AST). The
most common side effects (≥20 %) were hair loss, feeling tired, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet,
nausea, diarrhoea, low red blood cells, constipation, cough, headache, low white blood cells, decreased
appetite and vomiting.

About the IMpassion130 study
The IMpassion130 study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy,
safety and pharmacokinetics of Tecentriq plus nab-paclitaxel compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel in
people with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have not received prior systemic therapy
for metastatic breast cancer. The study enrolled 902 people who were randomised equally (1:1). The coprimary endpoints are PFS per investigator assessment (RECIST 1.1) in the ITT population and in the PDL1-positive population and OS in the ITT population. OS results were immature in the ITT population.
Secondary endpoints include objective response rate and duration of response.
About Triple-Negative breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with more than 2 million diagnosed worldwide
each year.1TNBC represents 15% of all breast cancers and is more common in women under the age of 50,
compared with other forms of breast cancer.2;3;4 It is defined by the lack of expression and/or amplification of
the targetable receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 amplification.5 Patients with metastatic TNBC
generally experience rapid progression and shorter OS compared to other subtypes of breast cancer.3

AZ to get an option to negotiate rights and share the development cost
 The focus of the agreement is to develop microbiome for immuno-oncology by using Seres’ expertise in microbiome with AstraZeneca’s experience in oncology products
 Seres’ leading microbiome candidates includes SER-109 & has received FDA’s BT & OD designation. SER-287 & SER-401 is currently being evaluated in P-II b & P-I b studies respectively","Seres Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MCRB) today announced a three-year research collaboration with AstraZeneca. The collaboration will focus on advancing mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in augmenting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, including potential synergy withAstraZeneca compounds.
Preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests that the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome impacts clinical response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy and supports the hypothesis that modification of the microbiome may improve outcomes. These data provide strong support for continued research to further understand the microbiome as a predictor of response to checkpoint inhibitors and to elucidate the potential of microbiome therapeutics to augment immunotherapy.
Under the collaboration, research will evaluate microbiome-based approaches as a predictor for which patients may respond best to certain cancer immunotherapies. Additionally, SER-401, an investigational microbiome therapeutic, may be studied in combination with AstraZeneca compounds targeting various cancers. The collaboration will apply Seres’ microbiome drug discovery and manufacturing expertise with AstraZeneca’s extensive oncology experience to evaluate the potential for microbiome therapy to improve clinical response when used in conjunction with adjunctive pharmaceutical approaches.
“We are very pleased to be collaborating with AstraZeneca, a global leader in oncology, to advance the development of potential microbiome-based therapies for cancer. Through the activities under this collaboration and in our SER-401 Phase 1b clinical study in metastatic melanoma, we hope to meaningfully advance our understanding of the potential for microbiome therapeutics to magnify the impact of cancer immunotherapy,” said Eric Shaff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Seres Therapeutics.
“Our new collaboration with Seres Therapeutics represents an important opportunity to advance our understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and the immune system’s ability to respond to cancer therapy,” said Jean-Charles Soria, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Research & Development Oncology at AstraZeneca. “Despite progress in the field of immunotherapy, we are only at the tip of the iceberg. Too many patients are still unable to benefit from existing therapies, so we must continue following the science in pursuit of new and innovative solutions.”
Under the terms of the exclusive collaboration, AstraZeneca will provide Seres with $20 million in three equal installments over two years, with the first payment due at the start of the agreement. In addition, AstraZeneca will also reimburse Seres for research activity related to the collaboration. Seres will maintain rights to oncology targeted microbiome therapeutic candidates, and AstraZeneca will obtain the option to negotiate for rights to those programs and other inventions arising out of the collaboration.

 REFLECTIONS B327-02 study demonstrated a high degree of similarity & no clinical differences b/w Trazimera & Herceptin
 Trazimera (trastuzumab-biosimilar) is a HER2 receptor antagonist biosimilar to Herceptin and has received EU’s approval in Jul’18 for the same indication","Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TRAZIMERA™ (trastuzumab-qyyp), a biosimilar to Herceptin® (trastuzumab),1 for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) overexpressing breast cancer and HER2 overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.2
“This is an important milestone in the U.S. which both adds to our growing portfolio of oncology treatments and has the potential to improve access to cancer care,” said Andy Schmeltz, Global President, Pfizer Oncology. “We are proud to be able to offer treatment options that can help address the diverse needs of patients.”
The FDA approval was based on review of a comprehensive data package, which demonstrated a high degree of similarity between TRAZIMERA and the originator product. This includes results from the REFLECTIONS B327-02 clinical comparative study that was recently published in the British Journal of Cancer, which showed clinical equivalence, finding a high degree of similarity and no clinically meaningful differences between TRAZIMERA and the originator product in patients with first line HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.3
“Approximately 15-30% of breast cancers and 10-30% of gastric cancers are HER2-positive, which is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognoses for patients,” said Dr. Mark Pegram, associate director for clinical research at the Stanford Comprehensive Cancer Institute, and director of the Breast Oncology Program at the Stanford Women’s Cancer Center.4 “With the availability of biosimilars like TRAZIMERA in the U.S., oncologists will have additional treatment options to choose from, which may help provide patients with greater access to the medicines they need.”
Pfizer has a robust portfolio of potential biosimilar candidates in mid- to late-stage development.5 TRAZIMERA is Pfizer’s first oncology monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilar and Pfizer’s fifth biosimilar to be approved by the FDA.2,6,7,8,9 TRAZIMERA was also approved for use in the EU in July 2018 for the treatment of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer and HER2 overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.10
About TRAZIMERA (trastuzumab-qyyp)
TRAZIMERA is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilar of the originator biologic medicine, Herceptin, which targets HER2, a protein found on the surface of some cancer cells which can stimulate the cells to divide and grow.11 TRAZIMERA locks on to the HER2 protein and blocks the receptors, stopping cell division and growth.10
As part of the REFLECTIONS clinical trial program, TRAZIMERA has been studied in nearly 500 patients and across more than 20 countries to date.12,13,14,15,16

11167,Allergan Reports Acceptance of NDA from FDA for its Ubrogepant for Migraine,Allergan Announces FDA Acceptance of New Drug Application for Ubrogepant for the Acute Treatment of Migraine,"The NDA filing is based on P-III ACHIEVE I (50 mg/100 mg) & ACHIEVE II (25mg/50mg) + two additional safety studies (UBR-MD-04 & 3110-105-002) assessing Ubrogepant vs PBO in patients with acute migraine
 The ACHIEVE I & ACHIEVE II studies resulted in meeting its 1EPs and 2EPs i.e, reduces the pain with no bothersome symptoms and was well tolerated
 Ubrogepant is a novel, oral gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist and is used for broad spectrum treatment of migraine from episodic to chronic","Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The NDA filing is based on the successful completion of four clinical trials – two pivotal studies, ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II, which demonstrated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, as well as two additional safety studies. A 10-month review period has been assigned with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) in the fourth quarter of 2019.
“Following the acceptance and expected review of this NDA, we anticipate ubrogepant to be the first approved oral CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine, and may be used in conjunction with other available migraine treatments,” said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer, Allergan. “As a leader in Chronic Migraine research for more than 20 years, Allergan looks to provide options for patients who need new acute and preventative treatments for migraine. In addition to ubrogepant, we are continuing to advance the Phase 3 clinical program for atogepant, the company’s second orally-administered investigational CGRP receptor antagonist specifically for migraine prevention.”
In the four clinical studies (ACHIEVE I, ACHIEVE II, UBR-MD-04 and 3110-105-002) supporting the NDA, ubrogepant demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability in the acute treatment of migraine among a broad patient population, including those who had an insufficient response to a triptan or those patients in whom triptans were contraindicated, as well as in patients who had moderate to severe CV risk profile. Following are topline results from the key clinical studies:
Phase 3 Clinical Trials (ACHIEVE I & ACHIEVE II)

The two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally administered ubrogepant (ACHIEVE I at 50 mg and 100 mg; and ACHIEVE II at 25 mg and 50 mg) compared to placebo to treat a single migraine attack in adults.
The 50 mg and 100 mg doses met the studies’ co-primary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients achieving pain freedom and absence of most bothersome symptom at two hours after the initial dose as compared to placebo patients; there was continued separation from placebo up to 48 hours.
The 50 mg and 100 mg doses also met key secondary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients achieving pain relief at two hours after the initial dose compared to placebo patients.
Additional Safety Studies (UBR-MD-04 & 3110-105-002)

Study UBR-MD-04: Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, 52-week open-label extension trial in which adults with migraine were randomized 1:1:1 to usual care, ubrogepant 50 mg, or ubrogepant 100 mg to assess long-term safety and tolerability.
Intermittent use of ubrogepant 50 mg or 100 mg for the acute treatment of migraine attacks over one year was well-tolerated. The three most frequently reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis.
Study 3110-105-002: Phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant 100 mg, focusing on hepatic safety in healthy participants administered high frequency intermittent dosing (2 days of ubrogepant 100 mg followed by 2 days of placebo for 8 consecutive weeks).
Ubrogepant 100 mg was well-tolerated following frequent dosing and was not associated with persistent increases in ALT/AST compared to placebo, supporting liver safety.
“Despite its prevalence and burden, migraine remains an undertreated disease, with many patients continuing to seek additional treatment options from their physicians,” said Dr. Jessica Ailani, a neurologist and Director of the Medstar Georgetown Headache Center. “If approved, ubrogepant, the first innovation in the acute treatment of migraine in over 25 years, will be used across the entire spectrum of the disease (from episodic to chronic) helping patients achieve relief in the moments when they most demand it.”
About Ubrogepant
Ubrogepant is a novel, highly potent, orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. CGRP receptor antagonism is a novel mechanism of action for the acute treatment of migraine that clearly differs from the mechanisms of currently available triptans (serotonin 1B/1D agonists), opioids and ergots.
About Migraine
Migraine is a chronic disease with episodic attacks defined by neurological symptoms such as headache pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea; these symptoms are often incapacitating. Migraine is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 1 in 7 individuals, and is associated with significant disability leading to high personal, family, societal, and economic burden. There is a need for new treatments for migraine with improved benefit-risk profiles as compared to current standard of care.
Allergan, a leader in the migraine space, markets BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) the first FDA-approved, preventive treatment for adult Chronic Migraine patients since it was approved in 2010. Allergan is also advancing its migraine program with two investigational small molecule oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, which are being developed for the acute treatment and prevention of migraine. Allergan’s CGRP receptor antagonist ubrogepant has been submitted to the FDA for review for the acute treatment of migraine, and it is expected to be the first oral CGRP receptor antagonist to market; following will be atogepant, which is currently in Phase 3 development for the prevention of migraine.

“Paige.AI is focused on providing artificial intelligence tools to pathologists that will enable them to become faster and more accurate in their diagnosis and treatment recommendations for the care of cancer patients,” said Dr. Leo Grady, Chief Executive Officer of Paige.AI. “We are thrilled to receive Breakthrough designation and look forward to collaborating with the FDA to bring our products to market, starting with prostate cancer and expanding from there.”
The FDA’s Breakthrough Device designation is granted for technologies that have the potential to provide for more effective diagnosis or treatment for life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases, where timely availability is in the best interest of patients because no approved alternative exists or because the technology offers significant advantages over existing approved alternatives. The Breakthrough Device program was created by the 21st Century Cures Act.
“We are honored to have been granted Breakthrough designation by the FDA, which underscores the groundbreaking nature of our technology as the leading clinical-grade AI in computational pathology to combine vast amounts of high-quality data with unique deep learning architectures in service of delivering better patient care,” said Dr. Thomas Fuchs, Co-Founder of Paige.AI.
Paige.AI was launched in early 2018 based on technology developed by Fuchs and his colleagues and a license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). MSK began digitizing its pathology slides four years ago. Under the license agreement, Paige.AI receives de-identified images of digitized slides – more than one million such slides to date — and is funding the digitization of an additional four million archive slides, which in total will create the largest digital pathology dataset. Paige.AI is working with this de-identified dataset to develop a comprehensive portfolio of AI products across cancer subtypes to serve the needs of pathologists around the world.

INDIANAPOLIS, – Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that its Phase 3 RELAY study of CYRAMZA® (ramucirumab) met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the time patients lived without their cancer growing or spreading after starting treatment. The Phase 3 global, randomized, double-blind trial is evaluating CYRAMZA in combination with erlotinib, compared to placebo in combination with erlotinib, as a first-line treatment in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating EGFR mutations.
The safety profile observed in the RELAY study was consistent with what has been previously observed for CYRAMZA in Phase 3 clinical trials and the established safety profile of erlotinib. The most common (>5% incidence) Grade ≥3 adverse events occurring at a higher rate (≥5% difference) on the CYRAMZA-plus-erlotinib arm compared to the placebo-plus-erlotinib arm were hypertension, dermatitis acneiform (an acne-like rash), and diarrhea. Detailed efficacy and safety results will be submitted for presentation at a medical meeting in 2019.
“Despite recent treatment advances in metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, prognosis remains poor and there is an ongoing need for additional first-line treatment options to help patients with this deadly disease,” said Maura Dickler, M.D., vice president of late phase development, Lilly Oncology.
There is no cure for people with metastatic lung cancer. The disease is associated with low survival rates and disease progression following acquired resistance remains a challenge. Most patients receive several lines of treatment and the therapeutic regimen prescribed for first-line treatment can impact a person’s options for later lines of treatment. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the current standard treatment option for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Erlotinib, the TKI included in the RELAY trial regimen, is a globally recognized standard of care for this type of lung cancer.
“We are excited about these results, which show CYRAMZA plus erlotinib significantly delayed disease progression in this patient population. The RELAY trial is another example of Lilly’s deep commitment to providing new treatment options to patients with lung cancer,” said Dr. Dickler. “We would like to thank the patients, investigators and clinical trial sites that are participating in the RELAY study, and we look forward to working with regulatory authorities globally on our submissions.”
Lilly intends to initiate global regulatory submissions in mid-2019.
RELAY is the second positive Phase 3 study of CYRAMZA in metastatic NSCLC. In the positive Phase 3 REVEL study, CYRAMZA plus docetaxel was compared to placebo plus docetaxel in people with metastatic NSCLC whose cancer had progressed on or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. The primary endpoint of overall survival was met, as well as key secondary endpoints of PFS and response rate. The REVEL results supported CYRAMZA’s current indication in second-line NSCLC.
Results of previously completed Phase 3 studies of CYRAMZA have also supported approvals in second-line gastric and colorectal cancer. Based on the REACH-2 results, Lilly has made regulatory submissions in the U.S., EU and Japan for the use of CYRAMZA in second-line treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
About the RELAY Trial
RELAY is a global randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of CYRAMZA in combination with erlotinib, compared to placebo in combination with erlotinib, as a first-line treatment in previously untreated patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. Initiated in 2015, the study randomized 449 patients across North America, Europe and Asia. The primary endpoint of the RELAY trial is progression-free survival; key secondary endpoints include safety, response rate, overall survival, and patient-reported outcomes.
About Lung Cancer and EGFR Mutations
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and most other countries, killing nearly 1.7 million people worldwide each year.1 In the U.S., lung cancer is responsible for approximately 25 percent of all cancer deaths, more than those from breast, colon and prostate cancers combined.2 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is much more common than other types of lung cancer and accounts for about 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.3 Stage IV NSCLC is a very difficult-to-treat cancer and the prognosis is poor for metastatic NSCLC.4
EGFR is a protein that helps cells grow and divide. When the EGFR gene is mutated it can cause the protein to be overactive, resulting in the formation of cancer cells. EGFR mutations may occur in 10 to 35 percent of NSCLC tumors globally.5 Activating EGFR mutations are found in about 10 to 20 percent of Caucasian patients with lung adenocarcinomas and in up to 40 to 60 percent of Asian patients.6,7,8 Regardless of ethnicity, these mutations are commonly found in females, non-smokers and those with adenocarcinoma histology.9,10 The most common EGFR mutations are activating exon 19 deletion and exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations, which are present in over 90 percent of EGFR-mutated tumors.7,8
About CYRAMZA® (ramucirumab)
In the U.S., CYRAMZA (ramucirumab) is approved for use as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel as a treatment for people with advanced or metastatic gastric (stomach) or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose cancer has progressed on or after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy. It is also approved in combination with docetaxel as a treatment for people with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose cancer has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, it is approved with FOLFIRI as a treatment for people with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose cancer has progressed on or after therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.
CYRAMZA is being investigated in a broad global development program that has enrolled more than 14,000 patients across more than 100 trials worldwide. These include several studies investigating CYRAMZA in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for the treatment of multiple tumor types.
Ramucirumab is an antiangiogenic therapy. It is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Receptor 2 antagonist that specifically binds and blocks activation of VEGF Receptor 2 by blocking the binding of VEGF receptor ligands VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. Ramucirumab inhibited angiogenesis in an in vivo animal model.
About Angiogenesis and VEGF Protein
Angiogenesis is the process of making new blood vessels. In a person with cancer, angiogenesis creates new blood vessels that give a tumor its own blood supply, allowing it to grow and spread.
Some tumors create proteins called VEGF. These proteins attach to the VEGF receptors of blood vessel cells causing new blood vessels to form around the tumors, enabling growth. Blocking the VEGF protein from linking to the blood vessels helps to inhibit tumor growth by slowing angiogenesis and the blood supply that feeds tumors. Of the three known VEGF receptors, VEGF Receptor 2 is linked most closely to VEGF-induced tumor angiogenesis.
INDICATIONS
Gastric Cancer
CYRAMZA, as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic, gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
CYRAMZA, in combination with docetaxel, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving CYRAMZA.
Colorectal Cancer
CYRAMZA, in combination with FOLFIRI (irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil), is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with disease progression on or after prior therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR CYRAMZA
WARNING: HEMORRHAGE, GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATION, AND
IMPAIRED WOUND HEALING 
Hemorrhage: CYRAMZA increased the risk of hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhagic events. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience severe bleeding. 
 
Gastrointestinal Perforation: CYRAMZA can increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, a potentially fatal event. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a gastrointestinal perforation.
 
Impaired Wound Healing: Impaired wound healing can occur with antibodies inhibiting the VEGF pathway. Discontinue CYRAMZA therapy in patients with impaired wound healing. Withhold CYRAMZA prior to surgery and discontinue CYRAMZA if a patient develops wound healing complications.
Warnings and Precautions
Hemorrhage

In study 1, which evaluated CYRAMZA as a single agent in advanced gastric cancer, the incidence of severe bleeding was 3.4% for CYRAMZA and 2.6% for placebo. In study 2, which evaluated CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel in advanced gastric cancer, the incidence of severe bleeding was 4.3% for CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel and 2.4% for placebo plus paclitaxel. Patients with gastric cancer receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were excluded from enrollment in studies 1 and 2. In study 3, which evaluated CYRAMZA plus docetaxel in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the incidence of severe bleeding was 2.4% for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel and 2.3% for placebo plus docetaxel. Patients with NSCLC receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or chronic therapy with NSAIDs or other antiplatelet therapy other than once-daily aspirin or with radiographic evidence of major airway or blood vessel invasion or intratumor cavitation were excluded from study 3. In study 4, which evaluated CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI in metastatic colorectal cancer, the incidence of severe bleeding was 2.5% for CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI and 1.7% for placebo plus FOLFIRI. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience severe bleeding.
Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs)

Serious, sometimes fatal, ATEs including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular accident, and cerebral ischemia occurred in clinical trials. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a severe ATE.
Hypertension

An increased incidence of severe hypertension occurred in patients receiving CYRAMZA as a single agent (8%) as compared to placebo (3%), in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel (15%) as compared to placebo plus paclitaxel (3%), and in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus docetaxel (6%) as compared to placebo plus docetaxel (2%), and in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI (11%) as compared to placebo plus FOLFIRI (3%). Monitor blood pressure every 2 weeks or more frequently as indicated during treatment. Temporarily suspend CYRAMZA for severe hypertension until medically controlled. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA if medically significant hypertension cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy or in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.
Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)

Prior to the institution of premedication recommendations across clinical trials of CYRAMZA, IRRs occurred in 6 out of 37 patients (16%), including 2 severe events. The majority of IRRs across trials occurred during or following a first or second CYRAMZA infusion. Monitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRRs in a setting with available resuscitation equipment. Immediately and permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for grade 3 or 4 IRRs.
Gastrointestinal Perforations

Four of 570 patients (0.7%) who received CYRAMZA as a single agent in advanced gastric cancer clinical trials experienced gastrointestinal perforation. In study 2, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was 1.2% for CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel as compared to 0.3% for placebo plus paclitaxel. In study 3, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was 1% for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel as compared to 0.3% for placebo plus docetaxel. In study 4, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was 1.7% for CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI and 0.6% for placebo plus FOLFIRI. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a gastrointestinal perforation.
Impaired Wound Healing

CYRAMZA has not been studied in patients with serious or nonhealing wounds. CYRAMZA has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Discontinue CYRAMZA therapy in patients with impaired wound healing. Withhold CYRAMZA prior to surgery. Resume CYRAMZA following the surgical intervention based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. If a patient develops wound healing complications during therapy, discontinue CYRAMZA until the wound is fully healed.
Deterioration in Child-Pugh B or C Cirrhosis

Clinical deterioration, manifested by new onset or worsening encephalopathy, ascites, or hepatorenal syndrome, was reported in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis who received single-agent CYRAMZA.
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)

RPLS has been reported at a rate of <0.1% in clinical studies with CYRAMZA. Discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who develop RPLS. Symptoms may resolve or improve within days, although some patients with RPLS can experience ongoing neurologic sequelae or death.
Proteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome

In study 4, severe proteinuria occurred more frequently in patients treated with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI compared to patients receiving placebo plus FOLFIRI. Severe proteinuria was reported in 3% of patients treated with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI (including 3 cases [0.6%] of nephrotic syndrome) compared to 0.2% of patients treated with placebo plus FOLFIRI. Monitor proteinuria by urine dipstick and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio for the development of worsening of proteinuria during CYRAMZA therapy. Withhold CYRAMZA for urine protein levels that are ≥2 g over 24 hours. Reinitiate CYRAMZA at a reduced dose once the urine protein level returns to <2 g over 24 hours. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for urine protein levels >3 g over 24 hours or in the setting of nephrotic syndrome.
Thyroid Dysfunction

Monitor thyroid function during treatment with CYRAMZA. In study 4, the incidence of hypothyroidism reported as an adverse event was 2.6% in the CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI-treated patients and 0.9% in the placebo plus FOLFIRI-treated patients.
Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Animal models link angiogenesis, VEGF, and VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryofetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CYRAMZA and for at least 3 months after the last dose of CYRAMZA.

Use in Specific Populations

Pregnancy: Based on its mechanism of action, CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm. Animal models link angiogenesis, VEGF, and VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryofetal development, and postnatal development. There are no available data on CYRAMZA use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of ramucirumab on reproduction and fetal development. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk for maintaining pregnancy, risk to the fetus, and risk to newborn and pediatric development, and to use effective contraception during CYRAMZA therapy and for at least 3 months following the last dose of CYRAMZA.
Lactation: Because of the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ramucirumab, advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CYRAMZA.
Females of Reproductive Potential: Advise females of reproductive potential that based on animal data CYRAMZA may impair fertility.
Please see full Prescribing Information for CYRAMZA, including Boxed Warning for hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, and impaired wound healing.

SYMDEKO® will be considered for Australian reimbursement for eligible CF patients aged 12 years and older at the March meeting of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.
“We are delighted that the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia recognized the safety profile and efficacy of SYMDEKO®. This approval brings us one step closer to our future goal of bringing treatment to all people living with CF,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “This new medicine is an especially important treatment option for patients with residual function mutations and those with two copies of the F508del mutation who either never started or discontinued ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor).”
The TGA’s decision is based on results from two pivotal Phase 3 studies, EVOLVE and EXPAND, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2017. Results showed treatment with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor provides benefits across different CF populations, including statistically significant improvements in lung function, as determined by absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1), with a generally well tolerated safety profile and a lack of increased respiratory adverse events compared to placebo. The improvements in lung function showed a mean absolute change in ppFEV1 compared to placebo of 4.0 percentage points (P<0.0001) and 6.8 percentage points (P<0.0001) in EVOLVE and EXPAND respectively. The most common adverse reactions (≥10% incidence) experienced by patients who received tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in pooled, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies were headache and nasopharyngitis.
Tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2018, by Health Canada in June 2018 and by the European Commissionin October 2018.
About Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia.
CF is caused by a defective or missing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF. There are approximately 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene. Some of these mutations, which can be determined by a genetic test, or genotyping test, lead to CF by creating non-working or too few CFTR proteins at the cell surface. The defective function or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cell in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death. The median age of death is in the mid-to-late 20s.
About SYMDEKO® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)
Some mutations result in CFTR protein that is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and that generally does not reach the cell surface. SYMDEKO is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Tezacaftor is designed to address the trafficking and processing defect of the CFTR protein to enable it to reach the cell surface where ivacaftor can increase the amount of time the protein stays open.
U.S. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR SYMDEKO® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) tablets:
SYMDEKO is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation, or who have at least one mutation in the CF gene that is responsive to treatment with SYMDEKO. Patients should talk to their doctor to learn if they have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if SYMDEKO is safe and effective in children under 12 years of age.
Patients should not take SYMDEKO if they take certain medicines or herbal supplements such as: the antibiotics rifampin or rifabutin; seizure medicines such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin; St. John’swort.
Before taking SYMDEKO, patients should tell their doctor if they: have or have had liver problems; have kidney problems; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant because it is not known if SYMDEKO will harm an unborn baby; are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed because it is not known if SYMDEKO passes into breast milk.
SYMDEKO may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how SYMDEKO works. Therefore, the dose of SYMDEKO may need to be adjusted when taken with certain medicines. Patients should especially tell their doctor if they take antifungal medicines such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole; or antibiotics such as telithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin.
SYMDEKO may cause dizziness in some people who take it. Patients should not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything that requires alertness until they know how SYMDEKO affects them.
Patients should avoid food or drink that contains grapefruit or Seville oranges while they are taking SYMDEKO.
SYMDEKO can cause serious side effects, including:
High liver enzymes in the blood, which have been reported in people treated with SYMDEKO or treated with ivacaftor alone. The patient’s doctor will do blood tests to check their liver before they start SYMDEKO, every 3 months during the first year of taking SYMDEKO, and every year while taking SYMDEKO. Patients should call their doctor right away if they have any of the following symptoms of liver problems: pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area; yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes; loss of appetite; nausea or vomiting; dark, amber-colored urine.
Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) in some children and adolescents treated with SYMDEKO or with ivacaftor alone. If the patient is a child or adolescent, their doctor should perform eye examinations before and during treatment with SYMDEKO to look for cataracts.
The most common side effects of SYMDEKO include headache, nausea, sinus congestion, and dizziness.
These are not all the possible side effects of SYMDEKO. Please click here to see the fullU.S.Prescribing Information for SYMDEKO (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) tablets.
About EVOLVE and EXPAND
Data from the two Phase 3 studies EVOLVE and EXPAND were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2017. The studies enrolled approximately 750 people with CF ages 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation or with one F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity. Across both studies, patients treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor experienced statistically significant improvements in lung function, as determined by absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1. The treatment was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) experienced by patients who received tezacaftor/ivacaftor with ivacaftor in the pooled, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies were headache (14% versus 12% on placebo) and nasopharyngitis (12% versus 10% on placebo).

11209,ï»¿Secura Bio Acquires WW Commercialization Rights to Novartis' Farydak for R/R Multiple Myeloma,Secura Bio Acquires Global Rights To Farydak,"Secure Bio to get WW commercialization rights for Farydak (panobinostat) from Novartis to treat patients with r/r multiple myeloma with no prior treatment
 The focus of the acquisition is to expand Secura Bio’s oncology portfolio and develop new product combinations for Farydak
 Farydak (panobinostat, PO) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor & decreases the growth of myeloma cells. On February 23 & August 28, 2015, it has received the FDA’s accelerated approval & EU’s approval for the same indication and is marketed in 53 countries","Secura Bio, Inc. (www.securabio.com), an integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the worldwide commercialization of significant oncology therapies, today announced that it has acquired the global rights to Farydak® (panobinostat) from Novartis.
Farydak® (panobinostat) is a prescription oral medication used in combination with proteasome inhibitors and corticosteroids to treat patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received prior treatments. Farydak is a member of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor family with a very potent and unique mode of action slowing the growth of multiple myeloma cells.
Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, and is the second most common blood cancer with over 160,000 cases diagnosed globally per year, with over 30,000 in the United States. Despite the increased availability of treatments, the disease is characterized by recurrent relapses and remains incurable for most patients leading to approximately 106,000 deaths per year worldwide, over 12,000 of which are in the United States.
On February 23, 2015 Farydak® received FDA accelerated approval for use in patients with multiple myeloma, and on August 28, 2015 it was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the same use. Farydak® has received marketing authorization in 53 countries to date for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.
Secura Bio is dedicated to working with health care professionals to ensure Farydak’s® benefit to patients is well understood by cancer care teams and by ensuring that the medicine is available to those who need it. Secura Bio is also investigating the opportunity to develop new potential dosages and product combinations for Farydak®.
“We are very pleased to acquire worldwide rights to Farydak® as we execute our plan to aggressively build a meaningful, worldwide oncology portfolio,” said Joseph M. Limber, President and CEO of Secura Bio. “Farydak will be a critical cornerstone of our strategy, as it offers a potentially valuable and high-growth treatment option for physicians in their therapeutic regimen for multiple myeloma patients when combined with a variety of other multiple myeloma therapies.”
“Farydak represents an exciting agent with a unique mechanism of action that is part of a promising class of drugs in this setting,” said study investigator Paul Richardson, MD, Clinical Program Leader and Director of Clinical Research, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana–Farber Cancer Institute. “Importantly, Farydak has been shown to improve progression–free survival in relapsed multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior regimens, including bortezomib and an IMiD, which is an area of particular unmet medical need.”
About Farydak® (panobinostat)
Farydak (panobinostat) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDACs at nanomolar concentrations. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones and some non-histone proteins. Inhibition of HDAC activity results in increased acetylation of histone proteins, an epigenetic alteration that results in a relaxing of chromatin, leading to transcriptional activation. In vitro, panobinostat caused the accumulation of acetylated histones and other proteins, inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. Increased levels of acetylated histones were observed in xenografts from mice that were treated with panobinostat. Panobinostat shows more cytotoxicity towards tumor cells compared to normal cells.
About multiple myeloma 

Epigenetics is the cell programming that governs gene expression and cell development. In multiple myeloma, the normal epigenetic process is disrupted (also called epigenetic dysregulation) resulting in the growth of cancerous plasma cells, potential resistance to current treatment, and ultimately disease progression.
Multiple myeloma impacts approximately 81,000 people in the United States. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, a kind of white blood cell present in bone marrow—the soft, blood–producing tissue that fills the center of most bones. The cancer is caused by the production and growth of abnormal cells within the plasma, which multiply and build up in the bone marrow, pushing out healthy cells and preventing them from functioning normally. Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease with a high rate of relapse (when the cancer returns) and resistance (when the therapy stops working), despite currently available treatments. It typically occurs in individuals 60 years of age or older, with few cases in individuals younger than 40.
Farydak® Important Safety Information 
Farydak can cause serious side effects, including diarrhea and heart problems.
Diarrhea is common with Farydak and can be severe. Patients should tell their healthcare provider (HCP) right away if they have abdominal (stomach) cramps, loose stool, diarrhea, or feel like they are becoming dehydrated. HCPs may prescribe medicines to help prevent or treat these side effects. Taking or using stool softeners or laxative medicines may worsen diarrhea, patients should talk to their HCP before taking or using these medicines.
Farydak can cause severe heart problems which can lead to death. Risk of heart problems may be increased with a condition called “long QT syndrome” or other heart problems. Patients should call their HCP and get emergency medical help right away if they have any of the following symptoms of heart problems: chest pain, faster or slower heartbeat, palpitations (feel like heart is racing), feel lightheaded or faint, dizziness, blue colored lips, shortness of breath, or swelling in legs.
Farydak can cause severe bleeding which can lead to death. It may take patients longer than usual to stop bleeding while taking Farydak. Patients should tell their HCP right away if they get any of the following signs of bleeding: blood in stools or black stools (look like tar), pink or brown urine, unexpected bleeding or bleeding that is severe or that cannot be controlled, vomit blood or vomit looks like coffee grounds, cough up blood or blood clots, increased bruising, feeling dizzy or weak, confusion, change in speech, or headache that lasts a long time.
Farydak is a prescription medicine used, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, to treat people with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma after at least two other types of treatment have been tried. It is not known if Farydak is safe and effective in children.
Patients should tell their HCP about all of the medicines they take, including prescription and over–the–counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.
Patients should take Farydak exactly as the HCP tells them to take it. The HCP will tell patients how much Farydak to take and when to take it. The HCP may change the dose or stop treatment temporarily if patients experience side effects. Patients should not change the dose or stop taking Farydak without first talking with their HCP.
Patients should avoid eating star fruit, pomegranate or pomegranate juice, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking Farydak. These foods may affect the amount of Farydak in the blood.
Low blood cell counts are common with Farydak and can be severe. Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) can cause unusual bleeding or bruising under the skin. Low white blood cell count (neutropenia) can cause infections. Low red blood cell count (anemia) may make a patient feel weak, tired, or they may get tired easily, look pale, or feel short of breath.
There is an increased risk of infection while taking Farydak. Patients should contact their HCP right away if they have a fever or have any signs of an infection including sweats or chills, cough, flu–like symptoms, shortness of breath, blood in phlegm, sores on body, warm or painful areas on body, or feeling very tired.
Patients should call their HCP right away with any of the following symptoms of liver problems: feel tired or weak, loss of appetite, dark amber colored urine, upper abdominal pain, yellowing of skin or the white of eyes.
The most common side effects of Farydak include tiredness, nausea, swelling in arms or legs, decreased appetite, fever and vomiting. Patients should tell their HCP if they have any side effect that is bothersome or that does not go away.

11215,ï»¿Akebia Therapeutics Reports Positive Results of Vadadustat in P-III J01 &amp; J03 Studies for Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Japan,Akebia Therapeutics Announces Positive Top-Line Results from Two Pivotal Phase 3 Studies of Vadadustat in Japanese Patients with Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease,"The two P-III J01 & J03 studies involve assessing of Vadadustat vs darbepoetin alfa in 304 & 323 Japanese patients (non- dialysis dependent & dialysis dependent) with anemia due to CKD @52wks.
 The P-III J01 & J03 studies result: met its 1EPs; @20 &24 wks. mean Hb level (11.66 g/dL & 10.61 g/dL vs 11.93 g/dL & 10.65 g/dL); SAEs (13.9% & 13.0% vs 14.4% & 10.6%)
 Vadadustat is an oral HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, co-developed by Akebia & MTPC with its expected NDA filing in Japan in 2019","Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:AKBA) today announced positive top-line results from two phase 3 active-controlled pivotal studies evaluating vadadustat, an investigational oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), in Japanese subjects with anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). These studies were conducted by Akebia’s development and commercialization collaboration partner in Japan, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC). Each study, one in non-dialysis dependent subjects and one in hemodialysis-dependent subjects, met its primary endpoint. In addition, results from two phase 3 single-arm studies conducted by MTPC in peritoneal dialysis subjects and hemodialysis subjects further support vadadustat’s potential in these indications. MTPC expects to submit a Japanese New Drug Application in 2019.
“Collectively, these data provide further confirmation of vadadustat’s potential to meaningfully transform the treatment paradigm for patients with anemia due to CKD,” said John P. Butler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Akebia. “These results add to our dataset demonstrating the potential for vadadustat to effectively manage hemoglobin levels in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent patients, including those who convert from erythropoiesis stimulating agents.”
Top-Line Results from the Pivotal Phase 3 Study in Non-Dialysis Dependent CKD Subjects (J01 Study)
The phase 3 randomized, open-label, active-controlled correction and conversion study assessed the efficacy and safety of vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa, an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA), in 304 Japanese non-dialysis dependent subjects with anemia due to CKD, with a treatment duration of 52 weeks. Data from the planned analysis at 24 weeks are provided. The study met its primary endpoint, with the mean hemoglobin (Hb) level at week 20 and week 24 at 11.66 g/dL (95% CI 11.49, 11.84 g/dL) for vadadustat-treated subjects compared to 11.93 g/dL (95% CI 11.76, 12.10 g/dL) for darbepoetin alfa-treated subjects. The difference in mean Hb was -0.26 g/dL (95% CI -0.50, -0.02 g/dL), achieving the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion of -0.75 g/dL. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 72.2% in the vadadustat-treated group compared to 73.2% in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group. The most common AEs reported in vadadustat-treated subjects were nasopharyngitis (14.6%), diarrhea (10.6%), constipation (5.3%), and contusion (5.3%). The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 13.9% in the vadadustat-treated group compared to 14.4% in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group; no SAE was considered related to study drug. No deaths were reported in the vadadustat-treated group, and one fatal myocardial infarction was reported in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group, which was assessed as not related to study drug.
Top-Line Results from the Pivotal Phase 3 Study in Dialysis-Dependent CKD Subjects (J03 Study)

The phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled conversion study assessed the efficacy and safety of vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa in 323 Japanese hemodialysis subjects with anemia due to CKD who had been receiving ESA therapy prior to study screening, with a treatment duration of 52 weeks. Group level data at 24 weeks from this ongoing double-blind study are provided. The study met its primary endpoint, with the mean Hb level at week 20 and week 24 at 10.61 g/dL (95% CI 10.45, 10.76 g/dL) for vadadustat-treated subjects compared to 10.65 g/dL (95% CI 10.50, 10.80 g/dL) for darbepoetin alfa-treated subjects. The difference in mean Hb was -0.05 g/dL (95% CI -0.26, 0.17 g/dL), achieving the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion of -0.75 g/dL. The incidence of AEs was 89.5% in the vadadustat-treated group compared to 88.2% in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group. The most common AEs reported in vadadustat-treated subjects were nasopharyngitis (19.8%), diarrhea (10.5%), and shunt stenosis (8.0%). The incidence of SAEs was 13.0% in the vadadustat-treated group compared to 10.6% in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group; no SAE was considered related to study drug.
Top-Line Results from Two Phase 3, Single-Arm Studies in Dialysis-Dependent CKD Subjects (J02 Study and J04 Study)

The phase 3 open-label, single-arm J02 study assessed the efficacy and safety of vadadustat in 42 Japanese peritoneal dialysis subjects with anemia due to CKD, with a treatment duration of 24 weeks. The mean Hb level at week 20 and week 24 was 11.35 g/dL (95% CI 10.99, 11.70 g/dL) for vadadustat-treated subjects. Thirty-eight subjects (90.5%) experienced an AE and twelve (28.6%) experienced an SAE. One SAE of fatal myocardial ischemia was assessed as possibly related to vadadustat by the investigator.
The phase 3 open-label, single-arm J04 correction study evaluated the safety and efficacy of vadadustat, with a treatment duration of 24 weeks, in 24 Japanese hemodialysis subjects with anemia due to CKD who had not been receiving ESA therapy prior to study screening or who underwent ESA washout during screening. The mean Hb level at week 20 and week 24 was 10.75 g/dL (95% CI 10.35, 11.14 g/dL) for vadadustat-treated subjects. Twenty-three subjects (95.8%) experienced an AE, and seven (29.2%) experienced an SAE. No SAE was assessed as related to study drug, and no deaths were reported.
Akebia will discuss these findings on its previously announced fourth quarter and full-year 2018 investor update call on Monday, March 18, 2019 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Additional data from the studies are expected be presented by MTPC at an upcoming medical meeting.
In Japan, an estimated 13 million people are afflicted with advanced stages of CKD. Anemia is common in patients with CKD and its prevalence increases as CKD progresses. Injectable ESAs are currently the standard of care. Vadadustat, if approved for marketing, would provide patients with a once-daily oral treatment option and has the potential to set a new standard of care for the treatment of anemia due to CKD.
About Vadadustat
Vadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor currently in global phase 3 development for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease. Vadadustat’s proposed mechanism of action is designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen availability with increased production of HIF, which coordinates the interdependent processes of iron mobilization and erythropoietin production to increase red blood cell production and, ultimately, improve oxygen delivery. Vadadustat is an investigational therapy and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other regulatory authority.

 The focus of the acquisition is to enhance Exatech’s GPS computer-assisted knee replacement system including its Truliant Total Knee System using the XpandOrtho’s ligament balancing technology
 XpandOrtho Technology is a soft tissue intra-articular balancing instrument which uses sensors, based on the bellows system providing surgeon gap balancing feedbacks for total knee arthroplasty and has received FDA’s clearance in 2017","Exactech, a developer and producer of bone and joint restoration products and biologic solutions for extremities, knee, and hip announced today, that it has acquired XpandOrtho, a designer of soft tissue balancing instruments for knee replacement surgery. Exactech plans to incorporate XpandOrtho’s technology to enhance its ExactechGPS® computer-assisted surgery system, the only navigation system that supports both shoulder and knee replacement.
Managing a patient’s soft tissue is an important aspect of knee replacement surgery. XpandOrtho received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 for an electronic, soft tissue balancing instrument for total knee arthroplasty. The intra-articular device uses multiple sensors within the knee joint to guide soft tissue balancing. The device uses a novel pneumatic-based bellows system, which wirelessly communicates with a display to provide the surgeon gap balancing feedback throughout the knee’s range of motion.
According to Exactech CEO David Petty, “The acquisition of XpandOrtho supports Exactech’s growth strategy and commitment to improving surgeon experience and patient outcomes. Their innovative ligament balancing technology provides a strong framework for integration into our ExactechGPS system to further advance our award-winning Truliant® Total Knee System. We look forward to collaborating with XpandOrtho founders Cliff Colwell and Darryl D’Lima on continued development of advanced knee replacement technology.”
Darryl D’Lima M.D., Ph.D., and Clifford W. Colwell, Jr., M.D., report that they feel “privileged to have been purchased by an outstanding orthopaedic device company such as Exactech.” Colwell added, “This allows our technology, which has been in development for more than seven years, to be brought to market for the benefit of surgeons and their patients.”
