27576,Codagenix Collaborates with Serum Institute of India to Co-Develop a Live-Attenuated Vaccine Against Coronavirus (COVID-19),"Codagenix and Serum Institute of India Initiate Co-Development of a Scalable, Live-Attenuated Vaccine Against the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, COVID-19","Codagenix will utilize its deoptimization technology for viral deoptimization, designed several nCoV vaccine candidate genomes, will grow and conduct in-vivo tests of vaccine viruses prior to testing in clinical studies
 The Serum Institute of India will scale up the manufacturing of vaccines to ensure its availability to meet the public needs. The companies are pursuing an accelerated development pathway to speed up the availability of vaccine
 The focus of the collaboration is to develop a live-attenuated vaccine, inducing an immune response to multiple antigens of the virus and enables scale for mass production","FARMINGDALE, N.Y., Feb. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Codagenix, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing prophylactic vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies, today announced a collaboration with the Serum Institute of Indiato rapidly co-develop a live-attenuated vaccine against the emergent coronavirus. There are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for this novel coronavirus, now referred to as COVID-19. A live-attenuated vaccine has multiple advantages, including mounting an immune response to multiple antigens of the virus and the ability to scale for mass production.
Codagenix uses viral deoptimization to synthesize “rationally designed,” live-attenuated vaccines. Codagenix’s technology allows for the rapid generation of multiple vaccine candidates against emerging viruses, starting with only the digital sequence of the viral genome. Thanks to major advances in the speed and quality of genome sequencing in recent years, in addition to open-source data sharing among scientists and public health agencies around the world, the nCoV genome was available to the public in a matter of days after the virus was first isolated. Thanks to the availability of this data, Codagenix has already designed multiple nCoV vaccine candidate genomes using its proprietary deoptimization technology. The vaccine viruses will then be grown and tested in vivo by contracted laboratories suitable for containment, prior to testing in clinical trials.
The Serum Institute of India, a vaccine manufacturer and distributor with a global footprint, will then scale-up the manufacture of the vaccine to ensure its availability to meet a critical public health need. Codagenix and Serum Institute are pursuing an accelerated development pathway with built-in redundancies to increase speed and likelihood of success.
Dr. Adar Poonwalla, the CEO of Serum Institute, commented, “We are very excited for this new partnership with Codagenix and we hope that we can establish a platform dealing with new infectious diseases and outbreaks beginning with the coronavirus epidemic.”
“We are honored to form a collaboration with the Serum Institute, one of the world’s leading vaccine manufacturers. With the Serum Institute’s financial and technical support, we will be able to push a coronavirus vaccine into the clinic on an extremely rapid timeline. Live-attenuated vaccines like the ones developed by Codagenix are ideally suited to outbreak scenarios as they scale rapidly and generally require only modest amounts of active ingredient for each immunization, as compared to inactivated and subunit vaccines. We are proud to be confronting this public health crisis head-on,” said J. Robert Coleman, Ph.D., MBA, CEO of Codagenix.
Glenn Rockman, of Adjuvant Capital, added: “One of the many compelling features of the Codagenix technology is the theoretical ability to rapidly respond to emerging viral threats. We never imagined the Codagenix platform would be tested by a possible pandemic so soon after we invested, but we are nonetheless grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the global nCoV response. The Codagenix team has been working around the clock with our new colleagues at the Serum Institute of India, and both companies are eager to manufacture and test these new vaccine candidates as quickly as possible.”
The newly identified coronavirus causes mild to severe respiratory illness, with symptoms including cough and fever. Until an effective vaccine becomes available, transmission of the virus can be prevented by frequent handwashing and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.

27584,Soligenix's RiVax Receives the US FDA's Fast Track Designation for the Prevention of Ricin Poisoning,"FDA Grants Soligenix ""Fast Track"" Designation for RiVax in the Prevention of Ricin Poisoning","The US FDA has granted FT designation to RiVax (heat stable ricin toxin vaccine) to prevent ricin intoxication. Soligenix will submit BLA for the vaccine on a rolling basis, letting the FDA review sections of the BLA prior to receiving the complete submission
 FDA’s FT designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs and biologics and is granted to the therapy
 RiVax is Soligenix’s heat-stable recombinant subunit vaccine, developed to prevent exposure to ricin toxin, comprising of the genetically altered version of a Ricin Toxin A (RTA) chain containing two mutations that inactivate the toxicity of the ricin molecule","PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Soligenix, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today that its RiVax® (heat stable ricin toxin vaccine) development program for prevention of ricin intoxication has received “Fast Track” designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Fast track is a designation that the FDA reserves for a drug intended to treat a serious or life- threatening condition and one that demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs and biologics. For instance, should events warrant, Soligenix will be eligible to submit a biologics license application (BLA) for RiVax® on a rolling basis, permitting the FDA to review sections of the BLA prior to receiving the complete submission. Additionally, BLAs for fast track development programs ordinarily will be eligible for priority review, which imparts an abbreviated review time of approximately six months.
“We are very pleased to have been granted fast track designation from the FDA to go along with the orphan drug designation previously received,” stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. “We believe that the FDA’s action in granting fast track designation validates the unmet medical need that currently exists for a vaccine providing protection against lethal ricin toxin exposure and for the potential key role RiVax® can serve as a part of the US Strategic National Stockpile.”
The development of RiVax® has been funded through a series of grants from both the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the FDA and ongoing development is sponsored by NIAID contract #HHSN272201400039C. Non-dilutive funding for the development of RiVax® has exceeded $40 million to date.
About Ricin Toxin
Ricin toxin is a lethal plant-derived toxin and potential biological weapon because of its stability and high potency, and the fact that it is readily extracted from by-products of castor oil production. Ricin comes in many forms including powder, mist or pellet. Ricin can also be dissolved in water and other liquids. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the lethal dose in humans is about the size of a grain of salt. Ricin toxin illness causes tissue necrosis and general organ failure leading to death within several days of exposure. Ricin is especially toxic when inhaled. Ricin works by entering cells of the body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die, which is eventually harmful to the entire body.
There are currently no effective treatments for ricin poisoning. The successful development of an effective vaccine against ricin toxin may act as a deterrent against the actual use of ricin as a biological weapon and could be used to vaccinate military personnel and civilian emergency responders at high risk of potential exposure in the event of a biological attack.
About RiVax®
RiVax® is Soligenix’s proprietary heat stable recombinant subunit vaccine developed to protect against exposure to ricin toxin, the threat of which has been highlighted recently in the news with an envelope addressed to President Trump that was thought to contain this potent and potentially lethal toxin. With RiVax®, Soligenix is a world leader in the area of ricin toxin vaccine research.
RiVax® contains a genetically altered version of a Ricin Toxin A (RTA) chain containing two mutations that inactivate the toxicity of the ricin molecule. A Phase 1A clinical trial was conducted with a formulation of RiVax® that did not contain an adjuvant. This trial revealed dose dependent seroconversion as well as lack of toxicity of the molecule when administered intramuscularly to human volunteers. The adjuvant-free formulation of RiVax® induced toxin neutralizing antibodies that lasted up to 127 days after the third vaccination in several individuals.
To increase the longevity and magnitude of toxin neutralizing antibodies, RiVax® was subsequently formulated with an adjuvant of aluminum salts (known colloquially as alum) for a Phase 1B clinical trial. Alum is an adjuvant that is used in many human vaccines, including most vaccines used in infants. The results of the Phase 1B study indicated that alum-adjuvanted RiVax® was safe and well tolerated, and induced greater ricin neutralizing antibody levels in humans than adjuvant-free RiVax®. In animal studies, the alum formulation of RiVax® also induced higher titers and longer-lasting antibodies than the adjuvant-free vaccine. Vaccination with the thermostabilized alum-adjuvanted RiVax® formulation in a large animal model provided 100% protection (p<0.0001) against acute exposure to aerosolized ricin, the most lethal route of exposure for ricin. The protected animals also had no signs of gross lung damage, a serious and enduring ramification with long-term consequences for survivors of ricin exposure. These results are described in a publication available here.
Heat stabilization of RiVax® is achieved with the Company’s proprietary ThermoVax® technology, designed to eliminate the cold-chain production, distribution and storage logistics required for most vaccines. The technology utilizes precise lyophilization of protein immunogens with conventional aluminum adjuvants in combination with secondary adjuvants for rapid onset of protective immunity with the fewest number of vaccinations. By employing ThermoVax® during the final formulation of RiVax®, the vaccine has demonstrated enhanced stability and the ability to withstand temperatures at least as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to one year. These results are described in a publication available here.
The development of RiVax® has been funded through a series of grants from both the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the FDA and ongoing development is sponsored by NIAID contract #HHSN272201400039C. Non-dilutive funding for the development of RiVax® has exceeded $40 million to date. RiVax® is being developed under the FDA “Animal Rule” and potentially would be added to the Strategic National Stockpile and dispensed in the event of a terrorist threat. RiVax® has received orphan drug designation in the US and in Europe.
As a new chemical entity, an FDA approved RiVax® vaccine has the potential to qualify for a biodefense Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which allows the holder accelerated review of a drug application. Approved under the 21st Century Health Cures Act in late 2016, the biodefense PRV is awarded upon approval as a medical countermeasure when the active ingredient(s) have not been otherwise approved for use in any context. PRVs are transferable and can be sold, with sales in recent years in excess of $100 million. When redeemed, PRVs entitle the user to an accelerated review period of six months, saving a median of seven months’ review time as calculated in 2009. However, the FDA must be advised 90 days in advance of the use of the PRV and the use of a PRV is associated with an additional user fee ($2.1 million in 2020).

 The US FDA has granted PR and designated its NDA as sNDA. The sNDA is based on P-II study that demonstrated clinical benefits and was well tolerated in FL patients with EZH2 activating mutations & with wild type EZH2
 Tazverik is a methyltransferase inhibitor indicated to treat patients aged ≥16yrs. with metastatic or LA epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection with its anticipated PDUFA date as Jun 18, 2020","Approval Would Expand TAZVERIK™ Label into Second Indication

PDUFA Target Action Date Scheduled for June 18, 2020

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Epizyme, Inc. (Nasdaq: EPZM), a fully integrated commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel epigenetic therapies, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for filing the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for the accelerated approval of TAZVERIK™ (tazemetostat) for patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. The FDA granted Priority Review and has designated the company’s application as a supplemental NDA (sNDA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 18, 2020. Priority Review is granted to investigational therapies that, if approved, may offer significant improvements in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious condition.
“Follicular lymphoma is an incurable disease for which patients are in need of a safe, durable treatment option,” said Dr. Shefali Agarwal, chief medical officer of Epizyme. “If approved, we believe TAZVERIK could become an important new option for these patients and their physicians. We are thrilled with FDA’s acceptance of our application as an sNDA with Priority Review, for TAZVERIK for patients with relapsed or refractory FL. We look forward to working with the Agency during their review and would like to thank the many patients, caregivers and physicians whose contributions have been invaluable in bringing us to this point.”
“On the heels of our first approval for TAZVERIK for epithelioid sarcoma last month and a successful launch into the market, this sNDA filing acceptance brings us one step closer to providing TAZVERIK to a larger patient population,” said Robert Bazemore, chief executive officer of Epizyme. “The June 2020 PDUFA date positions TAZVERIK for two FDA approvals within six months of each other, which would be a remarkable achievement for Epizyme. We are actively building off our experience with our ES commercial launch, in order to seamlessly expand to an FL launch where we anticipate rapid market adoption, if approved.”
Epizyme’s sNDA submission is based primarily on updated Phase 2 efficacy and safety data for TAZVERIK in this patient population, which were presented at the 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. The data demonstrated that treatment with TAZVERIK resulted in clinical benefit as assessed by both investigators and an Independent Review Committee (IRC), and was shown to be generally well tolerated in FL patients with EZH2 activating mutations (n=45) and FL patients with wild-type EZH2 (n=54).
To support a full approval of TAZVERIK for FL, Epizyme is conducting a single, global, randomized, adaptive trial to evaluate the combination of TAZVERIK with “R2” (Revlimid® plus Rituxan®), an approved chemo-free treatment regimen, for FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 500 FL patients, stratified based on their EZH2 mutation status. The safety run-in portion of the trial is underway, and the company expects to advance into the efficacy portion of the Phase 1b/3 trial in 2020.

The partnership is declared for International Childhood Cancer Day which is a global campaign to raise awareness and for a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by children with cancer, the survivors and their families","PARSIPPANY, N.J. & TEL AVIV, Feb. 14 /CSRwire/ – Global HOPE (Hematology-Oncology Pediatric Excellence), a program of Texas Children’s Hospital, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Direct Relief announced today a donation partnership that will provide access to medications in sub-Saharan Africa—where an overwhelming majority of pediatric cancer and hematology patients do not survive.
Under this partnership, Global HOPE will determine the specific volumes and quantities of medications identified for current patient needs at its clinical sites. Teva will provide essential medications for treating cancer and blood disorders in children to Direct Relief, who will in turn ensure the efficient shipping and delivery of the donated medicines in coordination with Global HOPE facilities.
“The success we’ve had in radically changing the course of pediatric cancer and hematology in sub-Saharan Africa is due in large part to our partners and donors who have made our work possible,” said Dr. David Poplack, Director of Global HOPE. “By partnering with a global leader in generic and specialty medicines like Teva along with Direct Relief’s experience in cold chain logistics, we can have an immediate and sustained impact in low- and middle-income countries where increased access to pediatric oncology treatments is desperately needed.”
Teva will initially support the Global HOPE program in Malawi, with the potential to extend access of donated medicines to other Global HOPE sites across sub-Saharan Africa. Teva’s donation of medicines through this partnership will support the treatment plans for almost 95% of all chemotherapy patients. Over the next five years, Global HOPE anticipates diagnosing and treating close to 4,000 new pediatric cancer patients in Malawi.
“This initiative with Global HOPE and Direct Relief can bring medicines to thousands of children with cancer and blood disorders in African countries,” said Amalia Adler-Waxman, VP Social Impact and Responsibility at Teva. “Supporting this critical supply chain along with our partners allows us to facilitate access to pediatric oncology treatments while laying the groundwork for Global HOPE and others to also potentially treat pediatric illnesses beyond cancer and hematologic disorders.”
As an organization with decades of global supply chain and logistics expertise, Direct Relief will play a leading role in the distribution of donated prescriptions product from Teva. Direct Relief’s shipments of donated medicines from Teva will be shipped to one of the designated local Global HOPE-affiliated NGOs in Malawi, Botswana and Uganda.
“Direct Relief is deeply appreciative to Teva and Global HOPE for their leadership and initiative in providing critical treatments to children in Africa and globally,” said Thomas Tighe, President and CEO of Direct Relief. “Thanks to this collaboration, children who would otherwise be unable to access cancer therapies will be able to receive the treatments they need.”
The partnership was announced for International Childhood Cancer Day. International Childhood Cancer Day is a global collaborative campaign to raise awareness and promote an increased appreciation and deeper understanding of the challenges faced by children and adolescents with cancer, the survivors and their families.

27621,"Merck &amp; Co's Ervebo (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) Receives Approval in Four African Countries","ERVEBO (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) Now Registered in Four African Countries, Within 90 Days of Reference Country Approval and WHO Prequalification'","The Ervebo has received approval in DRC, Burundi, Ghana, and Zambia, following the implementation of the WHO’s Roadmap for introduction & roll‐out of Merck’s rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola virus vaccine in African countries
 The 4 countries have licensed an Ebola vaccine within 90 days after WHO prequalification with its anticipated registration in other African countries in the coming wks. Merck in collaboration with the US govt. WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi will support public health preparedness and response efforts against Zaire ebolavirus disease
 Additionally, Merck will initiate the manufacturing of licensed dosing with its anticipated availability in Q3’20. Ervebo is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in patients aged ≥18yrs.","Democratic Republic of the Congo One of the First African Countries to Register ERVEBO

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today confirmed that four African countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), have approved ERVEBO (pronounced er-VEE-boh). ERVEBO was granted a conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission on November 11, 2019 and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Dec. 20, 2019. In the United States, ERVEBO is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 18 years of age and older. The duration of protection conferred by ERVEBO is unknown. ERVEBO does not protect against other species of Ebolavirus or Marburgvirus. Effectiveness of the vaccine when administered concurrently with antiviral medication, immune globulin (IG), and/or blood or plasma transfusions is unknown.
Approvals by these African countries signify continued, groundbreaking progress in advancing the future of global public health preparedness against Zaire ebolavirusdisease, made possible by the unprecedented collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO), the African Vaccines Regulatory Forum (AVAREF), African governments, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Merck. These approvals were the result of the successful implementation of the WHO’s Roadmap for introduction and roll‐out of Merck rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola virus disease vaccine in African countries. The roadmap, designed to coordinate actions and contributions toward the licensing and roll-out of ERVEBO, helped facilitate near-parallel regulatory reviews and led to the approvals of the vaccine in several at-risk countries within 90 days of WHO prequalification.
“We are grateful for WHO’s leadership in establishing a path forward for expediting the prequalification and licensing of this vaccine in countries at greatest risk,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “This important milestone is one more example of the partnership that has formed in response to the outbreaks. While we are far from finished in the Ebola fight, this milestone shows what can be done when we work together to address the most challenging diseases that threaten people and communities.”
ERVEBO has now been registered by National Health Authorities in the following countries in Africa – DRC, Burundi, Ghana, and Zambia. Approvals in additional countries in Africa are anticipated in the near future.
As previously announced, Merck is working to initiate manufacturing of licensed doses and expects these doses to start becoming available in approximately the third quarter of 2020. Merck is working closely with the United States government, WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance) to plan for how eventual, licensed doses will support future public health preparedness and response efforts against Zaire ebolavirus disease. In the meantime, Merck continues to work urgently with WHO and partners to make investigational Ebola Zaire vaccine (V920) doses available in support of international outbreak response efforts in the DRC and neighboring countries.
Selected Safety Information for ERVEBO
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not administer ERVEBO to individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including rice protein.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Management of Acute Allergic Reactions
Among 15,399 subjects vaccinated with ERVEBO, there were two reports of anaphylaxis. Monitor individuals for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions following vaccination with ERVEBO. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of ERVEBO.
Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness
Vaccination with ERVEBO may not protect all individuals. Vaccinated individuals should continue to adhere to infection control practices to prevent Zaire ebolavirusinfection and transmission.
Immunocompromised Individuals
The safety and effectiveness of ERVEBO have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals. The effectiveness of ERVEBO in immunocompromised individuals may be diminished. The risk of vaccination with ERVEBO, a live virus vaccine, in immunocompromised individuals should be weighed against the risk of disease due to Zaire ebolavirus.
Transmission
Vaccine virus RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in blood, saliva, urine, and fluid from skin vesicles of vaccinated adults. Transmission of vaccine virus is a theoretical possibility.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The clinical development program for ERVEBO included clinical studies conducted in North America, Europe and Africa, in which a total of 15,399 adults received a dose of ERVEBO. The total number of subjects vaccinated with ERVEBO in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was 1,712 and in open label trials was 13,687.
The most common injection-site adverse reactions reported by subjects taking ERVEBO in Study 1 (N=500) were injection-site pain (34.0%) and redness/swelling (2%). The most common injection-site adverse reactions reported by subjects taking ERVEBO in Study 2 (N=1051) were injection-site pain (70.0%), swelling (17%), and redness (12%).
The most common systemic adverse reactions reported following vaccination with ERVEBO in Study 1 (N=498) were headache (37%), feverishness (34%), muscle pain (33%), fatigue (19%), nausea (8%), joint pain/tenderness (7%), rash (4%), and abnormal sweating (3%). The most common systemic adverse reactions reported following vaccination with ERVEBO in Study 2 (N=1051) were joint pain (18%), arthritis (5%), rash (4%), and vesicular lesions (2%).
Arthralgia was reported to occur in 7% to 40% of vaccine recipients in blinded, placebo-controlled studies. Severe arthralgia, defined as preventing daily activity, was reported in up to 3% of subjects.
Arthritis (including events of arthritis, joint effusion, joint swelling, osteoarthritis, monoarthritis or polyarthritis) was reported to occur in 0% to 24% of subjects in blinded, placebo-controlled studies in which subjects received ERVEBO or a lower dose formulation, with all but one study reporting arthritis in <5% of subjects. Most occurrences of arthritis were reported within the first few weeks following vaccination, were of mild to moderate intensity, and resolved within several weeks after onset. In one study conducted in Switzerland (Study 5, NCT02287480), 102 subjects received ERVEBO or a lower dose formulation. In this study, arthritis was reported to occur in 24% of subjects and severe arthritis, defined as preventing daily activity, in 12% of subjects.
Rash was reported to occur after administration of ERVEBO in blinded, placebo-controlled studies, with all but one study reporting rash in <9% of subjects. In Study 5, rash was reported to occur in 25% (n=4) of ERVEBO recipients and 7.7% (n=1) of placebo recipients.
White blood cell counts were assessed in 697 subjects who received ERVEBO. Decreases in lymphocytes were reported in up to 85% of subjects and decreases in neutrophils were reported in up to 43% of subjects. No associated infections were reported.
Among 15,399 ERVEBO recipients, two serious adverse reactions of pyrexia were reported as vaccine-related. In addition, two serious adverse reactions of anaphylaxis were reported as vaccine-related. None of these serious adverse reactions were fatal.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Interference with Laboratory Tests
Following vaccination with ERVEBO, individuals may test positive for anti-Ebola glycoprotein (GP) antibody and/or Ebola GP nucleic acid or antigens. GP-based testing may have limited diagnostic value during the period of vaccine viremia, in the presence of vaccine-derived Ebola GP, and following antibody response to the vaccine.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Pregnancy
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ERVEBO in pregnant women, and human data available from clinical trials with ERVEBO are insufficient to establish the presence or absence of vaccine-associated risk during pregnancy.
The decision to vaccinate a woman who is pregnant should consider the woman’s risk of exposure to Zaire ebolavirus.
Lactation
Human data are not available to assess the impact of ERVEBO on milk production, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breastfed child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ERVEBO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ERVEBO or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine.
Geriatric Use
Clinical studies of ERVEBO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
More About the Development of the Vaccine
ERVEBO, known as V920 in its investigational phase, was initially engineered by scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory and the technology was subsequently licensed by a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics Corporation. In late 2014, when the Ebola outbreak in western Africa was at its peak, and with the goal of applying its capabilities in process research, clinical development, and manufacturing to an important global effort, Merck acquired the rights to develop V920 from NewLink Genetics. Since that time, the company has worked closely with a diverse range of external collaborators to enable a broad clinical development program with partial funding from the U.S. government, including the Department of Health and Human Service’s Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) and the Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Program (DTRA) and Joint Vaccination Acquisition Program (JVAP). Beginning in 2015 Merck began manufacturing the emergency-use supplies that have been used to support outbreak response efforts prior to availability of licensed doses in collaboration with Gavi. Merck’s ongoing V920 vaccine supply replenishment activities are supported by partial Federal funding from BARDA under Contract No. HHSO100201700012C. Merck has been responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and regulatory efforts in support of V920. The company has committed to working closely with other stakeholders to accelerate the continued development, production and availability of the vaccine.

27629,PharmaMar and Jazz Receive the US FDA's Priority Review Acceptance of Lurbinectedin's NDA for Patients with Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer,PharmaMar and Jazz Pharmaceuticals Announce FDA Acceptance and Priority Review of New Drug Application for Lurbinectedin in Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer,"The US FDA has accepted NDA filing with PR seeking accelerated approval for lurbinectedin to treat patients with SCLC having diseases progression following the prior treatment of platinum-containing therapy
 The NDA submission is based on P-II monotherapy basket study assessing lurbinectedin in 105 patients with SCLC at 39 centers across the US & EU that resulted in meeting its 1EPs of ORR
 Lurbinectedin (PM1183) is a selective inhibitor of the oncogenic transcription programs on which tumors are dependent, with its anticipated PDUFA date as of Aug 16, 2020. In Dec’2019, PharmaMar and Jazz signed an exclusive license for lurbinectedin, which became effective in Jan’2020, granting US commercial rights of the therapy to the Jazz","Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date set for August 16, 2020.

MADRID and DUBLIN, Feb. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — PharmaMar (MSE:PHM) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) announce that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for filing with Priority Review the New Drug Application (NDA) seeking accelerated approval for lurbinectedin for the treatment of patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) who have progressed after prior platinum-containing therapy. The FDA has set a PDUFA target action date of August 16, 2020.
PharmaMar submitted the NDA to FDA in December 2019 based on data from the Phase II monotherapy basket trial, which included evaluation of lurbinectedin for the treatment of relapsed SCLC. A total of 105 patients from 39 centers were recruited in Europe and the United States. The trial met its primary endpoint of the Objective Response Rate (ORR) and the results were presented at the 55th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in June 2019.
The FDA’s accelerated approval pathway allowed for the submission of an NDA based on the results of Phase II drug investigations for the treatment of serious diseases that address an unmet medical need. There remains a critical unmet need for patients with relapsed SCLC, as the treatment landscape has not changed substantially in more than two decades since the last new chemical entity, topotecan, was approved.
As previously announced in December 2019, PharmaMar and Jazz Pharmaceuticals have entered into an exclusive license agreement, which became effective in January 2020, granting Jazz U.S. commercialization rights to lurbinectedin.
About Lurbinectedin
Lurbinectedin (PM1183) is a synthetic compound currently under clinical investigation. It is a selective inhibitor of the oncogenic transcription programs on which many tumors are particularly dependent. Together with its effect on cancer cells, lurbinectedin inhibits oncogenic transcription in tumor-associated macrophages, downregulating the production of cytokines that are essential for the growth of the tumor. Transcriptional addiction is an acknowledged target in those diseases, many of them lacking other actionable targets.

The corresponding abstract and presentation were selected as one of the Highlights of ECCO at this year’s congress
February 14, 2020 10:04 AM Eastern Standard Time
VIENNA–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Celltrion Healthcare today announced new 1-year data from a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety of CT-P13 subcutaneous (SC) formulation compared to the CT-P13 intravenous (IV) formulation in patients with active Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Results presented at The European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) 2020 annual congress in Vienna, Austria demonstrated that the SC formulation of CT-P13 was comparable to the IV formulation of CT-P13 in terms of efficacy and safety throughout the 1-year treatment period.1
In the study, 131 patients were randomised at the maintenance phase (66 to the SC arm and 65 to the IV arm), of whom 105 (80.2%) patients completed the week 54 visit (55 in the SC arm and 50 in the IV arm). After loading doses of IV 5mg/kg at weeks 0 and 2, patients were randomised at week 6 to receive either SC 120 mg (<80kg) or 240 mg (≥80 kg) every 2 weeks in the SC arm, or continued on IV 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks in the IV arm. From week 30 onwards, the IV 5 mg/kg group were switched to either SC 120 or 240 mg based on the patients’ body weight.1
Professor Shomron Ben-Horin, MD, Department of Gastroenterology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Israel, and one of the lead investigators of the trial said, “the 1-year results including switching results show a comparable efficacy and safety profile between CT-P13 SC and IV. These observations support the world’s first infliximab SC formulation as a viable therapeutic agent to expand patients’ treatment options.” Professor Ben-Horin added, “It is exciting to hear that the abstract has been selected as one of the Highlights of ECCO and I highly anticipate the approval decision for the inflammatory bowel disease indication in the coming months.”
The study showed that the mean CDAI and partial Mayo scores decreased over time in both arms until week 30, while comparable improvement in clinical activity was observed at week 54 – after switching the remaining IV patients to SC. The rates of clinical response and remission at week 54 were maintained, and the rate of mucosal healing in CD and UC combined was further improved at week 54. Furthermore, after switching the mean pre-dose serum concentrations in the IV arm increased to a comparable level as the SC arm, and maintained consistent levels until week 54. The overall safety profile during the maintenance phase, and on or after week 30, were comparable between both the SC and IV arms.1
The results were presented as part of oral presentation ‘OP24: A novel subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13): 1-year results including switching results from intravenous infliximab (CT-P13) in patients with active Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis’, which was selected for inclusion in the Highlights of ECCO by organisers.
“CT-P13 SC (Remsima® SC) is the first and only subcutaneous infliximab to be available in Europe offering patients who are starting or switching anti-TNF-α therapy with the proven benefits of infliximab in a more convenient form. Starting with Germany, we have started launching the new subcutaneous infliximab country by country by establishing local operations across major European countries, building our commercial capabilities and strengthening our relationships with stakeholders across these markets” said Mr. Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare.
Celltrion is seeking approval for the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) indication for CT-P13 SC (Remsima® SC) in mid-2020, following EU marketing authorisation for the treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis in late 2019.

Notes to editors:
About inflammatory bowel disease
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic disabling gastrointestinal disorders that impact every aspect of a patient’s life.2 They affect an estimated 5 million people globally;3 IBDs account for substantial costs to the healthcare system and society; the direct healthcare costs of IBDs are estimated to be €4.6-5.6 billion per year.4
About CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab)5,6,7
CT-P13 is developed and manufactured by Celltrion, Inc. and was the world’s first monoclonal antibody biosimilar approved by the European Commission (EC). It is indicated for the treatment of eight autoimmune diseases including RA and IBD. It was approved by the EC under the trade name Remsima® in September 2013 and launched in major EU countries in early 2015. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved CT-P13 in April 2016 under the trade name Inflectra®. CT-P13 is approved in more than 94 countries (as of February 2020) including the US, Canada, Japan and throughout Europe.
CT-P13 IV is usually given as 3mg per kg/body weight in RA and as 5mg per kg/body weight for the other indications. Infliximab IV is given as an infusion over two hours. All patients are monitored for any reactions during the infusion and for at least one to two hours afterwards. Celltrion has also developed a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of infliximab that has three administration options; via a pre-filled pen (auto injector), pre-filled syringe or pre-filled syringe with needle safeguard. The SC formulation has the potential to enhance treatment options for the use of infliximab biosimilar by providing high consistency in drug exposure and a convenient method of administration.
CT-P13 SC has received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and EU marketing authorisation for the treatment of people with RA. Celltrion has submitted a further variation to the marketing authorisation of CT-P13 SC to extend the indication to other disease areas including inflammatory bowel disease. In the United States, Remsima® SC will be reviewed through the new drug pathway with the expectation of receiving US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval by 2022.

 The two P-III studies resulted in meeting its 1EPs i.e. gain in BCVA @48wks., it demonstrated superior resolution of retinal fluid (IRF/SRF) (for 6mg (31% & 26% vs 45% & 44%), superfluid resolution @16wks. & 1yr., maintenance of 3mos. dosing interval @1yr. (56% & 51%) respectively
 Beovu (RTH258) is the only anti-VEGF therapy approved in the EU for wet AMD offering the option to start eligible patients on 3mos. dosing intervals immediately after the loading phase. The approval is applicable to all 27 EU states including the UK, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein","Beovu (brolucizumab) is the only anti-VEGF treatment approved in Europe for wet AMD that offers the option to start eligible patients on three-month dosing intervals immediately after the loading phase1
 

For the more than 20 million people worldwide who are living with wet AMD, frequent injections are a common reason patients drop off existing treatments2-4
 

Approval is based on two head-to-head clinical trials, HAWK and HARRIER, in which Beovu achieved robust vision gains that were non-inferior to aflibercept at year one (primary endpoint)1,5
 

Beovu also demonstrated superior fluid resolution versus aflibercept at week 16 and year one (secondary endpoints)1,5
 
Basel, February 17, 2020 – Novartis today announced the European Commission (EC) has approved Beovu® (brolucizumab) injection for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Beovu is the first EC-approved anti-VEGF treatment to demonstrate superior resolution of retinal fluid (IRF/SRF), a key marker of disease activity, versus aflibercept (secondary endpoints)1,5. Beovu also offers the ability to start eligible wet AMD patients on a three-month dosing interval immediately after the loading phase1,5. The EC decision is applicable to all 27 European Union member states as well as the UK, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
 
“Currently, wet AMD patients, who are often older, can face significant challenges in managing their disease. We believe that Beovu, and its ability to resolve fluid, brings great therapeutic value that will help physicians optimize treatments for patients based on disease activity,” said Marie-France Tschudin, President Novartis Pharmaceuticals. “With the approval of this innovative biologic, Novartis is continuing to reimagine medicine for people living with wet AMD.”
 
“Drying the retina is one of the main goals in the treatment of wet AMD with anti-VEGF therapy,” said Frank Holz, MD, FEBO, FARVO, Professor and Chairman, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany. “Beovu, with its superior fluid resolution as demonstrated in the HAWK and HARRIER trials, will provide physicians with a new option to treat wet AMD.”
 
Wet AMD is a chronic, degenerative eye disease caused by an excess of VEGF, a protein that promotes the growth of abnormal blood vessels underneath the macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision6,7. The disease is a leading cause of severe vision loss and blindness in people over age 65, affecting more than 20 million people worldwide3,4,8. In the EU, an estimated 1.7 million people are affected by wet AMD9. Early symptoms of wet AMD include blurry or wavy vision7. As the disease progresses, patients lose central vision, making it difficult to see objects directly in front of them7.
 
The EC approval was based on findings from the Phase III HAWK and HARRIER clinical trials, in which Beovu met the primary endpoint, demonstrating gains in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) that were non-inferior to aflibercept at year one (week 48)1,5. Vision gains at year one were maintained at year two1,5.
 
In fluid-related secondary endpoints, Beovu outperformed aflibercept1,5. Significantly fewer patients had intra-retinal and/or sub-retinal fluid (IRF/SRF), two fluids which may disrupt the normal retinal structure and cause damage to the macula (31% for brolucizumab 6 mg vs. 45% for aflibercept in HAWK; 26% vs. 44%, respectively, in HARRIER at year one)1,5,10. Additionally, Beovu showed superior reductions in central subfield thickness, another indicator of retinal fluid, at week 16 and at year one1,5. Differences seen at year one were maintained at year two1,5. In both trials, 30% fewer patients had signs of disease activity with Beovu versus aflibercept as early as week 1611.
 
In HAWK and HARRIER, over half of patients were maintained on the three-month dosing interval (56% in HAWK and 51% in HARRIER) at year one1,5. The remaining patients in the study were treated on a two-month dosing interval1,5.
 
“Today’s approval is a step forward for patients in Europe who have been looking for a new treatment option which may help them maintain their sight — and their independence — for longer,” said Christina Fasser, President, Retina International. “This can really help to alleviate a burden, not only on the patient themselves, but also on those who care for them.”
 
In October 2019, Novartis received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Beovu for the treatment of wet AMD12. Beovu received Swissmedic approval in Switzerland13 and Australian TGA approval14 in January 2020, both for the treatment of wet AMD. Novartis is committed to bringing Beovu to patients worldwide, and additional regulatory filings are currently underway in Canada, Japan and Brazil.
 
About Beovu (brolucizumab)
Beovu (brolucizumab, also known as RTH258) is the most clinically advanced humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv)5,15. Single-chain antibody fragments are highly sought after in drug development due to their small size, enhanced tissue penetration, rapid clearance from systemic circulation and drug delivery characteristics15-17.
 
The proprietary innovative structure results in a small molecule (26 kDa) with potent inhibition of, and high affinity to, all VEGF-A isoforms16. Beovu is engineered to deliver the highest concentration of drug, providing more active binding agents than other anti-VEGFs5,15. In preclinical studies, Beovu inhibited activation of VEGF receptors through prevention of the ligand-receptor interaction16-18. Increased signaling through the VEGF pathway is associated with pathologic ocular angiogenesis and retinal edema19. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and suppress endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability19.
 
About the HAWK and HARRIER studies
With more than 1,800 patients across nearly 400 centers worldwide, HAWK (NCT02307682) and HARRIER (NCT02434328) are the first and only global head-to-head trials in patients with wet AMD that prospectively demonstrated efficacy at week 48 using an innovative q12w/q8w regimen, with a majority of patients on q12w immediately following the loading phase5. Both studies are 96-week prospective, randomized, double-masked multi-center studies and part of the Phase III clinical development of Beovu5. The studies were designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of brolucizumab 6 mg (HAWK and HARRIER) and 3 mg (HAWK only) versus aflibercept 2 mg in patients with wet AMD5.
 
About wet age-related macular degeneration
Wet AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss and legal blindness in people over the age of 65 in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia, impacting an estimated 20 million people worldwide3,4,8. Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision7,20,21. These blood vessels are fragile and leak fluid, disrupting the normal retinal architecture and ultimately causing damage to the macula7,20,21.
 
Early symptoms of wet AMD include distorted vision (or metamorphopsia) and difficulties seeing objects clearly22. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential21. As the disease progresses, cell damage increases, further reducing vision quality7. This progression can lead to a complete loss of central vision, leaving the patient unable to read, drive or recognize familiar faces and potentially depriving them of their independence7,23. Without treatment, vision can rapidly deteriorate24.

 The two approaches include the development of DNA vaccine by Zydus’ VTC and a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vectored vaccine by Zydus’ Etna Biotech to combat COVID
 Zydus’ manufacturing facilities for producing recombinant antigens and measles-containing vaccines will enable rapid ramping up of the production for both vaccine candidates, once the proof-of-concept is established","Adopting a two-pronged approach, a DNA based vaccine and a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vectored vaccine to combat the virus
Ahmedabad, India, 15 February 2020
Zydus Cadila, an innovation-driven, global pharmaceutical company, announced that it has initiated an accelerated research programme with multiple teams in India and Europe developing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) based on two approaches.
The first approach deals with development of a DNA vaccine against the major viral membrane protein responsible for the cell entry of the novel coronavirus, now called COVID19. The plasmid DNA would be introduced into the host cells, where it would be translated
into the viral protein and elicit a strong immune response mediated by the cellular and humoral arms of the human immune system, which play a vital role in protection from disease as well as viral clearance.
The second approach deals with development of a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vectored vaccine against COVID-19. The recombinant measles virus (rMV) produced by reverse genetics would express codon-optimised proteins of the novel coronavirus and will induce long-term specific neutralizing antibodies, which will provide protection from the infection.
Speaking on the development, Chairman of the Zydus Group, Mr. Pankaj R. Patel said,
“There is an urgent and pressing need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine that can prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Our researchers are working to bring a speedy solution to this most devastating outbreak in recent times.”
The group’s Vaccine Technology Centre in India which is working on the plasmid DNA vaccine also has wide ranging capabilities in developing and manufacturing different vaccines for unmet needs. The group was the first to develop and indigenously manufacture
the vaccine to combat Swine Flu during outbreak in 2010. The group’s research arm in Europe, Etna Biotech is working on measles reverse genetics technology which has been used earlier to successfully develop the SARS-vaccine. The vaccines developed through this platform are safe, efficacious and large doses can be manufactured for which Zydus already has production facilities in place.
The company’s robust manufacturing facilities for producing recombinant antigens and measles containing vaccines would enable rapid ramping up of the production for both vaccine candidates, once the proof-of-concept is established.
The Novel Coronavirus outbreak which started in December 2019 has so far infected over 67000 people and has claimed over 1500 lives.

 The approval is based on a clinical study assessing Voltaren Arthritis Pain in patients with OA in hand & knee supporting the original prescription approval. The study demonstrated the onset of pain relief beginning as early as 1wk.
 Following the approval, Voltaren Arthritis Pain becomes the first and only prescription-strength, NSAID topical gel for arthritis pain to be available as OTC in the US","First and only prescription strength NSAID gel for arthritis pain to be available OTC
Warren, New Jersey, USA
GlaxoSmithKline (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Voltaren Arthritis Pain (diclofenac sodium topical gel, 1% (NSAID)- arthritis pain reliever) as an over-the-counter (OTC) product for the temporary relief of arthritis pain in the hand, wrist, elbow, foot, ankle or knee in adults (18 years and older). With the FDA’s approval, Voltaren Arthritis Pain becomes the first and only prescription strength, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) topical gel for arthritis pain available OTC in the United States.
Voltaren Gel, which GSKCH owns the rights to, is currently only available with a prescription in the US. Today’s OTC approval of Voltaren Arthritis Pain will provide the nearly 30 million Americans with osteoarthritis[i] over-the-counter access to this topical treatment option.
Franck Riot, Head of R&D, GSK Consumer Healthcare said: “For the millions of people around the world living with arthritis, joint pain and stiffness are daily realities. At GSK, we are committed to improving the quality of life of these people and today’s approval is progress towards this, providing consumers in the US with increased access to an effective, proven arthritis pain relief option. Voltaren is currently the number 1 OTC topical pain relief brand globally, and we look forward to expanding its availability in the US.”
Dr. Roy Altman, Professor of Medicine in Rheumatology at UCLA said: “Osteoarthritis treatment guidelines from several international and United States medical societies, including the 2019 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) endorse the early use of topical NSAIDs for treating arthritis pain of the knee and hand. In contrast to prior guidelines, the recommendations are inclusive of all age groups, not just the elderly.”
In addition, the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) recently updated and expanded their guidelines for non-surgical management of OA by developing patient-focused treatment recommendations. These updated guidelines strongly recommend topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for individuals with knee OA. Of the non-core interventions assessed as part of this guideline update, topical NSAIDs were recommended more strongly than all oral analgesics due to favorable balance of consistent efficacy and minor transient side effects[ii].
The submission in support of today’s approval of Voltaren Arthritis Pain was based on clinical data in hand and knee OA supporting the original prescription approval. The data demonstrated a consistent and appreciable onset of pain relief beginning as early as week 1 (as evidenced by appreciable improvements in pain symptoms across multiple pre-specified endpoints).
About Voltaren Arthritis Pain

About osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. OA occurs when the cartilage between joints begins to break down and wear away, resulting in joint pain and stiffness. OA occurs more frequently with age, and the pain can gradually worsen over time. The most common symptoms associated with OA include joint pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion.

 Veyonda (bid for 10 days) is a suppository dosage form of idronoxil and inhibitor of S1P and enhances the effect of Lutetium-PSMA (Lu-PSMA) in men with advanced PC","• New clinical alliance with GenesisCare to offer combined therapy of Veyonda® and 177Lu-PSMA
177Lu-PSMA is used as a treatment for late stage prostate cancer patients
• Both agents to be offered in a compassionate use program in Australia
• Combination therapy may be beneficial in boosting the response to 177Lu-PSMA
Sydney, 18th February 2020: Noxopharm (ASX: NOX) is pleased to announce a clinical alliancewith oncology services provider GenesisCare to offer a compassionate access program with Noxopharm’s novel lead product candidate, Veyonda®, for patients with advanced, treatmentresistant, metastatic prostate cancer (mCRPC) being treated with theranostics. The alliance formalises a program under which Noxopharm has been making Veyonda® available through GenesisCare for compassionate use in combination with 177Lu-PSMA therapy for mCRPC patients in Australia. Following promising clinical outcomesfrom the compassionate use program
and early clinical research, the two companies have formalised an arrangement to make the therapy available for use in patients with few treatment alternatives.
GenesisCare is one of the largest private providers of oncology services in Australia and Europe, offering a range of treatments including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, palliative radiation and nuclear medicine (theranostics). Professor Nat Lenzo, Clinical Director of Theranostics at GenesisCare and Clinical Professor at Curtin University said: “Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Australia, yet treatment options for advanced metastatic prostate cancer remain limited. Theranostics is
offering new hope for late stage prostate cancer patients, many of whom have exhausted conventional treatment options such as chemotherapy. While further studies are required, we are seeing encouraging results from the combination of Lu-PSMA and Veyonda® in select patients requiring additional treatment effects and are grateful for Noxopharm’s support to increase
access to this combined therapy for suitable patients.”

About 177Lu-PSMA
PSMA is a protein (prostate surface membrane antigen) expressed on prostate cancer cells in about 85-90% of men with mCRPC. In management of advanced prostate cancer, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based compounds (ligands), 68Gallium PSMA and 177Lutetium PSMA, are the most commonly used ‘theranostic pair’ for detection and treatment of metastatic
disease respectively. The PSMA protein is over-expressed on prostate cancer cells and has been the subject of numerous studies highlighting its suitability as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent. 177Lutetium is a radioisotope used in prostate cancer due its physical properties which facilitate tumour tissue death while avoiding unwanted effects on healthy tissue.
About Veyonda®
Veyonda® is a suppository dosage form of idronoxil, a first-in-class inhibitor of sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P). S1P is a key secondary messenger in cells, with dual roles of activating major pro-survival signalling pathways, and regulating immune cell trafficking in tissues. Many solid cancers over-express S1P, supporting unregulated tumour growth and suppressing immune cell populations and activities in tumours. By inhibiting this over-expression, idronoxil acts as both a radio-sensitiser and chemo-sensitiser, and as an immunotherapy, intended to restore immune function to tumours.
About the Compassionate Use Program
In Australia, access to emerging theranostics treatment such as 177Lu-PSMA and Veyonda® are via active clinical trials or with authorisation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Special Access Scheme (SAS), a scheme for compassionate access to medicines prior to their registration.

 HeadaTerm is a wearable anti-migraine device that utilizes electrical stimulation to target CNS’pain receptors by releasing pain-countering neurotransmitters. HeadaTerm’s TENS therapy is the fast-acting and effective treatment of acute migraine","WAT Medical is thrilled to announce the newest clinical study conducted for the anti-migraine device: HeadaTerm, which has demonstrated its clinical effectiveness at treating migraine. The Headaterm TENS device was shown to decrease pain at an 11.8% better rate than many acute migraine medications.
The blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted by Dr. Nihat M. Hokenek and his team at the Emergency Department of Kartal Dr. Lütfi Kirdar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.
The patients were divided into 2 groups: a sham group, and a verum group. Patients in the Verum group include those who used the device for the first time. Both groups were provided with visually indistinguishable devices. Each underwent therapy for a total of 20 minutes. Using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the patients’ perceived changes in pain intensity were recorded at the 20- and 120-minute marks after therapy initiation. After 120 minutes, patients’ individual needs for additional treatment were assessed. Additionally, their self-reported comfort levels were assessed using a Likert-type verbal scale.
Among the 151 patients who were assessed after being admitted to the emergency ward, the sham and verum group were each assigned with 39 patients from this pool. The VAS change for the verum group from 0 to 120 minutes was -65.46 ± 25.11, and for the sham group, it was -9.46 ± 2.61 (p <0.001). Verbal scores in the 120-minute mark were found to be 1.2 for sham group and 4.5 for the verum group (p <0.001). 30 patients (76.92%) in the sham group and 1 (2%) in the verum group had additional analgesic requirement after 120 minutes.
The study concluded that TENS therapy conducted by HeadaTerm is a fast-acting and effective treatment of acute migraine.

 Vyndaqel (tafamidis, 61mg) & Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine, 20 mg) are oral transthyretin stabilizers, stabilizing the tetramer of the transthyretin transport protein and slowing the formation of amyloid and is the first therapy to treat ATTR-CM and stage 1 ATTR-PN in the EU","February 18, 2020
—VYNDAQEL is the only EC-approved medicine proven to reduce mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in adults with wild-type or hereditary ATTR-CM—

—VYNDAQEL is the first approved medicine in the EU to treat both ATTR-CM and stage 1 symptomatic transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN)—

NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved VYNDAQEL®(tafamidis), a once-daily 61 mg oral capsule, for the treatment of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). VYNDAQEL is the first and only treatment approved in the European Union (EU) for patients with ATTR-CM. Prior to this approval, treatment options for patients with ATTR-CM were restricted to symptom management, and, in rare cases, heart (or heart and liver) transplant.
“Until today, there were no approved medicines to treat patients with ATTR-CM in the EU. Today’s approval represents incredible progress for these patients and reflects our steadfast commitment to delivering breakthrough medicines to rare disease patients,” said Paul Levesque, Global President, Pfizer Rare Disease. “Additionally, with today’s milestone, VYNDAQEL is now the first treatment to have two formulations approved in the EU to treat manifestations of transthyretin amyloidosis: one for cardiomyopathy, and one for stage 1 polyneuropathy.”
ATTR-CM is a rare, underdiagnosed and life-threatening disease characterized by the buildup of abnormal deposits of misfolded protein called amyloid in the heart and is defined by restrictive cardiomyopathy and progressive heart failure. Once diagnosed, the median life expectancy in patients with ATTR-CM, dependent on sub-type, is approximately two to 3.5 years.
“Before today, the European transthyretin amyloidosis community had a dire need for new therapeutic options that can improve outcomes for patients with cardiomyopathy,” said Thibaud Damy, MD, coordinator of the French Referral Centers for Cardiac Amyloidosis and past president of the French Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy group, French Society of Cardiology. “VYNDAQEL represents a major advance for patients, as it can significantly reduce all-cause mortality and the frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with wild-type or hereditary ATTR-CM.”
The EC approval of VYNDAQEL is based on results from the Phase 3 ATTR-ACT study, the first and only completed global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate a pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of ATTR-CM. The study compared patients who received an oral daily dose of 20 mg or 80 mg of tafamidis meglumine compared to those who received placebo.
In the primary analysis of the study, VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine) demonstrated a significant reduction in the hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalisations compared to placebo over a 30-month period in patients with wild-type or hereditary ATTR-CM (p=0.0006). Additionally, individual components of the primary analysis demonstrated a relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization of 30% (p=0.026) and 32% (p<0.0001), respectively, with VYNDAQEL versus placebo.
VYNDAQEL also had significant and consistent treatment effects compared to placebo on functional capacity and health status first observed at six months and continuing through 30 months. Specifically, VYNDAQEL reduced the decline in performance on the six-minute walk test (p<0.0001) and reduced the decline in health status as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire – Overall Summary score (p<0.0001).
VYNDAQEL was well tolerated in this study, with an observed safety profile comparable to placebo. The frequency of adverse events in patients treated with VYNDAQEL was generally similar and comparable to placebo. The approval is also based on findings from an evaluation of the free acid form of tafamidis 61 mg, which demonstrated that one 61 mg capsule of tafamidis free acid corresponds to an 80 mg tafamidis meglumine dose (4 x 20 mg capsules). The safety of the 61 mg dose was not evaluated in ATTR-ACT. The tafamidis 61 mg capsule was developed for patient convenience to enable a single capsule for daily administration.
In 2011, the tafamidis meglumine 20 mg capsule formulation of VYNDAQEL was approved in the EU for transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) to delay peripheral neurologic impairment.
About ATTR Amyloidosis
ATTR amyloidosis is rare, progressive disease characterized by the abnormal buildup of amyloid deposits composed of misfolded transthyretin protein in the body’s organs and tissues. ATTR amyloidosis can impact numerous organs and tissues in the body, including the peripheral nervous system, and organs such as the heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and eyes. ATTR-CM and ATTR-PN are two presentations of the disease.
ATTR-CM affects the heart and leads to restrictive cardiomyopathy and progressive heart failure. There are two sub-types of ATTR-CM: hereditary, which is caused by a mutation in the transthyretin gene and can occur in people as early as their 50s and 60s; or the wild-type form which is associated with aging, and is thought to be more common, usually affecting men after age 60. Often ATTR-CM is diagnosed only after symptoms have become severe.
ATTR-PN results from a genetic mutation of the transthyretin gene causing amyloid fibrils to form in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. ATTR-PN typically occurs during active adult years with onset as early as the 30s in some patients, followed by disease progression that may reach the terminal stage in approximately 10 years on average from disease onset.
About VYNDAQEL (tafamidis 61 mg) and VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine 20 mg)
VYNDAQEL (tafamidis 61 mg) and VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine 20 mg) are oral transthyretin stabilizers that selectively bind to transthyretin, stabilizing the tetramer of the transthyretin transport protein and slowing the formation of amyloid.
The tafamidis 61 mg capsule corresponds to an 80 mg tafamidis meglumine dose (4x 20mg capsules) and was developed for patient convenience to enable a single capsule for daily administration. VYNDAQEL 61 mg and VYNDAQEL 20 mg are not substitutable on a per milligram basis.
Tafamidis was granted Orphan Drug Designation for ATTR-CM in both the EU and US in 2012 and in Japan in 2018. Tafamidis was approved for the treatment of ATTR-CM in Japan under SAKIGAKE designation in March 2019, in the United States in May 2019, in the United Arab Emirates in November 2019, in Brazil in December 2019 and in Canada in January 2020.
VYNDAQEL (tafamidis meglumine) 20 mg was first approved in 2011 in the EU for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), in adult patients with stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment. Currently, it is approved for ATTR-PN in over 40 countries, including Japan, countries in Europe, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Israel, Russia, and South Korea. VYNDAQEL is not approved for ATTR-PN in the US.
VYNDAQEL (tafamidis), a once-daily 61 mg oral capsule, was granted marketing authorization for patients with ATTR-CM in the EU in February 2020.
VYNDAQEL® (tafamidis meglumine) and VYNDAMAX™ (tafamidis) From the U.S. Important Safety Information
Adverse Reactions
In studies in patients with ATTR-CM the frequency of adverse events in patients treated with VYNDAQEL was similar to placebo.
Specific Populations

27711,Chugai's RG6042 Receives MHLW's Orphan Drug Designation for Huntington's Disease in Japan,Chugai Receives Orphan Drug Designation for RG6042 in Huntington's Disease from the MHLW,"The MHLW has granted Chugai’s RG6042 an ODD for the expected treatment of Huntington’s disease
 The RG6042 is currently being evaluated in P-III GENERATION HD1 study and is expected to delay the progression of Huntington’s disease as the first disease-modifying therapy
 RG6042 (ONIS-HTTRx) is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting HTT mRNA and has received FDA & EMA’s ODD for the Huntington’s disease in May & Dec’2015 with EMA’s PRIME designation in 2018","RG6042 is expected to delay or slow progression of Huntington’s disease as
potentially the first disease-modifying drug for the hereditary disorder
 The global phase III clinical study is currently ongoing
TOKYO, February 17, 2020 — Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO: 4519) announced that the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has designated the company’s investigational medicine RG6042 as an orphan drug for the expected treatment of Huntington’s disease. RG6042 is designed to reduce production of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT), a protein generated from the genes responsible for Huntington’s disease. The global phase III clinical study (GENERATION HD1) is currently ongoing.
“Huntington’s disease is designated as an intractable disease in Japan, and only symptomatic treatment is available for this disease. In this high unmet medical need, patients with this hereditary disorder are in need of potential new treatments” said Dr. Yasushi Ito, Chugai’s Executive Vice President, Co-Head of Project & Lifecycle Management Unit. “We continue the ongoing clinical study in cooperation with Roche to deliver RG6042 to patients with Huntington’s disease, as the first disease-modifying drug.”
About RG6042
RG6042 (formerly known as IONIS-HTTRx) is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets human huntingtin messenger ribonucleic acid (HTT mRNA), designed to reduce the production of mHTT, which is believed to be the underlying cause of Huntington’s disease. It is being developed as a disease-modifying drug for Huntington’s disease and expected to delay or slow disease progression.1 RG6042 was designated as an orphan drug for the treatment of Huntington’s disease in Europe and the U.S. in May and December 2015,
respectively. In addition, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) designation for the drug for the treatment of people with Huntington’s disease in 2018.
About Huntington’s Disease
Huntington’s disease is a hereditary disorder accompanied by involuntary movements, mainly choreic movements, in addition to psychiatric symptoms and cognitive changes. 2 It is considered to be caused by accumulation of mHTT translated from mutant huntingtin genes with an expanded CAG repeat. 3 Patients with Huntington’s disease usually receive symptomatic treatment for involuntary movements and psychiatric symptoms because no definitive therapy is available for the disease. There are approximately
900 patients in Japan, based on the number of recipients with grant cards for medical expenses for the 2 / 2 treatment of designated intractable diseases issued in 2017.4 The prevalence is expected to be 0.7 per 0.1 million population.2
About orphan drugs
Based on Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Law, orphan drugs are designated by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare and granted priority review. The designation criteria are as follows: The number of patients who may use the drug is less than 50,000 in Japan; The drug is indicated for the treatment of serious diseases and there is a significant medical value such as no alternative appropriate drug or treatment, or high efficacy or safety expected compared to existing products; there is a theoretical rationale for using the product for the targeted disease and the development plan is reasonable.

27723,Sanofi Collaborates with BARDA to Facilitate the Development of Coronavirus Vaccine,Sanofi joins forces with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to advance a novel coronavirus vaccine,"Sanofi will leverage its previous development work for a SARS vaccine and utilize its recombinant DNA platform to accelerate the development of a vaccine candidate against coronavirus
 The SARS vaccine candidates that were developed by Protein Sciences (acquired by Sanofi in 2017) provides a head start in expediting a COVID-19 vaccine
 Additionally, in Dec’2019, Sanofi collaborates with BARDA to form state of the art facilities in the US for the sustainable production of an adjuvanted recombinant vaccine to be used in influenza pandemic and is based on the same platform that will be used for the COVID-19 program","Work with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) will utilize Sanofi’s well-established recombinant technology platform to expedite a potential COVID-19 vaccine
Newswire/ — Sanofi (NASDAQ: SNY; EURONEXT: SAN) Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, will leverage previous development work for a SARS vaccine which may unlock a fast path forward for developing a COVID-19 vaccine. Sanofi will collaborate with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, expanding the company’s long-standing partnership with BARDA.
COVID-19 belongs to a family of coronaviruses that can cause respiratory disease. In late 2002, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus emerged and then largely disappeared by 2004. Sanofi plans to further investigate an advanced pre-clinical SARS vaccine candidate that could protect against COVID-19.
“Addressing a global health threat such as this newest coronavirus is going to take a collaborative effort, which is why we are working with BARDA to quickly advance a potential vaccine candidate,” said David Loew, Global Head of Vaccines at Sanofi. “While we are lending our expertise where possible, we believe the collaboration with BARDA may provide the most meaningful results in protecting the public from this latest outbreak.”

Sanofi to utilize innovative recombinant technology platform
Sanofi will use its recombinant DNA platform to produce a 2019 novel coronavirus vaccine candidate. The recombinant technology produces an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus. The DNA sequence encoding this antigen will be combined into the DNA of the baculovirus expression platform, the basis of Sanofi’s licensed recombinant influenza product, and used to rapidly produce large quantities of the coronavirus antigen which will be formulated to stimulate the immune system to protect against the virus.

“Emerging global health threats like the 2019 novel coronavirus require a rapid response,” said BARDA Director Rick A. Bright, Ph.D. “By expanding our partnership with Sanofi Pasteur and leveraging a licensed recombinant vaccine platform, we hope to speed development of a vaccine candidate to protect against a new virus.”

Sanofi uniquely positioned in search for a coronavirus vaccine
In non-clinical studies, the SARS vaccine candidate was immunogenic and afforded partial protection as assessed in animal challenge models. This development work by Protein Sciences (acquired by Sanofi in 2017) provides a head start in expediting a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, since there is a licensed vaccine based on this platform this will allow for research and materials to be produced relatively quickly for clinical testing. Sanofi’s platform also has the potential to manufacture large quantities of the vaccine candidate.
Sanofi’s long-standing commitment to protecting public health
This agreement with BARDA marks another milestone in Sanofi’s ongoing contributions to help fight public health threats. Sanofi continues to actively explore potential opportunities where the company’s deep vaccine experience and innovative technologies may contribute to addressing the coronavirus public health situation, including sharing Sanofi’s vaccine research and development experience with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
In December 2019, Sanofi also entered into an agreement with BARDA to establish state of the art facilities in the U.S. for the sustainable production of an adjuvanted recombinant vaccine for use in the event of an influenza pandemic and based on the same technology platform that will be used for the COVID-19 program.

NSCLC without ALK or EGFR mutations
 The P-III Impower110 study results: improvement in OS by 7.1mos. (20.2 vs 13.1mos.), the safety profile is consistent with its known safety profile with no new signals observed
 Tecentriq is a mAb targeting PD-L1, blocking its interaction with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptor with its anticipated FDA’s decision on approval for this indication by Jun 19, 2020","Basel, 19 February 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and granted Priority Review for Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) as a first-line (initial) monotherapy for people with advanced non-squamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR or ALK mutations with high PD-L1 expression (TC3/IC3 wild-type [WT]), as determined by PD-L1 biomarker testing. The FDA is expected to make a decision on approval by June 19, 2020.
“In the IMpower110 study, Tecentriq alone demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival compared with chemotherapy for people newly diagnosed with certain types of advanced non-small cell lung cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “We are working closely with the FDA to bring this chemotherapy-free option to these patients as quickly as possible.”
This sBLA is based on results from the Phase III IMpower110 study, which showed that Tecentriq monotherapy improved overall survival (OS) by 7.1 months compared with chemotherapy (median OS=20.2 versus 13.1 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.595, 95% CI: 0.398–0.890; p=0.0106) in people with high PD-L1 expression (TC3/IC3-WT). Safety for Tecentriq appeared to be consistent with its known safety profile, and no new safety signals were identified. Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 12.9% of people receiving Tecentriq compared with 44.1% of people receiving chemotherapy.1
Roche has an extensive development programme for Tecentriq, including multiple ongoing and planned Phase III studies across lung, genitourinary, skin, breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and head and neck cancers. This includes studies evaluating Tecentriq both alone and in combination with other medicines.
About the IMpower110 study
IMpower110 is a Phase III, randomised, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tecentriq monotherapy compared with cisplatin or carboplatin and pemetrexed or gemcitabine (chemotherapy) in PD-L1-selected, chemotherapy-naïve participants with advanced non-squamous or squamous NSCLC without ALK or EGFR mutations (WT). A total of 572 people (555 WT) were enrolled and were randomised 1:1 to receive:

Tecentriq monotherapy, until loss of clinical benefit (as assessed by the investigator), unacceptable toxicity or death; or
Cisplatin or carboplatin (per investigator discretion) combined with either pemetrexed (non-squamous) or gemcitabine (squamous), followed by maintenance therapy with pemetrexed alone (non-squamous) or best supportive care (squamous) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death.
The primary efficacy endpoint is OS by PD-L1 subgroup (TC3/IC3-WT; TC2/3/ IC2/3-WT; and TC1,2,3/IC1,2,3-WT), as determined by the SP142 assay test. Key secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).
About NSCLC
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally.2 Each year 1.76 million people die as a result of the disease; this translates into more than 4,800 deaths worldwide every day.2 Lung cancer can be broadly divided into two major types: NSCLC and small cell lung cancer. NSCLC is the most prevalent type, accounting for around 85% of all cases.3 NSCLC comprises non-squamous and squamous-cell lung cancer, the squamous form of which is characterised by flat cells covering the airway surface when viewed under a microscope.3
About Tecentriq
Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called PD-L1, which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted medicines and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers. The development of Tecentriq and its clinical programme is based on our greater understanding of how the immune system interacts with tumours and how harnessing a person’s immune system combats cancer more effectively.
Tecentriq is approved in the US, EU and countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies in various forms of non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer, and in PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

February 12, 2020 09:05 AM Eastern Standard Time
GUILFORD, Conn.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Hyperfine Research, Inc. announced today that it has received US Food & Drug Administration 510(k) clearance for the world’s first bedside Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system, clearing the way for device shipments this summer. The Hyperfine system is 20X lower cost, 35X lower power consumption, and 10X lower weight than today’s fixed conventional MRI systems.
“Nearly six years ago, a dream to create a portable, affordable MRI system was born. We assembled an astounding team, and they took the 10 million-fold improvement in computing power since MRI was invented and the best of the billions invested in green electronics and built something astonishing, something disruptive,” said Jonathan Rothberg, PhD, founder and chairman of Hyperfine Research.
The Hyperfine point-of-care device represents multiple innovations in MRI design, architecture and workflow; more than 100 patents have been issued or are currently pending. The system is highly portable and wheels directly to the patient’s bedside, plugs into a standard electrical wall outlet, and is controlled via a wireless tablet such as an Apple iPad®.
The Hyperfine system was designed to address the limitations of current MRI systems in order to make MRI accessible anytime, anywhere, to any patient. “More than 40 years after its first use, MRI remains a marvel. Unfortunately, it also remains inaccessible. It’s time that MRI made the jump to point of need just like X-ray and ultrasound have before it,” said Dr. Khan Siddiqui, Hyperfine’s Chief Medical Officer. “Going beyond that, nearly 90% of the world has no access to MRI at all. With the FDA’s decision, we are now ready to rewrite the rules of MRI accessibility.”
In developing the system, Hyperfine performed thousands of brain scans including those within investigational partnerships at Yale New Haven University, Penn Medicine, Good Samaritan Hospital Long Island, New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, and Brown University, in addition to calling upon seminal work from the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital. The FDA clearance includes head imaging for patients 2 years of age and older. Hyperfine is now accepting product pre-orders via www.hyperfine.io
MRI uses a magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the body’s internal structures that are clearer, more detailed and more likely in some instances to identify and accurately characterize disease than other imaging methods.

27746,Abbott's Gallant ICD and CRT-D Device Receives CE Mark in the EU,"ABBOTT INTRODUCES NEXT-GENERATION HEART RHYTHM MANAGEMENT DEVICES IN EUROPE, FEATURING STATE-OF-THE-ART PATIENT APP AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY","Gallant implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices offer patients engagement and remote monitoring via smartphone to patients with abnormal heart rhythms & HF
 The Gallant system pairs with Abbott’s secure myMerlinPulse mobile app to improve the connectivity b/w the doctors & patients. The app allows the physician to monitor patients remotely, identification of asymptomatic episodes as well as patient-triggered transmissions, leading to earlier intervention and reduction in clinical burden
 The Gallant CRT-D system includes Abbott’s MultiPoint Pacing and SyncAV features to aid patients to respond to CRT therapy while the ICD device includes Abbott’s TailoredTherapy suite to help physicians more instinctively program their patient’s devices","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Feb. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced it has received CE Mark for the new Gallant™ implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices, bringing the most advanced heart rhythm management capabilities along with a new set of benefits to people in Europe with abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure. The devices offer new opportunities for patient engagement and remote monitoring through new smartphone connectivity and connected applications. Additional benefits include a patient preferred design, improved battery longevity and MRI compatibility.
Doctors will often recommend ICDs for prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients who suffer from reduced cardiac function and who may be at risk of suffering from life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms. These abnormal rhythms, also known as ventricular arrhythmias, can occur when the heart beats too fast or chaotically leaving the heart unable to pump blood effectively. CRT-Ds are used to prevent sudden death similar to traditional ICDs, but in addition act to restore the normal timing of the ventricles or lower chambers of the heart in patients with reduced cardiac function and progressive heart failure despite optimal medical therapy.
The new Gallant system pairs with Abbott’s secure myMerlinPulse™ mobile app to help streamline communication and increase engagement between doctors and their patients. For example, the app allows patients to engage more frequently with their healthcare team by providing access to transmission history and device performance, and the app can prompt patients to schedule their next appointment. Through the myMerlinPulse app, physicians can monitor their patients remotely, allowing for identification of asymptomatic episodes as well as patient-triggered transmissions, which can lead to earlier intervention and reduce clinical burden.
“The positive impact of remote monitoring has been proven repeatedly and leads to better patient outcomes and reduced burden on the healthcare system,” said Avi Fischer, M.D., divisional vice president and chief medical officer for Abbott’s Cardiac Rhythm Management business. “Abbott’s new Gallant system provides people the ability to connect to their doctor anytime, even while away from home, and reinforces our commitment to incorporate advanced technologies that will help improve engagement between patients, caregivers and doctors.”
In addition to enhanced remote monitoring capabilities, the Gallant CRT-D system includes Abbott’s MultiPoint™ Pacing and SyncAV features to help more patients respond to CRT therapy. Also, the Gallant ICD device includes Abbott’s TailoredTherapy™ suite to help physicians more intuitively program their patient’s devices. By incorporating these features into the Gallant systems, Abbott continues to prioritize therapy built around a patient’s specific programming needs to ensure they respond to treatment in the most effective way.
Abbott has designed Gallant with a secure lifecycle approach, which includes using the latest cybersecurity controls and partnering with industry cybersecurity experts to provide input into the design and testing of these controls. This approach provides the ability to more seamlessly update the device as cybersecurity threats evolve in the future.
“As I consider the next generation of high voltage therapy, cardiac rhythm management devices have to become more than just a device – they need to fit people’s lifestyles and empower them to be more engaged with their care and more connected to me and my hospital,” said Johannes Sperzel, M.D., head of the electrophysiology department at the Kerckhoff Klinik in Bad Nauheim, Germany, “With Abbott’s new Gallant devices, I can offer my patients smartphone connectivity, powerful connections to their clinical team and improved outcomes through a more tailored therapy approach. The features in Abbott’s devices will propel the industry forward in a very meaningful way.”

 Janssen will utilize its antiviral expertise with Rega Institute for Medical Research’s high throughput screening experience & capabilities for the screening of compounds in Belgium","Janssen strengthens collaboration with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in an effort to stem the threat of the global COVID-19 outbreak
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., February 18, 2020 – Johnson & Johnson today announced that its Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies will expand its existing partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, to seek treatment solutions for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV). This latest collaboration will enhance Janssen’s ongoing work with global partners to screen a library of existing antiviral molecules, with the aim of identifying compounds with promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
The expanded partnership with BARDA builds on Johnson & Johnson’s multipronged response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These efforts, in addition to the ongoing development of a potential vaccine candidate, bring hope of finding a solution against COVID-19 for communities in greatest need in China and around the world.
“We must engage in rigorous research and development in order to identify therapeutic candidates with antiviral activity against the novel coronavirus. Our ambitious goal is to bring forward a solution for patients and ensure future generations do not have to live in fear of the potentially serious consequences of COVID-19,” said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “We have a proven track record in partnering with others to develop and deliver antiviral therapies that serve the needs of diverse populations worldwide. While we are at early stages, we are making that commitment again.”
To screen potential compounds, Janssen will work with the Rega Institute for Medical Research (KU Leuven), in Belgium. The arrangement couples the Institute’s infrastructure, breadth of high throughput screening experience, and capabilities for studying special pathogens with Janssen’s drug development resources and antiviral expertise.
Janssen and BARDA will share the research and development costs and mobilize resources to screen a library of antiviral molecules for activity against SARS-CoV-2. The agreement was created under an existing U.S. Government’s Other Transaction Authority (OTA), HHSO100201800012C. This is a different agreement from the OTA under which Janssen’s SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research is being conducted.
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to a group of viruses called coronaviruses that attack the respiratory system. There is currently no licensed vaccine, treatment or cure for COVID-19.

 VYONDYS 53 is approved under accelerated review based on increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle of patients amenable to exon 53 skipping and will be commercialized in the US and has also demonstrated safety and effectiveness","VYONDYS 53 is Sarepta’s second RNA exon-skipping treatment for DMD approved in the U.S. —
— Commercial distribution of VYONDYS 53 in the U.S. will commence immediately —

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved VYONDYS 53™ (golodirsen). VYONDYS 53 is an antisense oligonucleotide from Sarepta’s phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) platform, indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 53 skipping. This indication is based on a statistically significant increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle observed in patients treated with VYONDYS 53, which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit for those patients who are exon 53 amenable. Consistent with the accelerated approval pathway, the continued approval of VYONDYS 53 may be contingent on confirmation of a clinical benefit in this post-marketing confirmatory trial.

Sarepta’s placebo-controlled, post-marketing confirmatory trial to support the VYONDYS 53 accelerated approval – titled ESSENCE – is currently enrolling and expected to conclude by 2024.

Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pyrexia (fever), pruritis, urticaria (hives), dermatitis, and skin exfoliation have occurred in patients who were treated with VYONDYS 53. Renal toxicity was observed in animal studies. Although not observed in the clinical studies with VYONDYS 53, renal toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. The most common adverse reactions that occurred in at least 20% of VYONDYS 53-treated patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients were headache (41%), pyrexia (41%), fall (29%), abdominal pain (27%), nasopharyngitis (27%), cough (27%), vomiting (27%), and nausea (20%).

Following a New Drug Application (NDA) submission to and review by the Division of Neurology Products (the Review Division) for VYONDYS 53, which the Review Division recommended for approval, the Office of Drug Evaluation 1 issued a complete response letter (CRL) in August of 2019. Thereafter, Sarepta made a formal dispute resolution request as outlined in relevant FDA Guidance. With the support of the Review Division, the matters raised in the CRL were rapidly evaluated and resolved by Dr. Peter Stein, Director of the Office of New Drugs (OND). OND granted the Company’s appeal and Sarepta re-submitted its NDA to the Review Division, which worked expeditiously to review and approve VYONDYS 53.

“Today is monumental for Sarepta and, more importantly, for the DMD community,” said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta. “VYONDYS 53, our second approved exon-skipping RNA therapy for DMD, may treat up to 8% of the DMD community, representing those patients who have a confirmed exon 53 amenable mutation. Along with EXONDYS 51® (eteplirsen), we now offer treatment options for approximately 20% of those with DMD in the U.S.”

Ingram continued, “In the span of four months, we commenced and completed the formal dispute resolution process culminating in the grant of our appeal, resubmitted our NDA and obtained an approval – a great benefit to DMD patients awaiting treatment. This unprecedented timing could not have been achieved without the commitment of the Review Division under the leadership of Dr. Billy Dunn, and the Office of New Drugs, which expeditiously heard and granted our appeal. Along with the DMD community, we owe our gratitude to both the Review Division and the OND for their objective, evidence-based approach to this review, for their fairness, and for the sense of urgency with which they addressed and resolved the CRL and granted this approval.”

“With the approval of VYONDYS 53, up to another 8% of Duchenne families will have a therapy to treat this devastating disease,” said Pat Furlong, founding president and chief executive officer, Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD). “For 25 years, PPMD has been working with researchers, clinicians, industry, and the Duchenne community to find treatments for all people living with Duchenne. And while we need to ensure that these approved therapies are accessible for patients, today we celebrate this approval and thank Sarepta for their continued leadership in the fight to end Duchenne.”

VYONDYS 53 is priced at parity to EXONDYS 51, the price of which has not increased since its launch in 2016. Patients and physicians can access more information at www.SareptAssist.com or by calling 1-888-727-3782.

About VYONDYS 53
VYONDYS 53 is an antisense oligonucleotide indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses Sarepta’s proprietary phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to bind to exon 53 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping,” of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 53 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to allow for production of an internally truncated dystrophin protein.

VYONDYS 53 is approved under accelerated review based on an increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle of patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

VYONDYS 53 has met the full statutory standards for safety and effectiveness and as such is not considered investigational or experimental.

Important Safety Information for VYONDYS 53
Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pyrexia, pruritus, urticaria, dermatitis, and skin exfoliation have occurred in VYONDYS 53-treated patients, some requiring treatment. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate medical treatment and consider slowing the infusion or interrupting the VYONDYS 53 therapy.

Renal toxicity was observed in animals who received golodirsen. Although renal toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies with VYONDYS 53, renal toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Renal function should be monitored in patients taking VYONDYS 53. Because of the effect of reduced skeletal muscle mass on creatinine measurements, creatinine may not be a reliable measure of renal function in DMD patients. Measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 24-hour urine collection prior to initiation of therapy is recommended. Monthly monitoring for proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis and monitoring of serum cystatin C every three months is recommended. In the case of a confirmed dipstick proteinuria of 2+ or greater or elevated serum cystatin C, a 24-hour urine collection to quantify proteinuria and assess GFR should be performed.

Adverse reactions observed in at least 20% of treated patients and greater than placebo were (VYONDYS 53, placebo): headache (41%, 10%), pyrexia (41%, 14%), fall (29%, 19%), abdominal pain (27%, 10%), nasopharyngitis (27%, 14%), cough (27%, 19%), vomiting (27%, 19%), and nausea (20%, 10%).

Other adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency greater than 5% of VYONDYS 53-treated patients and at a greater frequency than placebo were administration site pain, back pain, pain, diarrhea, dizziness, ligament sprain, contusion, influenza, oropharyngeal pain, rhinitis, skin abrasion, ear infection, seasonal allergy, tachycardia, catheter site related reaction, constipation, and fracture.

For further information, please see the full Prescribing Information.

About EXONDYS 51

EXONDYS 51 uses Sarepta’s proprietary phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. EXONDYS 51 is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to allow for production of an internally truncated dystrophin protein.

Important Safety Information About EXONDYS 51

Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash and urticaria, pyrexia, flushing, cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension, have occurred in patients who were treated with EXONDYS 51. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate medical treatment and consider slowing the infusion or interrupting the EXONDYS 51 therapy.

Adverse reactions in DMD patients (N=8) treated with EXONDYS 51 30 mg or 50 mg/kg/week by intravenous (IV) infusion with an incidence of at least 25% more than placebo (N=4) (Study 1, 24 weeks) were (EXONDYS 51, placebo): balance disorder (38%, 0%), vomiting (38%, 0%) and contact dermatitis (25%, 0%). The most common adverse reactions were balance disorder and vomiting. Because of the small numbers of patients, these represent crude frequencies that may not reflect the frequencies observed in practice. The 50 mg/kg once weekly dosing regimen of EXONDYS 51 is not recommended.

In the 88 patients who received ≥30 mg/kg/week of EXONDYS 51 for up to 208 weeks in clinical studies, the following events were reported in ≥10% of patients and occurred more frequently than on the same dose in Study 1: vomiting, contusion, excoriation, arthralgia, rash, catheter site pain, and upper respiratory tract infection.

TOKYO and BOTHELL, Wash., Dec. 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to PADCEV™ for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery or in a locally advanced or metastatic setting. PADCEV is approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program based on tumor response rate. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. PADCEV is the first FDA approved treatment in the U.S. for these patients. It is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.1,3

Metastatic urothelial cancer is an aggressive and devastating disease with limited treatment options, and the approval of PADCEV is a significant advance for these patients who previously had limited options after initial therapies failed,” said Jonathan E. Rosenberg, M.D., Medical Oncologist, Chief, Genitourinary Medical Oncology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. “The PADCEV clinical trial enrolled a range of patients whose cancer was difficult to treat, including those whose disease had spread to the liver.”
“The FDA approval of PADCEV is welcome news for patients with bladder cancer,” said Andrea Maddox-Smith, Chief Executive Officer, Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network. “Though new medicines for bladder cancer have been approved in recent years, most people living with advanced stages of this disease face a difficult journey with few treatment options.”
“This approval underscores our commitment to develop novel medicines that address unmet patient needs, and we’re grateful to the patients and physicians whose participation led to this outcome,” said Andrew Krivoshik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Oncology Therapeutic Area Head, Astellas.
“PADCEV is the first antibody-drug conjugate approved for patients facing this aggressive disease, and it is the culmination of years of innovative work on this technology,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics.
PADCEV was evaluated in the pivotal trial EV-201, a single-arm phase 2 multi-center trial that enrolled 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy.1 In the study, the primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 44 percent per blinded independent central review (55/125; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 35.1, 53.2). Among patients treated with the single agent PADCEV, 12 percent (15/125) experienced a complete response, meaning no cancer could be detected at the time of assessment, and 32 percent (40/125) experienced a partial response, meaning a decrease in tumor size or extent of cancer in the body. The median duration of response (DoR), a secondary endpoint, was 7.6 months (95% CI: 6.3, not estimable [NE]). The most common serious adverse reactions (≥3%) were urinary tract infection (6%), cellulitis (5%), febrile neutropenia (4%), diarrhea (4%), sepsis (3%), acute kidney injury (3%), dyspnea (3%), and rash (3%). The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (6%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue (56%), peripheral neuropathy (56%), decreased appetite (52%), rash (52%), alopecia (50%), nausea (45%), dysgeusia (42%), diarrhea (42%), dry eye (40%), pruritus (26%) and dry skin (26%). The most common Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) were rash (13%), diarrhea (6%) and fatigue (6%).
The FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program allows approval of a medicine based on a surrogate endpoint if the medicine fills an unmet medical need for a serious condition. A global, randomized phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial (EV-301) is underway and is also intended to support global registrations.
About PADCEV 
PADCEV is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.1,2 Nonclinical data suggest the anticancer activity of PADCEV is due to its binding to Nectin-4 expressing cells followed by the internalization and release of the anti-tumor agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) into the cell, which result in the cell not reproducing (cell cycle arrest) and in programmed cell death (apoptosis). PADCEV is co-developed by Astellas and Seattle Genetics.
PADCEV Support Solutions offers access and reimbursement support to help patients access PADCEV. For more information, go to PADCEV Support Solutions at PADCEVSupportSolutions.com.
About Bladder and Urothelial Cancer 
Approximately 80,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with bladder cancer this year.4 Urothelial cancer accounts for 90 percent of all bladder cancers and can also be found in the renal pelvis, ureter and urethra.5
Important Safety Information 
Warnings and Precautions
Hyperglycemia occurred in patients treated with PADCEV, including death and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), in those with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus. The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. In one clinical trial, 8% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C ≥8% were excluded. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (>250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV.

Peripheral neuropathy (PN), predominantly sensory, occurred in 49% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials; 2% experienced Grade 3 reactions. In one clinical trial, peripheral neuropathy occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without preexisting peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 was 3.8 months (range: 0.6 to 9.2). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients. At the time of their last evaluation, 19% had complete resolution, and 26% had partial improvement. Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when peripheral neuropathy occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade ≥3 peripheral neuropathy.

Ocular disorders occurred in 46% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included keratitis, blurred vision, limbal stem cell deficiency and other events associated with dry eyes. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 36% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 14% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.9 months (range: 0.3 to 6.2). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders.

Skin reactions occurred in 54% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials. Twenty-six percent (26%) of patients had maculopapular rash and 30% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 10% of patients and included symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), bullous dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. In one clinical trial, the median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.8 months (range: 0.2 to 5.3). Of the patients who experienced rash, 65% had complete resolution and 22% had partial improvement. Monitor patients for skin reactions. Consider appropriate treatment, such as topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for skin reactions, as clinically indicated. For severe (Grade 3) skin reactions, withhold PADCEV until improvement or resolution and administer appropriate medical treatment. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.

Infusion site extravasation Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 310 patients, 1.3% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. One percent (1%) of patients developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions.

Embryo-fetal toxicity PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during PADCEV treatment and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose.
Adverse Reactions
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients treated with PADCEV. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥3%) were urinary tract infection (6%), cellulitis (5%), febrile neutropenia (4%), diarrhea (4%), sepsis (3%), acute kidney injury (3%), dyspnea (3%), and rash (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, including acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac disorder, and sepsis (each 0.8%).
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 16% of patients; the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 64% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were peripheral neuropathy (18%), rash (9%) and fatigue (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 34% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction were peripheral neuropathy (12%), rash (6%) and fatigue (4%).
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue (56%), peripheral neuropathy (56%), decreased appetite (52%), rash (52%), alopecia (50%), nausea (45%), dysgeusia (42%), diarrhea (42%), dry eye (40%), pruritus (26%) and dry skin (26%). The most common Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) were rash (13%), diarrhea (6%) and fatigue (6%).
Lab Abnormalities
In one clinical trial, Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities reported in ≥5% were: lymphocytes decreased, hemoglobin decreased, phosphate decreased, lipase increased, sodium decreased, glucose increased, urate increased, neutrophils decreased.
Drug Interactions

Effects of other drugs on PADCEV Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase free MMAE exposure, which may increase the incidence or severity of PADCEV toxicities. Closely monitor patients for signs of toxicity when PADCEV is given concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Specific Populations

Lactation Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.
Hepatic impairment Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

 Padcev is an ADC targeting Nectin 4 and has received the US FDA’s approval in Dec’2019, indicated for LA/mUC in patients prior treated with PD-1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing CT before & after surgery","TOKYO and BOTHELL, Wash., Feb. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Astellas Pharma Inc.(TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) and Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGEN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PADCEV™ (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are unable to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the first-line setting.
The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy process is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition. Designation is based upon preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
“The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation reflects the encouraging preliminary evidence for the combination of PADCEV and pembrolizumab in previously untreated advanced urothelial cancer to benefit patients who are in need of effective treatment options,” said Andrew Krivoshik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Oncology Therapeutic Area Head, Astellas. “We look forward to continuing our work with the FDA as we progress our clinical development program as quickly as possible.”
“This is an important step in our investigation of PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer who are unable to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics. “Based on encouraging early clinical activity, we recently initiated a phase 3 trial of this platinum-free combination and look forward to potentially addressing an unmet need for patients.”
The Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted based on results from the dose-escalation cohort and expansion cohort A of the phase 1b/2 trial, EV-103 (NCT03288545), evaluating patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are unable to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy treated in the first-line setting with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab. Initial results from the trial were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 Congress, and updated findings at the 2020 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. EV-103 is an ongoing, multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 1b/2 trial of PADCEV alone or in combination, evaluating safety, tolerability and efficacy in muscle invasive, locally advanced and first- and second-line metastatic urothelial cancer.
About Bladder and Urothelial Cancer
It is estimated that approximately 81,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2020.1 Urothelial cancer accounts for 90 percent of all bladder cancers and can also be found in the renal pelvis, ureter and urethra.2
Globally, approximately 549,000 people were diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2018, and there were approximately 200,000 deaths worldwide.3
The recommended first-line treatment for patients with advanced urothelial cancer is a cisplatin-based chemotherapy. For patients who are unable to receive cisplatin, such as people with kidney impairment, a carboplatin-based regimen is recommended. However, fewer than half of patients respond to carboplatin-based regimens and outcomes are typically poorer compared to cisplatin-based regimens.4
About PADCEV 
PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2019 and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery or in a locally advanced or metastatic setting. PADCEV was approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program based on tumor response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.5
PADCEV is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is directed against Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer.5,6Nonclinical data suggest the anticancer activity of PADCEV is due to its binding to Nectin-4 expressing cells followed by the internalization and release of the anti-tumor agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) into the cell, which result in the cell not reproducing (cell cycle arrest) and in programmed cell death (apoptosis).5 PADCEV is co-developed by Astellas and Seattle Genetics.
Important Safety Information
Warnings and Precautions
Hyperglycemia occurred in patients treated with PADCEV, including death and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), in those with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus. The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. In one clinical trial, 8% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C ≥8% were excluded. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (>250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV.
Peripheral neuropathy (PN), predominantly sensory, occurred in 49% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials; 2% experienced Grade 3 reactions. In one clinical trial, peripheral neuropathy occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without preexisting peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 was 3.8 months (range: 0.6 to 9.2). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients. At the time of their last evaluation, 19% had complete resolution, and 26% had partial improvement. Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when peripheral neuropathy occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade ≥3 peripheral neuropathy.
Ocular disorders occurred in 46% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included keratitis, blurred vision, limbal stem cell deficiency and other events associated with dry eyes. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 36% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 14% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.9 months (range: 0.3 to 6.2). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders.
Skin reactions occurred in 54% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials. Twenty-six percent (26%) of patients had maculopapular rash and 30% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 10% of patients and included symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), bullous dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. In one clinical trial, the median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.8 months (range: 0.2 to 5.3). Of the patients who experienced rash, 65% had complete resolution and 22% had partial improvement. Monitor patients for skin reactions. Consider appropriate treatment, such as topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for skin reactions, as clinically indicated. For severe (Grade 3) skin reactions, withhold PADCEV until improvement or resolution and administer appropriate medical treatment. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.
Infusion site extravasation Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 310 patients, 1.3% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. One percent (1%) of patients developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions.
Embryo-fetal toxicity PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during PADCEV treatment and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose.
Adverse Reactions
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients treated with PADCEV. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥3%) were urinary tract infection (6%), cellulitis (5%), febrile neutropenia (4%), diarrhea (4%), sepsis (3%), acute kidney injury (3%), dyspnea (3%), and rash (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, including acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac disorder, and sepsis (each 0.8%).
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 16% of patients; the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 64% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were peripheral neuropathy (18%), rash (9%) and fatigue (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 34% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction were peripheral neuropathy (12%), rash (6%) and fatigue (4%).
The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue (56%), peripheral neuropathy (56%), decreased appetite (52%), rash (52%), alopecia (50%), nausea (45%), dysgeusia (42%), diarrhea (42%), dry eye (40%), pruritus (26%) and dry skin (26%). The most common Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) were rash (13%), diarrhea (6%) and fatigue (6%).
Lab Abnormalities
In one clinical trial, Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities reported in ≥5% were: lymphocytes decreased, hemoglobin decreased, phosphate decreased, lipase increased, sodium decreased, glucose increased, urate increased, neutrophils decreased.
Drug Interactions

Effects of other drugs on PADCEV Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase free MMAE exposure, which may increase the incidence or severity of PADCEV toxicities. Closely monitor patients for signs of toxicity when PADCEV is given concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Specific Populations

Lactation Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.
Hepatic impairment Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

 The study resulted in somnolence/sedation (24% vs.10%) and dry mouth (6% vs. 2%)
 CAPLYTA is a once-daily, oral therapy mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at central serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and postsynaptic antagonist activity at central dopamine D2 receptors","Press ReleaseNEW YORK, Dec. 23, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq:ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that CAPLYTA® (lumateperone) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. The Company expects to initiate the commercial launch of CAPLYTA in late Q1 2020.
The efficacy of CAPLYTA 42 mg was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled trials, showing a statistically significant separation from placebo on the primary endpoint, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and twice the rate of placebo) for the recommended dose of CAPLYTA vs placebo were somnolence/sedation (24% vs.10%) and dry mouth (6% vs. 2%).
In pooled data from short term studies, mean changes from baseline in weight gain, fasting glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol were similar between CAPLYTA and placebo. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 6.7% for CAPLYTA and 6.3% for placebo.
“We believe CAPLYTA provides healthcare providers a new, safe and effective treatment option to help the millions of adult patients with schizophrenia,” said Dr. Sharon Mates, Chairman and CEO of Intra-Cellular Therapies. “This approval represents the culmination of years of scientific research. We are especially grateful to the patients, their caregivers, and the healthcare professionals who have contributed to the development of CAPLYTA.”
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness impacting approximately 2.4 million adults in the United States. The clinical presentation of schizophrenia is diverse. Acute episodes are characterized by psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions, often requiring hospitalization. The disease is chronic and lifelong, often accompanied by depression and gradual deterioration of social functioning and cognitive ability. Patients with schizophrenia often discontinue treatment as a result of side effects such as weight gain and movement disorders.
“Schizophrenia is a complex disease that severely impacts patients and their families,” said Jeffrey A. Lieberman, M.D., Lawrence C. Kolb Professor and Chairman of Psychiatry, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons and Director, New York State Psychiatric Institute. “Effective treatment provided in a timely fashion can be game-changing for people living with schizophrenia. The efficacy and safety profile of CAPLYTA approved by the FDA, offers healthcare providers an important new option for treating people living with schizophrenia.”

 The study resulted in patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST: ORR 84%, CR 7%, PR 77%. And in patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations: ORR 89%, CR 8%, PR 82%, mDOR was not reached
 Ayvakit (avapritinib) is a KIT and PDGFRA mutant kinases inhibitor and is novel candidate approved for type 1 inhibitor for GIST and has also received the US FDA’s BT Designation. The PDUFA date for fourth-line GIST indication is currently Feb 14, 2020","YVAKIT is the first approved precision therapy for GIST and the only highly active treatment for PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST —— AYVAKIT showed an 84% overall response rate and a median duration of response was not reached in patients with unresectable or metastatic PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST in the NAVIGATOR trial(1) —— Blueprint Medicines to host investor conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET —

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Blueprint Medicines Corporation (NASDAQ: BPMC), a precision therapy company focused on genomically defined cancers, rare diseases and cancer immunotherapy, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved AYVAKIT™ (avapritinib) for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. AYVAKIT is the first precision therapy approved to treat a genomically defined population of patients with GIST.
The FDA granted a full approval to AYVAKIT based on efficacy results from the Phase 1 NAVIGATOR clinical trial, as well as combined safety results from multiple clinical trials for avapritinib. In patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST, AYVAKIT had an overall response rate (ORR) of 84 percent (95% CI: 69%, 93%), and a median duration of response (DOR) was not reached. The most common adverse reactions (≥20 percent) were edema, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, cognitive impairment, vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hair color changes, increased lacrimation, abdominal pain, constipation, rash and dizziness. Blueprint Medicines plans to make AYVAKIT available in the U.S. within a week.
GIST is a rare, genomically driven sarcoma of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Approximately 6 percent of patients with newly diagnosed GIST have PDGFRA exon 18 mutations. The most common PDGFRA exon 18 mutation is the D842V mutation, which is resistant to all other approved therapies. A retrospective study showed that when these patients were treated with imatinib, they had an ORR of 0 percent.2
“Today’s approval of AYVAKIT brings forward a new standard of care for patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST, a genomically defined population that previously had very limited treatment options. For the first time, we can offer these patients a highly effective treatment that targets the underlying genetic cause of their disease,” said Michael Heinrich, M.D., Professor of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University and an investigator on the NAVIGATOR trial. “Building on our growing understanding of the molecular basis of GIST, this milestone ushers in a new era of precision medicine in this disease. The FDA approval represents a call to action to conduct mutational testing in all patients with GIST before initiating kinase inhibitor therapy, as recommended by clinical guidelines, so appropriate patients may realize the benefits of this promising new medicine.”
“The full approval of AYVAKIT based on robust data from our Phase 1 NAVIGATOR clinical trial is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company and, more importantly, for GIST patients with a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, who have been waiting for a new treatment option,” said Jeff Albers, Chief Executive Officer at Blueprint Medicines. “AYVAKIT is the first of what we hope will be many approved medicines enabled by our research platform. Now, as we begin to deliver AYVAKIT to patients and their healthcare providers, we aim to fortify our leadership in the field of precision medicine and build a foundation for our broader portfolio by pairing our strong research and development capabilities with an equally talented commercial organization focused on addressing patient needs, accelerating diagnostic testing and enabling access.”
Blueprint Medicines is dedicated to helping patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST access treatment with AYVAKIT and providing robust support throughout their treatment journey. As part of this commitment, Blueprint Medicines is introducing YourBlueprint™, a patient support program that offers access and affordability solutions for individuals receiving AYVAKIT.

Update on New Drug Application for the Treatment of Fourth-Line GIST
Blueprint Medicines today announced that the FDA administratively split the proposed indications for avapritinib under the initial New Drug Application (NDA) into two separate NDAs: one for PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST, which the FDA approved today, and one for fourth-line GIST. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for the fourth-line GIST indication is currently February 14, 2020. As previously announced, for the NDA for fourth-line GIST an extension of up to three months for the PDUFA action date will likely be required to enable Blueprint Medicines to provide top-line data to the FDA from VOYAGER, a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating avapritinib versus regorafenib in third- or fourth-line GIST.
AYVAKIT Efficacy and Safety Data1
The efficacy of AYVAKIT was established from 43 patients in the NAVIGATOR trial with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring PDGFRA exon 18 mutations, including 38 patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations. These patients were treated at starting doses of either 300 mg once daily (QD) or 400 mg QD. Efficacy data were evaluated by blinded, independent central radiology review, based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (mRECIST 1.1 criteria) for GIST. The recommended dose of AYVAKIT is 300 mg QD. AYVAKIT is available in 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg dose strengths.
AYVAKIT demonstrated durable responses in patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutations across multiple lines of treatment. In these patients, the ORR was 84 percent [7 percent complete responses (CR), 77 percent partial responses (PR)]. In patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations, the ORR was 89 percent (95% CI: 75%, 97%; 8 percent CR, 82 percent PR). The median DOR was not reached in either patient population (range: 1.9+ months, 20.3+ months).
The safety of AYVAKIT in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST was evaluated in 204 patients who received 300 mg QD or 400 mg QD dosing in the NAVIGATOR trial. Patients were heavily pre-treated, with patients receiving a median of three prior kinase inhibitors (range: 0 to 7).
There are no contraindications for AYVAKIT. AYVAKIT has warnings and precautions of intracranial hemorrhage, central nervous system effects and embryo-fetal toxicity. The most common adverse reactions (≥20 percent) were edema, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, cognitive impairment, vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hair color changes, increased lacrimation, abdominal pain, constipation, rash and dizziness.
About AYVAKIT (avapritinib)
AYVAKIT (avapritinib) is a kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. AYVAKIT is a selective and potent inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA mutant kinases. It is the only FDA-approved type 1 inhibitor for GIST that works by directly binding to the active kinase conformation from which mutant KIT and PDGFRA signal. AYVAKIT has demonstrated inhibition of a broad range of KIT and PDGFRA mutations associated with GIST, including potent clinical activity against activation loop mutations that are associated with resistance to currently approved therapies. For more information, visit AYVAKIT.com.
Avapritinib is not approved for the treatment of any other indication in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction by the FDA or any other health authority.
Blueprint Medicines is pursuing a broad clinical development program for avapritinib across multiple lines of GIST treatment, as well as for advanced, smoldering and indolent systemic mastocytosis (SM). The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to avapritinib for two indications: one for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation and one for the treatment of advanced SM, including the subtypes of aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia. For more information about avapritinib clinical trials, visit www.clinicaltrials.gov or www.blueprintclinicaltrials.com.
About GIST
GIST is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the GI tract. Tumors arise from cells in the wall of the GI tract and occur most often in the stomach or small intestine. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 50 to 80, and diagnosis is typically triggered by GI bleeding, incidental findings during surgery or imaging and, in rare cases, tumor rupture or GI obstruction.
Most GIST cases are caused by mutations in KIT or PDGFRA that force protein kinases into an increasingly active state. Because other available therapies primarily bind to the inactive protein conformations, certain primary and secondary mutations typically result in treatment resistance and lead to disease progression.
In unresectable or metastatic GIST, clinical benefits from existing treatments can vary by mutation type. Mutational testing is critical to tailor therapy to the underlying disease driver and is recommended in expert guidelines. Currently, there are no approved therapies for patients with KIT-driven GIST whose disease progresses beyond imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib. In patients with advanced PDGFRA D842V-driven GIST treated with imatinib, a retrospective study showed an ORR of 0 percent.2
Important Safety Information
Intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subdural hematoma, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebral hemorrhage) occurred in 1% of 267 patients (0.7% Grade 3 or 4) with GIST and overall in 3% of 335 patients (1.2% Grade 3 or 4) who received AYVAKIT. Overall, 0.9% of patients receiving AYVAKIT required permanent discontinuation for an intracranial hemorrhage. Withhold AYVAKIT and then resume at a reduced dose upon resolution, or permanently discontinue AYVAKIT based on severity.
In 335 patients receiving AYVAKIT, CNS adverse reactions occurred overall in 58% of patients including cognitive impairment (41%; 3.6% Grade 3 or 4), dizziness (20%; 0.6% Grade 3 or 4), sleep disorders (15%; 0.3% Grade 3 or 4), mood disorders (13%; 1.5% Grade 3 or 4), speech disorders (6%; none Grade 3 or 4), and hallucinations (2.1%; none Grade 3 or 4). Overall, 3.9% of patients required permanent discontinuation of AYVAKIT for a CNS adverse reaction. Depending on severity, withhold AYVAKIT and then resume at the same dose or at a reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinue AYVAKIT.
AYVAKIT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential and pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with AYVAKIT and for 6 weeks after the final dose of AYVAKIT. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with AYVAKIT and for two weeks after the final dose. Advise females and males of reproductive potential that AYVAKIT may impair fertility.
In 204 patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were edema, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, cognitive impairment, vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hair color changes, increased lacrimation, abdominal pain, constipation, rash and dizziness.
Avoid coadministration of AYVAKIT with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce dose of AYVAKIT. Avoid coadministration of AYVAKIT with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers.

27859,Eisai's Dayvigo (lemborexant) Receives the US FDA's Approval to Treat Insomnia in Adults,U.S. FDA APPROVES EISAI’S DAYVIGO™ (LEMBOREXANT) FOR TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN ADULT PATIENTS,"The approval is based on two P-III studies (study 1 & 2) assessing Dayvigo (5mg/10mg, once nightly) vs PBO in patients aged ≥18yrs. & in female patients aged ≥55yrs. and male aged≥65yrs. for 6mos. & 1mos. who met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder respectively
 The collaborative results indicated that Dayvigo demonstrated superiority sSOL, sSEF, sWASO, LPS, SEF and WASO, effect at the beginning of treatment were generally consistent with later timepoints
 The FDA has recommended Dayvigo to be classified as a controlled substance while recommendation has been submitted to the US DEA. Dayvigo is expected to be commercially available within 90days following DEA scheduling","Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, “Eisai”) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the new drug application for its in-house discovered and developed orexin receptor antagonist DAYVIGOTM (lemborexant). DAYVIGO was approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance in adults1. In the United States, DAYVIGO will be commercially available in 5 mg and 10 mg tablets following scheduling by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which is expected to occur within 90 days.

 

The mechanism of action of lemborexant in the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance is presumed to be through antagonism of orexin receptors. The orexin neuropeptide signaling system plays a role in wakefulness. Blocking the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R is thought to suppress wake drive. Lemborexant binds to orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R and acts as a competitive antagonist with stronger inhibition effect to OX2R*.

 

The approval was based on the results of a clinical development program that included two pivotal Phase III studies (SUNRISE 2 and SUNRISE 1), which evaluated DAYVIGO versus comparators for up to one month and DAYVIGO versus placebo for six-months, respectively, in a total of about 2,000 adult patients with insomnia. From these studies results, DAYVIGO demonstrated statistically significant superiorities on sleep onset and sleep maintenance compared to placebo in both subjective and objective evaluations.

 

Across SUNRISE 2 and SUNRISE 1, DAYVIGO was not associated with rebound insomnia following treatment discontinuation, and there was no evidence of withdrawal effects following DAYVIGO discontinuation at either dose. In addition, the development program included multiple safety studies evaluating effects on postural stability, cognition, driving performance and respiratory safety.

 

SUNRISE 2 was a long-term (six month), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, trial in adult patients age 18 or older who met DSM-5** criteria for insomnia disorder. Patients were randomized to placebo (n=325), DAYVIGO 5 mg (n=323), or DAYVIGO 10 mg (n=323) once nightly. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline to end of treatment at six months for patient-reported (subjective) sleep onset latency (sSOL), defined as the estimated minutes from the time that the subject attempted to sleep until falling asleep. Pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline to end of treatment at six months for patient reported sleep efficiency (sSE; defined as the proportion of time spent asleep during time in bed) and subjective sleep onset and sleep maintenance (sWASO; defined as the minutes of wake from the onset of persistent sleep until lights on). The primary and pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints were measured using a Sleep Diary. In SUNRISE 2, DAYVIGO 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated statistically significant superiority on the primary efficacy measure, sSOL, compared to placebo. DAYVIGO 5 mg and 10 mg also showed statistically significant superiority in sSE and sWASO.1
SUNRISE 1 was a short-term (one month), randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group clinical trial in adult female subjects age 55 and older and male subjects 65 years and older who met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder. Patients were randomized to placebo (n=208), DAYVIGO 5 mg (n=266) or 10 mg (n=269) or active comparator (n=263) once nightly. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in latency to persistent sleep (LPS; defined as the number of minutes from lights off to the first 10 consecutive minutes of non-wakefulness) from baseline to end of treatment (day 29/30), as measured by overnight polysomnography (PSG) monitoring. The pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints in SUNRISE 1 were the mean change from baseline to end of treatment (day 29/30) in sleep efficiency (SE) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) measured by PSG. In SUNRISE 1, DAYVIGO 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated statistically significant superiority on the primary efficacy measure, LPS, compared to placebo. DAYVIGO 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated statistically significant improvement in SE and WASO compared to placebo.1
The most common adverse reaction (reported in 5% or more of patients treated with DAYVIGO and at least twice the rate of placebo) in SUNRISE 2 (the first 30 days) and SUNRISE 1 was somnolence (DAYVIGO 10 mg, 10%; DAYVIGO 5 mg, 7%; placebo, 1%).

 

In addition to these pivotal trials, Eisai conducted a number of studies to further evaluate the safety of DAYVIGO, including a study that assessed the effect of DAYVIGO on postural stability and cognitive performance and a next-morning driving study.

 

Middle of the Night Safety (Study 108): The effect of DAYVIGO on middle of the night safety was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled trial in healthy female subjects ≥ age 55 or male subjects ≥ age 65. Postural stability, the ability to awaken in response to a sound stimulus, and attention and memory were assessed following a scheduled awakening four hours after the start of the eight-hour time in bed. Nighttime dosing of DAYVIGO 5 and 10 mg resulted in impairment of balance (measured by body sway area) at four hours as compared to placebo. There were no meaningful differences between DAYVIGO (5 or 10 mg) and placebo on ability to awaken to sound. DAYVIGO was associated with dose-dependent worsening on measures of attention and memory as compared to placebo.1
Effects on Next-day Postural Stability and Attention and Memory (SUNRISE1 and Study 108): The effects of DAYVIGO on next day postural stability and attention and memory were evaluated in two randomized, placebo- and active-controlled trials in healthy subjects and insomnia patients age 55 and older. There were no meaningful differences between DAYVIGO (5 or 10 mg) and placebo on next-day postural stability, or memory compared to placebo. 1
Effects on Driving (Study 106): A randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, four-period crossover study evaluated the effects of nighttime administration of DAYVIGO on next-morning driving performance approximately nine hours after dosing in 24 healthy elderly subjects (≥65 years old, median age 67 years) and 24 adult subjects (median age 49 years). Although DAYVIGO at doses of 5 and 10 mg did not cause statistically significant impairment in next-morning driving performance in adult or elderly subjects (compared with placebo), driving ability was impaired in some subjects taking 10 mg DAYVIGO.
“Insomnia disorder is a chronic condition that has a variety of potential negative impacts and long-term consequences for health and well-being,”2 said Russell Rosenberg, PhD, D.ABSM, a principal investigator in the DAYVIGO clinical studies and former Chairman of the Board of the National Sleep Foundation. “The clinical trials provide evidence that DAYVIGO may improve patients’ ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.”

 

“We believe the approval of DAYVIGO is particularly exciting because it is the first FDA-approved medication to report safety data over a 12-month period along with sleep onset and sleep maintenance efficacy data over a six-month period in a pivotal clinical study,” said Lynn Kramer, MD, Chief Clinical Officer, Neurology Business Group, Eisai. “We look forward to making this new therapeutic option available to the millions of patients who suffer with insomnia.

 

Eisai has submitted new drug applications seeking approval of this agent for use in the treatment of insomnia in Japan (March 2019) and Canada (August 2019).

 

Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both, despite an adequate opportunity to sleep, that can lead to daytime consequences such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating and irritability.2,9 Insomnia is one of the most common sleep-wake disorders with high prevalence. Approximately 30% of adults worldwide have symptoms of insomnia,7,8 and many of them remain months to years. As a result, insomnia causes various social losses such as long absences and reduced productivity.

 

With DAYVIGO and through its research and development efforts focusing on orexin biology, Eisai aspires to improve the lives of patients suffering from sleep disorders.

 

*Lemborexant binds to orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R and acts as a competitive antagonist (IC50 values of 6.1 nM and

2.6 nM, respectively). When activated, the role of OX1R is to suppress REM sleep, and the role of OX2R is to suppress

both non-REM sleep and REM sleep. Lemborexant enables sleep by preventing activation of OX1R and OX2R.

[Notes to editors]

1. About Lemborexant
Lemborexant is Eisai’s in-house discovered and developed small molecule that binds to orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R and acts as a competitive antagonist (IC50 values of 6.1 nM and 2.6 nM, respectively). The mechanism of action of lemborexant in the treatment of insomnia is presumed to be through antagonism of orexin receptors. The orexin neuropeptide signaling system plays a role in wakefulness. Blocking the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to receptors OX1R and OX2R is thought to suppress wake drive.

As a result of clinical studies, the effect of lemborexant are suggested not only for primary insomnia but also for insomnia which is associated with other diseases, such as depression, (SUNRISE-1 and SUNRISE-2).

In addition to the indication of insomnia, a Phase II clinical study of lemborexant in patients with ISWRD associated with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s dementia is underway.

 

2. About Sleep-Wake Disorders and Insomnia
Sleep-wake disorders consist of disease categories such as insomnia, ISWRD, hypersomnia and breathing-related sleep disorders. Among the sleep-wake disorders, insomnia is the most common with persistent insomnia symptoms experienced by approximately 30 percent of the adult population worldwide.7,8 Insomnia disorder is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both, despite an adequate opportunity to sleep, that can lead to daytime consequences such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating and irritability.2,9

Good quality sleep is essential for good health including brain health,11 and studies suggest an optimal sleep duration between seven and eight hours.12 Poor sleep is associated with a wide range of health consequences, including an increased risk of hypertension, accidental injury, diabetes, obesity, depression, heart attack, stroke, dementia, as well as adverse effects on mood and behavior.2,10

Women are 1.4 times more likely than men to suffer from insomnia.13 Older adults also have higher prevalence of insomnia; aging is often accompanied by changes in sleep patterns, including disrupted sleep, frequent waking, and early waking, that can lead to less sleep time.14

 

 

3. SUNRISE 2 (Study 303)4
SUNRISE 2 is a 12-month multicenter, global (Japan, North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania), randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group Phase III study of 949 male or female adult participants (18 to 88 years of age) with insomnia disorder. SUNRISE 2 included a pre-randomization phase of up to 35 days (including a two-week placebo run-in period) and a randomization phase comprised of a six-month placebo-controlled treatment period, a six-month period of only active treatment, and a two-week period without treatment prior to the end-of-study-visit. Lemborexant 5 mg, 10 mg or matching placebo was taken orally in tablet form at home each night immediately before the patient intended to try to sleep for the first six months of study. Patients who received placebo during the first six-month period were administered lemborexant 5 mg or 10 mg for the second six-month period. Patients who received active treatment during the first period continued on the treatment to which they were originally randomized.

The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline in subjective sleep onset latency after six months of placebo-controlled treatment. Key secondary outcome measures were mean change from baseline in subjective sleep efficiency and subjective wake after sleep onset after six months of placebo-controlled treatment.

From the results, the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints for efficacy were achieved for lemborexant arms, and statistically significant improvements in sleep onset and sleep maintenance were confirmed for lemborexant arms compared to placebo during the six-month treatment period. The common AEs in the lemborexant arms were somnolence, nasopharyngitis, headache and influenza.

 

4. SUNRISE 1 (Study 304)3
SUNRISE 1 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, parallel-group Phase III study of the efficacy and safety of lemborexant in 1,006 patients 55 years and older (45% of all patients were aged 65 years and older) with insomnia disorder conducted in North America and Europe. SUNRISE 1 included a pre-randomization phase of up to 35 days (including a two-week placebo run-in period) and a randomization phase comprised of a 30-day treatment period and a two-week period without treatment prior to the end-of-study-visit. In this study, patients were administered placebo or one of three treatment regimens (lemborexant 5 mg, lemborexant 10 mg, zolpidem ER 6.25 mg).

The primary objective for SUNRISE 1 was to demonstrate using polysomnography that lemborexant at either the 5 mg or 10 mg dose is superior to placebo on objective sleep onset, as measured by latency to persistent sleep after the last two nights of one month of treatment. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in sleep efficiency for both lemborexant doses compared to placebo, wake after sleep onset (WASO) for both lemborexant doses compared to placebo, and WASO in the second half of the night (WASO2H) for both lemborexant doses compared to zolpidem ER, after one month of treatment, measured objectively by polysomnography.

The results of the study showed that lemborexant had statistically significant improvement compared to zolpidem ER 6.25 mg and placebo in sleep parameters evaluated in primary and key secondary endpoints. The common adverse events (AEs) in the DAYVIGO arms were headache and somnolence.

 

5. About Study 1065
Study 106 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, four period, crossover Phase I study to evaluate the effect of lemborexant in 48 healthy adults and elderly volunteers (23 to 58 years of age, mean: 58.5 years old) to evaluate on-road driving performance. Volunteers (65 years and older: 24, 23 to 64 years old: 24) were treated at bedtime with two out of three dose levels of lemborexant (2.5, 5 or 10 mg) and placebo for eight consecutive days. Zopiclone 7.5 mg as an active control was administered on days one and eight only, with placebo given for the six days in between. The primary endpoint was to evaluate change of standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) during an on-road driving test conducted after the first (in the morning of Day 2) and last day (in the morning of Day 9) of treatment administration after 9-hour dose.

In the on-road test, the volunteers drove a specially instrumented vehicle for about one hour over 100km (approximately 60 miles) primary highway circuit, accompanied by a licensed driving instructor. The task was to drive with a steady lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the slower traffic lane, while maintaining a constant speed of 95km/h.

Although lemborexant at doses of 5 and 10 mg did not cause statistically significant impairment in next-morning driving performance in adult or elderly subjects (compared with placebo), driving ability was impaired in some subjects taking 10 mg lemborexant.

 

6. About Study 1086
Study 108 was a randomized, double-blind, four period crossover Phase I study to evaluate the effect of lemborexant on postural stability, auditory awakening threshold, and cognitive performance in 56 healthy volunteers 55 years and older. Participants were treated at bedtime with a single dose of placebo, lemborexant 5 mg, lemborexant 10 mg, or zolpidem ER 6.25 mg. The primary endpoint assessed postural stability when awakened by an alarm approximately four hours after administration of lemborexant compared to zolpidem ER, as measured by stabilometer.

While there was a statistically significant increase in body sway for both doses of lemborexant compared with placebo, Zolpidem ER increased body sway at a magnitude almost three times more than lemborexant. This increase with zolpidem was three times that, which is associated with a blood alcohol content (BAC 0.05 percent) near the legal driving limit.

The next morning, shortly after the end of eight hours in bed, unlike zolpidem ER, neither dose of lemborexant had statistically significant residual effects on this measure of postural stability as compared to placebo.

27902,Roche Introduces RocheDiabetes InsulinStart to Facilitate the Access to Insulin Therapy for T2D Patients,"Roche presents RocheDiabetes InsulinStart, a new service to help you get started with insulin therapy","RocheDiabetes InsulinStart is a service designed to aid patients with T2D with a goal to facilitate the transition from oral antidiabetic therapies to long-term insulin once-daily therapy
 The message-based service supports the patients in the critical phase of finding the optimal dose for insulin (qd). The service will provide the user with the text message in the morning to remind them to take a blood sugar test and in the evening to recommend the insulin dose
 The Roche Diabetes InsulinStart service is offered in integration with Accu-Chek Smart Pix software, allowing doctors to adjust the therapy according to the patient’s need and avoids additional visit at the same time","RocheDiabetes InsulinStart is a service for people with type 2 diabetes that aims to facilitate the transition from oral antidiabetic drugs to supplementary, long-acting insulin therapy.
– Using proven algorithms, the message-based service provides support in the critical phase of finding the optimal dose for long-acting insulin injected once a day.
– The RocheDiabetes InsulinStart Service, which was initially integrated into the Accu-Chek Smart Pix software and later into the RocheDiabetes Care Platform, is now part of Roche’s open ecosystem and is intended to contribute to more effective and personalized diabetes management.
MADRID , February 20, 2020 / PRNewswire / – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY ) today announced RocheDiabetes InsulinStart at the 13th International Conference on Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) in Madrid , Spain. Roche Diabetes InsulinStart is designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who start long-term insulin therapy injected once a day. The message-based service can provide real relief to people with type 2 diabetes and help doctors personalize diabetes treatment. In DecemberIn 2019, Roche received the CE mark for the Roche Diabetes Insulin Start Service. The certification paves the way for pilot projects and studies that generate evidence.
When oral antidiabetic drugs alone can no longer control blood sugar, adding a fixed amount of complementary, long-acting insulin is a preferred therapy option. The start of this so-called basal insulin-assisted oral therapy (BOT) presents both patients and doctors with challenges. The frustration of not being able to manage type 2 diabetes is often accompanied by fear of injecting too much or too little insulin.
Many people with diabetes feel overwhelmed to adhere to the titration scheme to optimize treatment. Studies show that less than 40% of people with diabetes reach their glycemic target at the end of their insulin adjustment period 1 , and more than 80% of patients tend to stop insulin therapy the first year after starting 2 . These results indicate that there is a clear need to optimize titration in clinical practice.
RocheDiabetes InsulinStart promises support in this critical phase. Doctors register their patients with the RocheDiabetes InsulinStart service. These are then accompanied by the process of gradually increasing the long-acting insulin to achieve their optimal individual dosage. They receive a text message in the morning to remind them to take a sober blood sugar test and in the evening they recommend the insulin dose.
“RocheDiabetes InsulinStart meets the needs of people who need to inject long-term insulin once a day with a simple service that enables them to successfully start their unfamiliar therapy. It enables them to independently and safely manage their therapy in everyday life” , says Matthias Koehler , Senior Solutions Development Manager. The service can also be used by people who have already received insulin therapy but need to be adjusted to better control their type 2 diabetes.
The Roche Diabetes InsulinStart service is offered as an add-on within the Accu-Chek Smart Pix software; a software that offers decision and therapy support in the doctor’s office. Doctors can adjust the therapy transition to the patient’s needs and view the patient’s blood sugar and injected insulin levels at any time during this phase. This helps to avoid additional visits to the practice and at the same time offers clear, actionable support to enable a simple and effective start to long-lasting insulin therapy. After four to 12 weeks, the participants are usually within their personal target area and can continue with the individually determined, long-acting insulin dose.
About Diabetes
According to the International Diabetes Federation 3, there are currently almost half a billion (463 million) adults with diabetes worldwide; by 2045 this number will increase to 700 million. The most common form is type 2 diabetes, which accounts for around 90% of all diabetes cases. Controlling blood sugar levels is critical to preventing long-term micro and macrovascular complications. 5 Basal insulin is one of the suggested treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes whose diabetes cannot be controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs alone. 6 As with many chronic diseases, achieving optimal therapeutic results depends on both treatment capacity and adherence to therapy. In these aspects in particular, the Roche Diabetes Insulin Start service offers support to enable a better response to the therapy needs of people with diabetes.

The application is based on ongoing P-III study with material from the to-be-commercialized process and updated 3yrs. P-I/II data
 Additionally, the FDA has accepted the PMA for an AAV5 total antibody assay intended as CDx for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. The US FDA stated that they not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to review the application
 Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is gene therapy developed utilizing an AAV-factor VIII vector and has received FDA’s BT designation, EMA & FDA’s ODD for hemophilia A with its anticipated PDUFA date as Aug 21, 2020","No Advisory Committee Meeting Currently Planned to Review the Application
If approved, 1st Gene Therapy in U.S. for the Treatment of Any Type of Hemophilia
FDA Also Accepts Premarket Approval (PMA) Application for Companion Diagnostic Test, a 1st for a Gene Therapy
SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Feb. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq: BMRN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for its investigational AAV5 gene therapy, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, for adults with hemophilia A. This acceptance by the FDA marks the first marketing application accepted for a gene therapy product for any type of hemophilia in the United States.

The FDA has granted priority review designation to valoctocogene roxaparvovec, which is granted to drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date is August 21, 2020. The FDA has informed the company that they are not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application.
The application is based on a Phase 3 interim analysis of study participants treated with investigational product manufactured by the to-be-commercialized process and three-year Phase 1/2 data. BioMarin has constructed, commissioned, and validated one of the first gene therapy manufacturing facilities of its kind in the world. This award-winning facility is located in Novato, California. Marketing authorization documentation has been included in the applications, and the facility is ready for inspection to support approval.
In addition, the FDA has accepted the premarket approval (PMA) application for an AAV5 total antibody assay intended as a companion diagnostic test for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. With a low prevalence of pre-existing immunity to AAV5, BioMarin estimates that approximately 80% of people with hemophilia A in the US do not have preexisting immunity to AAV5 that would make them ineligible for AAV5-mediated gene therapy treatment. The assay is produced by ARUP Laboratories, a leading national reference laboratory and a nonprofit enterprise of the University of Utah and its Department of Pathology.
“Valoctocogene roxaparvovec has the potential to be the first gene therapy approved in any type of hemophilia and the acceptance of this application and its priority review status marks a significant milestone for gene therapies in general and for the hemophilia community specifically,” said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President, Global Research and Development at BioMarin. “We recognize the decades of scientific research that has allowed us to reach this stage of development. As pioneers in gene therapy, we are proud of the medical and technological innovation represented in valoctocogene roxaparvovec, which is possible because of the scientists who did the early research, clinical investigators, the hemophilia community and the people who work here. We look forward to working with the FDA to bring this groundbreaking therapy to people with hemophilia A.”
“The hemophilia community has been waiting for decades for gene therapies. The FDA acceptance of the filing and initiation of review for the first gene therapy for hemophilia A builds on years of scientific achievements in improving the standard of care for people with bleeding disorders,” said Doris V. Quon M.D., Medical Director, Orthopaedic Hemophilia Treatment Center at The Orthopaedic Institute for Children. “As a treating physician, I look forward to the possibility of having more treatment options for people with hemophilia.”
Regulatory Status in the U.S. and Europe
The FDA has granted valoctocogene roxaparvovec Breakthrough Therapy designation. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec has Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
The EMA validated the Company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for its investigational gene therapy, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, for adults with severe hemophilia A. The MAA review commenced in January 2020under accelerated assessment.
Recognizing valoctocogene roxaparvovec for its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs, EMA granted access to its Priority Medicines (PRIME) regulatory initiative in 2017 and recently granted BioMarin’s request for accelerated assessment of this MAA, potentially shortening the review period. This submission marks the first marketing application under review in Europe for a gene therapy product for any type of hemophilia.
Companion Diagnostic
The companion diagnostic is an AAV5 total antibody assay, which consists of a simple blood test to help identify patients most likely to respond to AAV5-based gene therapy. BioMarin implemented the test in multiple clinical studies evaluating valoctocogene roxaparvovec treatment of hemophilia A patients without antibodies to AAV5.
BioMarin partnered with ARUP, a laboratory with 35 years of experience supporting hospitals, physicians, and patients with unparalleled quality and service including two prior FDA companion diagnostic approvals, to develop this test. ARUP’s experience in developing FDA-approved, single-source companion diagnostic tests is unique among reference laboratories.
“We are delighted to have partnered with BioMarin on its hemophilia A gene therapy program,” said ARUP CEO Sherrie Perkins, MD, PhD. “Working with BioMarin on the simultaneous submission of the diagnostic and gene therapy applications aligns with our corporate commitment to providing outstanding patient care through cutting-edge diagnostic testing.”
About Hemophilia A
People living with hemophilia A lack enough functioning Factor VIII protein to help their blood clot and are at risk for painful and/or potentially life-threatening bleeds from even modest injuries. Additionally, people with the most severe form of hemophilia A often experience painful, spontaneous bleeds into their muscles or joints. Individuals with the most severe form of hemophilia A make up approximately 43 percent of the hemophilia A population. The standard of care for such individuals with hemophilia A is a prophylactic regimen of replacement Factor VIII infusions administered intravenously up to two to three times per week or 100 to 150 infusions per year. Despite these regimens, many people continue to experience bleeds, resulting in progressive and debilitating joint damage, which can have a major impact on their quality of life.
Hemophilia A, also called Factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia, is an X-linked genetic disorder caused by missing or defective Factor VIII, a clotting protein. Although it is passed down from parents to children, about 1/3 of cases are caused by a spontaneous mutation, a new mutation that was not inherited. Approximately 1 in 10,000 people have Hemophilia A.

27930,VBL Therapeutics to Initiate P-II Study Evaluating VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) + Nivolumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"VBL Therapeutics Announces the Launch of a New Clinical Trial of VB-111 Combined with the Checkpoint Inhibitor, Nivolumab, in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","The focus of the study is to evaluate the safety & tolerability of the combination therapy in addition to ORR as well as immunological and histologic readouts from tumor biopsies. The clinical study will be the first study to evaluate the combination of VB-111 with a checkpoint inhibitor
 The National Cancer Institute (NCI) will serve as an IND sponsor which has been approved by the US FDA. The study is expected to highlight the potential of VB-111 to turn “cold” colorectal tumors “hot”
 VB-111 is the first VTS-based therapy targeting the tumor vasculature for cancer therapies. The addition of nivolumab to the therapy may synergize the anti-tumor effect of VB-111","This clinical trial will investigate for the first time a combination of VB-111 with a checkpoint inhibitor.
Pathology readouts are expected to shed light on the potential of VB-111 to turn “cold” colorectal tumors “hot.”
TEL AVIV, Israel, Feb. 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — VBL Therapeutics (Nasdaq: VBLT) today announced the launch of a phase 2 clinical trial of VB-111 in combination with nivolumab (Opdivo®), an immune checkpoint inhibitor, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) will serve as the Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor for this study and the IND application has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This new study will investigate if priming with VB-111 can drive immune cells into the tumor and turn the colorectal tumor from immunologically “cold” to “hot.” The addition of nivolumab to VB-111 may further boost the anti-tumor immune response.
“This phase 2 study is part of our strategy to broaden the potential indications for VB-111 and to explore its activity as part of combination therapies,” said Dror Harats, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of VBL Therapeutics. “We look forward to collaborating with NCI on this clinical trial, as we continue to generate data which adds to our understanding of VB-111’s mechanism of action and therapeutic potential. We were particularly encouraged by results in ovarian cancer demonstrating the recruitment of infiltrating T cells into a tumor following treatment with VB-111, turning the tumor ‘hot’. This important finding suggests that VB-111 may be applied to other ‘cold’ tumors, in which checkpoint inhibitors show limited or no efficacy, including colorectal cancer, for which there remains a major unmet need.”
VBL and the NCI have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) under the direction of Tim F. Greten, M.D., Deputy Branch Chief & Senior Investigator of the Thoracic and GI Malignancies Branch (TGMB) and Co-Director of the NCI Center for Cancer Research (CCR) Liver Cancer Program. The goal of this open-label, single-arm phase 2 study is to evaluate VB-111 in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In addition to safety and tolerability, this study will evaluate efficacy endpoints including Best Overall Response, as well as immunological and histologic readouts from tumor biopsies. For additional information refer to https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04166383.

 The P-II/III ARTISTS 1 & P-III ARTISTS 2 studies resulted in not meeting its 1EPs i.e. reduction in motor and phonic tics as assessed by YGTSS-TTS. The studies were conducted in collaboration with Teva and Nuvelution Pharma
 Austedo is a VMAT2 inhibitor and has received the US FDA’s approval for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease in Apr’2017 and for tardive dyskinesia in Aug’2017","February 19, 2020 04:05 PM Eastern Standard Time
TEL AVIV, Israel–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) today announced the Phase 2/3 ARTISTS 1 and Phase 3 ARTISTS 2 trials designed to evaluate deutetrabenazine compared to placebo for the treatment of tics in pediatric patients with moderate to severe Tourette Syndrome failed to meet the primary endpoint of reduction in motor and phonic tics as assessed by the Total Tic Score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS).
“The results of the trials are disappointing, especially as there is such an unmet need for this community of pediatric patients”

In the data received this week, the most commonly reported adverse event in the ARTISTS 1 and ARTISTS 2 studies were headache, somnolence and fatigue. In this population, no new safety signals were identified that were inconsistent with the known safety profile of deutetrabenazine.
“The results of the trials are disappointing, especially as there is such an unmet need for this community of pediatric patients,” said Dr. Hafrun Fridriksdottir, Executive Vice President, Global R&D, at Teva. “As we assess a path forward, Teva is especially grateful to the investigators, patients and families who contributed to these studies for such an important patient population.”
The studies were conducted in partnership between Teva and Nuvelution Pharma, Inc.
Deutetrabenazine was approved by the FDA as AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine) tablets for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease in April 2017 and for tardive dyskinesia in adults in August 2017.
About ARTISTS 1
The ARTISTS 1 study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of deutetrabenazine in 119 pediatric patients (6-16 years) with moderate to severe Tourette Syndrome. Patients received either deutetrabenazine or placebo using a 1:1 randomization over 12 weeks of dosing. The primary endpoint was the change in the Total Tic Score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS) from baseline to week 12 between placebo and active treatment groups.
About ARTISTS 2
The ARTISTS 2 study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of deutetrabenazine in 158 pediatric patients (6-16 years) with moderate to severe Tourette Syndrome. Patients received either deutetrabenazine (low dose or high dose) or placebo using a 1:1:1 randomization over eight weeks of dosing. The primary endpoint was the change in the Total Tic Score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS) from baseline to week eight between placebo and active treatment groups.
About Tourette Syndrome
Tourette Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder with onset before age 18 years, characterized by motor and phonic tics that persist for greater than one year. Symptoms of Tourette Syndrome typically occur first in early childhood, with peak severity around the age of 10 years. Most individuals with Tourette Syndrome experience improvement of symptoms in late adolescence and into adulthood.
About AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine)
AUSTEDO® is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults and for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.
Indications and Usage
AUSTEDO® is indicated for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease and for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults.
Important Safety Information
Depression and Suicidality in Patients with Huntington’s Disease: AUSTEDO® can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntington’s disease. Balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for treatment of chorea. Closely monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Inform patients, their caregivers, and families of the risk of depression and suicidality and instruct them to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Exercise caution when treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation. AUSTEDO® is contraindicated in patients who are suicidal, and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression.
Contraindications: AUSTEDO® is contraindicated in patients with Huntington’s disease who are suicidal, or have untreated or inadequately treated depression. AUSTEDO® is also contraindicated in: patients with hepatic impairment; patients taking reserpine or within 20 days of discontinuing reserpine; patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of discontinuing MAOI therapy; and patients taking tetrabenazine (Xenazine®) or valbenazine (Ingrezza®).
Clinical Worsening and Adverse Events in Patients with Huntington’s Disease: AUSTEDO® may cause a worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity. Prescribers should periodically re-evaluate the need for AUSTEDO® in their patients by assessing the effect on chorea and possible adverse effects.
QTc Prolongation: Tetrabenazine, a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor, causes an increase in the corrected QT (QTc) interval. A clinically relevant QT prolongation may occur in some patients treated with AUSTEDO® who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers or are co-administered a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor. Dose reduction may be necessary. The use of AUSTEDO® in combination with other drugs known to prolong QTc may result in clinically significant QT prolongations. For patients requiring AUSTEDO® doses greater than 24 mg per day who are using AUSTEDO® with other drugs known to prolong QTc, assess the QTc interval before and after increasing the dose of AUSTEDO® or the other drugs. AUSTEDO® should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex reported in association with drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission, has been observed in patients receiving tetrabenazine. The risk may be increased by concomitant use of dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. The management of NMS should include immediate discontinuation of AUSTEDO®; intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems.
Akathisia, Agitation, and Restlessness: AUSTEDO® may increase the risk of akathisia, agitation, and restlessness. The risk of akathisia may be increased by concomitant use of dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. If a patient develops akathisia, the AUSTEDO® dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.
Parkinsonism: AUSTEDO® may cause parkinsonism in patients with Huntington’s disease or tardive dyskinesia. Parkinsonism has also been observed with other VMAT2 inhibitors. The risk of parkinsonism may be increased by concomitant use of dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. If a patient develops parkinsonism, the AUSTEDO® dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.
Sedation and Somnolence: Sedation is a common dose-limiting adverse reaction of AUSTEDO®. Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or hazardous machinery, until they are on a maintenance dose of AUSTEDO® and know how the drug affects them. Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and somnolence.
Hyperprolactinemia: Tetrabenazine elevates serum prolactin concentrations in humans. If there is a clinical suspicion of symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, appropriate laboratory testing should be done and consideration should be given to discontinuation of AUSTEDO®.
Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues: Deutetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues and could accumulate in these tissues over time. Prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects.
CYP2D6 Metabolism: In patients who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers or are taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, the total daily dosage of AUSTEDO® should not exceed 36 mg (maximum single dose of 18 mg).
Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions for AUSTEDO® (>8% and greater than placebo) in a controlled clinical study in patients with Huntington’s disease were somnolence, diarrhea, dry mouth, and fatigue. The most common adverse reactions for AUSTEDO® (4% and greater than placebo) in controlled clinical studies in patients with tardive dyskinesia were nasopharyngitis and insomnia.

About Rozlytrek
Rozlytrek is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1) and TRK (neurotrophin receptors) family strongly and selectively. It blocks ROS1 and TRK kinase activity, and inhibits proliferation of cancer cells with ROS1 or NTRK gene fusions. Rozlytrek was approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that harbor NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions in June 18, 2019 and was launched in September 4, 2019.
About ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC
ROS1 fusion gene is an abnormal gene that can be formed by fusing the ROS1 gene and other genes (CD74, etc.) as a result of chromosomal translocation for some reason. The ROS1 fusion kinase made from ROS1 fusion gene is thought to promote cancer cell proliferation. ROS1 fusion gene is found in about 1 to 2% of NSCLC, among which it is more expressed in adenocarcinoma.1)

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 21, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Esperion (NASDAQ:ESPR) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) tablet, an oral, once-daily, non-statin LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering medicine. NEXLETOL is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLETOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. NEXLETOL is the first oral, once-daily, non-statin LDL-C lowering medicine approved since 2002 for indicated patients.
NEXLETOL is a first-in-class ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver.
“NEXLETOL delivers upon a commitment we’ve made to millions of patients for a new treatment alternative if they struggle with bad cholesterol and have ASCVD or HeFH,” said Tim Mayleben, president and chief executive officer of Esperion. “Even with maximally tolerated statins, which may mean no statin at all, some of these patients can’t achieve their LDL-C goals. Today’s approval provides them with a new medicine to go along with a healthy diet. We express our sincere gratitude to all of the patients and physicians who put their confidence in Esperion’s team of lipid experts.”
LDL-C is a waxy, fat-like substance that’s found in the body. Elevated LDL-C contributes to a buildup of this fat in the arteries and can lead to cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke. Despite standard of care treatments, including statin therapy, it is estimated nearly 15 million patients (approximately one in four patients) in the U.S. cannot achieve guideline recommended LDL-C levels.
“The FDA approval of NEXLETOL provides an important option for patients living with elevated LDL-C and ASCVD or increased risk for cardiovascular disease because of HeFH,” said Christie M. Ballantyne, M.D., chairman of Esperion’s Phase 3 Executive Committee and professor and chief of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “There are millions of patients who are unable to reach their LDL-C targets despite available medicines. NEXLETOL is the first oral, once-daily, non-statin treatment option for indicated patients in nearly two decades.”
The approval of NEXLETOL is supported by a global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program conducted in more than 3,000 patients. In these studies, NEXLETOL provided an average of 18 percent placebo corrected LDL-C lowering when used with moderate or high intensity statins. Results from the Phase 3 development program have been published in The New England Journal of Medicine (040 Study), and The Journal of the American Medical Association (047 Study).
NEXLETOL was generally well-tolerated in clinical studies. Label warnings and precautions include hyperuricemia, with the development of gout in a small percentage of patients, as well as increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. Overall in Phase 3 studies, the adverse events reported most frequently in patients who received NEXLETOL were generally reported at similar rates in patients who received placebo. The most common adverse events reported with NEXLETOL (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infections, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The majority of adverse events reported with NEXLETOL were mild to moderate in severity and balanced in occurrence with adverse events in patients receiving placebo. For additional information on NEXLETOL, please see Full Prescribing Information at Esperion.com.
Today’s approval underscores Esperion’s commitment to deliver NEXLETOL to adult patients suffering from ASCVD or HeFH and who are unable to reach their LDL-C goal on maximally tolerated statins. Esperion is working with health insurance providers to help ensure broad insurance coverage and patient access to NEXLETOL. Eligible patients with commercial drug insurance coverage for NEXLETOL may pay as little as $10 per fill, up to a 3-month supply. Additionally, Esperion is committed to achieving the lowest branded tier coverage for Medicare patients. Esperion will provide resources to patients whose physician recommends treatment with NEXLETOL. These resources include educational materials, a dedicated call center, as well as a co-pay program for eligible patients.
NEXLETOL will be commercially available in the U.S., by prescription only, on March 30, 2020.
Esperion’s second LDL-C lowering medicine, the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination tablet, is currently under review by the U.S. FDA; the PDUFA goal date is February 26, 2020.

NEXLETOLTM (bempedoic acid) Tablet
NEXLETOL is a first-in-class ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by reducing cholesterol biosynthesis and up-regulating the LDL receptors. Completed Phase 3 studies conducted in more than 3,000 patients, with over 2,000 patients treated with NEXLETOL, demonstrated an average 18 percent placebo corrected LDL-C lowering when used in patients on moderate or high-intensity statins. NEXLETOL is the first oral, once-daily, non-statin LDL-C lowering medicine approved in the U.S. in nearly 20 years for patients with ASCVD or HeFH. NEXLETOL was approved by the FDA in February 2020.
Indication and Limitation of Use
NEXLETOL is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLETOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.
Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions:
Elevations in serum uric acid have occurred. Assess uric acid levels periodically as clinically indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia, and initiate treatment with urate-lowering drugs as appropriate. The risk for gout events with NEXLETOL was higher in patients with a prior history of gout although gout also occurred more frequently than placebo in patients treated with NEXLETOL who had no prior gout history.
Tendon rupture has occurred. Discontinue NEXLETOL at the first sign of tendon rupture. Avoid NEXLETOL in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture.
Adverse Reactions:
The most common (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia and elevated liver enzymes.
Drug Interactions:
Avoid concomitant use of NEXLETOL with simvastatin greater than 20 mg.
Avoid concomitant use of NEXLETOL with pravastatin greater than 40 mg.

CLEAR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial
The effect of NEXLETOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Esperion initiated a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) to assess the effects of NEXLETOL on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiovascular disease (CVD) who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and are considered “statin averse.” The CVOT — known as CLEAR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial — is an event-driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that completed enrollment in August 2019 of 14,032 patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk at over 1,400 sites in 32 countries.
Esperion Therapeutics
Through scientific and clinical excellence, and a deep understanding of cholesterol biology, the experienced Lipid Management Team at Esperion is committed to developing new LDL-C lowering medicines that will make a substantial impact on reducing global cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death around the world.

Esperion Therapeutics’ Commitment to Patients with Hyperlipidemia
High levels of LDL-C can lead to a build-up of fat and cholesterol in and on artery walls (known as atherosclerosis), potentially leading to cardiovascular events, including heart attack or stroke. In the U.S., 96 million people, or more than 37 percent of the adult population, have elevated LDL-C. There are approximately 18 million people in the U.S. with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) living with elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy — including individuals considered statin averse — leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events1. In the United States, more than 50 percent of ASCVD patients who are not able to reach their LDL-C with statins alone need less than a 40 percent reduction to reach their LDL-C threshold2.
Esperion’s mission as the Lipid Management Company is to deliver oral, once-daily medicines that complement existing oral drugs to provide the additional LDL-C lowering that these patients need.

Ofatumumab is a novel B-cell therapy that delivers sustained efficacy with a favorable safety profile1
If approved, ofatumumab has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for a broad RMS population and the first B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home using an autoinjector pen
Regulatory approval for ofatumumab in the US is expected in June 2020 and in Europe by Q2 2021
Basel, February 24, 2020 — Novartis today announced that both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have accepted the company’s Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for ofatumumab (OMB157) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in adults. Ofatumumab is a novel B-cell therapy that delivers sustained efficacy with a favorable safety profile1. If approved, ofatumumab has the potential to become a first-choice treatment for a broad RMS population and the first B-cell therapy that is easy to start and manage in a monthly subcutaneous injection that can be self-administered at home using an autoinjector pen.
The regulatory applications are based on positive data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, which investigated the efficacy and safety of monthly subcutaneous ofatumumab 20mg versus once daily oral Aubagio®* (teriflunomide) 14mg in adults with RMS2,3. In both head-to-head studies, ofatumumab demonstrated superiority over Aubagio® in patients with RMS1. Both studies met the primary endpoints where ofatumumab showed a highly significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the number of confirmed relapses, evaluated as the annualized relapse rate (ARR)1. Key secondary endpoints of delaying time to confirmed disability progression† (CDP) were also met1. Data presented at the 35th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) showed that compared to Aubagio®, ofatumumab:

Reduced the ARR by 50.5% (0.11 vs. 0.22) and 58.5% (0.10 vs. 0.25) (p<0.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II respectively1
Showed highly significant suppression of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions, demonstrating a profound abrogation of new inflammatory activity1
Showed a relative risk reduction of 34.4% (p=0.002) in three-month CDP and 32.5% (p=0.012) in six-month CDP in pre-specified pooled analyses1
Overall ofatumumab, a potent, fully-human antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered efficacy with a favorable safety profile1. The safety profile of ofatumumab as seen in the ASCLEPIOS studies is in line with the observations from Phase II results1,4.
In addition, Novartis has completed the APLIOS study, an open-label Phase II study, to determine the bioequivalence of subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab via a pre-filled syringe – as used in ASCLEPIOS I and II – and an autoinjector pen in patients with RMS5. The positive results of the study will be presented at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum in Florida, US. These results show that ofatumumab offers a highly effective B-cell therapy that can be self-administered at home using a patient-friendly autoinjector pen.
“We are excited that ofatumumab has the potential to be a powerful first-choice treatment option for patients and physicians looking for an impactful intervention,” said Krishnan Ramanathan, Neuroscience Global Program Head at Novartis. “With ofatumumab, we underpin our relentless dedication to reimagine medicine for patients across the MS spectrum and will work closely with the regulatory authorities to ensure it is available for people living with MS as soon as possible.”
Regulatory approval for ofatumumab in the US is expected in June 2020 and in Europe by Q2 2021. Novartis is committed to bringing ofatumumab to patients worldwide and additional regulatory filings are currently underway.
About ofatumumab
Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) self-administered by a once-monthly subcutaneous injection in development for RMS. Ofatumumab works by binding to the CD20 molecule on the B-cell surface, distinct from that of other anti-CD20 antibodies, and induces potent B-cell lysis and depletion4. The selective mechanism of action and subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab allows precise delivery to the lymph nodes, where B-cell depletion in MS is needed, while sparing those in the spleen that help maintain protective immunity4,5. Once-monthly dosing of ofatumumab also allows faster repletion of B-cells4, and offers more flexibility as no first dose observations or laboratory monitoring is required. Novartis obtained rights for ofatumumab from Genmab in all indications, including MS, in December 2015.
About ASCLEPIOS I and II studies
The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies are twin, identical design, flexible duration (up to 30 months), double-blind, randomized, multi-center Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab 20mg monthly subcutaneous injections versus Aubagio® 14mg oral tablets taken once daily in adults with RMS2,3. The ASCLEPIOS I and II studies enrolled 1,882 patients with MS, between the ages of 18 and 55 years, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.52,3. The studies were conducted in over 350 sites in 37 countries. Ofatumumab demonstrated a reduction in ARR by 50.5% (0.11 vs. 0.22) and 58.5% (0.10 vs. 0.25) compared to Aubagio® (p<0.001 in both studies) in ASCLEPIOS I and II respectively. It showed highly significant suppression of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions, demonstrating a profound suppression of new inflammatory activity. Ofatumumab also showed a relative risk reduction of 34.4% (p=0.002) in three-month CDP and 32.5% (p=0.012) in six-month CDP compared to Aubagio® in pre-specified pooled analyses. Overall ofatumumab, a potent, fully-human antibody targeting CD20 positive B-cells, delivered efficacy with a favorable safety profile. The safety profile of ofatumumab as seen in the ASCLEPIOS studies is in line with the observations from Phase II results1,4. Additional secondary endpoints included confirmed disability improvement at six months, serum levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), and rate of brain volume loss2,3.
About APLIOS study5
The APLIOS study is a 12-week, open-label, Phase II bioequivalence study to determine the bioequivalence of subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab via a pre-filled syringe – as used in ASCLEPIOS I and II – and an autoinjector pen in patients with RMS and to evaluate the onset of B-cell depletion with ofatumumab subcutaneous monthly injections. Patients were randomized according to injection device and site including the abdomen and the thigh. B-cell depletion was measured nine times over 12 weeks. The positive results of the study will be presented at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum in Florida, US.
About Multiple Sclerosis
MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss6. MS, which affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide7, is often characterized into three forms: primary progressive MS (PPMS)8, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), which follows from an initial RRMS course and is characterized by physical and cognitive changes over time, in presence or absence of relapses, leading to a progressive accumulation of neurological disability9. Approximately 85% of patients initially present with relapsing forms of MS7.
About Novartis in MS
In addition to ofatumumab, the Novartis MS portfolio also includes Gilenya® (fingolimod, an S1P modulator), which is indicated in the EU for the treatment of adult patients and children and adolescents 10 years of age and older with RRMS. In the US, Gilenya is approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with RMS, to include CIS‡, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease.
Mayzent is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that selectively binds to S1P1 and S1P5 receptors. In the US, Mayzent is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include CIS‡, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. In the EU, Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with SPMS with active disease evidenced by relapsing or imaging features of inflammatory activity. In November 2019, Novartis received approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for Mayzent for adult patients with SPMS.
Extavia® (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the US for RMS, to include CIS‡, relapsing remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. In Europe, Extavia is approved to treat people with RRMS, SPMS with active disease and people who have had a single clinical event suggestive of MS.
In the US, the Sandoz Division of Novartis markets Glatopa® (glatiramer acetate injection) 20mg/mL and 40mg/mL, generic versions of Teva’s glatiramer acetate.

27985,Eli Lilly's Trulicity (dulaglutide) Receives the US FDA's Approval to Reduce MACE in T2D Adults,Trulicity® (dulaglutide) is the first and only type 2 diabetes medicine approved to reduce cardiovascular events in adults with and without established cardiovascular disease,"The approval follows the REWIND study which involves assessing of Trulicity + SoC (1.5mg) vs PBO + SoC in adults with T2D
 The study showed reduction in MACE events and the profile of Trulicity was consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) class
 Trulicity is an injectable prescription medicine for adults with T2D used for the improving blood sugar level and reduction of MACE","New indication reflects distinct patient population in the REWIND study, including primarily people with multiple cardiovascular risk factors but without established cardiovascular disease
INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 21, 2020/PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Trulicity® (dulaglutide) for the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with type 2 diabetes who have established cardiovascular (CV) disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This decision makes Eli Lilly and Company’s (NYSE: LLY) Trulicity the first and only type 2 diabetes medicine approved to reduce the risk of MACE for both primary and secondary prevention populations.*
The new indication reflects the differentiated patient population of REWIND, the Trulicity cardiovascular outcomes trial. While all participants had CV risk factors, the study consisted primarily of people without established CV disease. REWIND showed a significant risk reduction in MACE, a composite endpoint of nonfatal myocardial infarction (heart attack), nonfatal stroke or CV death. Results demonstrated consistent MACE risk reduction with Trulicity across major demographic and disease subgroups. Trulicity’s safety profile was consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) class. The most common adverse events leading to the discontinuation of Trulicity were gastrointestinal events.
“The trial was designed to study a broad population of people living with type 2 diabetes, reflective of those in the general population. We therefore assessed the effect of Trulicity in people with established cardiovascular disease as well as those with multiple cardiovascular risk factors,” said Hertzel Gerstein, M.D., MSc, FRCPC, professor of medicine and deputy director of the Population Health Institute at McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences, and the REWIND study chair. “Globally, over 415 million people have type 2 diabetes, which is itself a cardiovascular risk factor. However, only about one third have established cardiovascular disease, which is why this new indication, and the supporting evidence, is important for the millions of people in the U.S. living with diabetes.”
“For the first time, health care providers can prescribe a diabetes medicine proven to significantly reduce the risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event for people with type 2 diabetes with and without established cardiovascular disease,” said Sherry Martin M.D., vice president, medical affairs, Lilly. “Trulicity can help people achieve their A1C goals and protect them from experiencing a cardiovascular event with a once-weekly, easy-to-use treatment option.”
Trulicity has been available in the U.S. since 2014 and is the number one prescribed GLP-1 RA. In addition to its proven glycemic efficacy and easy-to-use device**, Trulicity can now be prescribed to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their risk of CV events.
About the REWIND Study
REWIND (Researching cardiovascular Events with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the effect of Trulicity 1.5 mg, a weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), compared to placebo, both added to standard of care (according to local standard of care guidelines), on cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary CV outcome was the first occurrence of MACE (the composite of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke). Secondary outcomes include each component of the primary composite CV outcome, a composite clinical microvascular outcome comprising retinal or renal disease, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure requiring hospitalization or an urgent heart failure visit, and all-cause mortality. The 9,901 participants from 24 countries had a mean duration of diabetes of 10.5 years and a median baseline A1C of 7.2 percent. While all participants had CV risk factors, only 31.5 percent of the study participants had established CV disease. Prior (or established) cardiovascular disease in REWIND was defined as prior myocardial infarction, prior ischemic stroke, prior unstable angina, prior revascularization (coronary, carotid, or peripheral), prior hospitalization for ischemia-related events (unstable angina or myocardial ischemia on imaging, or need for percutaneous coronary intervention), or prior documented myocardial ischemia.
The REWIND trial’s international scope, high proportion of women, high proportion of people without established cardiovascular disease and inclusion of participants with a lower mean baseline A1C suggest that the findings will be directly relevant to the typical type 2 diabetes patient seen in general practice.

 Vyepti is mAb that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand further blocking the binding to receptors. The company has also submitted marketing application in Canada with expected submission to EU in 2020","In two clinical studies (PROMISE-1 in episodic migraine and PROMISE-2 in chronic migraine), Vyepti met its primary endpoint: decrease in mean monthly migraine days (MMD) over months 1-3.[i]
A treatment benefit over placebo was observed for both doses of Vyepti as early as day 1 post-infusion, and the percentage of patients experiencing a migraine was lower for Vyepti than with placebo for most of the first 7 days.i
In both studies, Vyepti demonstrated a sustained reduction of MMD through the second dose (month 6).i
Valby, Denmark, February 22, 2020 – H. Lundbeck A/S today announced that Vyepti™ (eptinezumab-jjmr) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults and will be available in April 2020.i The recommended dose is 100 mg every 3 months; some patients may benefit from a dose of 300 mg.i Vyepti is the first FDA-approved intravenous (IV) treatment for migraine prevention.
Dr. Deborah Dunsire, President and CEO of Lundbeck, commented “With the approval of Vyepti, I am pleased that we are now able to offer a new IV therapy that achieves the key treatment goal of preventing migraine over time while also delivering on the need for earlier onset of efficacy. The Vyepti clinical program is the first to demonstrate this early benefit.”
The efficacy and safety of Vyepti was demonstrated in two phase III clinical trials (PROMISE-1 in episodic migraine and PROMISE-2 in chronic migraine).i The clinical trial program demonstrated a treatment benefit over placebo that was observed for both doses of Vyepti as early as day 1 post-infusion, and the percentage of patients experiencing a migraine was lower for VYEPTI than with placebo for most of the first 7 days.i The safety of VYEPTI was evaluated in 2,076 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of Vyepti.i The most common adverse reactions (≥2 percent and at least 2 percent or greater than placebo) in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine were nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity.i In PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2, 1.9 percent of patients treated with Vyepti discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.i
“The PROMISE-2 data showed that many patients can achieve reduction in migraine days of at least 75 percent and experience a sustained migraine improvement through 6 months, which is clinically meaningful to both physicians and patients,” said Dr. Peter Goadsby, a professor of neurology at King’s College, London and the University of California, San Francisco. “Vyepti is a valuable addition for the treatment of migraine, which can help reduce the burden of this serious disease.” 
About the PROMISE Clinical Trial Program
The efficacy of Vyepti™ (eptinezumab-jjmr) was evaluated as a preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine in two randomized, placebo-controlled studies, both with 6-month double-blind periods: one study in episodic (PROMISE-1; defined as 4-14 headache days per month, of which at least 4 were migraine days) and one study in patients with chronic migraine (PROMISE-2; defined as 15-26 headache days per month, of which at least 8 were migraine days).i In both studies, patients were randomized to receive placebo, Vyepti 100 mg, or Vyepti 300 mg.i The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean MMD over months 1-3.i Patients were allowed to use concurrent acute migraine or headache medications, including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives), during the trial.i Both studies excluded patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, ischemic heart disease), neurological disease, and cerebrovascular disease.i In PROMISE-2, the study population included patients with a dual diagnosis of chronic migraine and medication overuse headache attributable to acute-medication overuse of triptans, ergotamine, or combination analgesics greater than 10 days per month.i
PROMISE-1: A total of 665 patients were randomized to receive placebo (N=222), 100 mg Vyepti (N=221), or 300 mg Vyepti (N=222) every 3 months for 12 months.i

Mean migraine frequency at baseline was approximately 8.6 migraine days per month and was similar across treatment groups.i
Mean change from baseline in MMD with Vyepti compared with placebo months 1-3: -3.9 days for 100 mg (p=0.018), -4.3 days for 300 mg (p<0.001), and -3.2 days for placebo.i
Percent responders with at least 50 percent reduction in MMD in months 1-3 compared with placebo: 49.8 percent for 100 mg (nominal statistical significance p=0.009), 56.3 percent for 300 mg (p<0.001), and 37.4 percent for placebo.i
Percent responders with at least 75 percent reduction in MMD in months 1-3: 22.2 percent for 100 mg (p=NS*), 29.7 percent for 300 mg (p<0.001), and 16.2 percent for placebo.i
Greater percentage of placebo-treated patients had migraine on most days during the first 7 days of treatment compared to Vyepti -treated patients.i
*NS = Not statistically significant
PROMISE-2: A total of 1,072 patients were randomized to receive placebo (N=366), 100 mg Vyepti (N=356) or 300 mg Vyepti (N=350) every 3 months for 6 months.i

Mean migraine frequency at baseline was approximately 16.1 migraine days per month and was similar across treatment groups.i
Mean change from baseline in MMD compared with placebo months 1-3: -7.7 days for 100 mg (p<0.001), -8.2 days for 300 mg (p<0.001), and -5.6 days for placebo.i
Percent responders with at least 50 percent reduction in MMD in months 1-3 compared with placebo: 57.6 percent for 100 mg (p<0.001), 61.4 percent for 300 mg (p<0.001), and 39.3 percent for placebo.i
Percent responders with at least 75 percent reduction in MMD in months 1-3: 26.7 percent for 100 mg (p<0.001), 33.1 percent for 300 mg (p<0.001), and 15.0 percent for placebo.i
Greater percentage of placebo-treated patients had migraine on each individual day during the first 7 days of treatment compared to Vyepti-treated patients.i
About VYEPTI™
Vyepti™ (eptinezumab-jjmr) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand and blocks its binding to the receptor.i
Lundbeck has submitted an application for market authorization of Vyepti in Canada and also plans to file in the European Union during 2020, followed by the submission of applications in other regions and countries around the world, including China and Japan.
About Migraine
Migraine is a complex and incapacitating neurological disease characterized by recurrent episodes of severe headaches typically accompanied by an array of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound.[ii] It is estimated to affect approximately 39 million people in the U.S. and mora than 1.3 billion worldwide, and impacts three times as many women than men.[iii],[iv],[v] It is the second leading cause of years lived with disability (YLD) among all diseases, and is the top YLD cause among patients aged 15 to 49 years, according to the Global Burden of Disease study.[vi] Migraine has a profound impact on patients’ lives, their relationships, as well as their ability to carry out activities of daily living.v More than 157 million work days are lost each year in the U.S. due to migraine. iii

 The focus of the collaboration is to evaluate the combination of GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system with Clover’s S-Trimer as a vaccine candidate utilizing its own Timer-Tag technology to develop vaccines for corona virus
 Trimer-Tag technology is a drug development platform involved in production of novel covalently-trimerized fusion proteins targeted to these previously undruggable pathways","Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a China based global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, announced today that it has entered into a research collaboration with GSK for its protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate (COVID-19 S-Trimer). GSK will provide Clover with its pandemic adjuvant system for further evaluation of S-Trimer in preclinical studies. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.
“We are proud to contribute to cutting edge research from scientists at Clover Biopharmaceuticals in China as part of our strategy to make our adjuvant technology available to selected partners who have a promising vaccine candidate against the newly emerged coronavirus.” said Thomas Breuer, Chief Medical Officer of GSK Vaccines. “The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protect more people.”
GSK is a leader in the development of innovative vaccines using different adjuvant systems. An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response, thereby creating a stronger and longer lasting immunity against infections than the vaccine alone.
“At Clover we look forward to evaluating the combination of GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system and our S-Trimer as a vaccine candidate. Utilizing our proprietary Timer-Tag© technology that has been shown to be recognized by antibodies produced by multiple previously-infected coronavirus patients, S-Trimer is being rapidly developed to support global efforts in combating this current and any future coronavirus outbreaks,” said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover.
“We are proud to work with GSK, and we are encouraged by the progress of our S-Trimer vaccine program,” said Steven Gong, VP Business Development & Strategy at Clover. “To this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we continue to invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.”
Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of the newly-identified SARS-CoV-2 virus last month, Clover scientists started designing the viral spike (S)-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing its patented Trimer-Tag© technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system.

Many major disease targets are trimerization-dependent such as the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (involved in extrinsic apoptosis, immune co-stimulation and inflammation) as well as enveloped RNA virus antigens responsible for entry into host cells. Clover is using Trimer-Tag technology to create trimerized fusion proteins that are able to effectively target these previously undruggable pathways.

About Wuhan Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus identified in late 2019 and belongs to a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. The virus which causes a disease recently named COVID-19, has never before been found in humans. Since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has infected over 75,000 people and has caused over 2,100 reported deaths (as of 21st February 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently there is no vaccine available for COVID-19.

About S-Trimer COVID-19 Vaccine
S-Trimer is a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein subunit vaccine candidate. Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry, making it the primary target antigen for vaccine development. S-Trimer resembles the native trimeric viral spike protein and is produced via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system.

With increasing medicine shortages that critically impact patient care, the new entity would contribute to supporting and securing API manufacturing as well as supply capacities for Europe and beyond. In Europe, the new API industry champion is expected to help in balancing the industry’s heavy reliance on API sourced from the Asian region3.

The new company would rank as the world’s second largest API company with approximately €1 billion in expected sales by 2022. It is expected to include 3,100 skilled employees and to be headquartered in France. A planned IPO on Euronext Paris would be evaluated with a decision expected by 2022, subject to market conditions.

Philippe Luscan, Executive Vice President, Global Industrial Affairs at Sanofi, said “Based on the expertise and experience built over decades within our industrial network, this new entity would help ensure a greater stability in supplying drugs to millions of patients in Europe and beyond. With this endeavor, this new entity would be agile as a standalone company, and able to unlock its growth potential, especially in capturing new third-party sales and all the opportunities of a market growing at a pace of 6 % per year4.”

By operating independently, the new entity plans to increase its sales to third parties and to expand its partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies in order to take advantage of new growth opportunities and have the ability to deftly adapt to customer needs. The new company would be uniquely positioned to benefit from its significant competitive strengths, including a broad portfolio of both volume and niche products, high standards of quality, competitive pricing, state-of-the-art industrial capabilities and technologies across Europe (including France, Italy, Germany, Hungary, and the United Kingdom) as well as leveraging an extensive commercial network covering more than 80 countries.

Sanofi is fully committed to the new company’s success and intends to establish a long-term customer relationship with the new API supplier and to hold a minority stake of approximately 30% in the new company. To provide the optimal conditions for success, Sanofi intends the new company to be debt free in order to maximize its future investment capacities, and is committed to remaining an important customer.

*About Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API):

28047,Roche Reports Acceptance of BLA for Fixed-Dose SC Combination of Perjeta and Herceptin to Treat HER2-Positive Breast Cancer,FDA accepts Roche’s Biologics License Application for fixed-dose subcutaneous combination of Perjeta and Herceptin for HER2-positive breast cancer,"The BLA is based on P-III FeDeriCa study assessing FDC of Perjeta + Herceptin (SC) + CT vs Perjeta + Herceptin (IV) + CT in 500 patients with HER2-positive eBC who are being treated in the neoadjuvant & adjuvant settings
 The P-III FeDeriCa study resulted in meeting its 1EPs & 2EPs i.e. non-inferior levels of Perjeta & Herceptin in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough) respectively, demonstrated comparable total pCR, no new signals were identified including no differences in cardiac toxicity
 The FDC combination is a new SC formulation that combines Perjeta and Herceptin with Halozyme’s Enhanze drug delivery technology which is based on (rHuPH20) with its expected FDA’s approval by Oct 18, 2020","Fixed-dose combination administered under the skin in just minutes, compared to hours with intravenous administration, significantly reducing time spent receiving treatment
US Food Drug and Administration is expected to decide on approval by 18 October 2020
Basel, 25 February 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of Perjeta® (pertuzumab) and Herceptin® (trastuzumab) with hyaluronidase, administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in combination with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, for the treatment of eligible patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The BLA for the FDC is based on results from the phase III FeDeriCa study, which demonstrated non-inferior levels of Perjeta in the blood (pharmacokinetics) and comparable efficacy and safety to standard IV infusions of Perjeta plus Herceptin and chemotherapy.1
“For more than two decades, our medicines have redefined the standard of care for people with HER2-positive breast cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Today’s acceptance builds upon our commitment by potentially offering patients a faster way to administer Perjeta and Herceptin. We’re working with the FDA to bring this treatment option to patients as quickly as possible.”
SC administration of the FDC takes approximately eight minutes for the initial loading dose and approximately five minutes for each subsequent maintenance dose.1 This is compared to approximately 150 minutes for infusion of a loading dose of Perjeta and Herceptin using the standard IV formulations, and between 60-150 minutes for subsequent maintenance infusions of the two medicines.2,3,4
The FeDeriCa study met its primary endpoint, with SC administration of the FDC showing non-inferior levels of Perjeta in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough) when compared to IV administration of Perjeta. A secondary endpoint of non-inferior Ctrough of Herceptin was also met. A non-inferiority endpoint was chosen for the study to ensure that people were receiving sufficient dosing with Perjeta and Herceptin as compared to the established IV doses at the same treatment intervals. In addition, rates of total pathological complete response (pCR), another secondary endpoint, were comparable between the treatment arms. The safety profile of the FDC in combination with chemotherapy was comparable to that of IV administration of Perjeta plus Herceptin and chemotherapy and no new safety signals were identified, including no meaningful difference in cardiac toxicity. The most common adverse events in both arms were alopecia, nausea, diarrhoea and anaemia.1
In previous studies of other SC formulations, SC administration has been shown to be strongly preferred by the majority of patients compared to IV administration of the same medicine, with the most common reason being that administration required less time in the clinic.5,6 In the PHranceSCa study, Roche is currently investigating patient preference for SC administration of the FDC compared to standard IV administration of Perjeta and Herceptin in people with HER2-positive early breast cancer (eBC).7 Interim results of this phase II study will be presented at a future medical meeting.
About the FeDeriCa study8
FeDeriCa is an international, multi-centre, two-arm, randomised, open-label, phase III study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of SC injection of the FDC of Perjeta and Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy, compared with standard IV infusions of Perjeta and Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy, in 500 people with HER2-positive eBC who are being treated in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery) settings. The primary endpoint of the study is minimum levels of Perjeta in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough). Secondary endpoints include safety; minimum levels of Herceptin in the blood during a given dosing interval (Ctrough); and total pCR, meaning there is no tumour tissue detectable in the tissue removed at the time of surgery.
About the FDC of Perjeta and Herceptin
The FDC of Perjeta and Herceptin is a new SC formulation that combines Perjeta and Herceptin with Halozyme Therapeutics’ Enhanze® drug delivery technology.
Pertuzumab in the FDC is the same monoclonal antibody as in IV Perjeta, and trastuzumab in the FDC is the same monoclonal antibody as in IV Herceptin. The mechanisms of action of Perjeta and Herceptin are believed to complement each other as both bind to the HER2 receptor, but in different locations. The combination of Perjeta and Herceptin is thought to provide a more comprehensive, dual blockade of the HER signaling pathways.9,10
The standard IV formulation of Perjeta in combination with IV Herceptin and chemotherapy (the Perjeta-based regimen) is approved in over 100 countries for the treatment of both early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In the neoadjuvant eBC setting, the Perjeta-based regimen has been shown to almost double the rate of pCR compared to Herceptin and chemotherapy.11 Additionally, the combination has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence of invasive disease or death in the adjuvant eBC setting.12 In the metastatic setting, the combination has shown an unprecedented survival benefit in previously untreated (first-line) patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.13
Halozyme’s Enhanze drug delivery technology may enable and optimise SC drug delivery for appropriate co-administered therapeutics. The technology is based on a proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), an enzyme that temporarily degrades hyaluronan – a glycosaminoglycan or chain of natural sugars in the body – to aid in the dispersion and absorption of other injected therapeutic drugs.14

About Roche’s medicines for HER2-positive breast cancer
Roche has been leading research into the HER2 pathway for over 30 years and is committed to improving the health, quality of life and survival of people with both early and metastatic HER2-positive disease. HER2-positive breast cancer is a particularly aggressive form of the disease that affects approximately 15-20% of patients.15 Roche has developed three innovative medicines that have helped transform the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: Herceptin® (trastuzumab), Perjeta® (pertuzumab) and Kadcyla® (trastuzumab emtansine). Eligibility for treatment with Roche’s HER2-targeted medicines is determined via a diagnostic test which identifies people who will likely benefit from these medicines at the onset of their disease.

CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts, and OSAKA, Japan – ( BUSINESS WIRE ) – 
Takeda Announces FDA Has Prioritized the Additional Request for New Drug for ALUNBRIG ® (brigatinib) as First- Line Treatment for Cancer Cancer ALK + metastatic non-small cell lung 

T akeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502 / NYSE: TAK) announces today that the United States Food and Drug Administration has granted a priority review to the company’s Supplemental New Drug Request (sNDA) in preparation for to expand the use of ALUNBRIG (brigatinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer like ALK + (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) detected by an FDA approved test . ALUNBRIG is a new generation tyrosine kinase (ITK) inhibitor designed to target and inhibit genetic alterations in ALK.

“ NSCLC ALK + is a rare and serious form of lung cancer that is difficult to treat. Although progress has been made, unmet needs still exist for approximately 40,000 patients who are diagnosed worldwide each year, “said Christopher Arendt, head of the Oncology Therapy Unit at Takeda. ” This is an important first step in expanding treatment options for people with metastatic ALK + NSCLC in the United States, and we look forward to continuing to work alongside regulatory authorities around the world to offer ALUNBRIG to newly diagnosed patients. “
The sNDA for ALUNBRIG as a first-line treatment is based on the results of the ALTA-1L Phase 3 trial, which evaluates the safety and efficacy profile of ALUNBRIG in patients with NSCLC. Locally advanced or metastatic ALK + that has not already received treatment with an ALK inhibitor, compared to that of crizotinib in the same population. The ALTA-1L trial met its primary endpoint, ALUNBRIG demonstrating superiority over crizotinib in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) assessed blindly by an independent review committee.
About the ALTA-1L trial
The ALTA-1L ( A LK in L ung Cancer T rial of Brig A tinib in 1 st L ine) Phase 3 trial of ALUNBRIG in adults is a current, randomized, open, comparative and multicenter global study of 275 patients (ALUNBRIG, n = 137, crizotinib, n = 138) suffering from locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC already never treated with an ALK inhibitor. Patients received either 180 mg ALUNBRIG once daily with a seven-day preparatory phase to 90 mg once daily, or 250 mg crizotinib twice daily.
The median age was 58 years in the ALUNBRIG group and 60 years in the crizotinib group. Twenty-nine percent of patients had baseline brain metastases in the ALUNBRIG group, and 30% in the crizotinib group. Twenty-six percent of patients had previously received chemotherapy for an advanced or metastatic disease in the ALUNBRIG group, compared to 27% in the crizotinib group.
Progression-free survival (PFS), assessed blindly by an independent review committee (IEC), was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1, intracranial ORT, intracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability.
The safety profile of ALUNBRIG during the ALTA-1L trial was generally consistent with current prescribing information in the United States.
About ALUNBRIG ® (brigatinib)
ALUNBRIG is a new generation, powerful and selective tyrosine kinase (ITK) inhibitor, designed to target and inhibit genetic alterations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In April 2017, ALUNBRIG received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of patients with metastatic ALK + NSCLC who have had their disease progressed by taking crizotinib or who are intolerant to it. This indication is approved under expedited authorization based on the tumor response rate and the duration of the response. Continued authorization for this indication may be subject to verification and description of the clinical benefits as part of a confirmatory trial.
ALUNBRIG is currently approved in more than 40 countries, including the United States, Canada and the European Union, for the treatment of patients with ALK + metastatic NSCLC who have worsened during treatment with crizotinib or who cannot tolerate taking crizotinib.
ALUNBRIG received revolutionary FDA treatment designation for the treatment of ALK + NSCLC patients whose tumors are resistant to crizotinib, and received the FDA orphan drug designation for the treatment of ALK +, ROS1 + NSCLC EGFR +.
About NSC + ALK +
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of the 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed worldwide each year, according to the World Organization of health. 1,2 Genetic studies indicate that chromosomal rearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) are key drivers in a subgroup of patients with NSCLC. 3 Between three and five percent of patients with metastatic NSCLC have a rearrangement of the ALK gene . 4,5,6
Takeda is committed to continuing its research and development efforts for the NSCLC to improve the lives of the approximately 40,000 patients diagnosed with this serious and rare form of lung cancer each year worldwide. 7

Hypertension:In the ALTA trial, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients in the 90 mg group who received ALUNBRIG and in 21% of patients in the 90 → 180 mg group. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 5.9% of all patients. Check blood pressure before treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks, then at least once a month during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Stop ALUNBRIG administration in case of grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive treatment. After resolution or return to grade 1 severity, resume administration of ALUNBRIG by reducing the dose. Consider permanent discontinuation of ALUNBRIG treatment in case of grade 4 hypertension or reoccurrence of grade 3 hypertension.
Bradycardia:Bradycardia can occur with ALUNBRIG. During the ALTA trial, heart rates below 50 beats per minute occurred in 5.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and in 7.6% of patients in the 90 → 180 mg group. Grade 2 bradycardia occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient in the 90 mg group. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor patients more frequently if the concomitant use of a drug known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided. In the event of symptomatic bradycardia, discontinue administration of ALUNBRIG and evaluate concomitant medications which are known to cause bradycardia. If a concomitant medicinal product known to cause bradycardia is identified and its administration interrupted or adjusted, resume administration of ALUNBRIG at the same dosage after disappearance of symptomatic bradycardia; otherwise reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG after the symptomatic bradycardia has disappeared. Stop administration of ALUNBRIG in the event of life-threatening bradycardia if no concomitant contributing drug is identified.
Visual disturbances:During the ALTA trial, adverse reactions leading to visual disturbances, including blurred vision, diplopia and reduced visual acuity, were reported in 7.3% of patients treated with ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and in 10 % of patients in group 90 → 180 mg. Grade 3 macular edema and cataracts occurred in one patient, each in the 90 → 180 mg group. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms. Stop administration of ALUNBRIG and request an ophthalmological assessment for patients with new or worsening visual symptoms, grade 2 or more severe. After return of grade 2 or 3 visual disturbances to grade 1 or to the reference level, resume administration of ALUNBRIG by reducing the dose.
Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK):During the ALTA trial, an increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) occurred in 27% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and in 48% of patients in the 90 → 180 mg group. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation was 2.8% in the 90 mg group and 12% in the 90 → 180 mg group. Dose reduction due to CPK elevation was performed in 1.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and in 4.5% of those in the 90 → 180 mg group. Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. Monitor CPK levels during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Stop the administration of ALUNBRIG in case of elevation of the CPK of grade 3 or 4. After resolution or return to grade 1 or to the reference level, resume the
Elevation of pancreatic enzymes:In the ALTA trial, amylase elevation occurred in 27% of patients in the 90 mg group and in 39% of patients in the 90 → 180 mg group. Lipase elevation occurred in 21% of patients in the 90 mg group and in 45% of patients in the 90 → 180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and in 2.7% of patients in the 90 → 180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and in 5.5% of patients in the 90 → 180 mg group. Monitor lipase and amylase during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Stop administration of ALUNBRIG in case of elevation of grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzymes. After resolution or return to grade 1 or to the reference level,
Hyperglycemia:During the ALTA trial, 43% of patients who received ALUNBRIG suffered from new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on a laboratory assessment of fasting blood sugar levels, occurred in 3.7% of patients. Two out of 20 (10%) patients with diabetes or early glucose intolerance needed to start insulin therapy while taking ALUNBRIG. Assess the fasting blood sugar before starting ALUNBRIG administration and monitor it periodically thereafter. Start or optimize the administration of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, as needed. If adequate control of hyperglycemia cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, discontinue administration of ALUNBRIG until
Embryo-fetal toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and on results obtained in animals, ALUNBRIG may harm the fetus if administered to pregnant women. There are no clinical data from the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Inform pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise women of childbearing potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG, and for at least 4 months after administration of the last dose. Advise men with female partners of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG.

28078,FMCNA's Novalung ECMO System Receives the US FDA's Approval for Acute Respiratory and Cardiopulmonary Failure,FDA Clears Novalung for Treatment of Acute Respiratory and Cardiopulmonary Failure,"The US FDA has cleared the Novalung system which eliminates the need for mechanical ventilation by pumping a person’s blood through an oxygenator for gas exchange
 Novalung is the first extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), approved to provide for more than 6hrs. of use as extracorporeal life support with its anticipated availability in the US in mid-2020
 The Novalung ECMO system works by pumping and oxygenating a patient’s blood, reducing the stress on the damaged heart and lungs. Novalung is a portable therapy solution designed to improve clinical outcomes and accommodate various clinical care settings such as ICU, OT, cardiac catheterization labs and emergency departments","WALTHAM, Mass., Feb. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Fresenius Medical Care North America (FMCNA) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared Novalung®, a heart and lung support system for the treatment of acute respiratory or cardiopulmonary failure. Novalung is the first extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system to be cleared for more than six hours of use as extracorporeal life support.
(PRNewsfoto/Fresenius Medical Care Holdings)
“Novalung is a critical leap forward in providing heart and lung support therapy for a longer duration than ever available before,” said Mark Costanzo, President of Renal Therapies Group, the technologies and pharmaceuticals division of FMCNA. “We’ve applied our leadership and technical expertise in renal medical devices to elevate standards for acute respiratory and cardiopulmonary failure treatments and technologies. We’re proud to broaden our care offerings to provide new therapies for patients with acute cardiopulmonary conditions.”
Patients in acute respiratory or cardiopulmonary failure often struggle to get oxygen into their bloodstream or expel carbon dioxide out of their bodies, resulting in dangerously low levels of oxygen. This acute low oxygen state can result from a wide range of conditions. Recent research has shown a significant increase in the use of ECMO with evidence of improved survival rates and no increase in hospitalization costs.1
The Novalung ECMO system pumps and oxygenates a patient’s blood, reducing the stress on damaged heart and lungs. Additionally, Novalung offers an alternative to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, which can cause additional lung injury as a result of the air pressure required. Novalung offers a portable therapy solution designed to improve clinical outcomes and accommodate various clinical care settings such as intensive care units, operating rooms, cardiac catheterization labs, and emergency departments.
“A long-term, effective ECMO solution gives critically-ill patients the time and support needed to heal,” said Dr. Robert Bartlett, Professor Emeritus, Section of General Surgery, Division of Acute Care Surgery, University of Michigan School of Medicine. “The system’s pressure sensor technology ensures continuous monitoring and accurate flow control of each patient’s blood, allowing the care team the flexibility needed to treat the underlying health issues.”
The use of Novalung as an ECMO device for critical care has several benefits, including minimizing the need for invasive ventilation, the ability to provide support after multi-organ injuries, and better survival outcomes for patients in cardiac arrest. This integrated heart and lung therapy platform provides the lifesaving support needed for patients in critical conditions.
FMCNA expects Novalung to be available within the U.S. mid-year 2020. To learn more, please visit fmcna.com/novalung.
INDICATIONS FOR USE
The Novalung System is indicated for long-term (>6 hours) respiratory/cardiopulmonary support that provides assisted extracorporeal circulation and physiologic gas exchange (oxygenation and CO2 removal) of the patient’s blood in adults with acute respiratory failure or acute cardiopulmonary failure, where other available treatment options have failed, and continued clinical deterioration is expected or the risk of death is imminent. These may include:
Failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass following cardiac surgery in adult patients
ECMO-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adults
Caution: Federal (US) law restricts these devices to sale by or on the order of a physician.
Note: Read the Instructions for Use for safe and proper use of these devices. For a complete description of hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions, see full package labeling at www.fmcna.com.

28100,Novartis Collaborates with DNDi to Develop LXE408 for Visceral Leishmaniasis,Novartis and DNDi to collaborate on the development of a new oral drug to treat visceral leishmaniasis,"Novartis will conduct P-I clinical study and will be responsible for the development and regulatory submissions while DNDi will lead P- II & III clinical development with the expected initiation of P-II study in H1’21 in India and additional trials planned in East Africa
 The collaboration b/w the companies is supported with the broader program with the Wellcome Trust and other partners to develop new therapies for visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis
 The broader program brings together a strong consortium of R&D partners, including the University of Dundee, GSK, Pfizer, TB Alliance & Takeda. LXE408 is a first-in-class oral therapy, discovered at Novartis with financial support from the Wellcome Trust","LXE408 is a first-in-class compound, discovered at Novartis with financial support from the Wellcome Trust
Novartis is responsible for completing Phase I clinical trials and has committed to maximizing access in endemic countries, once approved
DNDi will lead Phase II and III clinical development, starting in India with additional trials planned in East Africa
Leishmaniasis, which is transmitted by the sand fly, affects over one billion people; visceral leishmaniasis, the most serious form of the disease, affects an estimated 50 000 to 90 000 people per year
Basel, February 25, 2020 – Novartis and the Drugs for Neglected Diseasesinitiative (DNDi), a not-for-profit research and development (R&D) organization, have signed a collaboration and licence agreement to jointly develop LXE408, as a potential new oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, one of the world’s leading parasitic killers.
LXE408 is a first-in-class compound, discovered at Novartis with financial support from the Wellcome Trust. Within the scope of the agreement, Novartis is responsible for completing Phase I clinical trials. In addition, it will drive pharmaceutical development and regulatory submissions. Upon approval, Novartis has committed to distributing the drug on an affordable basis worldwide with a focus on maximizing access in endemic countries.
DNDi will lead Phase II and Phase III clinical development, with the first Phase II study scheduled to start in early 2021 in India. Additional trials are planned to take place in East Africa, which has the highest burden of visceral leishmaniasis.
“Existing treatments for visceral leishmaniasis are simply not good enough. They are too long, increasingly ineffective, and can be toxic, painful, and costly,” said Dr Bernard Pécoul, Executive Director of DNDi. “Our hope is to radically transform this by developing new oral drugs that are affordable, safe, effective, easy to take, and can also be adapted to meet the treatment needs of patients in different countries.”
Over one billion people worldwide are at risk of leishmaniasis, which is transmitted by the bite of a sand fly. Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar, is the most serious form of leishmaniasis, causing fever, weight loss, spleen and liver enlargement, and if left untreated, death. There are an estimated 50 000 to 90 000 new cases per year. Treating the disease is complex as it is dependent on the species of infecting parasite and the country, as treatment responses differ from region to region.
“Novartis has a long-term commitment to neglected tropical diseases that spans several decades. Diseases caused by kinetoplastid parasites, such as leishmaniasis, are one of our strategic research priorities and, together with our partners, we have developed a promising portfolio of drug candidates,” said Dr Lutz Hegemann, Chief Operating Officer for Global Health at Novartis. “We are excited to collaborate with DNDi to reimagine treatment options for people with leishmaniasis around the world.”
Broader partnerships
The collaboration between DNDi and Novartis is aligned with a broader program with the Wellcome Trust and other partners to develop new combinations of entirely new, all-orally acting chemical entities, to treat visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis, another form of the disease.
The program brings together a strong consortium of R&D partners, including the University of Dundee, GSK, Pfizer, TB Alliance, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. These partners have built a portfolio of lead series, pre-clinical and clinical drug candidates, originating from different chemical classes with different mechanisms of action against leishmania parasites.
“We are delighted to be partnering with Novartis from drug development to delivering a promising new oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. Together, we can contribute to sustaining elimination efforts in India and altering the treatment landscape in East Africa,” said Dr Fabiana Alves, Head of Visceral Leishmaniasis Clinical Program at DNDi.

28117,Takeda Exercises its Exclusive Option to Acquire PvP Biologics for ~$330M,Takeda Acquires PvP Biologics Following Results of a Phase 1 Study of TAK-062 (Kuma062) for the Treatment of Celiac Disease,"Takeda acquires PvP Biologics following the P-I proof-of-mechanism study of TAK-062 (Kuma062) to treat uncontrolled celiac disease. Takeda exercises its option to acquire by paying ~$330M as development & regulatory milestone including $35M up front
 In 2017, the companies collaborated to develop novel therapies for celiac disease, under which Takeda got exclusive option to acquire PvP following receipt of a pre-defined development plan
 TAK-062 is designed to digest gluten before they exit the stomach, thus eliminating the symptoms and intestinal damage caused by celiac disease. Takeda is planning to initiate P-IIb study assessing TAK-062 in patients with the uncontrolled disease, maintaining a gluten-free diet","– Investigational medicine TAK-062 is an oral computationally engineered super glutenase designed to improve the digestion of gluten
– Successful “build to buy” relationship adds second investigational therapy to Takeda’s pipeline for the potential treatment of uncontrolled celiac disease
Osaka, Japan, February 26, 2020–Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) announced that it has acquired PvP Biologics, Inc. following the conclusion of a Phase 1 proof-of-mechanism study of investigational medicine TAK-062 (Kuma062) for the treatment of uncontrolled celiac disease. TAK-062 is a potential best-in-class, highly potent super glutenase – a protein that degrades ingested gluten – that was computationally engineered to treat celiac disease, a serious autoimmune disease where the ingestion of gluten leads to inflammation and damage in the small intestine. The Phase 1 study investigated TAK-062’s safety and tolerability in both healthy volunteers and people with celiac disease. The ability of TAK-062 to degrade ingested gluten was studied in healthy volunteers. Takeda plans to submit data from the Phase 1 study for presentation at an upcoming medical congress.
“Many people living with celiac disease manage their symptoms by following a gluten-free diet, but there is no treatment for those who continue to experience severe symptoms,” said Asit Parikh M.D., Ph.D., Head, Gastroenterology Therapeutic Area Unit at Takeda. “PvP Biologics’ work demonstrated that TAK-062 is a highly targeted therapy that could change the standard of care in celiac disease. We are now applying our deep expertise in gastrointestinal diseases to advance the clinical study of TAK-062 and TAK-101, two programs with different modalities that have both demonstrated clinical proof of mechanism.”
TAK-062 enzymatically digests gluten and has demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity compared to other glutenases. It is designed to degrade the immune-reactive parts of gluten before they exit the stomach in order to prevent the immune response to gluten and eliminate the symptoms and intestinal damage caused by celiac disease. Takeda is planning a Phase 2b efficacy and dose-ranging study of TAK-062 in patients with uncontrolled disease who maintain a gluten-free diet.
Takeda exercised its option to acquire PvP Biologics for a pre-negotiated upfront payment as well as development and regulatory milestones totaling up to $330 million. Takeda and PvP Biologics previously entered into a development and option agreement, under which PvP Biologics was responsible for conducting research and development through the Phase 1 proof-of-mechanism study of TAK-062 in exchange for funding by Takeda related to a pre-defined development plan.
“TAK-062 was engineered in 2015 to address the challenges seen by previous glutenases in development for the treatment of celiac disease – their lack of specificity for gluten and activity in the acidic conditions of the stomach. As a result, TAK-062 demonstrated robust gluten degradation in humans, which was anticipated based on the very potent in vitro profile compared with other glutenases,” said Adam Simpson, president and chief executive officer of PvP Biologics. “Takeda has been a great partner and has the expertise, resources, and commitment to people living with celiac disease required to lead the next stage of TAK-062 development.”
In addition to TAK-062, Takeda previously announced data from a Phase 2a study of TAK-101, a potential first-in-class investigational therapy for the treatment of celiac disease. In the study, TAK-101 demonstrated T-cell response suppression, suggesting that it may induce tolerance to gluten in patients with celiac disease by immune uptake of proprietary nanoparticles loaded with gliadin proteins, a disease-specific antigen.
About Celiac Disease
Celiac disease is a genetically driven chronic immune-mediated disorder where abnormal immune responses to gluten peptides lead to small intestinal mucosal damage.1,2,3 Recent population-based studies in the U.S. indicate that the prevalence of celiac disease is around 1%4 and approximately 0.5% globally.5 The threshold of daily gluten that will cause mucosal injury in both adults and children is 10 to 50mg per day – or about 1/100thof a slice of bread.6,7 Celiac disease can cause symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Long-term complications of celiac disease may include malnutrition, accelerated osteoporosis, nervous system problems and problems related to reproduction. Currently the only available treatment for patients with celiac disease is maintaining a gluten-free diet, which involves strict, lifelong avoidance of exposure to gluten proteins from wheat, barley, and rye, which is not always effective.8

“Heartline is a study that has the potential to fundamentally change our understanding of how digital health tools, like the ECG app and irregular rhythm notification feature on Apple Watch, could lead to earlier detection of AFib, helping patients understand and directly engage in their heart health, prompting potentially life-saving conversations with their doctors, and improving health outcomes,” notes Dr. C. Michael Gibson*, Co-Chair of the Heartline Executive Committee and Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and CEO, Baim Institute.
Despite the fact that AFib is a leading cause of stroke, people often do not experience symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose. More than 33 million people worldwide and up to six million Americans live with AFib.1,2 Up to 30% don’t even know they have it until a serious cardiovascular event, such as a stroke, occurs.3 According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, AFib, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, results in 158,000 deaths and 454,000 hospitalizations each year.2
“As we look to tackle some of the greatest health care challenges, we must bring the best minds and capabilities to the table,” said Paul Burton, M.D., Ph.D., FACC, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Internal Medicine, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, a Janssen Pharmaceutical Company of Johnson & Johnson. “Through this important collaboration with Apple, we are pioneering new models that we hope can break down some of the most common barriers to participation in clinical studies. Our work continues to develop and deliver solutions for those impacted by AFib in the areas of detection, treatment and care, through novel approaches, so that we can potentially improve their lives today and well into the future.”
One of the key objectives of this nationwide, randomized study is to assess if a heart health engagement program provided through the Heartline Study app on iPhone, in combination with the ECG app and the irregular rhythm notification feature on Apple Watch, can reduce the likelihood of stroke and improve health outcomes with the earlier detection of AFib.
The engagement program, via the Heartline Study app from Johnson & Johnson, will provide ongoing education, tips, surveys and questionnaires across many topics related to overall heart health throughout the two-year active engagement period.
The ECG app can classify an electrocardiogram as sinus rhythm or AFib.
The irregular rhythm notification feature will provide notifications of irregular heart rhythms suggestive of AFib.
Through the app-based approach, the study will enable participants to engage in the study remotely, right from their iPhone and in some cases an Apple Watch, rather than travel to a clinical trial site. This approach to conducting a clinical trial, if successful, could potentially save time and cost.
“Apple technology is making a meaningful impact on scientific research through the powerful capabilities of iPhone and Apple Watch, all with privacy at the center of the participant experience,” said Myoung Cha, Apple’s Head of Health Strategic Initiatives. “The Heartline Study will help further understanding of how our technology could both contribute to science and help improve health outcomes, including reducing the risk of stroke.”

Evidation Health, a collaborator in the study, provides the technology and study operations that enable the Heartline Study app and study experience for participants.
To be eligible for the study, participants must be age 65 or older, a resident of the United States for the duration of the study, have Original (traditional) Medicare, have an iPhone 6s or a later model (with iOS version 12.2 or later), and agree to provide access to their Medicare claims data. Additional entry criteria may apply. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of two possible groups. One group will participate by only using the Heartline Study app on their iPhone. The other group will participate by using the study app on their iPhone in addition to obtaining an Apple Watch to use the ECG app and irregular rhythm notification feature. Participants who already own an Apple Watch may be eligible to join the study as well, with certain restrictions.
Participation in the study will span a total of three years with two years of active engagement, followed by one year of additional data collection. During the active engagement period, participants will receive heart health education, wellness tips, surveys, and questionnaires across multiple topics related to overall heart health in the app each week.

28139,The US FDA Upgrades the Purple Book to Assist the Transparency in Biosimilars,FDA In Brief: FDA Enhances Purple Book to Support Transparency in Biosimilars,"The US FDA is upgrading the Purple Book by changing it from the current list format to a searchable online database. The FDA has released the first phase that contains information on FDA-licensed biosimilar and interchangeable products along with their reference products
 The further release of phases will expand the number of FDA-licensed biological products included in the Purple Book online database until the final release, which will include information about all FDA-licensed biological products
 The expansion & digitization of the Purple Book will make information of FDA-licensed biological products more accessible & transparent for patients, industry users and other stakeholders","February 24, 2020,Media Inquiries , Jim McKinney, 240-328-7305
The following quote is attributed to FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.:
“This expansion and digitization of the Purple Book will make more information about FDA-licensed biological products more accessible, increasing transparency for patients, industry users and other stakeholders.
“We’re confident these enhancements will meet the needs of a wide range of users, from providing a simple search for patients and consumers, to a more advanced search for prescribers, researchers and industry representatives that may have a need for more technical information.
“Providing stakeholders with more information about biological products through a modernized platform should better facilitate the acceptance and use of existing biosimilar products and the development of new ones, potentially leading to lower costs for patients and improved access to safe, effective, high-quality medications.”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is upgrading the Purple Book, otherwise known as the “Database of FDA-Licensed Biological Products,” in phases, starting today, with full search functionality for all approved biosimilar products and their reference products. Subsequent phases are expected to expand the data set to include data and information about all Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulated products, including transition biological products.
The new database includes information about FDA-licensed biological products, such as the product’s proprietary and proper names, the full product label, dosage form, route of administration, strength, marketing status and more.
The enhancements to the Purple Book also include more information about approved biological products (such as including information pertaining to exclusivity, and whether a product has demonstrated that it is biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a reference product), intended to help patients and industry track the licensure statuses of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products, and to aid prescribers and pharmacies in identifying life-saving, and potentially cost-effective medications.
The FDA will also open a public docket to gather stakeholder feedback on the new database with enhanced functionality that the agency will review to inform the next phases of development.

 Remdesivir is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro/ vivo in animal models against viral pathogens including Ebola, Marburg, MERS and SARS","— U.S. FDA Grants Investigational New Drug Authorization to Study Remdesivir for the Treatment of COVID-19 —

FOSTER CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Feb. 26, 2020– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced the initiation of two Phase 3 clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in adults diagnosed with COVID-19 (novel coronavirus). These randomized, open-label, multicenter studies will enroll approximately 1,000 patients at medical centers primarily across Asian countries, as well as other countries globally with high numbers of diagnosed cases, beginning in March. The studies will assess two dosing durations of remdesivir, administered intravenously. The initiation of these studies follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) rapid review and acceptance of Gilead’s investigational new drug (IND) filing for remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.
The new clinical studies expand the ongoing research into remdesivir, which includes two clinical trials in China’s Hubei province led by the China-Japan Friendship Hospital as well as the recently initiated clinical trial in the United States led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Gilead has donated drug and provided scientific input for these studies, with results from those in Chinaexpected in April.
“Gilead’s primary focus is on rapidly determining the safety and efficacy of remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and this complementary array of studies helps to give us a more expansive breadth of data globally on the drug’s profile in a short amount of time. The speed with which remdesivir has moved into clinical development for this coronavirus reflects the pressing need for treatment options and the shared commitment of industry, governments, global health organizations and healthcare providers to respond to this public health threat with the highest urgency,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences.
The Gilead studies will evaluate two dosing durations of remdesivir. One study will randomize approximately 400 patients with severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 to receive either five or 10 days of remdesivir. The second study will randomize approximately 600 patients with moderate clinical manifestations of disease to receive five or 10 days of remdesivir or standard of care alone. The primary endpoint of both studies is clinical improvement, as described below.
Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use. Working with government agencies, non-governmental organizations and local regulatory authorities, Gilead is providing remdesivir to qualified patients with COVID-19 on a compassionate use basis for emergency treatment outside of ongoing clinical studies.

About Remdesivir
Remdesivir is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens including Ebola, Marburg, MERS and SARS. Remdesivir has been studied in healthy volunteers and in people with Ebola virus infection. Individual compassionate use cases are not sufficient to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in treating COVID-19, which can only be determined through prospective clinical trials.
About Gilead-Sponsored New Remdesivir Clinical Trials
The first of two studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of both a 5-day and a 10-day dosing regimen of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. Approximately 400 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir 200 mg on day one, followed by remdesivir 100 mg each day until day 5 or 10, in addition to standard of care. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of remdesivir, as measured by the normalization of fever and oxygen saturation [T < 36.6 C armpit, < 37.2 C oral, < 37.8 C rectal; and Sp02 > 94%, sustained for at least 24 hours through Day 14].
The second study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 5-day and a 10-day dosing regimen of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. Approximately 600 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir 200 mg on day one, followed by remdesivir 100 mg in addition to standard of care each day until day 5 or 10, compared with standard of care alone. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of remdesivir, as measured by the proportion of participants in each group discharged by day 14.

 Gemini is currently working on GEM103, a recombinant Complement Factor H therapy for dry AMD which the initiation point to develop therapies targeting the unmet medical needs of patients","February 26, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Gemini Therapeutics, a clinical stage precision medicine company developing innovative treatments for dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and linked ocular disorders, today announced a collaboration with the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) to expand knowledge and identify new targets associated with AMD.
Under the terms of the agreement, SERI and Gemini will explore the link between genetic and potential biomarkers in patients diagnosed with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). This approach will leverage Gemini’s experience using precision medicine to develop potential therapeutics for genetically defined patient populations. Gemini will use this information to increase its understanding of the links between genetic variants, the impact on the expression of specific genes, and the diagnosis of PCV. PCV and AMD are related diseases, and there are shared genetic causes between the two conditions. This collaboration will inform future development of more targeted therapies for both conditions.
Talking about the collaboration, Prof Gemmy Cheung, who heads AMD research at SERI said, “Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy represents a significant proportion of patients with neovascular AMD, especially in Asia. Currently there are limited or no specific treatment options for PCV. Exploring the molecular impact of specific genes linked to PCV in this SERI-Gemini collaboration will provide important new information towards designing innovative therapies in future. We are very excited indeed.”
“Our collaboration with SERI is an important extension of the work we’re doing at Gemini to increase understanding and improve the treatment of AMD. As we progress our current clinical program of GEM103, a recombinant Complement Factor H therapy, in dry AMD, expanding our understanding of related ocular diseases and taking a genetic starting point to develop therapeutic options for those patients is a natural next step,” said Jason Meyenburg, Chief Executive Officer of Gemini. “SERI is one of the foremost centers for the study of major eye diseases in the world and we are thrilled to collaborate with them on this important project.”
About PCV
Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is a disease affecting the blood vessels in the choroid which supports the retina. Abnormal branching of the blood vessels in the choroid results in aneurysms known as polyps, which can cause leakage of blood and fluid under the retina, causing elevations in the retina and substructures. Patients with PCV may eventually experience irreversible central vision loss in one or both eyes. PCV has a prevalence of between 23 and 54% in Asian populations diagnosed with AMD. In Caucasian populations between 4 and 10% of patients diagnosed with AMD and the genetic basis of the condition is being explored. Current treatments for PCV can involve laser or intravitreal injections, but the response is variable and the preferred treatment for PCV remains unclear.
Singapore Eye Research Institute
Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) is Singapore’s national research institute for ophthalmic and vision research. It is the research arm of Singapore National Eye Centre, and has close working relationships with A*STAR Research Institutes, Nanyang Technological University and other biomedical institutions and eye centers in Singapore and throughout the world.

– Conference Call and Webcast on Thursday, February 27 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time –

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Esperion (NASDAQ:ESPR) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved NEXLIZET™ (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) tablet, an oral, once-daily, non-statin LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C), lowering medicine. NEXLIZET is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLIZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. NEXLIZET is the first non-statin, LDL-C lowering combination medicine ever approved. This approval follows the approval of NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) tablet last week.

NEXLIZET contains bempedoic acid and ezetimibe and lowers elevated LDL-C through complementary mechanisms of action by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver and absorption in the intestine.

“The approval of NEXLIZET underscores Esperion’s commitment to providing patients and their healthcare providers with innovative non-statin medicines that fit into their everyday routines to lower elevated levels of bad cholesterol in adult patients with ASCVD or HeFH on maximally tolerated statins. This is the first non-statin combination medicine ever approved for lowering LDL-C,” said Tim M. Mayleben, president and chief executive officer of Esperion. “We are truly grateful to all of the patients and healthcare providers who put their confidence in Esperion’s team of lipid experts.”

LDL-C is a waxy, fat-like substance that’s found in the body. Elevated LDL-C contributes to a buildup of this fat in the arteries and can lead to cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke. Despite standard of care treatments, it is estimated nearly 15 million ASCVD or HeFH patients on maximally tolerated statins in the U.S. cannot achieve guideline recommended LDL-C levels.

“NEXLIZET provides significant additional LDL-C lowering for adult patients with ASCVD or HeFH when added to maximally tolerated statin medicine, including those patients for whom maximally tolerated statin may be no statin at all,” said Christie M. Ballantyne, M.D., chairman of Esperion’s Phase 3 Executive Committee and professor and chief of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “I believe this one-of-a-kind combination medicine which has two complementary, non-statin medications can provide highly effective additional reductions in LDL-C when added to statin therapy. It also has the conventional, oral, once-daily administration which can prove beneficial to patients struggling to meet their cholesterol goals with the currently available statin options in their daily regimen.”

The approval of NEXLIZET is supported by the Phase 3 Fixed Combination Drug Product LDL-C Lowering program, as well as safety data from the NEXLETOL (bempedoic acid) tablet global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program and the existing ezetimibe safety profile. NEXLIZET lowered LDL-C by a mean of 38 percent compared to placebo when added on to maximally tolerated statins. Results have been published in The European Journal of Preventative Cardiology.

NEXLIZET was generally well-tolerated in a pivotal Phase 3 study. Label warnings and precautions include hyperuricemia, with the development of gout in a small percentage of patients, as well as an increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. The most common adverse events reported in the development program (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) were generally reported at similar rates in patients who received placebo and were upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis fatigue, influenza. The majority of adverse events reported with NEXLIZET were mild to moderate in severity. For additional information on NEXLIZET, please see Full Prescribing Information at Esperion.com.

Today’s approval further underscores Esperion’s commitment to deliver our medicines to adult patients suffering from ASCVD or HeFH and who are unable to reach their LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statins. Esperion is working with health insurance providers to help ensure broad insurance coverage and patient access to our medicines. Eligible patients with commercial drug insurance coverage for our medicines may pay as little as $10 per fill, up to a 3-month supply. To ensure access, both NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET will be priced at parity. Additionally, Esperion is committed to achieving the lowest branded tier coverage for Medicare patients.

NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) Tablet

NEXLETOL is a first-in-class ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by reducing cholesterol biosynthesis and up-regulating the LDL receptors. Completed Phase 3 studies conducted in more than 3,000 patients, with over 2,000 patients treated with NEXLETOL , demonstrated an average 18 percent placebo corrected LDL-C lowering when used in patients on moderate or high-intensity statins. NEXLETOL is the first oral, once-daily, non-statin LDL-C lowering medicine approved in the U.S. in nearly 20 years for patients with ASCVD or HeFH. NEXLETOL was approved by the FDA in February 2020.

Indication and Limitation of Use
NEXLETOL is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLETOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Important Safety Information

Warnings and Precautions:
° Elevations in serum uric acid have occurred. Assess uric acid levels periodically as clinically indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia, and initiate treatment with urate-lowering drugs as appropriate. The risk for gout events with NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) tablet was higher in patients with a prior history of gout although gout also occurred more frequently than placebo in patients treated with NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) tablet who had no prior gout history.
° Tendon rupture has occurred. Discontinue NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) tablet at the first sign of tendon rupture. Avoid NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) tablet in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture.

Adverse Reactions:
° The most common (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia and elevated liver enzymes.

Drug Interactions:
° Avoid concomitant use of NEXLETOL with simvastatin greater than 20 mg.
° Avoid concomitant use of NEXLETOL with pravastatin greater than 40 mg.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088 or report side effects to Esperion at 833-377-7633 (833 ESPRMED).

NEXLIZETTM (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) Tablet

NEXLIZET contains bempedoic acid and ezetimibe and lowers elevated LDL-C through complementary mechanisms of action by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver and absorption in the intestine. Phase 3 data demonstrated NEXLIZET lowered LDL-C by a mean of 38 percent compared to placebo when added on to maximally tolerated statins. NEXLIZET is the first non-statin, LDL-cholesterol lowering combination medicine ever approved. NEXLIZET was approved by the FDA in February 2020.

Indication and Limitation of Use
NEXLIZET is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLIZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Contraindications:
° Known hypersensitivity to ezetimibe tablets.

Warnings and Precautions:
° Elevations in serum uric acid have occurred. Assess uric acid levels periodically as clinically indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia, and initiate treatment with urate-lowering drugs as appropriate. The risk for gout events with NEXLIZET was higher in patients with a prior history of gout although gout also occurred more frequently than placebo in patients treated with NEXLIZET who had no prior gout history.
° Tendon rupture has occurred. Discontinue NEXLIZET at the first sign of tendon rupture. Avoid NEXLIZET in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture.

Adverse Reactions:
° The most common adverse events reported in the development program were generally reported at similar rates in patients who received placebo (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis fatigue, influenza.

Drug Interactions:
° Simvastatin: Avoid concomitant use of NEXLIZET with simvastatin great than 20 mg.
° Pravastatin: Avoid concomitant use of NEXLIZET with pravastatin greater than 40 mg.
° Cyclosporine: Monitor cyclosporine concentrations.
° Fibrates: If cholelithiasis is suspected in a patient receiving NEXLIZET and fenofibrate, consider alternative lipid-lowering therapy.

CLEAR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial

The effect of NEXLETOL or NEXLIZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Esperion initiated a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) to assess the effects of bempedoic acid on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiovascular disease (CVD) who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and are considered “statin averse.” The CVOT — known as CLEAR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial — is an event-driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that completed enrollment in August 2019 of 14,032 patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk at over 1,400 sites in 32 countries.

Esperion Therapeutics

Through scientific and clinical excellence, and a deep understanding of cholesterol biology, the experienced Lipid Management Team at Esperion is committed to developing new LDL-C lowering medicines that will make a substantial impact on reducing global cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death around the world.

Esperion Therapeutics’ Commitment to Patients with Hyperlipidemia

High levels of LDL-C can lead to a build-up of fat and cholesterol in and on artery walls (known as atherosclerosis), potentially leading to cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke. In the U.S., 96 million people, or more than 37 percent of the adult population, have elevated LDL-C. There are approximately 18 million people in the U.S. living with elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy — including individuals considered statin averse — leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events1. In the United States, more than 50 percent of ASCVD patients who are not able to reach their LDL-C with statins alone need less than a 40 percent reduction to reach their LDL-C threshold2.

Esperion’s mission as the Lipid Management Company is to deliver oral, once-daily medicines that complement existing oral drugs to provide the additional LDL-C lowering that these patients need.

The validation indicates the acceptance of MAA and the initiation of CHMP’s formal review process
 The submission is based on P-III PRIMA study assessing Zejula vs PBO in women in a ratio (2:1) as 1L therapy for stage III/ IV platinum-responsive advanced OC. The study demonstrated clinical outcomes of Zejula
 Zejula (PO, qd) is a PARP inhibitor, indicated as a monothx. for the maintenance treatment of patients with platinum‑sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response to platinum-based CT","Submission based on data from the Phase III PRIMA clinical study that demonstrated clinically meaningful outcomes of niraparib maintenance treatment in the first-line setting regardless of biomarker status
Issued: London, UK
GlaxoSmithKline plc announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the company’s Type II Variation (T2V) for Zejula (niraparib) as a maintenance treatment in the first-line setting for women with advanced ovarian cancer who responded to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status. Validation of the T2V confirms that the submission is accepted and begins the formal review process by the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP).
The submission is based on data from the PRIMA study (ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012), which demonstrated clinically meaningful outcomes of niraparib treatment in the first-line maintenance setting.[1] Results from the PRIMA study were presented at the 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The PRIMA study enrolled women who responded to first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, including those with high risk of disease progression, a population with high unmet need and previously under-represented in first-line ovarian cancer studies.
In Europe, ovarian cancer is the sixth deadliest cancer among women and more than 65,000 women are diagnosed each year.[2] Most women are diagnosed with advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer and have a five-year survival rate of ~30%.[3] Despite high response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line, approximately 85% of women with advanced ovarian cancer will see their disease return.[4] With each recurrence, the time a woman may spend without her cancer progressing until the next recurrence gets shorter.
About PRIMA
PRIMA is a double-blind, randomised Phase III study designed to evaluate niraparib versus placebo in women being treated first-line for stage III or IV ovarian cancer. The study assessed the efficacy of niraparib as maintenance therapy, as measured by progression free survival. Patients in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were randomised 2:1 to niraparib or placebo.
About Zejula (niraparib)
Niraparib is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in multiple pivotal trials. GSK is building a robust niraparib clinical development programme by assessing activity across multiple tumour types and by evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other therapeutics. The ongoing development programme for niraparib includes several combination studies, including a Phase III study as a first-line triplet maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer (FIRST).
Important Information for ZEJULA
Zejula approved indication:
Zejula is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum‑sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum‑based chemotherapy.

Important Safety Information
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to niraparib or to any of the excipients and breast-feeding.
Warnings and precautions: Test complete blood counts weekly for the first month of treatment, then monthly thereafter. If a patient develops severe persistent haematologic toxicity including pancytopenia that does not resolve within 28 days following interruption, Zejula should be discontinued. Due to the risk of thrombocytopenia, anticoagulants and medicinal products known to reduce the thrombocyte count should be used with caution. If MDS and/or AML are confirmed while being prescribed Zejula , treatment should be discontinued, and the patient treated appropriately. Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with the use of Zejula. Pre‑existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Zejula treatment.

[February 26, 2019] Celltrion announced on November 26 that its own antibody biopharmaceutical, ‘Ramshima SC’, has been approved for marketing in Korea by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KFDA).
Celltrion is the first infliximab SC formulation to change the formulation of the conventional intravenous (IV) lambda injection into subcutaneous injection (SC) to gain a strong competitive edge in the market of TNF-α inhibitors (autoimmune diseases). In November last year, the company obtained sales approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and made its debut in the European market starting this month in Germany.
The indication approved by the Food and Drug Administration is RA (Rheumatoid arthritis) indication, and Celltrion plans to receive additional indications within the year through the change permit procedure to add IBD (Inflammatory bowel disease) indication. Ramshima SC will be introduced to the domestic market after completion of the permit for the addition of IBD indications.
Celltrion has recently filed an application for a Ramshima SC license in Canada to enter the North American market and plans to supply it throughout Canada through Celltrion Healthcare’s direct sales network. In addition, in the US, the world’s largest biopharmaceutical market, Ramshima SC is recognized as a ‘new drug’, exempting from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, and currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials smoothly. Celltrion aims to license the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022.
An official of Celltrion said, “With the approval of the Ramshima SC Food and Drug Administration, Celltrion has a strong portfolio in the autoimmune disease treatment market in Korea.” “Remshima has proven its efficacy and safety through clinical data disclosure at leading overseas conferences. We will do our best to secure indications for IBD so that SC can be introduced to Korean patients early. ”
Meanwhile, according to the IQVIA report of the market research institute (as of the first half of 2019), Ramshima has expanded its market share to 36% in the domestic market, surpassing the replacement rate of the original drug market by 40%. Trouxima and Hejuma are also leading the domestic biosimilar market by securing market share of 20% and 22% respectively in the first half of 2019.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/celltrion.jpg,Biosimilars,0,0,approval|Biosimilar|Celltrion|infliximab|KFDA|receives|Remsima SC|Rheumatoid Arthritis,publish,28/2/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/celltrion-approved-for-domestic-sales-of-remshima-sc-drug-for-autoimmune-diseases/,https://pharmashots.com/28201/celltrions-remsima-sc-biosimilar-infliximab-receives-kfdas-approval-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/

Biogen’s access to Sangamo’s gene regulation therapies complements its expanding efforts in gene therapy across diverse neurological diseases
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and BRISBANE, Calif., Feb. 27, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGMO), a genomic medicine company, today announced that they have executed a global licensing collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize ST-501 for tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease, ST-502 for synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease, a third undisclosed neuromuscular disease target, and up to nine additional undisclosed neurological disease targets. The companies will leverage Sangamo’s proprietary zinc finger protein (ZFP) technology delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV) to modulate the expression of key genes involved in neurological diseases.
“As a pioneer in neuroscience, Biogen will collaborate with Sangamo on a new gene regulation therapy approach, working at the DNA level, with the potential to treat challenging neurological diseases of global significance. We aim to develop and advance these programs forward to investigational new drug applications,” said Alfred Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Research and Development at Biogen.
“There are currently no approved disease modifying treatments for patients with many devastating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, creating an urgency for the development of medicines that will not just address symptoms like the current standards of care, but slow or stop the progression of disease,” said Sandy Macrae, CEO of Sangamo. “We believe that the promise of genomic medicine in neuroscience is to provide a one-time treatment for patients to alter their disease natural history by addressing the underlying cause at the genomic level.”
Sangamo’s genome regulation technology, zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs), is currently delivered with AAVs and functions at the DNA level to selectively repress or activate the expression of specific genes to achieve a desired therapeutic effect. Highly specific, potent, and tunable repression of tau and alpha synuclein has been demonstrated in preclinical studies using AAV vectors to deliver tau-targeted (ST-501) and alpha synuclein-targeted (ST-502) ZFP-TFs.
“The combination of Sangamo’s proprietary zinc finger technology, Biogen’s unmatched neuroscience research, drug development, and commercialization experience and capabilities, and our shared commitment to bring innovative medicines to patients with neurological diseases establishes the foundation for a robust and compelling collaboration,” said Stephane Boissel, Head of Corporate Strategy at Sangamo. “This collaboration exemplifies Sangamo’s commitment to our ongoing strategy to partner programs that address substantial and diverse patient populations in disease areas requiring complex clinical trial designs and commercial pathways, therefore bringing treatments to patients faster and more efficiently, while deriving maximum value from our platform.”
Under the terms of the collaboration, Biogen has exclusive global rights to ST-501 for tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease, ST-502 for synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease, and a third undisclosed neuromuscular disease target. In addition, Biogen has exclusive rights to nominate up to nine additional undisclosed targets over a target selection period of five years. Sangamo will perform early research activities, costs for which will be shared by the companies, aimed at the development of the combination of proprietary CNS delivery vectors and ZFP-TFs targeting therapeutically relevant genes. Biogen will then assume responsibility and costs for the investigational new drug-enabling studies, clinical development, related regulatory interactions, and global commercialization.
Sangamo will be responsible for GMP manufacturing activities for the initial clinical trials for the first three products of the collaboration and plans to leverage its in-house manufacturing capacity. Biogen will assume responsibility for GMP manufacturing activities beyond the first clinical trial for each of the first three products.
Upon closing of this transaction, Sangamo will receive $350 million comprised of $125 million in a license fee payment and $225 million from the sale of new Sangamo stock, or approximately 24 million shares at $9.21 per share. In addition, Sangamo may receive up to $2.37 billion in other development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, including up to $925 million in pre-approval milestone payments and up to $1,445 million in first commercial sale and other sales-based milestone payments. Sangamo will also be eligible to receive from Biogen tiered high single digit to sub-teen double-digit royalties on potential net commercial sales of products arising from the collaboration. Closing of the transaction is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S.
Conference call
Sangamo will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET tomorrow, Friday, February 28, which will be open to the public via telephone and webcast.

The partners aim to develop safer, more tolerable and more effective cytokine therapies for single agent and novel combinations with Boehringer Ingelheim’s innovative cancer vaccine, oncolytic virus, T cell engager and myeloid-targeting therapies 
Ingelheim, Germany and San Diego, California – 27 February 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim and Trutino Biosciences today announced they have entered into a research collaboration and worldwide licensing agreement based on Trutino’s innovative On-Demand-Cytokine (ODC) platform. Under the terms of strategic alliance, Boehringer Ingelheim gains access to Trutino’s ODC platform technology for the generation and development of up to three new ODC candidates. This new collaboration combines Boehringer Ingelheim’s long-term strategy to provide first-in-class, breakthrough therapies for cancer patients with Trutino’s unique knowledge and expertise in increasing the safety and efficacy of cytokine therapies.
“Developing a strong and innovative cytokine therapeutic program as an additional component of our cancer immunology portfolio, demonstrates how we are ‘Taking Cancer On,’ and provides a high potential combination partner for our existing cancer vaccine, oncolytic virus, T cell engager and myeloid-targeting therapeutics portfolio,” said Jonathon Sedgwick, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Global Head, Cancer Immunology & Immune Modulation Research at Boehringer Ingelheim. “We are very pleased to partner with Trutino and harness the potential of their innovative scientific platform to develop treatment breakthroughs that will transform the lives of cancer patients.”
Trutino’s ODC platform masks the activity of cytokines until they reach the tumor site and become fully activated, sparing systemic exposure and potentially leading to a higher margin of safety and greater efficacy than conventional cytokine treatments. Trutino will generate the new ODC molecules and carry out preclinical validation, handing over development to Boehringer Ingelheim for late pre-clinical testing through the rest of development.
“We are excited to embark on this partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim, a leader in cancer immunology, to advance cytokine therapeutic options that address the unmet medical needs of patients worldwide,” said Phillip Kim, Ph.D., MBA, Founder and CEO of Trutino Biosciences. “Boehringer Ingelheim has a deep commitment to innovative scientific approaches and is a leader in bringing novel cancer therapies to market. This global partnership validates the broad potential of our proprietary ODC platform to create safer and more effective cytokine therapies that can be delivered systemically and activated locally. Together, we can rapidly develop a new generation of cytokine therapies to address critical unmet need in oncology.”
Trutino’s clinical potential was initially recognized by Boehringer Ingelheim through its grass roots programs, including the ‘BI Innovation Prize,’ where the ODC platform technology was an early-stage standout in the 2019 program held in San Diego. Launched in 2015, the grass roots programs comprise of ‘BI Office Hours,’ ‘BI Academy’ and the ‘BI Innovation Prize.’ Through Office Hours, Boehringer Ingelheim has provided over 200 early-stage companies in the life-sciences community with mentoring and direct access to relevant expertise and industry perspective from senior leaders within the company. In partnership with BioLabs in Boston, New York and San Diego, Boehringer Ingelheim has awarded numerous entrepreneurs with free lab space through the ‘Golden Ticket’ program. As a company dedicated to improving health and quality of life, these programs give Boehringer Ingelheim the opportunity to lend expertise to the innovation community and offer guidance around the science to help enable ideas to deliver the next breakthroughs.
The partnership with Trutino will strengthen Boehringer Ingelheim’s next generation immune oncology portfolio, which combines cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, T Cell engagers and myeloid targeting platforms with the aim of making “cold” tumors that are invisible to the immune system “hot” to rally the immune system against the tumor. Under the terms of the agreement, Boehringer Ingelheim will provide an upfront payment, near-term pre-clinical milestone payments and clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, including royalties on future product sales.

 CAD EYE utilizes FUJIFILM’s REiLi AI technology and can perform complex segmentation of 2D/3D images, spot lesions & is compatible with various imaging modalities. It automatically engages with white light or LCI mode to improve the accuracy of lesion detection
 CAD EYE is customized detection support used with the ELUXEO system, aimed to improve lesion detection in the colon at the expert level and is expected to be available with EX-1 in Mar’2020","FUJIFILM Europe GmbH will launch a new function known as “CAD EYE,” which was developed by FUJIFILM Corporation to support real time detection of colonic polyps during colonoscopy utilizing AI technology*1. CAD EYE’s functionality will be available with software EW10-EC01 and the compatible expansion unit EX-1 in combination with the Fujifilm ELUXEO 7000 system.
Fujifilm has already acquired CE mark for this new software EW10-EC01 and it will be launched with EX-1 in March 2020. 

Improving the detection rate of difficult to discover lesions has been one of the major challenges within the field of endoscopy in recent years. Fujifilm has continuously worked on the development of image processing technologies such as Linked Color Imaging (LCI) and Blue Light Imaging (BLI) utilizing specific wavelengths of light to support early cancer detection and characterization.
“I am very pleased to announce the launch of the CAD EYE Detection function. I am convinced that with this new development, we will achieve our vision of reducing the incidence of colorectal cancers and patient mortality whilst lowering the economic burden associated with the management and aftercare that results from this devastating disease,” says Mr. Takakazu Sakashita, Senior Vice President FUJIFILM Europe GmbH Medical Systems Division.

When a suspicious polyp is detected within the endoscopic image, a Detection Box indicates the area where the suspicious polyp has been detected, and a Visual Assist Circle illuminates in the vicinity. Additionally a sound is heard when a suspicious polyp is detected.
 CAD EYE Detection


Background
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer after lung cancer and breast cancer in terms of the number of cases, and the second most common cause of cancer death after lung cancer*3. And in order to reduce the incidence of cancer, colonoscopy is widely considered the gold standard for detection of colonic neoplasia. However, errors in colonoscopic detection of neoplasia, including both polyps and cancers, are well documented and improvement of detection rate of such legions has been one of the major topics in gastroenterology field. 4*, 5*
Fujifilm is working to develop a unique collection of image processing technologies and continues to develop the practical application of AI technology and will continue to develop and supply a wide range of products and services that meet the needs of frontline medicine in various fields, contributing to streamlining clinical work, enhancing the quality of medical care and maintaining and strengthening people’s health.

28253,Gates Foundation Forms an Alliance with Global Pharma Companies to Develop PAN-TB Drug Regimen for Tuberculosis,First-of-its-kind global collaboration launched to develop transformative treatment regimens for tuberculosis,"GSK, Evotec, J&J, Otsuka, the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute and its foundation have launched the ‘PAN-TB collaboration’ project to collaboratively accelerate the development of novel TB treatment regimens
 The global collaboration will focus on developing a new regimen with the drug candidates that demonstrated efficacy in its P-II studies with limited or no drug resistance to achieve the global eradication of the disease
 The PAN-TB collaboration is a first-of-its-kind collaboration among philanthropic, non-profit and private sectors to facilitate the development of an investigational drug regimen for treating all forms of TB","A new global collaboration of philanthropic, non-profit and private sector organizations will work together to accelerate the development of novel TB treatment regimens for all TB patients.
The global collaboration aims to create treatment regimens comprised of medicines to which there is limited or no drug resistance and that are ready for phase 3 development.
The regimens could be an important step toward addressing the current global challenges around TB treatment complexity, and the diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB.
Issued: London, UK
Today a consortium of philanthropic, non-profit and private sector organisations launched a collaboration that aims to accelerate the development of novel “pan-TB” drug regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) that are ready for phase 3 development. The regimens will be designed to have little to no drug resistance and an acceptable safety profile, and be better-tolerated, shorter in duration and simpler to use than existing options. Such regimens are intended to be a central component of efforts to address the current complexities and challenges of TB treatment.
The members of the Project to Accelerate New Treatments for Tuberculosis (PAN-TB collaboration) – Evotec, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., based in Japan, the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation – have committed to leveraging their unique assets, resources and scientific expertise to advance the development of novel regimens.
“Current tools are insufficient for accelerating and sustaining global progress against TB,” said Trevor Mundel, President of Global Health at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “Innovative partnerships, such as the PAN-TB collaboration, are urgently needed to develop new drugs and treatment regimens that can address TB and advance progress towards achieving global elimination TB goals.”
TB causes more deaths globally than any other infectious disease, with 10 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths recorded in 2018 alone. TB is responsible for up to a third of all mortality associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR).[1],[2]
The current regimen for drug-sensitive TB, the most common and easiest to treat form of TB, requires that patients take multiple drugs for six or more months under clinical monitoring. Patients with drug-resistant TB cannot use this regimen and face longer and more complex treatment regimens, often with significant side effects.[3] Currently, patients must undergo additional testing to diagnose drug-resistant TB.
The regimens that the PAN-TB collaboration is working to develop could help transform TB care. A shorter and safer novel regimen that can treat TB irrespective of pre-existing drug resistance and with reduced need for drug resistance testing, could provide a significant benefit to both patients and health systems.
The PAN-TB collaboration will identify and assess the potential of investigational pan-TB regimens, through phase 2 clinical efficacy studies. Collaborative pre-clinical research activities have begun. Clinical trials will be announced as they are planned.

Penny Heaton, M.D., CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute: “The development of a regimen that can treat both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis could be a game changer for how the world addresses TB and growing antimicrobial resistance. The PAN-TB collaboration’s unique partnership model leverages the assets and expertise of multiple partners to fill a crucial need in the tuberculosis treatment research and development pipeline.”
Cord Dohrmann, Chief Scientific Officer of Evotec: “Tuberculosis continues to be a significant global health burden, and so far all efforts to eradicate the disease have failed. One reason for this is that the current treatment regimen is both complex and time-consuming. We are proud to be part of PAN-TB, which unites global leaders in their respective fields. We believe that through the PAN-TB collaboration we have all the resources necessary to lead the TB treatment regimen into a new era where an effective, universally applicable treatment for this devastating medical condition is globally available.”
Pauline Williams, MD, Senior Vice President of GSK Global Health Pharma: “GSK is committed to improving global health through our science and we have a world-leading pipeline of TB candidate medicines aiming to eliminate this deadly infectious disease. However, no one organisation can succeed in tackling TB alone. As a partner in the PAN-TB collaboration, we will contribute our scientific knowledge and innovative TB assets to determine the optimal treatment regimen to treat and cure TB patients regardless of their resistance profile to current treatments.”
Ruxandra Draghia-akli, M.D, Ph.D., Global Head of Global Public Health R&D, Johnson & Johnson said: “Solving the TB challenge is deeply personal for Johnson & Johnson. It was one of the driving forces that compelled Dr. Paul Janssen, namesake of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, to commit his life to the advancement of modern medicine, because he lost a loved one to this terrible disease. Over the past 20 years, J&J has made good on Dr. Janssen’s commitment, discovering and bringing to market one of the most important new TB medicines in half a century. But we can’t beat TB alone. That’s why we’re honoured to join forces with the Gates Foundation and other pharmaceutical companies in the quest to create the first pan-TB treatment regimen. Together, we are confident that we can transform TB treatment and end this disease once and for all.”
Keiso Yamasaki, TB Global Project Leader of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., based in Japan: “We are extremely proud to be part of this unique collaboration. For nearly half a century, Otsuka has been dedicated to tuberculosis research and development in the hope of eliminating this neglected disease. From new compounds, diagnostics and pediatric tools, we remain committed to developing innovations for tuberculosis. We applaud the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for bringing together leaders in the TB field to help develop a new universal treatment regimen guiding us closer towards the goal of TB elimination.”
About the Project to Accelerate New Treatments for Tuberculosis
The Project to Accelerate New Treatments for Tuberculosis (PAN-TB collaboration) is a first-of-its-kind collaboration among philanthropic, non-profit and private sectors that aims to accelerate the development of an investigational drug regimen capable of treating all forms of tuberculosis.
The PAN-TB collaboration will leverage members’ collective assets, resources and scientific expertise to identify and evaluate new drug regimens with an acceptable safety profile, that have the potential to treat both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB, and are better-tolerated, shorter in duration and simpler to use than existing options. The collaboration will focus on advancing research through phase 2 clinical efficacy studies in order to identify promising regimens for further development.
The PAN-TB collaboration plans to work closely and transparently with the European Regimen Accelerator for Tuberculosis (ERA4TB), which was launched in January 2020. New molecular entities identified by ERA4TB that show promise in initial human studies could later be incorporated into the PAN-TB collaboration’s later-stage, clinical research. Several organisations, including Evotec, GSK and Johnson & Johnson, are members of both projects, which will help to ensure coordination across collaborations toward the common goal of advancing TB drug and regimen development.
The founding members of the PAN-TB collaboration are Evotec, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., based in Japan, the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Additional members may be announced in the future.

About Tuberculosis
TB causes more deaths globally than any other infectious disease, with 10 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths recorded in 2018 alone.[4] Though the number of deaths is falling, it isn’t falling fast enough to reach WHO’s global TB elimination goals. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB are also urgent concerns. In 2017, drug-resistant TB alone caused 230,000 deaths – one-third of all deaths due to AMR.[5] TB is also the leading cause of death in people living with HIV, accounting for one-third of deaths among HIV-positive people. The world’s most vulnerable are disproportionately affected by TB, with many cases of TB occurring in resource-limited areas.[6]

 EC will now review the CHMP’s positive opinion and if approved, vedolizumab will be the only maintenance therapy for UC & CD with both IV & SC formulation in the EU
 Vedolizumab SC is a gut-selective biologic act by inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin binding to MAdCAM-1 and not VCAM-1 and is expected to be available in both pre-filled syringe and a pre-filled pen","February 28, 2020 Osaka, JAPAN
If approved, the additional treatment modality will provide more options for how patients in Europe receive the gut-selective biologic vedolizumab
Recommendation brings vedolizumab one step closer to becoming the only maintenance therapy with both intravenous and subcutaneous formulation options for patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease
Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the approval of a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of the gut-selective biologic vedolizumab for use as maintenance therapy in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD). Takeda proposes to make vedolizumab SC available in both a pre-filled syringe and a pre-filled pen.
 
The CHMP opinion will now be reviewed by the European Commission. If approved, vedolizumab will become the only maintenance therapy for UC or CD with both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations across the European Union, providing greater options for how patients receive their treatment.
 
“Today’s positive CHMP opinion marks a key step forward in our goal to provide greater options to patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease,” said Adam Zaeske, Head, GI Franchise, Europe and Canada Business Unit, Takeda. “Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are life-long diseases, and it is important that patients have treatment options that suit their different preferences and lifestyles. We look forward to the European Commission’s decision and the opportunity to bring a subcutaneous formulation of vedolizumab to these patients across Europe.”
 
The positive opinion from the CHMP was based on the pivotal phase 3 VISIBLE trials which assessed the safety and efficacy of a SC formulation of vedolizumab as maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC or CD who achieved clinical response* at week 6 following two doses of open-label vedolizumab intravenous (IV) therapy at weeks 0 and 2.1,2,3 Data from a long-term, open-label extension study of patients from VISIBLE 1 and VISIBLE 2 was also considered.4
* VISIBLE 1 – UC: Clinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from baseline (week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point.2
VISIBLE 2 – CD: Clinical response is defined as a ≥70-point decrease in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score from baseline (week 0).5
 
About the VISIBLE Clinical Trial Program
The VISIBLE clinical trial program aims to assess the efficacy and safety of an investigational subcutaneous (SC) formulation of vedolizumab as maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD).
 
The VISIBLE program consists of three phase 3 studies involving over 1,000 UC and CD patients which includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies examining the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission at week 52, and an open-label extension study to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of vedolizumab SC.2,3,4
 

About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).6 Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, with CD potentially progressing over time.7,8 UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD, which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.9,10 CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.9,10 UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.9,11 CD commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.7 The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to UC or CD.9,12,13
 

About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved as an intravenous (IV) formulation.14,15 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).16 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.17 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.16 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).16,18,19 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.16
 
Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist.14,15 Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 415,000 patient years of exposure to date.5
 

Therapeutic Indications for vedolizumab IV
 
Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
 
Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.


Important Safety Information for vedolizumab IV
 
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
 
Special warnings and special precautions for use
Vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.
 
Infusion-related reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone, and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.
 
Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.
 
Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.
 
Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.
 
Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
 
Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.

And it is generally accepted that anyone living with insulin-dependent diabetes knows the frustrations of getting carb counting wrong – along with the so-called rollercoaster of hypo- and hyperglycemia that ensues. Considering that all FDA cleared dose calculators have thus far required the user to do carb counting themselves, it is fair to say that the majority of dose calculators have been designed for the minority of people living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. But this is a thing of the past.
(PRNewsfoto/Companion Medical, Inc.)
Companion Medical today confirmed that it has received clearance from the FDA for its InPen bolus calculator for fixed dosing and meal estimation. The new bolus calculator takes into consideration each user’s current glucose level and active insulin – the calculation of the amount of insulin still lowering glucose from previous bolus doses, removing the guesswork from insulin dosing. This is the first time a clearance like this has been issued for those with Type 1 or Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes who administer a fixed amount of insulin for meals or deliver a dose based on the approximate size of their planned meal, as opposed to individual carb estimations. These new capabilities allow InPen to help the majority of patients using multiple daily injections, regardless of their personal insulin regimen.
“Our goal since launching in 2017 has been to make insulin therapy simpler for all people with diabetes – not just the most engaged or advanced. We do this by letting the InPen system do most of the heavy lifting and ease the burden,” said Sean Saint, CEO and founder of Companion Medical. “Similar to the first InPen dose calculator, which has been a game-changer for those of us who count carbs, this new FDA clearance for users on fixed-dose or meal estimation therapy finally offers a simple, yet advanced solution to those people living with insulin-dependent diabetes who are not expert carb counters.”
“The biggest predictor of better control amongst people living with diabetes is the number of insulin doses per day. Patients without a dose calculator with active insulin tracking have been taught for years to dose at least four hours apart because of the dangers of insulin stacking – this allows for only a maximum of three or four doses per day,” said Mike Mensinger, CTO and co-founder at Companion Medical. “With the new calculator modes, InPen provides an experience consistent with these patients’ current therapies, while adjusting recommendations automatically based on their current glucose level and factoring in active insulin to safely allow correction of high blood glucose between meals.”
“This feature allows insulin pen users to be met where they are in their therapy,” said Janice MacLeod who leads Companion Medical’s clinical advocacy efforts. “The clinicians I have spoken to are excited about this feature for their patients, in particular those with Type 2 diabetes who inject insulin. Not all patients are able or wish to, count carbs for every meal, and the option of correction doses informed by InPen’s active insulin tracking is incredibly useful in helping users avoid stacking their insulin and minimizing their risk of low glucose.”
The InPen system, which includes a smart pen and Bluetooth®️ connected app, helps calculate insulin doses, issue dose reminders, track active insulin and send reports to caregivers. InPen is available in the U.S. by prescription only. The app is available for download on the Apple® App Store and Google Play™. For more information, visit www.companionmedical.com.

Pivotal Phase III study shows significant improvements with ERBITUX® in combination with platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil in response rate, disease progression and survival compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone
This marks a meaningful step forward in Merck’s commitment as a global specialty innovator – including bringing innovative medicines to markets with high unmet medical needs
DARMSTADT, Germany, March 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ —
Not intended for UK-based media
Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that ERBITUX® (cetuximab) has been granted approval by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) in combination with platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil. Evidence from the pivotal Phase III CHANGE II study, on which the approval is based, shows the efficacy and safety of the EXTREME regimen (ERBITUX® + cisplatin + 5-FU, followed by ERBITUX® maintenance) vs platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin + 5-FU) alone for first-line treatment in Chinese patients with R/M SCCHN. The data showed that the addition of ERBITUX® to platinum-based chemotherapy improved progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR), confirming the relevance of the EXTREME regimen specifically in this patient population.1
“ERBITUX® in combination with platinum-based therapy is a preferred treatment option for patients with R/M SCCHN globally and the CHANGE II study further demonstrates the benefits it can bring in the first-line setting for patients in China,” said Professor Ye Guo, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, China and principal investigator in the CHANGE II study. “The approval of ERBITUX® in a first-line setting marks an important development for Chinese patients, who now have access to a new treatment option.”
“ERBITUX® and the EXTREME regimen play an important role in the treatment of patients with R/M SCCHN. We welcome the National Medical Products Administration’s decision to make it available to Chinese patients in the first-line setting,” said Chris Round, Head of International Operations and Global Core Franchises, Merck, operating in China. “This approval marks a significant step forward in fulfilling our commitment as a global specialty innovator, including bringing medicines to markets with high unmet medical needs.”
The approval is based on the CHANGE II study of 243 randomized patients (164 patients in the ERBITUX® + platinum-based chemotherapy arm versus 79 patients in the platinum-based chemotherapy only arm) from China with R/M SCCHN, which found that adding ERBITUX® to platinum-based chemotherapy improved progression-free survival (median 5.5 vs 4.2 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40–0.80), overall survival (median 10.2 vs 8.4 months; HR=0.71; 95% CI: 0.50–0.99) and overall response rate (50% vs 27%) with no new or unexpected safety findings.1
CHANGE II is the first Phase III trial in the Chinese population to prospectively evaluate an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody in the first-line treatment of patients with R/M SCCHN. The data are consistent with previous international pivotal studies and reaffirm the efficacy of ERBITUX® in combination with platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil for patients with R/M SCCHN.
In 2019, ERBITUX® was made available in China for the first-line treatment of patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, or in combination with irinotecan in patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy.
About CHANGE II
CHANGE II is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase III trial assessing the efficacy and safety of the EXTREME regimen vs platinum-based therapy for Chinese patients with first-line recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN). The trial included 243 patients in China ≥18 years of age with histologically confirmed R/M SCCHN and no prior systemic chemotherapy for R/M disease. The primary objective was to demonstrate superior PFS time per Response Evaluation Criteria on Solid Tumors (RECIST).
About ERBITUX® (cetuximab)
ERBITUX® is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of ERBITUX® is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Based on in vitro evidence, ERBITUX® also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR-expressing tumor cells (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [ADCC]).
ERBITUX® has already obtained market authorization in over 100 countries worldwide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Merck licensed the right to market ERBITUX®, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998.

The positive opinion is based on P-III SENSCIS study assessing nintedanib (150mg, bid) vs PBO in 576 patients with SSc-ILD across 32+ countries
 The P-III SENSCIS results demonstrated a 44% loss of pulmonary function as measured in FVC, skin thickness as measured by the change in mRSS and QoL measured by SGRQ @52wks.
 Nintedanib is an approved therapy in 70+ countries for the treatment of patients with IPF and has received FDA’s approval as the first therapy to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-ILD in Sept’2019","Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency has adopted a positive opinion for nintedanib for the treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) in adults1
Based upon positive SENSCIS® trial results nintedanib was approved as the first and only therapy in the U.S. to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-ILD2
Nintedanib is already approved in more than 70 countries for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
Ingelheim, Germany, 28 February 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending granting marketing authorisation for nintedanib for the treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) in adults.1 In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nintedanib as the first and only medicine to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adults living with SSc-ILD. Regulatory approvals for the treatment of patients living with SSc-ILD have also been granted in other countries including Canada, Japan and Brazil.
Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is a disfiguring, disabling and potentially fatal rare autoimmune disease.3,4,5 It causes scarring (fibrosis) of various organs, including the lungs, heart, digestive tract and kidneys and can have life-threatening complications. When SSc affects the lungs, it can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD), known as SSc-ILD.2,6 ILD is the leading cause of mortality in SSc, accounting for almost 35% of SSc-related deaths.7
“SSc-ILD is a life-changing disease. Once fibrosis of the lungs occurs it cannot be reversed, and this can have a devastating impact on a patient’s life and daily activities” said Peter Fang, Senior Vice President and Head of Therapeutic Area Inflammation at Boehringer Ingelheim. “Striving to improve the lives of people living with pulmonary fibrosis, we are pleased with the Committee’s positive opinion, which represents an important step forward in helping to slow down the progression of this rare and life-changing disease.”
The positive opinion was based on the results of the SENSCIS® trial, a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with ILD-associated systemic sclerosis (SSc-ILD).2 The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) assessed over a 52-week period. Patients remained on the study treatment for at least 52 weeks of treatment or for a maximum of 100 weeks of treatment. Results showed nintedanib slowed the loss of pulmonary function by 44% (41mL/year) relative to placebo, as measured in FVC over 52 weeks.2 The adverse-event profile of nintedanib was similar to that observed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with the most common adverse event being diarrhoea.2
Notes to Editors
SENSCIS® Trial
SENSCIS® was the largest randomised controlled trial to be conducted in patients with SSc-ILD, involving 576 patients across more than 32 countries including the United States, Canada, China, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in lung function as measured in FVC (mL/year) assessed over 52 weeks. The trial also collected data on other manifestations of the disease with key secondary endpoints identified as skin thickness as measured by absolute changes from baseline in modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) and health-related quality of life measured by the total score on the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at week 52. Enrolment criteria included a diagnosis of SSc with onset of first non-Raynaud symptoms within 7 years, ILD confirmed by high resolution computed tomographic that showed fibrosis affecting at least 10% of the lungs, at least 40% predicted FVC, and a diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) as 30–89% predicted. Patients were randomised to receive nintedanib 150 mg twice daily or placebo. Patients on stable therapy with mycophenolate or methotrexate and/or taking prednisone up to 10 mg/day were allowed to participate.2
About systemic sclerosis-associated ILD
Systemic sclerosis-associated ILD is a chronic lung disease in which scar tissue (“fibrosis”) and/or inflammation builds up in the walls of the air sacs of the lungs in a person with a diagnosis of scleroderma.8 The disease impacts four times as many women as men, and the onset of the disease typically occurs at a young age, between 25 and 55 years.9
Nintedanib 
Nintedanib is already approved in more than 70 countries for the treatment of patients living with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) – a chronic and ultimately fatal disease characterised by a decline in lung function. It is estimated that over 80,000 people with IPF have been treated with nintedanib.
Nintedanib is one of two antifibrotic drugs shown to slow the disease progression in IPF, and they are approved and recommended for use in IPF patients by international guidelines.2 
In September 2019, nintedanib was approved in the U.S. as the first and only therapy to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated ILD. Submissions have been made to other regulatory bodies across the globe and so far, regulatory approvals have been granted in Canada, Japan, Brazil and other countries.

March 02, 2020 06:55 AM Eastern Standard Time
FOSTER CITY, Calif. & MENLO PARK, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) and Forty Seven, Inc. (Nasdaq: FTSV) announced today that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Gilead will acquire Forty Seven for $95.50 per share in cash. The transaction, which values Forty Seven at approximately $4.9 billion, was unanimously approved by both the Gilead and Forty Seven Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close during the second quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Through the addition of Forty Seven’s investigational lead product candidate, magrolimab, the acquisition will strengthen Gilead’s immuno-oncology research and development portfolio. Magrolimab is a monoclonal antibody in clinical development for the treatment of several cancers for which new, transformative medicines are urgently needed, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The investigational therapy targets CD47, a “do not eat me” signal that allows cancer cells to avoid destruction thereby permitting the patient’s own innate immune system to engulf and eradicate those cancer cells. Forty Seven presented promising results of a Phase 1b study of magrolimab in patients with MDS and AML at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December 2019. Magrolimab has the potential to be a first-in-class therapy.
“This agreement builds on Gilead’s presence in immuno-oncology and adds significant potential to our clinical pipeline,” said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences. “Magrolimab complements our existing work in hematology, adding a non-cell therapy program that complements Kite’s pipeline of cell therapies for hematological cancers. With a profile that lends itself to combination therapies, magrolimab could potentially have transformative benefits for a range of tumor types. We are looking forward to working with the highly experienced team at Forty Seven to help patients with some of the most challenging forms of cancer.”
“This is an exciting day for patients who may one day benefit from future anti-CD47 therapies and other immuno-oncology treatments based on our research and an exciting time for Forty Seven as this allows us to achieve our vision of helping patients defeat their cancer,” commented Mark McCamish, MD, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Forty Seven. “We are pleased to join Gilead and believe that by combining our scientific expertise with Gilead’s strength in developing treatments that modify the immune system, we will be able to more rapidly advance our therapies.”
Magrolimab
Forty Seven is initially studying magrolimab in patients with MDS and AML. Additional studies are ongoing in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and solid tumors. Magrolimab has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MDS and AML, and for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL and follicular lymphoma, two forms of B-cell NHL. Magrolimab has also been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of MDS and AML and by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of AML.
More than 400 patients have received the compound to date through clinical trials.
Ongoing Phase 1b Clinical Trial
In December 2019, Forty Seven presented promising results of a Phase 1b trial evaluating magrolimab in combination with azacitidine in untreated patients with higher risk MDS and untreated patients with AML, who are ineligible for induction chemotherapy. This has led to the initiation of a potential registrational cohort in MDS. All patients received a 1 mg/kg priming dose of magrolimab, coupled with intrapatient dose escalation to mitigate on-target anemia. Patients were then treated with full doses of azacitidine and magrolimab maintenance doses of 30 mg/kg weekly.
As of the data cutoff of November 18, 2019, 62 patients had been treated with the combination in the Phase 1b portion of the trial, including 35 patients with MDS and 27 patients with AML.
Clinical Activity Data
As of the data cutoff, 46 patients were evaluable for response assessment, including 24 patients with untreated higher-risk MDS and 22 patients with untreated AML, who were ineligible for induction chemotherapy.
In higher-risk MDS, the overall response rate (ORR) was 92 percent, with 12 patients (50 percent) achieving a complete response (CR), eight patients (33 percent) achieving a marrow CR and two patients (8 percent) achieving hematologic improvement. Two patients (8 percent) had stable disease.
In untreated AML, the ORR was 64 percent, with nine patients (41 percent) achieving a CR, three patients (14 percent) achieving a CR with complete blood count recovery (CRi) and one patient (5 percent) achieving a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). Seven patients (32 percent) had stable disease and one patient (5 percent) had progressive disease.
The median time to response among MDS and AML patients treated with the combination was 1.9 months.
Median duration of response and median overall survival have not been reached for either MDS or AML patients, with a median follow-up of 6.4 months (range 2.0 to 14.4 months) for MDS and 8.8 months (range 1.9 to 16.9 months) for AML.
Safety Data
As of the data cutoff, the combination of magrolimab and azacitidine was well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicities compared to azacitidine alone. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with prior clinical experience. No deaths were observed in the first 60 days on combination treatment and only one patient out of 62 (1.6 percent) discontinued treatment due to a treatment-related AE.
Additional Programs
Beyond magrolimab, Forty Seven is preparing to advance two additional investigational compounds into clinical testing. FSI-174, an anti-cKIT antibody, is being developed in combination with magrolimab as a novel, all-antibody conditioning regimen to address the limitations of current stem cell transplantation conditioning regimens. FSI-189, an anti-SIRPα antibody, is being developed for the treatment of cancer, as well as certain non-oncology settings, including transplantation conditioning.
Terms of the Transaction
Under the terms of the merger agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead will promptly commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Forty Seven’s common stock at a price of $95.50 per share in cash. Following successful completion of the tender offer, Gilead will acquire all remaining shares not tendered in the offer through a second step merger at the same price as in the tender offer.
Consummation of the tender offer is subject to a minimum tender of at least a majority of outstanding Forty Seven shares plus Forty Seven shares underlying vested options, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions.
Gilead plans to pay all cash consideration for the transaction. The tender offer is not subject to a financing condition.
Citi and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint financial advisors to Gilead. Centerview Partners LLC is acting as the exclusive financial advisor to Forty Seven. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as legal counsel to Gilead and Cooley LLP is serving as legal counsel to Forty Seven.

28328,Takeda to Divest a Portfolio of Select OTC and Non-Core Assets to Hypera Pharma in Latin America for $825M,TAKEDA AGREES TO DIVEST SELECT OTC AND NON-CORE ASSETS IN LATIN AMERICA TO HYPERA PHARMA FOR $825 MILLION USD,"Takeda will divest a portfolio of ~18 select OTC and prescription pharmaceutical assets including Neosaldina, Nesina, and Dramin sold in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru to Hypera for a total value ~$825M. The transaction is expected to be close in H2’20
 Takeda expects that its ~300 employees supporting the divested assets will be given the opportunity to transition over to Hypera. Additionally, Takeda and Hypera Pharma signed a manufacturing & supply agreement under which Takeda will manufacture the products and supply them to Hypera
 The divestiture marks Takeda’s fifth divestment over the last 12mos. and allow the company to focus on its key areas by simplifying its portfolio","March 2, 2020– Company further sharpens focus on patient access to innovative medicines in Latin America
– Transaction further accelerates deleveraging
Osaka, JAPAN, March 2, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest a portfolio of select non-core products exclusively in Latin America to Hypera S.A. (“Hypera Pharma”), Brazil’s largest pharmaceutical company with a leading position in branded prescriptions, consumer health and branded generics, for a total value of $825M USD.
The portfolio includes over-the-counter and prescription pharmaceutical products sold in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru, which are part of Takeda’s Growth & Emerging Markets Business Unit.
“Takeda remains firmly committed to the emerging markets and Latin America. This divestment enables us to focus our investments in these countries that center on our highly innovative medicines across Gastroenterology, Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience,” said Ricardo Marek, President, Growth & Emerging Markets Business Unit, Takeda, “Doing so will help meet the unmet needs of patients living with complex and rare conditions. At the same time, we are confident that Hypera Pharma is well placed to provide patients with uninterrupted access to the products they will acquire.”
This is Takeda’s fifth divestment over the last 12 months, contributing to the Company’s goal to divest approximately $10 billion USD in non-core assets. Takeda intends to use the proceeds from its divestitures to continue to reduce its debt and accelerate rapid deleveraging toward its target of 2x net debt/adjusted EBITDA within March 2022 – March 2024.
Takeda previously announced the sales of TachoSil® to Ethicon for $400 million USD in May 2019, Xiidra® to Novartis for up to $5.3 billion USD in July 2019, non-core assets in countries spanning Near East, Middle East and Africa to Acino for over $200 million USD in October 2019, and a portfolio of non-core assets in Russia, Georgia, and a number of Commonwealth of Independent States countries to STADA for $660 million USD in November 2019.
The non-core products in this latest transaction generated revenues of approximately $215 million USD in Fiscal Year 2018, driven by sales of key products such as Neosaldina®, Nesina®, and Dramin®.
While these trusted products continue to play important roles in meeting patient needs, they are not within Takeda’s chosen business areas – Gastroenterology, Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience – that are core to its global long-term strategy. Their divestment enables the Company to further focus on its key business areas through simplifying its portfolio.
“This announcement marks the latest step in Takeda’s strategy of streamlining and optimizing our portfolio while accelerating our deleveraging. By continuing to focus on our key business areas and pipeline of innovative medicines, we will strengthen our position as a R&D driven global biopharmaceutical leader and deliver enhanced value for patients and Takeda shareholders,” said Costa Saroukos, Chief Financial Officer, Takeda.
Transaction Details
Takeda has entered into an agreement to divest the rights, title, and interest to the products in a portfolio of approximately 18 select OTC and prescription pharmaceutical assets sold in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru – to Hypera Pharma for a total value of $825M USD.
Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda anticipates that approximately 300 commercial employees supporting the divested assets will be given the opportunity to transition over to Hypera Pharma at the close of this transaction.
Takeda and Hypera Pharma have also entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement under which Takeda will continue to manufacture these products and supply them to Hypera Pharma.
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Until then, Takeda remains the owner of these products and responsible for ensuring patient access to them.
Takeda is being advised by BofA Securities (financial advisor) and White & Case (legal advisor) in this transaction.

OA with inadequate pain relief with other analgesics
 The regulatory submission is based on data from 39 P-I-III clinical studies assessing tanezumab in 18,000 patients, including three P-III studies evaluating tanezumab (SC) in patients with mod. to sev. OA
 Tanezumab is an investigational mAb targeting & inhibiting NGF with its anticipated PDUFA date in Dec’2020. In 2013, Pfizer & Eli Lilly collaborated to develop and commercialize tanezumab as non-opioid pain medication addressing the unmet medical needs of patients","NEW YORK and INDIANAPOLIS, March 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review a Biologics License Application (BLA) for tanezumab 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (SC), which is being evaluated for patients with chronic pain due to moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA) who have experienced inadequate pain relief with other analgesics. Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that is part of an investigational class of non-opioid chronic pain medications known as nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibitors.
More than 27 million Americans are living with OA, 11 million of whom have moderate-to-severe OA. Currently available treatment options for moderate-to-severe OA do not meet the needs of all patients, and many cycle through multiple therapies to find relief from their pain. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for the FDA to make a decision on the tanezumab application is in December 2020. In its acceptance letter, the FDA stated that it is currently planning to hold an Advisory Committee meeting to discuss this application.
“The FDA acceptance of the tanezumab application represents a significant milestone, and the breadth of our regulatory submission reflects the extensive clinical data we have gathered for tanezumab over the course of its development,” said Ken Verburg, tanezumab development team leader, Pfizer Global Product Development. “There is an urgent need for innovation in the treatment of osteoarthritis, as there have been no new classes of medicines available for this debilitating condition in more than a decade. If approved, tanezumab would be a first-in-class treatment for patients suffering from chronic pain due to moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis who have experienced inadequate pain relief with other analgesics.”
“Osteoarthritis patients face a significant burden – due to the physical pain they experience, nearly every aspect of their lives can be impacted. This pain can affect their ability to participate in daily activities, which can have significant psychological, social and societal consequences,” said Patrik Jonsson, president, LillyBio-Medicines. “We look forward to working closely with the FDA to potentially bring tanezumab to patients living with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis.”
The tanezumab regulatory submission encompasses data from 39 Phase 1-3 clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of tanezumab among more than 18,000 patients, including three Phase 3 studies evaluating SC administration of tanezumab in patients with moderate-to-severe OA.
About Tanezumab
Tanezumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that works by selectively targeting, binding to and inhibiting NGF. NGF levels increase in the body as a result of injury, inflammation or in chronic pain states. By inhibiting NGF, tanezumab may help to keep pain signals produced by muscles, skin and organs from reaching the spinal cord and brain. Tanezumab has a novel mechanism that acts in the periphery in a different manner than opioids and other analgesics, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in studies to date, tanezumab has not demonstrated a risk of addiction, misuse or dependence.
The Pfizer-Lilly Alliance
In 2013, Pfizer and Lilly entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize tanezumab, a monoclonal antibody that is part of an investigational class of non-opioid pain medications known as NGF inhibitors. Tanezumab has the potential to address significant unmet needs in moderate-to-severe OA, a condition that can have life-altering physical, social, psychological and economic impacts. We are driven by our shared mission to improve the lives of the millions of people who are suffering from chronic pain. Together, we are leveraging our deep clinical expertise with the goal of delivering scientific innovation in chronic pain management and making a meaningful difference for people around the world.

 The companies will exclusively work together to develop promoters utilizing SuRE technology for the uniQure’s research pipeline and will explore the further development of AAV vector libraries containing fragments of the non-coding human genome
 The collaboration will combine Gen-X platform will uniQure’s expertise in AAV gene therapy which accelerates the development of advanced gene therapy candidates","~ Gen-X Will Work with uniQure During an Exclusivity Period to Identify Novel Promoters for uniQure’s Product Portfolio ~

~ uniQure Receives Option to Acquire Gen-X Business for Use in Gene Therapy ~

LEXINGTON, Mass. and AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands, March 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — uniQure N.V. (NASDAQ: QURE), a leading gene therapy company advancing transformative therapies for patients with severe medical needs, and Gen-X, a spin-off company from the Netherlands Cancer Institute, today announced that they have signed an exclusive research collaboration and license agreement with Gen-X, with an option for uniQure to acquire Gen-X, to identify novel synthetic promoters for use in gene therapy products.

Gen-X performs functional annotation of the non-coding genome using its proprietary Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE) technology. This technology measures the potential of hundreds of millions of DNA elements for their ability to serve as promoters or enhancers, driving the gene expression with a range of unique properties for gene therapy applications. The SuRE technology is unique among other promoter-identification technologies in finding non-coding promoter elements throughout the genome at remote sites where activity is regulated.

“Novel promoters are an important area of innovation in gene therapy with the potential to enable valuable functionality and improve treatment options,” stated Jonathan Garen, chief business officer of uniQure. “With the unique SuRE methodology developed by Gen-X, we will now leverage our modular technology platform to potentially identify new promoters and enhancers that drive gene expression in the right cell-type and under the right conditions. We are excited about the collaboration, providing us with the potential of applying this state-of-the-art technology and increasing the expression and effectiveness of our next generation gene therapy product candidates.”

During the collaboration, Gen-X will work exclusively with uniQure to develop promoters for the uniQure research pipeline. Through the SuRE technology, the Gen-X promoter library is designed to identify novel promoters to regulate gene activity and, if needed, conditionally control protein production. The parties will also explore further development of AAV vector libraries containing fragments of the non-coding human genome.

 The P-III ICARIA-MM study results: improvement in PFS (11.53 vs 6.47); improvement in ORR (60.4% vs 35.3%)
 Sarclisa is mAb targeting CD38 receptor on MM cells, act by inducing apoptosis & immunomodulatory activity and has received FDA & EMA’s ODD with its anticipated availability in the US soon","Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% compared to pom-dex alone in a pivotal trial
* FDA approval based on data from the only randomized Phase 3 trial (ICARIA-MM) to evaluate an anti-CD38 in combination with pom-dex that has presented results to date
* Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer, affecting more than 130,000 patients in the U.S.; approximately 32,000 Americans are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year
BRIDGEWATER, N.J., March 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Sarclisa® (isatuximab-irfc) in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adults with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Sarclisa is expected to be available to patients in the U.S. shortly.
Sarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma cells.
“Today’s FDA approval of Sarclisa provides a new treatment option for patients with difficult-to-treat multiple myeloma. These are patients whose disease has returned or become resistant to their prior treatments,” said Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. “At Sanofi, we are focused on discovering and developing medicines that may change the practice of medicine, and Sarclisa offers a potential new standard of care in the United States. We continue to evaluate Sarclisa in a comprehensive clinical program in multiple myeloma, as well as in other blood cancers and solid tumors.”

Sarclisa Safety Profile and Efficacy in Difficult-to-Treat Patients
In the ICARIA-MM study, Sarclisa added to pom-dex (Sarclisa combination therapy) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) with a median PFS of 11.53 months compared to 6.47 months with pom-dex alone (HR 0.596, 95% CI: 0.44-0.81, p=0.0010). Sarclisa combination therapy also demonstrated a significantly greater overall response rate compared to pom-dex alone (60.4% vs. 35.3%, p<0.0001). 

“Most patients with multiple myeloma unfortunately relapse and become refractory to currently available therapies. Sarclisa used in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone offers an important new treatment option for patients in the United States living with this incurable disease,” said Paul Richardson, MD, principal investigator of ICARIA-MM, and clinical program leader and director of clinical research at the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “The pivotal ICARIA-MM trial was the first Phase 3 study of a CD38 antibody in combination with pom-dex to present results demonstrating significant clinical benefit in this setting. The study enrolled a broad population of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that is particularly difficult to treat and with poor prognosis, which is reflective of real-world practice.”

The most common adverse reactions (occurring in 20% or more of patients) in patients who received Sarclisa combination therapy were neutropenia (96%), infusion-related reactions (39%), pneumonia (31%), upper respiratory tract infection (57%) and diarrhea (26%). Serious adverse reactions that occurred in more than 5% of patients who received Sarclisa combination therapy included pneumonia (25.3%) and febrile neutropenia (12.3%). Permanent discontinuation of Sarclisa combination therapy due to an adverse reaction (Grades 3-4) occurred in 7% of patients, and 3% of patients discontinued due to an infusion-related reaction.
An Important New Option for Treating Multiple Myeloma
Sarclisa offers an intravenous (IV) administration and is dosed at 10 mg/kg, in combination with pom-dex, every week for four weeks and then every two weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The first cycle is administered in an infusion time of 200 minutes, which can decrease to 75 minutes for the third cycle onwards. A treatment cycle is 28 days.
The U.S. list price (wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC) for Sarclisa is $650 per 100 mg vial and $3,250 per 500 mg vial. For a typical patient in the U.S., between 70-80 kg (154-176 lbs), this correlates to a cost of $5,200 per infusion. Actual costs to patients are generally anticipated to be lower as the list price does not reflect insurance coverage, copay support, or financial assistance from patient support programs. Sanofi is committed to responsible pricing while bringing innovative and valuable therapies to patients with significant unmet need.
Patients in the U.S. who have been prescribed Sarclisa may be eligible to enroll in the CareASSIST Patient Support Program, which provides reimbursement support and financial assistance to eligible patients. For more information, please call 1-833-WE+CARE (1-833-930-2273) or visit SanofiCareAssist.com/Sarclisa.
Multiple Myeloma Leads to Significant Disease Burden
Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy,i affecting more than 130,000 patients in the United States; approximately 32,000 Americansii are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year. Despite available treatments, multiple myeloma remains an incurable malignancy, and is associated with significant patient burden. As patients relapse, they can become refractory to therapies they have received. There is a need for new agents so that patients and physicians can have options as the disease progresses over time. Relapsed (or recurrent) multiple myeloma means that the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Since multiple myeloma does not have a cure, most patients will relapse at some point. Refractory multiple myeloma refers to cancer that does not respond to therapy.
About Sarclisa
Sarclisa is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma cells. It is designed to induce programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on multiple myeloma cells and cell surface receptors, making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa.
Sarclisa has Orphan Drug Designation status from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In the second quarter of 2019, the EMA accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application for use of Sarclisa in combination with pom-dex for the treatment of certain patients with RRMM. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of the U.S.
Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments for people with relapsed refractory or newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other blood cancer types (hematologic malignancies) and solid tumors.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Thermo Fisher uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted operating income, which exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and significant transaction costs; restructuring and other costs/income; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS also excludes certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, benefits from tax credit carryforwards, the impact of significant tax audits or events and the results of discontinued operations. Thermo Fisher excludes the above items because they are outside of the company’s normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. Thermo Fisher believes that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of the company’s core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.

– The designation is based on results from a Phase II trial, which suggested Esbriet slowed disease progression in patients with uILD at 24 weeks –

March 03, 2020 01:00 AM Eastern Standard Time
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Esbriet®(pirfenidone) for adults with unclassifiable interstitial lung disease (uILD). The designation was granted based on data from a Phase II trial, which studied the efficacy and safety of Esbriet in uILD. The study represented the first randomized controlled trial to exclusively enroll patients with progressive fibrosing uILD.
“We look forward to discussing the data with the FDA with the hope of bringing our important medicine to those with uILD who are currently without a treatment option.”

“Today’s milestone for Esbriet builds on our continued commitment to improving the standard of care for people living with fibrotic lung diseases,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “We look forward to discussing the data with the FDA with the hope of bringing our important medicine to those with uILD who are currently without a treatment option.”
ILD is a term that broadly describes a diverse group of more than 200 types of rare pulmonary diseases. While ILDs share similar features, including cough and shortness of breath, each ILD has different causes, treatment approaches, and outlooks. Approximately 10% of people living with ILD reviewed by a multidisciplinary team cannot be given a definitive diagnosis, even after a thorough investigation, and in these cases, people are categorized as having uILD.
The Phase II data supporting Breakthrough Therapy Designation were recently presented as a late-breaking abstract at the 2019 European Respiratory Society’s annual meeting and simultaneously published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The data suggested Esbriet slowed disease progression and supported its efficacy on a number of lung function parameters including forced vital capacity (FVC), in people with uILD. The safety and tolerability profile of Esbriet in people with uILD was comparable with that observed in Phase III trials in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to accelerate the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions with preliminary evidence that indicates they may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. This is the 33rd Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Genentech’s portfolio of medicines.
About the Phase II Study
This international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II trial at 70 centers included patients (aged ≥18-85 years) with progressive fibrosing uILD, a percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) of 45% or higher and percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLco) of 30% or higher, more than 10% fibrosis on high-resolution CT, and a high-resolution CT from the previous 12 months.
The primary endpoint was mean predicted change in FVC from baseline over 24 weeks, measured by daily home spirometry. Secondary endpoints were change in FVC measured by site spirometry, proportion of patients who had a more than 5% or more than 10% absolute or relative decline in percent predicted FVC measured by clinic-based spirometry, change in percent predicted DLco, change in 6-min walk distance (6MWD), change in University of California San Diego-Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ) score, change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, change in cough visual analogue scale, and changes in total and subscores of the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), all of which were compared with baseline.
Analysis of the primary endpoint was affected by intraindividual variability in home spirometry values, which prevented application of the prespecified statistical model to the primary endpoint assessment. Over 24 weeks, predicted median change in FVC measured by home spirometry was -87.7 mL (Q1-Q3 -338.1 to 148.6) in the pirfenidone group versus -157.1 mL (–370.9 to 70.1) in the placebo group. Over 24 weeks, predicted mean change in FVC measured by site spirometry was lower in patients given pirfenidone than placebo (treatment difference 95.3 mL, p=0.002). Results for DLco and 6MWD generally trended in favor of pirfenidone treatment. Adverse event reporting reflected the known safety profile of pirfenidone. The most common treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (47% in the pirfenidone group vs 26% in the placebo group), fatigue (13% vs 10%), and rash (10% vs 7%). Pirfenidone treatment was associated with less loss to lung function and exercise capacity compared with placebo over 24 weeks. The results of this study suggest that patients with progressive fibrosing uILD may benefit from pirfenidone therapy.
About Esbriet
Esbriet is an oral medicine approved for the treatment of IPF and is available in more than 60 countries worldwide. Esbriet was approved for use in Europe in 2011 in adults with mild-to-moderate IPF and in the U.S. in people with IPF in October 2014. In early 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Esbriet 801 mg and 267 mg tablets as new options for administering the medicine for the treatment of IPF. The 801 mg tablets, which are now available in the U.S., offer people with IPF a maintenance option for taking Esbriet with fewer pills per day.

NEW YORK, March 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — PAVmed Inc. (Nasdaq: PAVM, PAVMZ) (the “Company” or “PAVmed”), a highly differentiated, multiproduct medical device company, today announced that its majority owned subsidiary, Lucid Diagnostics Inc. (“Lucid”), has entered into a clinical trial research agreement with the University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”) for a clinical trial designed to evaluate whether Lucid’s EsoCheck™ Esophageal Cell Collection Device with Collect+Protect™ Technology (“EsoCheck”) provides a less invasive, more efficient, and cost-effective alternative to endoscopic biopsies in the management of patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a rapidly emerging allergy-mediated inflammatory condition of the esophagus similar to and often associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although underappreciated by the medical community and frequently confused with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), EoE has a prevalence comparable to IBD and exacts a significant burden on patients. It can lead to swallowing difficulties, esophageal scarring, food impaction and pain. Current treatment includes oral steroids and an elimination diet. Since inflammation can persist despite resolution of symptoms, treatment courses can be very difficult and costly for patients, requiring multiple and frequent invasive endoscopies with biopsies. To date efforts to replace endoscopy with a non-invasive diagnostic device have proven unsuccessful.

EsoCheck is an FDA 510(k)-cleared non-invasive device designed to sample cells from a targeted region of the esophagus in a five-minute office-based procedure, without the need for endoscopy. (EsoCheck animation). Although EsoCheck was originally designed to facilitate the diagnosis of Barrett’s Esophagus in conjunction with Lucid’s EsoGuard™ Esophageal DNA Test, it can also be used to sample esophageal cells to assist in the diagnosis and management of any esophageal condition including EoE.

The Lucid-Penn agreement covers a research program entitled “Pilot Study of EsoCheck Compared to Biopsies and Brush Cytology During Endoscopy for Evaluation of Eosinophilic Esophagitis” (the “Study”) led by principal investigator Gary W. Falk, M.D., M.S., AGAF. Dr. Falk is a professor of Gastroenterology, the clinical co-director of the Joint Center for Digestive, Liver and Pancreatic Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and the co-director of the Penn Medicine Esophageal and Swallowing Center at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He is also a Director of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus and Past President of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).

“We are excited to partner with Dr. Falk and his team at the University of Pennsylvania to explore yet another application for our versatile EsoCheck Cell Collection Device, the only esophageal cell collection device capable of performing targeted and protected sampling of esophageal cells” said Lishan Aklog, M.D., PAVmed’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Lucid’s Executive Chairman. “Dr. Falk is one of the world’s leading experts on EoE and we hope this research partnership will yield results that can dramatically improve the care of long-suffering EoE patients.”

The trial is a prospective cross-sectional pilot feasibility study of ten patients with suspected or established EoE scheduled for a clinically indicated upper endoscopy. The patients will undergo esophageal sampling using EsoCheck followed by endoscopy, including brushings and biopsies. The primary endpoint of the trial is the sensitivity and specificity of EsoCheck versus endoscopic biopsy in the assessment of EoE.

“There is a major unmet need for the development of non-invasive tools as an alternative to standard endoscopy in the management of EoE. I am excited to partner with Lucid on this important investigator initiated clinical trial,” said Dr. Falk. “I approached Lucid to collaborate on this project because EsoCheck is a novel new device capable of collecting esophageal cells without dilution and contamination. EoE is an important condition which can result in significant complications and impairment in quality of life that merits active treatment with close monitoring. Our EoE patients very much need an alternative to multiple and frequent endoscopies to monitor and tailor their treatment program. I look forward to evaluating the data derived from the trial and evaluating the potential of using EsoCheck as part of a non-invasive EoE monitoring program.”

28397,Novartis' Mayzent Receives Health Canada's Approval for Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis with Active Disease,Novartis receives Health Canada approval for Mayzent (siponimod) to treat secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease,"The approval is based on P-III EXPAND study assessing Mayzent vs PBO in 1651 patients with SPMS from 31 countries including 47 participants in Canada with a mean age of 48yrs., living with MS for ~16yrs., >50% had a median EDDS score of 6.0 and relied on a walking aid
 The P-III EXPAND study result demonstrated a reduction in diseases progression, including impact on physical disability
 Mayzent is an S1P receptor modulator and the first oral therapy approved for SPMS with active disease. The approval of Mayzent is a tribute to Novartis’s relentless commitment to reimagining MS treatment","MayzentTM (siponimod) is the first oral treatment approved for people living with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease, and the first treatment approved for SPMS with active disease in almost 15 years1
Most people living with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) will develop SPMS2
Approval is based on the Phase III EXPAND trial, the largest controlled clinical study of people living with SPMS, showing MayzentTM significantly reduced the risk of disease progression, including impact on physical disability3
DORVAL, QC, March 3, 2020 /CNW/ – Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (Novartis) is pleased to announce that Health Canada has approved MayzentTM (siponimod) for the treatment of adults with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features characteristic of multiple sclerosis inflammatory activity, to delay the progression of physical disability. SPMS follows a relapsing-remitting (RRMS) course of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is characterized by progressive worsening with fewer, or no relapses, and nerve damage or loss4. SPMS is defined as active when individuals experience relapses or there is evidence of new MRI activity5.

A snapshot of Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) (CNW Group/Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.)
“One of the top treatment goals for individuals with MS is delaying disability progression and we’re delighted to deliver the first and only oral treatment proven to slow disease progression in those with active SPMS,” said Dawn Bell, Chief Scientific Officer and VP Medical Affairs, Novartis Canada. “The approval of MayzentTM is a testament to our relentless commitment to reimagine MS treatment.”
People living with SPMS experience changes in their MS symptoms with fewer or no relapses, and there can be minor remissions and plateaus6. Progression most frequently includes mobility issues, which may lead to the need for walking aids, bladder dysfunction, and cognitive decline7.
“We are pleased to see that Health Canada has approved an additional therapeutic advancement targeting progressive forms of the disease. MS is unpredictable. The more treatment options for people with MS, the more opportunities they have in managing their individual symptoms throughout their MS journey,” said Dr. Pamela Valentine, President and CEO, MS Society of Canada.
“As the first oral therapy specifically approved for SPMS, MayzentTM may help those living with active SPMS by slowing disease progression,” said Dr. Mark S. Freedman, Professor of Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa.
About the EXPAND Study and Multiple Sclerosis
EXPAND is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of MayzentTM versus placebo in people with SPMS. The study included 1,651 people with a diagnosis of SPMS from 31 countries, including 47 participants in Canada3. Those enrolled in EXPAND were representative of a typical SPMS population: at study initiation, participants had a mean age of 48 years, had been living with MS for approximately 16 years and more than 50% had a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6.0 and relied on a walking aid3. EXPAND included a subset of patient with active disease (n=779), defined as patients with relapses in the two years prior to the study and/or presence of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline. The baseline characteristics were similar except for signs of activity compared to the overall population.
About Multiple Sclerosis and MayzentTM (siponimod)
MS is a chronic, often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system (CNS), made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve8. It affects over 77,000 Canadians – one of the highest prevalence rates in the world9,10. MS is currently classified as an autoimmune disease of the CNS8. The disease attacks and destroys myelin – the protective fatty insulation around the nerve fibres of the brain and spinal cord – interrupting signals between the brain and the body8.
There are three main forms of MS: RRMS (the most common form of the condition at diagnosis), SPMS and primary progressive MS (PPMS)11. The disease progression rate, severity, and specific symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from one person to another8.
MayzentTM is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator indicated for the treatment of SPMS in adults with active disease. MayzentTM targets two separate receptors involved in the immune response of the CNS3. Siponimod binding to S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes prevents lymphocyte from egressing the lymph nodes and as a consequence, from entering the CNS of patients with MS.

 The Elecsys GALAD will be the first GALAD score with regulatory approval to be used as IVD targeting the improvement in diagnostic workflows in the management of chronic liver disease
 The Elecsys GALAD score in combination with blood-based biomarkers support clinicians by providing them accurate and timely information to make earlier interventions, thus improves patient’s outcomes and reduces the mortality rate in patients with HCC","The Elecsys GALAD score aims to support clinicians in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma by giving them more timely and accurate information to make earlier interventions
When hepatocellular carcinoma is detected and managed at the very earliest, patient’s 5-year survival rates can increase to over 70%1
Utilizing blood-based biomarkers, as part of the Elecsys GALAD score, is minimally invasive to patients
Basel, 4 March 2020 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Device Designation to the Elecsys® GALAD score.* This algorithmic score combines gender and age with the biomarker results of the Elecsys AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II and is intended to aid diagnosis of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Dr. Amit Singal, Medical Director of the Liver Tumor Program and Clinical Chief of Pathology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, USA, stated, “HCC is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with the highest burden of disease in East Asia and Africa. This high mortality is largely driven by most patients being detected at a late stage, when curative therapies are no longer possible. Therefore, improving early HCC detection is a critical area of need.”
The Elecsys GALAD score will be the first GALAD score, with regulatory approval, for use in In Vitro Diagnostics and is an integral part of the Roche Diagnostics Liver Indication Program, which aims to improve diagnostic workflows throughout chronic liver disease management. Combined with ultrasound, the Elecsys GALAD score has the potential to support clinicians by giving them more accurate information at an earlier stage, thus improving patient outcomes while being minimally invasive for people and potentially also more affordable to healthcare systems.
Liver cancer is one of the few cancers that are on the rise.2 While recent developments in screening and new treatments are making advances in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HCC, clinicians still face challenges in diagnosing the disease early enough. Only 44% of liver cancer patients are diagnosed at an early stage.3 Of HCC patients, which are diagnosed with late-stage disease, less than 16% survive a period of 5 years. Of the patients diagnosed at an early stage, 70% percent are still alive after five years1. Therefore, diagnosing HCC, as early as possible, is essential to improving patient outcomes.
“We are excited about FDA’s recognition of the potential clinical benefit the Elecsys GALAD score could bring in diagnosing hepatocellular cancer at an early stage,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “The combination of blood-based biomarkers with clinical algorithms has the potential to significantly reduce mortality of HCC patients as they can receive a more timely diagnosis and treatment.”
About GALAD Score
Pioneered by Professor Philip Johnson, Deputy Director of NWCR Centre and Professor in Translational Oncology at the University of Liverpool, and colleagues from the UK, the GALAD score is a serum biomarker-based model that predicts the probability of having hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic liver disease. This combines gender and age with the results from assays AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II to give the clinician a clearer picture of HCC risk.
In chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, Alpha1-fetoprotein (AFP) may be chronically elevated. Very high concentrations of AFP may be produced by certain tumors. This characteristic makes the AFP test useful as a tumor marker. AFP-L3 is a subtype of AFP and can be used to differentiate an increase in AFP due to HCC, or benign liver disease. PIVKA-II is a precursor and abnormal form of prothrombin that is found in patients with HCC. This can be used to differentiate HCC from non-HCC hepatic diseases.PIVKA-II is an alternate name for des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP).
About Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend surveillance of high risk populations for HCC, every 6 months using ultrasound, either with or without a blood test to check protein levels (AFP).4 Ultrasound examinations can be sensitive enough to detect small masses on the liver. While easily done in a doctor’s office, ultrasound examinations are less conclusive with inexperienced technicians and in patients with obesity and fatty liver disease. A recent meta-analysis suggested that ultrasound may miss more than half of early stage HCCs.5 Therefore, other methods of diagnosis, such as abdominal CT scan, abdominal MRI scan or liver biopsy are often needed.4 These are more accurate than ultrasound, though are more invasive and uncomfortable for patients, as well as being costly to the healthcare system.
Liver cancer is one of the few cancers that are on the rise, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary type of liver cancer, accounts for 90% of these cases.6Worldwide, the most common risk factor for HCC is viral hepatitis – known to cause inflammation of the liver.6,7 Chronic hepatitis B accounts for approximately 50% of all cases of HCC, and the majority of cases of childhood HCC.8 Other risk factors include aflatoxin – a carcinogenic mould found in contaminated foods, especially rice, in hot and humid climates.6
Viral hepatitis B has a particularly high prevalence in most countries in Asia, and this prevalence directly contributes to higher incidences of HCC in the region.7,9An increasingly important risk factor for the development of HCC is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), linked with fatty foods and obesity.10 This is the fastest-growing rate of any cancer and is thought to be driven in part by this risk factor, along with increased alcohol use.11

– Exploring the potential to repurpose marketed products and molecules to potentially treat COVID-19
Cambridge, Mass. and Osaka, Japan, March 4, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) today will share with members of the United States Congress that it is initiating the development of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal hyperimmune globulin (H-IG) to treat high-risk individuals with COVID-19, while also studying whether Takeda’s currently marketed and pipeline products may be effective treatments for infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.
Hyperimmune globulins are plasma derived-therapies that have previously been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections and may be a treatment option for COVID-19. As a leader in plasma-derived therapies with more than 75 years of experience in the development of plasma-derived products, Takeda has the expertise to research, develop, and manufacture a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal H-IG, which Takeda is referring to as TAK-888.
“As a company dedicated to the health and well-being of people around the world, we will do all that we can to address the novel coronavirus threat,” said Dr. Rajeev Venkayya, President of Takeda’s Vaccine Business Unit and co-lead of the company’s COVID-19 response team. “We have identified relevant assets and capabilities across the company and are hopeful that we can expand the treatment options for patients with COVID-19 and the providers caring for them.”
Takeda is currently in discussions with multiple national health and regulatory agencies and health care partners in the US, Asia, and Europe to expeditiously move the research into TAK-888 forward. This requires access to source plasma from people who have successfully recovered from COVID-19 or who have been vaccinated, once a vaccine is developed. These convalescent donors have developed antibodies to the virus that could potentially mitigate severity of illness in COVID-19 patients and possibly prevent it.
H-IG works by concentrating the pathogen-specific antibodies from plasma collected from recovered patients or vaccinated donors in the future. By transferring the antibodies to a new patient, it may help that person’s immune system respond to the infection and increase their chance of recovery. Because the plasma needed for TAK-888 is unlikely to come from current plasma donors, Takeda will initially produce the therapy in a segregated area within its manufacturing facility in Georgia, and development and production of it should not negatively impact Takeda’s ability to produce its other plasma-derived therapies.
“Plasma-derived therapies are critical, life-saving medicines that thousands of people with rare and complex diseases rely on every day around the world,” said Dr. Chris Morabito, Takeda’s Head of Research and Development, Plasma-Derived Therapies Business Unit. “Our heritage, combined with our scale, expertise and capabilities, uniquely position Takeda to realize the potential of plasma-derived therapies, such as TAK-888.”
In addition, Takeda is exploring whether select marketed therapies and molecules in its drug library could be viable candidates for the effective treatment of COVID-19. These efforts are at an early stage but being given a high priority within the company.
An internal working group of in-house experts in public health, vaccines, plasma-derived therapies, and R&D will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our expertise and extensive network of global partners to address COVID-19. COVID-19 is the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which can cause pneumonia and has resulted in more than 3,000 deaths globally since its recent discovery. To date, there are no approved vaccines or therapies to prevent or treat COVID-19.

− GIVLAARI Approved Based on ENVISION Phase 3 Study Results Showing a 74% Reduction in the Rate of Porphyria Attacks −

March 03, 2020 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for GIVLAARI® (givosiran), an injection for subcutaneous use targeting aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. AHP is an ultra-rare condition in which patients can experience debilitating attacks of severe abdominal pain, vomiting and seizures, which can be life-threatening due to the possibility of paralysis and respiratory arrest during attacks. Many patients also experience chronic symptoms, including pain, which continue to be present between attacks.
“We are committed to bringing GIVLAARI to patients in Europe as rapidly as possible, and plan to build on our experience in the U.S. by proactively engaging with national authorities in Europe around a value-based agreement framework which we hope will accelerate patient and provider access to GIVLAARI”

“Today’s approval of GIVLAARI marks a historic moment for patients and families living with this devastating genetic disease, as there are currently no approved medicines in Europe proven to decrease the frequency of attacks and reduce the chronic pain that many patients suffer,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “We are proud to bring GIVLAARI, our second RNAi medicine to be approved in the last 18 months, to patients in Europe and we want to thank the patients, families, investigators and study staff whose support and involvement have made this achievement possible.”
“The fear of not knowing when an attack will strike, combined with ongoing symptoms between attacks, affects every aspect of patients’ lives, limiting their ability to work and maintain a social life,” said Dr Eliane Sardh, Head of the Porphyria Centre Sweden, Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden. “In our experience, life is very different for patients since they have been treated with givosiran. In addition to a reduction in the number of porphyria attacks which require hospitalization and urgent healthcare visits, we have seen improvements in how patients report their overall health status and quality of life, so this approval is truly meaningful for patients, their families and the healthcare professionals who treat them. Some of our patients have been able to achieve significant personal and professional milestones that would not have been possible before.”
“We are committed to bringing GIVLAARI to patients in Europe as rapidly as possible, and plan to build on our experience in the U.S. by proactively engaging with national authorities in Europe around a value-based agreement framework which we hope will accelerate patient and provider access to GIVLAARI,” said Barry Greene, President, Alnylam. “While every country has its own process for measuring the value of new medicines, we believe this framework will appeal in many countries as it combines payment based on performance with additional financial mechanisms to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the treatment of all AHP patients in line with the authorized indication of GIVLAARI.”
GIVLAARI (givosiran) was granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as well as Orphan Designation in the European Union. GIVLAARI was also granted an accelerated assessment, which is awarded to medicines deemed to be of major public health interest and therapeutic innovation, and the award is designed to bring new treatments to patients more quickly. This EC approval follows the recent approval of GIVLAARI by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November 2019. Givosiran is also awaiting approval in Brazil where it is under priority review.
About ENVISION Phase 3 Study
The marketing authorization was based on positive data from the ENVISION Phase 3 trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of givosiran in patients with a documented diagnosis of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). The primary endpoint was reduction relative to placebo in the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks, defined as those requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous hemin administration at home, in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP, the most common subtype of AHP) over six months. The trial enrolled 94 patients with AHP, at 36 study sites in 18 countries around the world and is the largest ever interventional study conducted in AHP. Patients were randomized 1:1 to givosiran or placebo, with givosiran administered subcutaneously at 2.5 mg/kg monthly. Upon completion of dosing in the double-blind period, all eligible patients (99%) enrolled in the ENVISION open-label extension (OLE) to receive givosiran on an ongoing basis.

In the study, givosiran demonstrated a 74% reduction in the annualized composite rate of porphyria attacks in AIP patients relative to placebo.
50% of patients on givosiran were attack-free during the six-month treatment period as compared to 16.3% of placebo-treated patients.
Patient-reported daily worst pain was significantly improved with givosiran vs placebo in patients with AIP (p<0.05).
Givosiran reduced use of hemin, as well as urinary aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and urinary porphobilinogen (PBG).
A greater proportion of patients on givosiran reported improvements in their overall health, pain, daily functioning, compared to placebo.
The most frequently occurring adverse reactions reported in patients treated with givosiran are injection site reactions (36%), nausea (32.4%) and fatigue (22.5%). Other adverse reactions seen in givosiran treated patients (occurring ≥10% more frequently than placebo) include transaminase elevations, rash and glomerular filtration rate decrease.
About GIVLAARI® (givosiran)
GIVLAARI is an RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) for the treatment of adults and adolescents with acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). In the pivotal study, givosiran was shown to significantly reduce the rate of porphyria attacks that required hospitalizations, urgent healthcare visits or intravenous hemin administration at home compared to placebo. GIVLAARI is Alnylam’s first commercially available therapeutic based on its Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology to increase potency and durability. GIVLAARI is administered via subcutaneous injection once monthly at a dose based on actual body weight and should be administered by a healthcare professional. GIVLAARI works by specifically reducing elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to reduction of toxins associated with attacks and other disease manifestations of AHP.
About Acute Hepatic Porphyria
Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) refers to a family of ultra-rare, genetic diseases characterized by debilitating, potentially life-threatening attacks and, for some patients, chronic manifestations that negatively impact daily functioning and quality of life. AHP is comprised of four subtypes: acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and ALA dehydratase-deficiency porphyria (ADP). Each type of AHP results from a genetic defect leading to a lack of certain enzymes needed to produce heme in the liver, which leads to an accumulation of porphyrins in the body to toxic amounts. AHP disproportionately impacts women of working and childbearing age, and symptoms of the disease vary widely. Severe, unexplained abdominal pain is the most common symptom, which can be accompanied by limb, back, or chest pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, seizures, weak limbs, constipation, diarrhea, or dark or reddish urine. AHP is life-threatening due to the possibility of paralysis and respiratory arrest during attacks. The nonspecific nature of AHP signs and symptoms can often lead to misdiagnoses of other more common conditions such as gynecological disorders, viral gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and appendicitis. Consequently, on a global perspective, patients with AHP can wait up to 15 years for a confirmed diagnosis, with the risk of addiction problems. In addition, long-term complications and comorbidities of AHP can include hypertension, chronic kidney disease or liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma.
About RNAi
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.
About Alnylam

 SRI’s SynFini platform is designed to accelerate discovery and development by automating the design, RSO and production of target molecules. The collaboration demonstrates a new paradigm in rapid discovery against pharmaceutical target","Researchers will utilize Iktos’ generative modeling AI technology with SRI’s SynFini synthetic chemistry platform to discover new compounds against multiple viruses, including the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19)

PARIS and MENLO PARK, Calif., March 3, 2020 – Iktos, a company specialized in artificial intelligence (AI) for novel drug design and SRI International (SRI), a research center headquartered in Menlo Park, California, today announced that the companies have entered into a collaboration agreement designed to accelerate discovery and development of novel anti-viral therapies. Under the collaboration, Iktos’ generative modeling technology will be combined with SRI’s SynFini™, a fully automated end-to-end synthetic chemistry system, to design novel, optimized compounds and accelerate the identification of drug candidates to treat multiple viruses, including influenza and the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).
Iktos’ AI technology, based on deep generative models, helps bring speed and efficiency to the drug discovery process by automatically designing virtual novel molecules that have all of the desirable characteristics of a novel drug candidate. This tackles one of the key challenges in drug design: rapid and iterative identification of molecules which simultaneously validate multiple bioactive attributes and drug-like criteria for clinical testing.
“Iktos generative AI technology has proven its value and potential to accelerate drug discovery programs in multiple collaborations with renowned pharmaceutical companies. We are eager to apply it to SRI’s endonuclease program and hope our collaboration can make a difference and speed up the identification of promising new therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19,” said Yann Gaston-Mathé, co-founder and CEO of Iktos. “We are excited at the prospect of combining our automated compound design technology with SRI’s SynFini platform and the potential this has to further accelerate drug discovery.”
SRI’s SynFini platform is designed to accelerate chemical discovery and development, and thereby bring new drugs to the clinic more quickly and affordably. The closed loop SynFini platform automates the design, reaction screening and optimization (RSO), and production of target molecules. SynFini comprises three components that work seamlessly together: a software platform (SynRoute™), a reaction screening platform (SynJet™), and a multi-step flow chemistry automation and development platform (AutoSyn™).
SRI has an ongoing program focused on discovering drugs to block endonuclease enzymes that are common to many viruses. These enzymes are involved in viral replication and blocking of host resistance to infection. Sequence analysis of COVID-19 indicates that this virus has an endonuclease that it is genetically about 97 percent similar to the SARS virus. Recent studies show that blocking the SARS virus endonuclease inhibits the infection’s pathogenesis, leading to a 100 percent survival rate in preclinical models. This suggests that the COVID-19 endonuclease is a good therapeutic target.
“The SynFini system has the potential to dramatically expedite small molecule drug discovery,” said Nathan Collins, Ph.D., Chief Strategy Officer of SRI’s Biosciences Division and Head of the SynFini program. “We look forward to exploring how the integration of Iktos’ AI-driven generative molecule combined with SynFini supports the rapid and efficient discovery of new drugs to treat emerging infectious diseases.”
By combining platforms for the accelerated molecular design and automated production of target molecules with established high-throughput biology, Iktos and SRI hope to demonstrate a new paradigm in extremely rapid drug discovery against high-value pharmaceutical targets.

28460,Janssen Reports Submission of Ponesimod's MAA to EMA for the Treatment of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,Janssen Submits European Marketing Authorisation Application for Ponesimod for Treatment of Adults with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,"The MAA is based on P-III OPTIMUM study assessing Ponesimod (20mg) vs Teriflunomide (14 mg) in patients with RMS
 The P-III OPTIMUM study results: @108wks. 30.5% reduction in ARR; 56% reduction CUALs in the brain; reduction in fatigue symptoms; safety profile is consistent with the previous studies
 Ponesimod is an investigational S1P1 modulator, act by inhibiting S1P activity leading to a reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes crossing the BBB","TITUSVILLE, NEW JERSEY, March 4, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) announced today the submission of
a marketing authorisation application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval for ponesimod for the treatment of adult patients with
relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).
Ponesimod is a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator that inhibits S1P protein activity and in so doing is believed to reduce the number of circulating lymphocytes that can cross the blood-brain barrier.i In patients with MS the movement of immune cells into the brain damages myelin, the protective sheath that insulates nerve cells. Damage to myelin slows or halts nerve conduction, producing the neurologic signs and symptoms of MS.ii
“More than 2.3 million people worldwide live with MSiii – including 700,000 in Europe aloneiv – and of this population, approximately 85 percent are initially diagnosed with relapsing MS.v Despite continuous advancements in the treatment landscape, a number of unmet needs remain,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “This submission is an important milestone as we work to bring a new treatment option to those living with relapsing forms of MS.”
The MAA is based on the head-to-head OPTIMUM Phase 3 study, which showed superior efficacy of ponesimod 20 mg on the primary endpoint of reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR), as well as most secondary endpoints compared to teriflunomide 14 mg in adults with relapsing MS. At week 108, a highly statistically significant reduction of 30.5 percent on ARR
was observed with ponesimod when compared to teriflunomide. Additionally, a statistically significant reduction of fatigue symptoms and a 56 percent reduction on combined unique active lesions (CUALs) in the brain was observed with ponesimod compared to teriflunomide. The safety profile observed for ponesimod was consistent with previous studies of ponesimod and the known safety profile for other S1P receptor modulators. The most common treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the ponesimod 20 mg study arm were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, nasopharyngitis, headache and upper respiratory tract infections.vi
“Fatigue remains a challenging, yet invisible, symptom among those living with MS. We are encouraged by the results ponesimod shows in alleviating this symptom, as well as the reduction in new inflammatory lesions and disability accumulation,” said Husseini Manji, M.D., F.R.C.P.C., Global Therapeutic Area Head for Neuroscience at Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We look forward to collaborating closely with the EMA as the application process progresses.”
The clinical study data that supports this filing was presented in September 2019 at the 35th Congress of The European Committee for Treatment and Research in
Multiple Sclerosis Conference (ECTRIMS) in Stockholm, Sweden. More information

About Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
MS is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system affecting 2.3 million people worldwide, with females more impacted than males.vii The disease is characterized by demyelinationiii and axonal loss leading to neurological impairment and severe disability.viii Relapsing forms of MS, which make up 85 percent of all MS cases include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS.ix In addition to the debilitating neurological symptoms of the disease, patients often also suffer from “hidden symptoms,” namely fatigue and depression, both of which are major contributors to the reduced quality of life.x Relapses are defined as new, worsening or recurrent neurological symptoms that last for more than 24 hours with the absence of fever or infections. Relapses may be fully resolved over days or weeks or lead to persistent residual deficits and accumulation of disability.xi

 — Recent Alnylam advances in lung delivery technology suggest possible utility of siRNAs in targeting SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses

— Vir to lead development of potential coronavirus RNAi therapeutic candidates, with Alnylam retaining an option for 50-50 participation

SAN FRANCISCO & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY) today announced an expansion of their existing collaboration to include the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19. Under the agreement, the companies will utilize Alnylam’s recent advances in lung delivery of novel conjugates of siRNA – the molecules that mediate RNAi – together with Vir’s infectious disease expertise and established capabilities, to bring forward one or more siRNAs to treat SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other coronaviruses as well. The collaboration will focus on development of siRNAs that Alnylam recently identified that target highly conserved regions of coronavirus RNAs.
Alnylam has designed and synthesized over 350 siRNAs targeting all available SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes, which will be screened in in vitro potency assays. Potent siRNA lead candidates will be further evaluated by scientists at Vir for in vitro and in vivo anti-viral activity, leading to the selection of a development candidate (DC).
Vir will lead all development and commercialization of any selected DCs. At clinical proof of concept, Alnylam will have an option to share equally in the profits and losses associated with the development and commercialization of the coronavirus program. Alternatively, Alnylammay elect to earn development and commercialization milestones and royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration in amounts agreed upon for the coronavirus program. This new program expands the companies’ existing licensing agreement announced in 2017 to now develop up to six novel siRNAs to treat infectious diseases.
“Given the scope and speed of the COVID-19 outbreak, Vir is seeking multiple approaches that combine our expertise in infectious disease with that of current and new partners to respond rapidly,” said George Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vir Biotechnology. “Alnylam has been an excellent partner, and our complementary capabilities made this a compelling opportunity to address this growing public health crisis.”
“RNAi is a powerful, natural cellular mechanism that can be harnessed to develop a broad range of innovative medicines, including anti-viral therapies. Our recent pre-clinical progress in extra-hepatic delivery of siRNAs has now been extended to the lung, and we’re encouraged that these results could potentially translate to humans,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. “We believe RNAi therapeutics represent a promising approach for targeting coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. As the leader in RNAi therapeutics, we at Alnylam are committed to doing our part in joining other biopharmaceutical companies, like Vir, to address this emerging outbreak.”
The companies are currently collaborating on VIR-2218 (ALN-HBV02), a novel, investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the first program to enter the clinic as a part of the infectious disease collaboration. The safety and efficacy of VIR-2218 are currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 study.

About Leber Congenital Amaurosis
Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA, is a group of inherited retinal degenerative disorders caused by mutations in at least 18 different genes. It is the most common cause of inherited childhood blindness, with an incidence of two to three per 100,000 live births worldwide. Symptoms of LCA appear within the first years of life, resulting in significant vision loss and potentially blindness. The most common form of the disease, LCA10, is a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene and is the cause of disease in approximately 20‑30 percent of all LCA patients.

28488,The US FDA and FTC Sign Agreement to Support the Development of Biosimilars,"FDA and FTC Announce New Efforts to Further Deter Anti-Competitive Business Practices, Support Competitive Market for Biological Products to Help Americans","The partnership will address the false and misleading promotion about biosimilars within their respective authorities and prevent anti-competitive behavior. Additionally, the agencies will collaborate with participants from industry, academia and government agencies for discussing issues related to competition in the biologics market
 The agencies will collaboratively exchange the information for suitable practices in preventing the activities that the biosimilar is needed for testing. Also, the FTC will review the patent settlements for preventing antitrust violations
 The FDA’s BAP outlines four strategies for accelerating the biosimilar competition, including supporting market competition and providing direction to industry for the development of promotional materials for medical products. The FDA and FTC will uphold a public workshop FDA/FTC Workshop on a Competitive Marketplace for Biosimilars on Mar 9, 2020 at FDA’s White Oak Campus in Silver Spring, Maryland","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission today signed a joint statement regarding enhanced collaboration in support of a robust marketplace for biological products, including the critical adoption of bio-similars and interchangeable products. This joint statement describes key steps the agencies will take to address false or misleading promotion about biosimilars within their respective authorities and deter anti-competitive behavior in this space.
“Competition is key for helping American patients have access to affordable medicines. While these therapies are critical for patients, biological products contribute significantly to drug costs, as they are often far more complex to develop than other drugs” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Strengthening efforts to curtail and discourage anti-competitive behavior is key for facilitating robust competition for patients in the biologics marketplace, including through biosimilars, bringing down the costs of these crucial products for patients.”
“Biologics are essential to the treatment of many serious illnesses. Practices in biologics markets are delaying the availability of biosimilar products, thereby depriving patients of the benefits of competition, including lower prices and increased innovation,” said FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. “The FTC is committed to continuing to enforce the antitrust laws in healthcare markets, including those for biologics and biosimilars.”
Biological products are a diverse category of products which may be produced through biotechnology in a living system, such as a microorganism, plant cell, or animal cell, and are used to diagnose, prevent, treat, and cure diseases and medical conditions. Biosimilars are biological products that are highly similar to and have no clinically meaningful differences from existing FDA-approved “reference” products. Reference products are FDA-approved biological products against which proposed biosimilar products are compared.
Biosimilar and interchangeable products have the potential to greatly reduce health care costs, similar to what has been seen with increased generic drug offerings. The 1984 Hatch Waxman Act, which created an abbreviated path to market for generic versions of small molecule drugs, has saved patients roughly $2 trillionExternal Link Disclaimer over the past decade. While the U.S. market for biosimilar versions of biological products is still maturing, the FDA’s research suggests that after market entry, biosimilars have the potential to offer significant savings. Biosimilars marketed in the U.S. typically have launched with initial list prices 15 to 35% lower than comparative list prices of the reference products.
However, anti-competitive practices, such as making false or misleading statements comparing biological reference products and biosimilars, may be slowing progress and hampering uptake of these important therapies. The FDA and the FTC have serious concerns about such statements and their negative impact on public health, including their potential to create negative misperceptions about the safety or effectiveness of approved biosimilars. The agencies intend to take appropriate steps to address companies making false or misleading communications about biologics, including biosimilars and interchangeable products, which will help deter anti-competitive behavior in the biologics market and can help lead to the use of all available biological products.
As detailed in the joint statement, the agencies will also collaborate on future public outreach efforts, including bringing together participants from industry, academia and government agencies to discuss issues relating to competition in the biologics market. To this end, today we’re also announcing that the FDA and FTC will hold a public workshop, “FDA/FTC Workshop on a Competitive Marketplace for Biosimilars” on March 9 at the FDA’s White Oak Campus in Silver Spring, Md.
The agencies will exchange information, when appropriate, about best practices to prevent activities that impede access to samples of the reference product that the prospective biosimilar applicant needs for testing. Additionally, the FTC intends to review patent settlement agreements involving biosimilars, to prevent antitrust violations.
Another key to ensuring that public information surrounding biosimilars and their reference products is communicated in a truthful and non-misleading manner is the FDA’s regulation of industry’s promotional materials for all prescription drugs, including biosimilar and reference products. Therefore, the FDA is publishing a draft guidance outlining its current thinking on presenting data and information in a truthful and non-misleading way about biosimilars and reference products in FDA-regulated promotional materials. It addresses questions companies may have when developing these kinds of materials and provides examples that can help with specific situations biosimilar and reference product companies may encounter.
Availability of this new draft guidance and ongoing collaboration with the FTC is part of the FDA’s continuing work to help ensure truthful and non-misleading prescription drug promotion and serves as another example of the FDA’s commitment to public health by addressing anti-competitive tactics that aim to undermine confidence in the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biosimilar products.
Today’s announcements are key deliverables in the FDA’s Biosimilars Action Plan (BAP) that outlines four key strategies to accelerate biosimilar competition, including supporting market competition and providing clearer direction to industry on the development of promotional materials for medical products. The FDA is accepting comments from the public on the draft guidance from Feb. 4 to April 6.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FDA16120529002343.jpg,Biosimilars,0,0,2020|Agreement|BAP|Biosimilars|Competitive Marketplace for Biosimilars|Development|FTC|Sign|Support|the US FDA,publish,2/3/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/fda-and-ftc-announce-new-efforts-to-further-deter-anti-competitive-business-practices-support-competitive-market-for-biological-products-to-help-americans/,https://pharmashots.com/28488/the-us-fda-and-ftc-sign-agreement-to-support-the-development-of-biosimilars/

17 This guidance provides recommendations to applicants seeking licensure under section 351(k) of
18 the Public Health Service (PHS) Act of a proposed biosimilar or proposed interchangeable
19 biosimilar2
for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use. This
20 guidance also provides recommendations on the submission of a supplement to a licensed 351(k)
21 biologics license application (BLA) seeking to add a condition of use that previously has been
22 licensed3
for the reference product to the labeling4
of a licensed biosimilar or interchangeable
23 product, including considerations related to the timing of such submissions.
24
25 This guidance includes recommendations regarding the following specific issues:
26
27  Submission of an application seeking licensure of a proposed biosimilar or proposed
28 interchangeable biosimilar for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of
29 use.
1 This draft guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency). 2 In this draft guidance, the following terms are used to describe biological products licensed under section 351(k) of
the PHS Act: (1) biosimilar or biosimilar product refers to a product that FDA has determined to be biosimilar to
the reference product (see sections 351(i)(2) and 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act); and (2) interchangeable,
interchangeable biosimilar, or interchangeable product refers to a biosimilar product that FDA has also determined
to be interchangeable with the reference product (see sections 351(i)(3) and 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act).
Biosimilarity, interchangeability, and related issues are discussed in more detail in section II of this draft guidance.
3
As stated in FDA’s guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference
Product (May 2019), FDA expects that applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and
information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same
clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use. We update
guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents. 4
Unless otherwise specified, the terms biosimilar product labeling and labeling as used in this guidance address
only the prescribing information as described in 21 CFR 201.56 and 201.57.

30  Development of proposed labeling when the applicant seeks licensure of a proposed
31 biosimilar or proposed interchangeable product for fewer than all of the reference product’s
32 licensed conditions of use.
33  Submission of a supplement to an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar
34 to seek licensure for a condition of use previously licensed for the reference product. This
35 may occur, for example, when (1) the biosimilar or interchangeable product was initially
36 licensed for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use, or (2) the
37 reference product is licensed for a new condition of use after licensure of the biosimilar or
38 interchangeable product.
39  Timing for the submission of a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a licensed 351(k) BLA
40 described above with the goal of obtaining licensure of a condition of use for a biosimilar or
41 interchangeable product as soon as possible after the expiration of any relevant exclusivity or
42 patents.
43
44 This guidance is one in a series of guidances that FDA is developing to implement the Biologics
45 Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) and includes references to
46 information from other FDA guidances, where appropriate.
47
48 In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
49 Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
50 as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
51 the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
52 not required.

55 II. BACKGROUND
56
57 A. The Biosimilar Pathway
58
59 Section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the
60 requirements for the licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar. Section 351(i)
61 defines biosimilarity to mean “that the biological product is highly similar to the reference
62 product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components” and that “there are
63 no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in
64 terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product” (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A
65 BLA submitted under section 351(k) (a “351(k) BLA”) must contain, among other things,
66 information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based
67 upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies,5
and a clinical study or studies, unless
68 FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) BLA (see
69 section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act).

We support the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We
encourage sponsors to consult with us if it they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable,
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency
to an animal test method.

Draft—Not for Implementation
71 To meet the standard for “interchangeability,” an applicant must provide sufficient information
72 to demonstrate biosimilarity to the reference product and also to demonstrate that the biological
73 product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given
74 patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in
75 terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the
76 biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference
77 product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act).
78 Interchangeable biosimilars may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention
79 of the prescribing healthcare provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).
80
81 B. Licensure of a Biosimilar or Interchangeable Biosimilar for Fewer Than All of the
82 Reference Product’s Licensed Conditions of Use
83
84 A biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar may be licensed only for conditions of use that have
85 been previously licensed for the reference product.6
An applicant generally may obtain licensure
86 of a biosimilar or interchangeable for fewer than all of the conditions of use for which the
87 reference product is licensed.7
However, FDA recommends that an applicant seeking licensure
88 for a proposed interchangeable product seek licensure for all of the reference product’s licensed
89 conditions of use when possible.8
90
91 A variety of circumstances may lead an applicant to seek licensure of a proposed biosimilar or
92 proposed interchangeable product for fewer than all of the conditions of use for which the
93 reference product is licensed. Examples of these circumstances are described below.
94
95 Orphan-drug Exclusivity
96
97 The reference product may be licensed for one or more indications that are protected by orphan98 drug exclusivity. In such cases, until the applicable exclusivity expires, FDA will not be able to
99 license a biosimilar or interchangeable product for the protected indications. However, assuming
100 that the requirements for licensure are met, FDA may be able to license a biosimilar or
101 interchangeable product for one or more indications of the reference product that are not
102 protected by orphan-drug exclusivity. In such circumstances, an applicant may choose to seek
103 licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable product for such indications.
104
105 After the applicable orphan-drug exclusivity expires, the applicant may, in a supplement to the
106 licensed 351(k) BLA, seek licensure of the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for a
6
Section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act.
7 Notably, section 351(k)(4)(A) of the PHS Act provides, among other things, that an application for an
interchangeable product must include information sufficient to show that the proposed interchangeable product “can
be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient.” FDA expects that
applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and information to support a showing that the
proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all
of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use. Guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating
Interchangeability With a Reference Product (May 2019).

107 previously protected indication, and FDA may license the biosimilar or interchangeable
108 biosimilar for this indication if the requirements for licensure are met.9
109
110 Circumstances Other Than Exclusivity
111
112  Patent(s) covering a licensed condition of use of the reference product: An applicant may
113 conclude that a licensed condition of use of the reference product is protected by one or more
114 patent(s). As a result, the applicant may decide not to seek licensure of a proposed biosimilar
115 or proposed interchangeable product for conditions of use that are protected by patent,
116 according to the applicant’s own assessment.
117
118  Other reasons: Reasons other than patents or exclusivity may lead an applicant to choose to
119 seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed.
120
121 III. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APPLICANTS SEEKING LICENSURE OF A
122 BIOSIMILAR OR INTERCHANGEABLE BIOSIMILAR FOR FEWER THAN
123 ALL OF THE REFERENCE PRODUCT’S LICENSED CONDITIONS OF USE
124
125 A. Submission of Original 351(k) BLA or Supplement to a 351(k) BLA
126
127 1. Submission of an Original 351(k) BLA for Licensure for Fewer Than All of the
128 Reference Product’s Licensed Conditions of Use
129
130 As part of an original 351(k) BLA, an applicant is expected to submit draft labeling that includes
131 the conditions of use for which the applicant is seeking licensure of the proposed biosimilar or
132 proposed interchangeable product.10, 11 Additional considerations regarding draft labeling are
133 described in section III.B in this guidance. Applicants may contact the appropriate review
134 division in FDA for more information about submitting a 351(k) BLA for licensure of a
135 proposed biosimilar or proposed interchangeable biosimilar for fewer than all of the reference
136 product’s licensed conditions of use.
137

Similarly, as provided by section 351(m) of the PHS Act, an additional six-month period of exclusivity will attach
to certain applicable periods of exclusivity if the sponsor conducts pediatric studies that meet the requirements for
pediatric exclusivity pursuant to section 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). As with
orphan-drug exclusivity, during the applicable period of pediatric exclusivity FDA may be able to license a
biosimilar or interchangeable product for one or more indications of the reference product that are not protected by
such exclusivity, and FDA may license the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for a previously protected
indication after the applicable pediatric exclusivity expires.
10 FDA has issued draft guidance regarding the submission of data and information to support approval of a
proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for an indication for which the reference product has unexpired
exclusivity. See Q.I.24 in the draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Q&As on Biosimilar Development
and the BPCI Act (Revision 2) (December 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA’s current
thinking on this topic.
11 See section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act, which requires that a 351(k) application include information
demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling
proposed for the biological product have been previously approved for the reference product.

138 2. Submission of a Supplement to a 351(k) BLA Seeking Licensure of a Biosimilar or
139 Interchangeable Biosimilar for an Additional Condition of Use Previously Licensed
140 for the Reference Product
141
142 The holder of a licensed 351(k) BLA may, in a supplement to the 351(k) BLA, seek licensure of
143 its biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for an additional condition of use that has been
144 previously licensed for the reference product and for which the applicant did not originally seek
145 licensure. A 351(k) BLA holder seeking licensure for an additional condition of use must submit
146 a supplement in accordance with 21 CFR 601.12 seeking licensure of the proposed change. See
147 section III.C.
148
149 A supplement to a 351(k) BLA seeking licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar
150 for an additional condition of use should contain all the data and information needed to support
151 licensure of the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for the proposed condition of use, which
152 may include reference to data and information previously submitted to the 351(k) BLA with
153 appropriate scientific justification. Applicants may contact the appropriate clinical review
154 division at FDA for more information about licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable
155 biosimilar in such circumstances.
156
157 B. Development of Draft Labeling for a Proposed Biosimilar or Interchangeable
158 Product for Fewer Than All of the Reference Product’s Licensed Conditions of Use
159 FDA’s guidance for industry Labeling for Biosimilar Products (“Biosimilar Labeling
160 Guidance”), provides general recommendations on the development of draft labeling for
161 proposed biosimilar products for submission in a 351(k) BLA.12 In the Biosimilar Labeling
162 Guidance, FDA recommends that labeling for a biosimilar product incorporate relevant data and
163 information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications. The Biosimilar
164 Labeling Guidance also explains that determining which data and information from the reference
165 product labeling should be incorporated into the proposed labeling for a biosimilar will depend
166 on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all—or fewer than all—of the conditions of use
167 licensed for the reference product.
168
169 1. Content of Draft Labeling
170
171 The applicant should develop draft labeling for the proposed biosimilar or proposed
172 interchangeable biosimilar that includes information from the reference product labeling that is
173 relevant to the proposed conditions of use for the proposed biosimilar or interchangeable, with
174 appropriate modifications. In preparing such draft labeling, the applicant should carefully
175 scrutinize the content of all sections of the labeling to ensure that relevant information is
12 See guidance for industry Labeling for Biosimilar Products (July 2018), which states that it does not provide
specific labeling recommendations for interchangeable products and that any specific recommendations for
interchangeable products will be provided in future guidance.

Draft—Not for Implementation
176 included, based on the proposed conditions of use for the proposed biosimilar or interchangeable
177 product.13
178
179 FDA will evaluate the labeling to determine whether it complies with applicable requirements.14
180 For example, the labeling must summarize the essential scientific information needed for the safe
181 and effective use of the product.15 FDA regulations also require that prescription drug labeling
182 contain:
183
184 “adequate information … including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods,
185 and frequency and duration of administration and any relevant warnings, hazards,
186 contraindications, side effects, and precautions, under which practitioners licensed
187 by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the purposes for
188 which it is intended …”16
189
190 2. Information to Support Draft Labeling for a Biosimilar or Interchangeable Product
191 for Fewer Than All of the Reference Product’s Licensed Conditions of Use
192
193 In general, FDA does not expect an applicant to submit a justification for the applicant’s decision
194 not to seek licensure of a biosimilar for all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use.
195 FDA does not consider the applicability of patents to a proposed biosimilar product (e.g., the
196 validity or enforceability of patents or potential infringement) in its review of a 351(k) BLA or
197 supplement to a 351(k) BLA.17 An applicant seeking licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable
198 biosimilar for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use may, in a
199 351(k) BLA or a supplement to a 351(k) BLA, submit information that is intended to inform
200 FDA’s review of the draft labeling. For example, an applicant may submit a justification as to
201 why, in the applicant’s view, the draft labeling meets the requirements for approval, considering
202 the conditions of use for which the applicant is seeking licensure.
203
204 C. Timing Considerations for Submission of a 351(k) BLA or Supplement to a 351(k)
205 BLA
206
207 The recommendations in this section are intended to facilitate submission of a 351(k) BLA or
208 supplement to a licensed 351(k) BLA with the goal of obtaining licensure of a biosimilar or
209 interchangeable biosimilar soon after expiration of any relevant exclusivity or expiration of a
13 For example, as noted in the guidance for industry Labeling for Biosimilar Products (July 2018), “in certain
circumstances it may be necessary to include information in the biosimilar product labeling relating to an
indication(s) for which the biosimilar product is not licensed, in order to help ensure safe use …” Additionally,
although biosimilar labeling need not be identical to reference product labeling, deviations should be carefully
considered to ensure that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the draft
labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product (see section
351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).
14 See, e.g., 21 CFR 201.56 and 21 CFR 201.57.
15 See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).
16 See 21 CFR 201.100(d)(1) (emphasis added).

of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted against a 351(k) applicant, refer to section 351(l) of the PHS Act

210 patent that, in the 351(k) applicant’s assessment, protects a licensed condition of use of the
211 reference product. These recommendations also are applicable to a supplement to a licensed
212 351(k) BLA that seeks licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar for an additional
213 condition of use for which the applicant did not originally seek licensure but that has since been
214 licensed for the reference product.
215
216 1. Targeted Timelines for Review
217
218
219
220
Original 351(k) BLA
As described in the Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA) II Goals Letter, FDA is committed to
reviewing and acting on original 351(k) BLAs within 10 months of the 60-day filing date.18
221
222
223
224
Supplements to a Licensed 351(k) BLA
In the BsUFA II Goals Letter, FDA also committed to reviewing and acting on original 351(k)
BLA supplements with clinical data within 10 months of receipt.19 In light of the anticipated
225 FDA review burden (among other considerations), FDA anticipates that it will review and act on
226 many supplements seeking licensure for additional conditions of use for a licensed biosimilar or
227 interchangeable product before the BsUFA goal date. To the extent practicable, FDA intends
228 that a supplement to a licensed 351(k) BLA seeking licensure of the biosimilar or
229 interchangeable product for an additional condition of use that has been previously licensed for
230 the reference product will be reviewed and acted upon in a 6-month timeframe, without regard to
231 whether the biosimilar or interchangeable product was initially licensed for fewer than all of the
232 reference product’s licensed conditions of use or the reference product is licensed for a new
233 condition of use after licensure of the biosimilar or interchangeable product.
234
235 FDA recognizes that targeting a 6-month timeline for such supplements may surpass, in many
236 cases, the performance goal commitment FDA made in the BsUFA II Goals Letter. Supplements
237 seeking licensure for additional conditions of use for a licensed biosimilar or interchangeable
238 product likely will include clinical data or reference clinical data submitted previously to the
239 351(k) BLA. As noted, the BsUFA II Goals Letter describes a 10-month goal date for original
240 351(k) BLA supplements with clinical data. However, at this time, FDA believes that a review
241 timeframe of 6 months will generally be appropriate for a supplement to a licensed 351(k) BLA
242 seeking licensure of the biosimilar or interchangeable product for an additional condition of use
243 that has been previously licensed for the reference product, assuming the supplement does not
244 raise novel review issues. Among other considerations, this is based on the anticipated FDA
245 review burden associated with these types of supplements. FDA intends to notify applicants in
246 an acknowledgement letter if it believes that the 10-month review timeline described in the
247 BsUFA II Goals Letter is more appropriate for any such supplement.

Draft—Not for Implementation
250 2. Unexpired Exclusivity
251
252
253
The Agency cannot license a biosimilar or interchangeable product for an indication protected by
orphan-drug exclusivity or pediatric exclusivity until the expiration of that exclusivity.20 If an
254 applicant’s proposed labeling includes conditions of use that are protected by unexpired orphan255
256
drug exclusivity or unexpired pediatric exclusivity, the Agency may communicate this issue to
the applicant in the Day 74 letter.21 In these circumstances, an applicant may seek to time the
257 submission of a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA with the goal of obtaining licensure
258 after a specific date, such as the expiration of orphan-drug or pediatric exclusivity.
259
260 3. Circumstances Other Than Exclusivity, Including Patents
261
262 As described above, an applicant may choose to seek licensure of a proposed biosimilar or
263 interchangeable biosimilar for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use
264 based on an assessment by the applicant that one or more of the reference product’s licensed
265 conditions of use is protected by patent. In these circumstances, an applicant may seek to time
266 the submission of a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA with the goal of obtaining
267 licensure after a specific date, such as the expiration of a patent. Other nonpatent reasons may
268 also lead an applicant to take this approach.
269
270 In contrast to orphan-drug and pediatric exclusivity, the BPCI Act does not limit FDA’s ability to
271 license a 351(k) BLA or a supplement to a 351(k) BLA where a biosimilar seeks licensure for a
272 condition of use which may be subject to one or more patents. FDA may therefore license the
273 product for such condition of use if FDA determines that the requirements for licensure have
274 been met.
275
276
277
Applicants should be aware that FDA may review and act on (i.e., license or issue a complete
response letter to)22 a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA before any applicable BsUFA
278 goal date or 6-month targeted review timeline. If an applicant does not want FDA to take action
279 on a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA before a specified date, the applicant should
280 request that the Agency refrain from acting on the BLA or supplement before the specified date,
281 so long as that date falls on or before the applicable BsUFA goal date.
282
283 To request that FDA not take action on a 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA before a
284 specified date, the applicant should include the following language on the cover letter of their
285 BLA or supplement, in bold typeface and prominently placed above the body of the cover letter:
286
287
288
351(k) BLA action timing request: [Applicant Name] requests that FDA not
take action on this [application/supplement] before [specified date].
289
290 If the applicant requests that FDA refrain from taking action on the 351(k) BLA or a supplement
291 to a 351(k) BLA until a specified date that is on or before any applicable BsUFA goal date, the
20 See section 527 of the FD&C Act; section 351(m) of the PHS Act; 21 CFR 316.31. 21 See BsUFA II Goals Letter, p. 10. 22 See BsUFA II Goals Letter, p. 32 (defining “review and act on” to mean “the issuance of a complete action letter
after complete review of a filed complete application”).

292 Agency intends to honor the applicant’s request, where appropriate. Applicants should take
293 BsUFA goal dates into consideration before making such requests. If the requested date extends
294 beyond any applicable BsUFA goal date, the Agency does not intend to honor the applicant’s
295 request.
296
297 Upon receipt of the 351(k) BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA containing a request not to act
298 before any applicable BsUFA goal date (or another specified date prior to a BsUFA goal date),
299 FDA intends to acknowledge the applicant’s request along with the date of receipt of the 351(k)
300 BLA or supplement to a 351(k) BLA through an acknowledgment letter.

 DI-LEU16-IL2 is a novel immune-cytokine targeting CD20, developed by Merck KGaA and licensed to Provenance in 2009. Later in 2011, Provenance rights to develop & commercialize the therapy to Alopexx","CONCORD, Mass., March 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Alopexx Oncology, LLC announced today that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Beijing Shenogen Pharma Group to develop and commercialize DI-Leu16-IL2 in Chinaand other parts of Asia. Alopexx will receive an upfront payment, various development and commercial milestones and royalties on sales.
DI-LEU16-IL2 is a novel antibody-cytokine fusion protein (or immunocytokine) targeting the B cell antigen, CD20. The CD20 antibody recognizes the same target on B cells as Rituxan and maintains the activities of both the antibody and cytokine components. In addition, it is also involved in tumor targeting, engagement of the immune system, and induction of an anti-cancer vaccine effect.
In a Phase I study of DI-LEU16-IL2 conducted in the 3 US centers, fifteen of 18 patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell CD20 positive lymphoma who received 2 or more cycles of therapy had tumor regression or stabilization including 3 complete and 2 partial responses. The durations of response were over 12 months in many cases. The durability of those responses was maintained in patients months after stopping treatment suggesting a vaccine effect had occurred. These study results are similar to a previous investigator sponsored Phase 1 study conducted at the City of Hope by Dr. Andrew Raubitschek.
“We believe that DI-Leu16-IL2 will significantly help individuals with B-cell malignancies,” said Dr. Daniel Vlock, founder and CEO of Alopexx Enterprises. “We are delighted to be working with Shenogen to advance the development of this promising therapeutic.”
Dr. Kun Meng, Chairman of Shenogen Pharma Group, commented, “We are very excited with this exclusive in-license opportunity of DI-Leu16-IL2 antibody-cytokine fusion protein from Alopexx, which opens the door for us to get into the B-cell lymphoma space of immunotherapy.” Given the advantage of combining the benefits of anti-CD20 and IL2, two targets with approved anti-cancer drugs, Dr. Meng said, “We believe DI-Leu16-IL2 can offer superior efficacy and better serve the unmet medical needs of patients with B-cell lymphomas, especially with the relapsed and refractory forms of diseases.” Shenogen plans to develop this drug as a potential single agent, or as combination therapy with other drugs.
About DI-Leu16-IL2
CD20 is a protein frequently expressed on cancer cells associated with NHL. Pre-clinical studies have shown that DI-Leu16-IL2, which has activities of both the anti-CD20 antibody and cytokine components, targets the tumor cells, engages the immune system and has the potential to produce an anti-cancer vaccine effect. As a result of this vaccine-like effect, long- term anti-cancer activity should continue and future cancer cells could be destroyed even without the need for re-dosing.
“The fusion of the anti-CD20 antibody and the cytokine IL2 creates an effect that is far more powerful than administering those therapeutics individually or in combination,” explained Stephen Gillies, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Alopexx Oncology. “In this therapeutic approach the drug elicits a T-cell response and also activates the innate immunity to kill tumor cells, and that is a very important distinction between this and other treatments.”
About Alopexx Oncology/Alopexx Enterprises
Alopexx Oncology, LLC, a portfolio company of Alopexx Enterprises, licensed the rights to develop and commercialize its lead drug candidate DI-Leu16-IL2 from Provenance Biopharmaceuticals Corp. in 2011. This molecule was originally developed by Merck KGaA (now Merck Healthcare KGaA). In 2009 Merck KGaA license the global rights of DI-Leu16-IL2 to Provenance Biopharmaceuticals Corp.

28515,Roche's Actemra (tocilizumab) Receives Approval to Combat Coronavirus Complications in China,China approves use of Roche drug in battle against coronavirus complications,"China’s National Health Commission reports in its treatment guidelines that Roche’s Actemra can be used to treat coronavirus patients with serious lung damage and high IL-6 levels
 Researchers are assessing Actemra in clinical studies & is expected to include 188 coronavirus patients and running until May 10, 2020, with the goal to evaluate efficacy and safety of the drug in coronavirus patients with CRS
 Actemra is a biologic therapy and has received the US FDA’s approval in 2010 for RA, act by inhibiting high IL-6 protein levels","BEIJING/ZURICH, March 4 (Reuters) – China has approved the use of Swiss drugmaker Roche’s ROG.S anti-inflammation drug Actemra for patients who develop severe complications from the coronavirus as it urgently hunts for new ways to combat the deadly infection that is spreading worldwide.
China is hoping that some older drugs could stop severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), or cytokine storms, an overreaction of the immune system which is considered a major factor behind catastrophic organ failure and death in some coronavirus patients.
Actemra, a biologic drug approved in 2010 in the United States for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inhibits high Interleukin 6 (IL-6) protein levels that drive some inflammatory diseases.
China’s National Health Commission said in treatment guidelines published online on Wednesday that Actemra can now be used to treat coronavirus patients with serious lung damage and high IL-6 levels.

Separately, researchers in the country are testing Actemra, known generically as tocilizumab, in a clinical trial expected to include 188 coronavirus patients and running until May 10.
Roche, which donated 14 million yuan ($2.02 million) worth of Actemra during February, said the trial was initiated independently by a third party with the aim of exploring the efficacy and safety of the drug in coronavirus patients with CRS.
It added that there was currently no published clinical trial data on the drug’s safety or efficacy against the virus.
More than 3,000 people have died and 93,000 have been infected by the novel coronavirus thought to have originated in Wuhan, China, before spreading to around 90 countries including the United States, Italy, Switzerland, France and Germany.

The Swiss company, for which China is its No. 2 market behind the United States, also makes diagnostic gear to detect the coronavirus.
Since Actemra’s approval a decade ago, it has become a go-to drug against other inflammatory conditions, including cytokine storms in cancer patients receiving cell therapies from Novartis NOVN.S and Gilead Sciences GILD.O.
In 2012 it helped save the life of a young U.S. girl, the first child to be treated for leukaemia with Novatis’ Kymriah, from a post-treatment rush of IL-6.
Priced at between $20-30,000 annually for RA according to SSR Health, Roche’s medicine is also used for rare juvenile arthritis and giant cell arteritis, or inflammation of the blood vessels.

China’s National Medical Product Administration has yet to give its approval for Actemra to be sold for use in coronavirus infection cases and Chinese drugmakers are also racing to develop alternatives to Roche’s treatment.
Bio-Thera Solutions Ltd 688177.SS expects to file new drug approval for a version of Actemra in 2021, while Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co Ltd 600267.SS in 2016 got regulatory approval to hold trials for an Actemra copy, company filings showed.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/roche-22.jpg,Biotech,0,0,Actemra|approval|China|Combat|Coronavirus Complications|receives|Roche|tocilizumab,publish,3/5/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/china-approves-use-of-roche-drug-in-battle-against-coronavirus-complications-2/',https://pharmashots.com/28515/roches-actemra-tocilizumab-receives-approval-to-combat-coronavirus-complications-in-china/

28535,The US FDA Informs About Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Medical Devices with Bluetooth Low Energy,"FDA Informs Patients, Providers and Manufacturers About Potential Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Certain Medical Devices with Bluetooth Low Energy","The US FDA issued a warning to patients, HCPs and medical devices manufacturers about potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities in BLE technology. The FDA mentioned the products that could be impacted which include pacemakers, glucose monitors and ultrasound devices
 The US FDA referred to the vulnerabilities as “SweynTooth”, which allows the unauthorized users to wirelessly crash the device or stop it from working.
 The FDA recommends that medical device manufacturers should stay alert for cybersecurity vulnerabilities and proactively participate in addressing them as well as providing mitigation strategies","Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is informing patients, health care providers and manufacturers about a set of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, referred to as “SweynTooth,” that – if exploited – may introduce risks for certain medical devices. SweynTooth affects the wireless communication technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE allows two devices to “pair” and exchange information to perform their intended functions while preserving battery life and can be found in medical devices as well as other devices, such as consumer wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These cybersecurity vulnerabilities may allow an unauthorized user to wirelessly crash the device, stop it from working, or access device functions normally only available to the authorized user.
To date, the FDA is not aware of any confirmed adverse events related to these vulnerabilities. However, software to exploit these vulnerabilities in certain situations is publicly available. Today, the FDA is providing additional information regarding the source of these vulnerabilities and recommendations for reducing or avoiding risks the vulnerabilities may pose to a variety of medical devices, such as pacemakers, glucose monitors, and ultrasound devices.
“Medical devices are becoming increasingly connected, and connected devices have inherent risks, which make them vulnerable to security breaches. These breaches potentially impact the safety and effectiveness of the device and, if not remedied, may lead to patient harm,” said Suzanne Schwartz, M.D., MBA, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships and Technology Innovation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The FDA recommends that medical device manufacturers stay alert for cybersecurity vulnerabilities and proactively address them by participating in coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities as well as providing mitigation strategies. An essential part of the FDA’s strategy is working with manufacturers, health care delivery organizations, security researchers, other government agencies and patients to address cybersecurity concerns that affect medical devices in order to keep patients safe.”
The FDA is currently aware of several microchip manufacturers that are affected by these vulnerabilities: Texas Instruments, NXP, Cypress, Dialog Semiconductors, Microchip, STMicroelectronics and Telink Semiconductor. Their microchips may be in a variety of medical devices, such as those that are implanted in or worn by a patient (such as pacemakers, stimulators, blood glucose monitors and insulin pumps) or larger devices that are in health care facilities (such as electrocardiograms, monitors and diagnostic devices like ultrasound devices).
Medical device manufacturers are already assessing which devices may be affected by SweynTooth and are identifying risk and remediation actions. In addition, several microchip manufacturers have already released patches. For more information about SweynTooth cybersecurity vulnerabilities – including a list of affected devices, see ICS-ALERT-20-063-01 SweynTooth Vulnerabilities, Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Advisory.
The agency is asking medical device manufacturers to communicate to health care providers and patients which medical devices could be affected by SweynTooth and ways to reduce associated risk. Patients should talk to their health care providers to determine if their medical device could be affected and to seek help right away if they think their medical device is not working as expected.
The FDA takes reports of vulnerabilities in medical devices very seriously and today’s safety communication includes recommendations to manufacturers for continued monitoring, reporting and remediation of medical device cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The FDA is recommending that manufacturers conduct a risk assessment, as described in the FDA’s cybersecurity postmarket guidance, to evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities on medical devices they manufacture and develop risk mitigation plans. Medical device manufacturers should work with the microchip manufacturers to identify available patches and other recommended mitigation methods, work with health care providers to determine any medical devices that could potentially be affected, and discuss ways to reduce associated risks.
The FDA will continue to assess new information concerning the SweynTooth vulnerabilities and will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.
Further, the FDA will continue its ongoing work with manufacturers and health care delivery organizations—as well as security researchers and other government agencies—to help develop and implement solutions to address cybersecurity issues throughout a device’s total product lifecycle.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/usfda-kVB-621x414@LiveMint-1.jpg,MedTech,0,0,About|Bluetooth Low Energy|Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities|FDA|Informs|medical devices|US,publish,3/5/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/fda-informs-patients-providers-and-manufacturers-about-potential-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-in-certain-medical-devices-with-bluetooth-low-energy/,https://pharmashots.com/28535/the-us-fda-informs-about-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-in-medical-devices-with-bluetooths-low-energy/

 Heat’s subsidiary Zolovax will focus on the development of COVID-19 vaccines while the University of Miami will develop and test vaccines utilizing Heat’s gp-96 backbone, expressing antigens associated with COVID-19
 Heat’s gp96-based therapeutic platform reprograms live cells to continually secrete antigens of interest bound to the gp96, thus activating a robust T-cell response against antigens","Heat’s gp96 vaccine platform activates CD8 T cells, antigen presenting cells and natural killer cells, and induces mucosal immunity which could make it an ideal vaccine for COVID-19
Vaccine designed to induce a multi-epitope specific CD8 T-cell response, which is crucial for protection against potential future mutations of COVID-19
DURHAM, NC / ACCESSWIRE / March 5, 2020 / Heat Biologics, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTBX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specialized in the development of therapeutic vaccines, announced today a strategic collaboration with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine to support the development of a vaccine leveraging Heat’s proprietary gp96 platform designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that Heat’s gp96-based vaccines may be utilized to target COVID-19. Heat has treated more than 300 patients to date with its gp96-based therapeutic vaccines. Results from these studies together with positive outcomes in NIH and DOD-funded mouse and primate studies against SIV/HIV 1-2, malaria and zika, demonstrate that gp96 vaccines express a broad range of antigens and stimulate a robust systemic immune response, culminating in humoral and cell mediated responses in different organs including the gut, reproductive tract, liver and lungs.
Heat’s COVID-19 vaccine will utilize Heat’s gp96 platform to generate open docking sites for the insertion of multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Heat anticipates that its novel approach should activate a potent immune response, without the disadvantages of possible genomic integration of foreign DNA or viral vector instability possible with attenuated viral vaccines. This approach is designed to induce a multi-epitope specific memory CD8 T-cell response that protects against multiple, distinct coronavirus strains across diverse human populations and against potential future mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus.
Heat’s COVID-19 program emerged from the same laboratory that originally developed Heat’s gp96 platform technology, and will be developed at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine under the direction of Natasa Strbo, M.D., D.Sc., research assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, who has spent many years advancing the gp96 platform as a vaccine against HIV, malaria, zika and other infectious diseases.
Mucosal immunity and airway memory T-cell responses are crucial in the protection against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, since these areas are the first to encounter the virus. Importantly, Heat’s gp96-based vaccines have demonstrated effectiveness in the induction of mucosal immunity. Dr. Strbo and her team have developed a gp96 vaccine against SIV (the primate equivalent of HIV) that has been shown to induce a dramatic antigen-specific immune response in the mucous membranes. Treated primates (rheusus macaques) were 73 percent less likely to acquire a particularly virulent form of the SIV virus*. These data support broader use of the vaccine platform against other viruses attacking the mucosal tissues, such as COVID-19 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594107).
“T-cell immune responses play a crucial role in protection against coronaviruses and facilitation of coronavirus clearance. It is noteworthy to mention that not antibodies, but only SARS-CoV-specific memory T-cells persisted up to 11 years post-recovery,” said Dr. Strbo. “Therefore, an effective coronavirus vaccine should induce neutralizing antibodies and elicit specific memory CD8 T cell responses. Currently, gp96 is the most efficient agent known to mediate antigen cross-presentation at femto-molar concentrations of antigen. Heat’s gp96 vaccine platform has unique properties that enable it to activate antigen presenting cells, natural killer cells and T cells, which could make it an ideal vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.”
Heat’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Zolovax, Inc., will focus on the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. Under the terms of the research collaboration, University of Miami will develop and test one or more vaccine constructs utilizing Heat’s gp-96 vaccine backbone to express antigens associated with COVID-19.
“We are excited about our collaboration with the University of Miami to develop a gp96-based vaccine designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” said Jeff Wolf, CEO of Heat. “gp96 is a powerful vaccine platform that has been shown to induce a potent immune response, which may protect against COVID-19 and other highly-virulent infectious diseases. We look forward to advancing this important program”
* Novel vaccination modality provides significant protection against mucosal infection by highly pathogenic SIV, J Immunol. 2013 Mar 15; 190(6): 2495-2499.
Additional published studies (Strbo et al 2013 Cutting Edge J Immunol Selinger et al 2014, Vaccari et al Nature Medicine 2016 and 2018) support the feasibility of the gp96-Ig cell secreted-based vaccine platform.
About Heat’s gp96-based therapeutic platform
Heat shock protein gp96 is a chaperone protein found in all human cells. It is a potent immune adjuvant that has the role of “molecular warning system” or more specifically, gp96 has demonstrated a clinical ability to induce immunity against antigens from the cell it came from. gp96 is naturally tethered to the cell and is normally released only during necrosis or cell death.
Heat’s proprietary gp96 vaccine platform reprograms live cells to continually secrete antigens of interest bound to the gp96, thus activating a robust T-cell response against those antigens. Heat’s gp96 platform was developed by Dr. Eckhard Podack at the University of Miami and has undergone rigorous testing in numerous NIH and DOD-funded mice and primate trials as a vaccine against HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases, and has been tested on over 300 patients in numerous NIH and Heat-funded oncology trials.
About Heat Biologics, Inc.

28558,Baysient to Release iDose Software Technology Platform 1.0 to Reduce the Biosimilar Cost in Market,Digital Health Company Baysient Announces CDS/HCEI Software to Reduce Healthcare Cost in the Biosimilar Market,"The 12-month clinical validation study (NCT02453776) data demonstrated the reduction “switching” from lower cost infliximab to more expensive biologics by 66%. Also, similar studies are ongoing in 9 countries on 3 continents
 The results were already presented at ECCO, Copenhagen, Mar 2019 and DDW, San Diego, May 2019 and the Baysient pipeline includes CDS for 25 FDA approved anti-inflammatory biologics. The HCPs using iDose software’s CDS reduced the cost $726,000 per 100 patients
 The iDose algorithm is a cloud base SaaS and is HIPAA-compliant, compatible with EMRs offered in the US and Canada, combines the PK data with Bayesian learning (non-AI machine learning) and forecasting, also enables the physicians to understand how to keep the amount of drug in patient’s body from falling below the physician-selected target","FORT MYERS, Fla., Feb. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Baysient® LLC’s founder, Diane Mould, announces the release of the iDose® software technology platform version 1.0 for infliximab (an anti-inflammatory biologic drug), just before presenting Biologics and Precision Medicine in IBD at Canadian Digestive Disease Week (CDDW), February 28 – March 1. The presentation will include results from a 12-month clinical validation study (NCT02453776) demonstrating (p = 0.017) the potential to reduce “switching” from lower cost infliximab to more expensive biologics by 66%. Similar studies are ongoing in 9 countries on 3 continents (> 300 patients).
The results to be presented in Montreal were originally presented by the investigators at European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization (ECCO, Copenhagen, March 2019) and Digestive Disease Week (DDW, San Diego, May 2019). Approximately 30% of all patients treated with anti-inflammatory biologics need to switch drugs within the first year. Typical switching from infliximab (biosimilar) to another biologic (not infliximab, not biosimilar) increases drug cost by $11,000 per patient per year (U.S. average retail costs, January 9, 2020). Healthcare professionals using the iDose software’s clinical decision support (CDS) information have the potential to reduce drug costs in this typical scenario by $726,000 per 100 patients failing therapy. Clinical Decision Support (CDS) information from the iDose software keeps 66 of these patients on average from failing and having to switch. The relatively low cost of the iDose software was not subtracted from the savings in this scenario. The Baysient pipeline includes CDS for 25 other FDA approved anti-inflammatory biologics.
The iDose algorithm combines scientifically appropriate pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling with statistically sound Bayesian learning (non-AI machine learning) and forecasting. Information from the iDose software helps physicians understand how to keep the amount of drug in a patient’s body from falling below the physician-selected target therapeutic level.
Reimbursement codes (ICD and CPT) for therapeutic drug monitoring, other long term (current) drug therapy, or chronic care management may be applicable.
Patented iDose functionality is offered as a business-to-business, cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) and is HIPAA-compliant and compatible with electronic medical records (EMRs). It is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada.
When used by, or under the supervision of healthcare professionals, the iDose software is exempted from FDA clearance requirements. Drug companies must meet FDA requirements prior to associating the iDose software with their products. Healthcare payor firms may use information obtained from the iDose software as healthcare economic information (HCEI) after internal review.
Baysient LLC is a privately held Delaware company. Baysient develops SaaS, cloud-based software that provides medical providers and/or payors with a full line of CDS products to facilitate individualized and improved treatment outcomes for inflammatory diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Crohn’s Disease (CD), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), etc. Baysient’s software uses individual patient routine lab results and demographic information to allow physicians to individualize dosing to a specific target trough level.

BOSTON & GHENT, Belgium–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Orionis Biosciences is today debuting with the announcement of a major drug discovery collaboration with Novartis. Orionis has developed innovative technologies in genome-scale drug discovery and tunable molecular design of novel therapeutic drug modalities to tackle the industry’s most intractable disease targets.
The goal of the four-year collaboration with Novartis is to discover and design novel small molecule therapeutics, such as protein degraders, across various therapeutic areas, by broadly leveraging Orionis’ Allo-Glue™ technology platform. The terms of the collaboration include research funding, a convertible note investment, royalties and potential clinical milestones.
“Our collaboration with Novartis provides tremendous validation of the work we have accomplished over the past several years to develop innovative tools to unlock challenging drug targets for new therapeutic modalities,” commented Niko Kley, CEO of Orionis. “There are many disease-related targets that have eluded scientists and drug discoverers for decades, with new ones being identified every day. Our proprietary genome-wide discovery and drug design technologies may enable identification and development of small molecules and biologics with high specificity and selectivity against targets at a scale, speed and efficiency that is unique in the industry.”
Orionis was originally founded by drug discovery and technology pioneers Niko Kley, PhD, CEO, Jan Tavernier, PhD, CTO and Professor at VIB-Ghent University (Belgium), and VIB. Riccardo Sabatini, PhD, CDS, joined the company as architect and leader of Orionis’ computational science platform.
Dr. Jay Bradner, MD, PhD, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research commented, “We are excited to be working with the Orionis team to combine our expertise in drug discovery and development with their innovative technologies for rapidly identifying and prioritizing new targets at a genome-wide scale. Our hope is that through this collaboration, we will be able to reach historically elusive targets as we strive to bring new therapies to patients more quickly.”
Riccardo Sabatini commented further, “It is incredibly exciting to see how mapping of genome-scale fingerprints of drug action is opening new possibilities and dimensions in applications of numerical methods and machine learning to support drug design.”
“The opportunity behind the forming of Orionis was that the existing pharmacopeia of approved drugs reflects relatively few disease targets being addressed with too many similar drugs. We have been steadily executing on our mission to bring together an array of technological innovations to enable discovery of a diversity of new drug candidates that act with high therapeutic target-focused precision,” commented Prof. Jan Tavernier.
Orionis Biosciences, named for the Orion star system, is a unique constellation of people, technology platforms and drug modalities. “We have quietly built and evolved our core science capabilities, portfolio of intellectual property and an exciting emerging pipeline of drug candidates, which we are advancing to unlock major value for the pharmaceutical industry and new treatment options for patients in need,” commented CEO Niko Kley.

28582,Zydus' Saroglitazar Receives DCGI's Approval as the World's First Therapy for Non-Cirrhotic NASH in India,Zydus announces world’s first drug for the treatment of Non-Cirrhotic NASH,"The approval is based on P-III EVIDENCES II study assessing saroglitazar (4mg) vs PBO in patients with NASH. The study resulted in meeting its 1EPs & 2EPs and demonstrated improvement of NASH using liver biopsy @52wks. and a reduction in liver fat, liver enzymes and disease activity
 In P-II EVIDENCES I study, saroglitazar resulted in improvement in liver enzyme in patients with NAFLD while the EVIDENCES IV study assessing saroglitazar in patients with NASH in the US that resulted in meeting its 1EPs & 2EPs
 Saroglitazar is a dual PPAR agonist, launched in India in Sept’2013 for diabetic dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with T2D not controlled by statins alone","Ahmedabad, India, March 05, 2020
• Saroglitazar, approved by DCGI becomes the first ever drug anywhere in the world for
treatment of Non-Cirrhotic Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH)
• NASH ranks as one of the major causes of cirrhosis, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver
disease and is a leading cause of liver transplant
Zydus Cadila, an innovation-driven global pharmaceutical company today announced that the
Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved its New Drug Application (NDA) for
Saroglitazar for the treatment of Non-Cirrhotic Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH) in
India.
NASH is a progressive disease of the liver, which starts with fat accumulation in the liver
known as Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). This condition could progress to
cirrhosis and liver failure. It is a large unmet medical need as there is currently no approved
drug for the treatment of NASH anywhere in the world, a disease that is highly prevalent with
10% to 30% of the global population being affected by it. The prevalence of NASH in India
is estimated to be nearly 25% of the population. NASH ranks as one of the major causes of
cirrhosis, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only
option for managing advanced cirrhosis with liver failure.
Speaking about the development, Pankaj Patel, Chairman, Zydus Group mentioned, “We are
happy that our efforts to discover and develop a novel drug for patients living with NASH, an
unmet healthcare need globally have been successful. Saroglitazar will provide hope and new
lease of life for millions of patients in India suffering from NASH.”
Saroglitazar was launched in India in September 2013, for the treatment of diabetic
dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with type-2 diabetes not controlled by
statins alone. In January this year, Saroglitazar received an approval for the treatment of Type
2 Diabetes Mellitus. In the last seven years, over a million patients have benefitted from this
drug.
Saroglitazar is uniquely poised with its dual PPAR alpha and gamma properties – reducing
the comorbidities (dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus) and causing NASH
resolution. Zydus achieved positive results in EVIDENCES II trial, a Phase 3 liver biopsy
trial of Saroglitazar 4 mg versus Placebo in Indian patients with NASH. The trial evaluated
histological improvement of NASH using liver biopsy at the end of 52 weeks and
successfully met primary and secondary endpoints. Saroglitazar 4 mg demonstrated a
significant reduction in liver fat, liver enzymes and disease activity.
In EVIDENCES I, which was a Phase 2 clinical trial, Saroglitazar demonstrated improvement
in liver enzymes and lipids in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). On
the global front, a Phase 2 trial (EVIDENCES IV) of Saroglitazar Mg in patients with NASH
in the US met primary and secondary endpoints. The results were presented at The Liver
Meeting® 2019, the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases (AASLD) held at Boston.
Additionally, 15 investigator initiated clinical studies of Saroglitazar have been presented and
published in leading scientific journals and conferences.

About DURYSTA™
DURYSTA™ is a prostaglandin analog indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with OAG or OHT.
DURYSTA™ is an ophthalmic drug delivery system for a single intracameral administration of a biodegradable implant containing 10 mcg bimatoprost. DURYSTA™ should not be re-administered to an eye that received a prior DURYSTA™. DURYSTA™ is preloaded into a single-use applicator to facilitate the administration of the biodegradable implant directly into the anterior chamber of the eye.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
DURYSTA™ (bimatoprost implant) is indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
CONTRAINDICATIONS
DURYSTA™ is contraindicated in patients with: active or suspected ocular or periocular infections; corneal endothelial cell dystrophy (e.g., Fuchs’ Dystrophy); prior corneal transplantation or endothelial cell transplants (e.g., Descemet’s Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty [DSAEK]); absent or ruptured posterior lens capsule, due to the risk of implant migration into the posterior segment; hypersensitivity to bimatoprost or to any other components of the product.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
The presence of DURYSTA™ implants has been associated with corneal adverse reactions and increased risk of corneal endothelial cell loss. Administration of DURYSTA™ should be limited to a single implant per eye without retreatment. Caution should be used when prescribing DURYSTA™ in patients with limited corneal endothelial cell reserve.
DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in patients with narrow iridocorneal angles (Shaffer grade ˂ 3) or anatomical obstruction (e.g., scarring) that may prohibit settling in the inferior angle.
Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with ophthalmic bimatoprost, including DURYSTA™ intracameral implant. DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.
Prostaglandin analogs, including DURYSTA™, have been reported to cause intraocular inflammation. DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.
Ophthalmic bimatoprost, including DURYSTA™ intracameral implant, has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues, such as increased pigmentation of the iris. Pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. While treatment with DURYSTA™ can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly.
Intraocular surgical procedures and injections have been associated with endophthalmitis. Proper aseptic technique must always be used with administering DURYSTA™, and patients should be monitored following the administration.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
In controlled studies, the most common ocular adverse reaction reported by 27% of patients was conjunctival hyperemia. Other common adverse reactions reported in 5%‑10% of patients were foreign body sensation, eye pain, photophobia, conjunctival hemorrhage, dry eye, eye irritation, intraocular pressure increased, corneal endothelial cell loss, vision blurred, iritis, and headache.

About Glaucoma
Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. An estimated 70 million people globally are living with glaucoma. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated IOP. Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only proven way to slow the progression of vision loss associated with glaucoma.
Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are a standard first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, the most common form, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Poor adherence to glaucoma medication could result in disease progression and vision loss.

28609,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Imfinzi and Tremelimumab in P-III DANUBE Study for Unresectable Stage IV Bladder Cancer,"Update on Phase III DANUBE trial for Imfinzi and tremelimumab in unresectable, Stage IV bladder cancer","The P-III DANUBE study involves assessing Imfinzi as monothx. & Imfinzi + Tremelimumab vs SOC CT as a 1L treatment for patients with unresectable, Stage IV (metastatic) UC whose tumor cells express high levels (≥25%) of PD-L1 & patients regardless of their PD-L1 expression respectively
 The P-III DANUBE study did not meet its 1EPs of OS while its safety & tolerability profile is consistent with previous studies
 Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a mAb targeting PD-L1, blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, being evaluated in multiple clinical studies for LA/m-BC and earlier stages of BC","The Phase III DANUBE trial for Imfinzi (durvalumab) and Imfinzi plus tremelimumab in unresectable, Stage IV (metastatic) bladder cancer did not meet the primary endpoints of improving overall survival (OS) versus standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapy for Imfinzi monotherapy in patients whose tumour cells and/or tumour-infiltrating immune cells express high levels (≥25%) of PD-L1, or for Imfinzi plus tremelimumab in patients regardless of their PD-L1 expression.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “AstraZeneca remains committed to addressing unmet needs in bladder cancer and the potential for immunotherapy to improve outcomes for these patients. The results from this trial will inform our comprehensive Phase III development programme in bladder cancer. We look forward to the results of the Phase III NILE trial also in the 1st-line metastatic setting, and we continue to advance clinical trials for patients at earlier stages of the disease.”
The safety and tolerability profiles for Imfinzi and the combination with tremelimumab were consistent with previous trials. The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
Imfinzi is being developed in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer in the Phase III NILE trial either in combination with chemotherapy or with chemotherapy and tremelimumab. Imfinzi is also being tested in earlier stages of bladder cancer in the Phase III NIAGARA trial in combination with chemotherapy, and in the Phase III POTOMAC trial in combination with SoC Bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy.
Imfinzi is approved for patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy in 15 countries, including the US.
Bladder cancer
In 2018, approximately 550,000 people were diagnosed with bladder cancer around the world and 200,000 died from the disease.1 Locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer remains an area of unmet medical need and typically only one in seven patients are alive five years after diagnosis.2 Urothelial cancer (UC) is the most common form of bladder cancer.3 UC is the 10th most common cancer worldwide and the 13th most common cause of cancer death.1,4 PD-L1 is widely expressed in tumour and immune cells in patients with bladder cancer and helps tumours evade detection from the immune system.5
DANUBE
DANUBE is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of both cisplatin eligible and ineligible patients with unresectable, Stage IV (metastatic) UC. The trial compared Imfinzi monotherapy or Imfinzi plus tremelimumab versus cisplatin and gemcitabine or carboplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. The trial was conducted in more than 220 centres across 24 countries, including centres in the US, Canada, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.
Eligible patients included those with transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium, including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. High PD-L1 was defined as ≥25% of tumour cells (TC) or tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) expressing membrane PD-L1 if ICs involved >1% of the tumour area, or TC≥25% or IC=100% if ICs involved ≤1% of the tumour area.
The primary endpoints of the trial were OS in high PD-L1 patients treated with Imfinzi monotherapy, and OS in patients treated with Imfinzi plus tremelimumab regardless of their PD-L1 status. The DANUBE trial addresses a post-approval commitment in agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration from the May 2017 accelerated US approval of Imfinziin previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer.
Imfinzi
Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.
Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after chemoradiation therapy in 61 countries, including the US, Japan, China and across the EU, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. Imfinzi recently received its first global approval for the 1st-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in combination with SoC chemotherapy in Singapore.
As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combinations including with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.
Tremelimumab
Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death. Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with Imfinzi in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and liver cancer.
AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)
Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca believes that IO-based therapies offer the potential for life-changing cancer treatments for the clear majority of patients.
The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.
AstraZeneca in Oncology
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

28663,AbbVie's Maviret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) Receives EC's Marketing Authorization as Eight-Week Regimen for Treatment-NaÃ¯ve Chronic HCV Patients with Genotype 3 and Compensated Cirrhosis,European Commission Grants AbbVie Marketing Authorization Shortening MAVIRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) Treatment Duration to Eight Weeks for Treatment-Naïve Chronic HCV Patients with Genotype 3 and Compensated Cirrhosis,"The approval is based on P-IIIb EXPEDITION-8 study assessing Maviret in 343 treatment naïve chronic HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis across all major genotypes (GT1-6) for 8wks.
 The P-IIIb EXPEDITION-8 study results: GT1- 6 patients achieving SVR12 (97.7%); GT3 patients achieving SVR12 (95.2%); one case of virologic failure and no case of discontinuation was reported
 Maviret is a combination of NS3/4A protease & NS5A inhibitor and is now available as an 8-week regimen for treatment-naïve, HCV patients without cirrhosis & with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of genotype in the EU","MAVIRET now available in the EU as an 8-week treatment option for treatment-naïve, chronic hepatitis C (HCV) patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of genotype* 
– Today’s EC decision makes MAVIRET the only pan-genotypic (genotypes 1-6) 8-week treatment option for treatment-naïve, chronic HCV patients, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., March 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the European Commission has approved a change to the marketing authorization for MAVIRET® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic hepatitis C (HCV) patients with genotype (GT) 3 infection. MAVIRET was already indicated as an 8-week, pan-genotypic (GT1-6), once-daily regimen for treatment-naïve HCV patients without cirrhosis, and as an 8-week, once-daily regimen for treatment-naïve GT 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis.1*
“A shorter treatment duration means that more patients with HCV can be treated with an 8-week course of MAVIRET in the absence of initial tests to determine their genotype or degree of fibrosis or cirrhosis,” said Janet Hammond M.D., Ph.D., vice president, general medicine and virology therapeutic area, AbbVie. “The ability to streamline pre-treatment assessment for people with HCV represents a paradigm shift in the way the disease is treated, potentially accelerating the care cascade and allowing us to make greater strides towards achieving the World Health Organization’s goal of eliminating HCV by 2030.”
The EC approval is supported by data from the Phase 3b EXPEDITION-8 study. The Phase 3b EXPEDITION-8 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of MAVIRET in treatment-naïve chronic HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis across all major genotypes (GT1-6). The results have been reported for GT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (n=343) patients2 and showed that with 8 weeks of MAVIRET, 97.7 percent (n=335/343) of GT1- 6 patients achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) (ITT). For patients with GT3, the SVR12 rate was 95.2% (n= 60/63) (ITT).**
To date, one virologic failure has been reported and no patients have discontinued treatment due to adverse events. In the study, most patients that did not achieve SVR12** were lost to follow up versus experiencing treatment failure, and no new safety signals were identified.2
“Despite hepatitis C now being curable, there are millions of people in Europe who are chronically infected with the virus. Many of these patients have never received treatment, often because they have been unable to navigate the practical and clinical complexities of the treatment journey,” said Stefan Zeuzem, M.D., chief of the department of medicine at the J.W. Goethe University Hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. “A shorter-duration therapeutic option and simplified pre-treatment approach can eliminate the need for extra tests and help significantly more people overcome their very real treatment barriers.”
In the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region, 14 million people are estimated to be chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus and many of them are unaware that they are infected.3 Each year 112,500 people die from hepatitis C-related liver disease.3
About the EXPEDITION-8 Study2
EXPEDITION-8 is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 3b study in treatment-naïve, GT1-6 chronic HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis (n=343) who received MAVIRET for 8 weeks.
The primary efficacy endpoints were SVR12** in patients with GT1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in a per-protocol (PP) and intent-to-treat (ITT) population versus historical SVR12** rates based on the efficacy of MAVIRET for 12 weeks in treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis. The key secondary efficacy endpoints were the percentages of GT1-6 patients achieving SVR12** in a PP and ITT population.
Additional information on the clinical trials for MAVIRET is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov/.
About MAVIRET® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir)1

 XOMA retains the rights for all other territories and receives royalties on the sales in the licensed territories. The collaboration will combine Zydus’ IL-2 with XOMA’s anti-IL-2 mAb
 Zydus to develop new IO therapy through human POC while each company will receive pre-defined shares of future proceeds that may arise under the license agreement","AHMEDABAD, India and EMERYVILLE, Calif., March 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Zydus Cadila, an innovation-driven global pharmaceutical company, and XOMA Corporation (Nasdaq: XOMA) today announced they have entered into a licensing agreement to advance an IL-2-based immuno-oncology (IO) drug candidate that combines Zydus’ IL-2 with XOMA’s novel anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody.

As part of the agreement, Zydus will advance the new IO candidate through formal clinical trials. Zydus has been granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the therapy in India, Brazil, Mexico and other emerging markets, and XOMA has the potential to receive single-to double-digit royalties on commercial sales in those territories. XOMA retains rights in all other territories (i.e., XOMA territory). Through this collaboration, Zydus will develop the new IO drug candidate through human proof-of-concept and each company has the potential to receive pre-defined shares of future proceeds that may arise from licensing and commercialization activities.

Speaking about the development, Managing Director of the Zydus group, Dr. Sharvil Patel said, “IL-2 will be the backbone of IO-based therapies for cancer treatment in the future. In this win-win agreement, we see a great strategic fit between our IL-2 and XOMA’s anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody as together they have the potential to provide a safe and efficacious medicine to address the unmet needs of patients living with cancer.”

Jim Neal, Chief Executive Officer at XOMA commented, “IL-2 has long been recognized as an effective anti-tumor agent, but its utility has been limited by its toxicity. XOMA has developed unique, fully human antibodies that promote IL-2 action specifically to the cytotoxic effector immune cell populations relevant for anti-tumor activity while simultaneously limiting the unwanted stimulation of immunosuppressive T cells, thereby minimizing its undesired side effects. This IL-2 and monoclonal antibody combination has the potential to turn the immune system against the cancer cells, and Zydus is an ideal partner to advance this combination through clinical development.”

28677,BMS Reports Results of Triple Regimen in P-III ELOQUENT-1 Study for Patients with Newly Diagnosed Untreated Multiple Myeloma,"Bristol Myers Squibb Reports Primary Results of ELOQUENT-1 Study Evaluating Empliciti (elotuzumab) Plus Revlimid (lenalidomide) and Dexamethasone in Patients with Newly Diagnosed, Untreated Multiple Myeloma","The P-III ELOQUENT-1 study involves assessing of Empliciti (elotuzumab)+ Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (ERd) vs Rd in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated MM
 The P-III ELOQUENT-1 study resulted in not meeting its 1EPs of PFS while the safety profile of ERd is consistent with its known profiles
 Empliciti is an immunostimulatory Ab targeting SLAMF7 and has received the FDA’s approval in 2015 as a combination therapy with Rd for MM patients prior treated with one to three therapies and in 2018 approved as EPd combination therapy for MM patients prior treated with two therapies","Phase 3 trial did not meet primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients not eligible for transplant

PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) today announced topline results from ELOQUENT-1, a Phase 3, randomized, open-label trial evaluating the combination of Empliciti (elotuzumab) plus Revlimid(lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (ERd), versus Revlimid and dexamethasone alone (Rd), in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple myeloma who are transplant ineligible. Both treatments were administered continuously until disease progression. At final analysis, the addition of Empliciti did not show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), the study’s primary endpoint. The safety profile of ERd was generally consistent with the known profile of Empliciti plus Revlimid and dexamethasone. The company will complete a full evaluation of the ELOQUENT-1 data and work with investigators to present the results at a future medical meeting.
“While we are disappointed that the ELOQUENT-1 trial did not meet its primary endpoint in these previously untreated, transplant ineligible patients, the Empliciti, Revlimid and dexamethasone combination remains a standard treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, providing the potential for improved survival in this population of patients who are in need of additional treatment options,” said Noah Berkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, Global Clinical Development, Hematology, Bristol Myers Squibb.
“Multiple myeloma is an aggressive disease characterized by relapse and the likelihood to be refractory to several therapies,” said Meletios A. Dimopoulos, M.D., professor and chairman of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics at Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine. “While the elotuzumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination was unable to show a benefit in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma at this time, it remains an important treatment option in the relapsed/refractory setting.”
Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie are co-developing Empliciti, with Bristol Myers Squibb solely responsible for commercial activities.
About ELOQUENT-1
ELOQUENT-1 is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label trial evaluating Revlimid and dexamethasone with or without Empliciti in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple myeloma. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the addition of Empliciti to Revlimid and low-dose dexamethasone would improve PFS, the study’s primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate and overall survival.
Bristol Myers Squibb: Advancing Cancer Research
At Bristol Myers Squibb, patients are at the center of everything we do. The goal of our cancer research is to increase quality, long-term survival and make cure a possibility. We harness our deep scientific experience, cutting-edge technologies and discovery platforms to discover, develop and deliver novel treatments for patients.
Building upon our transformative work and legacy in hematology and Immuno-Oncology that has changed survival expectations for many cancers, our researchers are advancing a deep and diverse pipeline across multiple modalities. In the field of immune cell therapy, this includes registrational CAR T-cell agents for numerous diseases, and a growing early-stage pipeline that expands cell and gene therapy targets, and technologies. We are developing cancer treatments directed at key biological pathways using our protein homeostasis platform, a research capability that has been the basis of our approved therapies for multiple myeloma and several promising compounds in early- to mid-stage development. Our scientists are targeting different immune system pathways to address interactions between tumors, the microenvironment and the immune system to further expand upon the progress we have made and help more patients respond to treatment. Combining these approaches is key to delivering new options for the treatment of cancer and addressing the growing issue of resistance to immunotherapy. We source innovation internally, and in collaboration with academia, government, advocacy groups and biotechnology companies, to help make the promise of transformational medicines a reality for patients.
About Empliciti
Empliciti is an immunostimulatory antibody that specifically targets Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule Family member 7 (SLAMF7), a cell-surface glycoprotein. SLAMF7 is expressed on myeloma cells independent of cytogenetic abnormalities. SLAMF7 also is expressed on Natural Killer cells, plasma cells and at lower levels on specific immune cell subsets of differentiated cells within the hematopoietic lineage.
Empliciti has a dual mechanism-of-action. It directly activates the immune system through Natural Killer cells via the SLAMF7 pathway. Empliciti also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells, tagging these malignant cells for Natural Killer cell-mediated destruction via antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
Empliciti was initially approved by the FDA in 2015 in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies. In 2018, Empliciti was approved by the FDA in a new combination, with Pomalyst/Imnovid (pomalidomide) and dexamethasone (EPd), for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. The ELd and EPd indications were subsequently approved by the European Commission in 2016 and 2019, respectively.
U.S. FDA-APPROVED INDICATIONS FOR EMPLICITI®
EMPLICITI® (elotuzumab) is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies.
EMPLICITI® (elotuzumab) is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Infusion Reactions
Infusion reactions were reported in 10% of patients treated with EMPLICITI in the ELOQUENT-2 trial [EMPLICITI + lenalidomide + dexamethasone (ERd) vs lenalidomide + dexamethasone (Rd)] and 3.3% in the ELOQUENT-3 trial [EMPLICITI + pomalidomide + dexamethasone (EPd) vs pomalidomide + dexamethasone (Pd)].
In the ELOQUENT-2 trial, all infusion reactions were Grade 3 or lower, with Grade 3 infusion reactions occurring in 1% of patients. The most common symptoms included fever, chills, and hypertension. Bradycardia and hypotension also developed during infusions. In the trial, 5% of patients required interruption of the administration of EMPLICITI for a median of 25 minutes due to infusion reactions, and 1% of patients discontinued due to infusion reactions. Of the patients who experienced an infusion reaction, 70% (23/33) had them during the first dose.
In the ELOQUENT-3 trial, the only infusion reaction symptom was chest discomfort (2%), which was Grade 1. All the patients who experienced an infusion reaction had them during the first treatment cycle.
If a Grade 2 or higher infusion reaction occurs, interrupt the EMPLICITI infusion and institute appropriate medical and supportive measures. If the infusion reaction recurs, stop the EMPLICITI infusion and do not restart it on that day. Severe infusion reactions may require permanent discontinuation of EMPLICITI therapy and emergency treatment.
Premedicate with dexamethasone, H1 blocker, H2 blocker, and acetaminophen prior to EMPLICITI infusion.
Infections
In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), infections were reported in 81% of patients in the ERd arm and 74% in the Rd arm. Grade 3-4 infections were 28% (ERd) and 24% (Rd). Discontinuations due to infections were 3.5% (ERd) and 4.1% (Rd). Fatal infections were 2.5% (ERd) and 2.2% (Rd). Opportunistic infections were reported in 22% (ERd) and 13% (Rd). Fungal infections were 10% (ERd) and 5% (Rd). Herpes zoster was 14% (ERd) and 7% (Rd).
In the ELOQUENT-3 trial (N=115), infections were reported in 65% of patients in both the EPd arm and the Pd arm. Grade 3-4 infections were reported in 13% (EPd) and 22% (Pd). Discontinuations due to infections were 7% (EPd) and 5% (Pd). Fatal infections were 5% (EPd) and 3.6% (Pd). Opportunistic infections were reported in 10% (EPd) and 9% (Pd). Herpes zoster was reported in 5% (EPd) and 1.8% (Pd).
Monitor patients for development of infections and treat promptly.
Second Primary Malignancies
In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), invasive second primary malignancies (SPM) were 9% (ERd) and 6% (Rd). The rate of hematologic malignancies was the same between ERd and Rd treatment arms (1.6%). Solid tumors were reported in 3.5% (ERd) and 2.2% (Rd). Skin cancer was reported in 4.4% (ERd) and 2.8% (Rd).
In the ELOQUENT-3 trial (N=115), invasive SPMs were 0% (EPd) and 1.8% (Pd).
Monitor patients for the development of SPMs.
Hepatotoxicity
In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), AST/ALT >3X the upper limit, total bilirubin >2X the upper limit, and alkaline phosphatase <2X the upper limit were 2.5% (ERd) vs 0.6% (Rd). Of 8 patients experiencing hepatotoxicity, 2 patients discontinued treatment while 6 patients had resolution and continued. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop EMPLICITI upon ≥Grade 3 elevation of liver enzymes. Continuation of treatment may be considered after return to baseline values.
Interference with Determination of Complete Response
EMPLICITI is a humanized IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and possibly relapse from complete response in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
Pregnancy/Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
There are no available data on EMPLICITI use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage.
There is a risk of fetal harm, including severe life-threatening human birth defects, associated with lenalidomide and pomalidomide, and they are contraindicated for use in pregnancy. Refer to the respective product full prescribing information for requirements regarding contraception and the prohibitions against blood and/or sperm donation due to presence and transmission in blood and/or semen and for additional information.

Important Safety Information
WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY, HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, and VENOUS and ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Do not use REVLIMID during pregnancy. Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe life-threatening human birth defects. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo-fetal death. In females of reproductive potential, obtain 2 negative pregnancy tests before starting REVLIMID treatment. Females of reproductive potential must use 2 forms of contraception or continuously abstain from heterosexual sex during and for 4 weeks after REVLIMID treatment. To avoid embryo-fetal exposure to lenalidomide, REVLIMID is only available through a restricted distribution program, the REVLIMID REMS® program.
Information about the REVLIMID REMS program is available at www.celgeneriskmanagement.com or by calling the manufacturer’s toll-free number 1-888-423-5436.
Hematologic Toxicity (Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia)
REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Eighty percent of patients with del 5q MDS had to have a dose delay/reduction during the major study. Thirty-four percent of patients had to have a second dose delay/reduction. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80% of patients enrolled in the study. Patients on therapy for del 5q MDS should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or reduction. Patients may require use of blood product support and/or growth factors.
Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism
REVLIMID has demonstrated a significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with MM who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy. Monitor for and advise patients about signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the choice of regimen should be based on an assessment of the patient’s underlying risks.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy: REVLIMID can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus.
Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: REVLIMID is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to lenalidomide.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: See Boxed WARNINGS.

Females of Reproductive Potential: See Boxed WARNINGS.
Males: Lenalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking REVLIMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing REVLIMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking REVLIMID must not donate sperm.
Blood Donation: Patients must not donate blood during treatment with REVLIMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to REVLIMID.
REVLIMID REMS® Program: See Boxed WARNINGS. Prescribers and pharmacies must be certified with the REVLIMID REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements; pharmacies must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive REVLIMID. Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with REMS requirements; female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements and males must comply with contraception requirements.
Hematologic Toxicity: REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising, especially with use of concomitant medications that may increase risk of bleeding. Patients may require a dose interruption and/or dose reduction. MM: Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) in patients taking REVLIMID + dexamethasone or REVLIMID as maintenance therapy, every 7 days for the first 2 cycles, on days 1 and 15 of cycle 3, and every 28 days thereafter. MDS: Monitor CBC in patients on therapy for del 5q MDS, weekly for the first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. See Boxed WARNINGS for further information. MCL: Monitor CBC in patients taking REVLIMID for MCL weekly for the first cycle (28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles 2-4, and then monthly thereafter. FL/MZL: Monitor CBC in patients taking REVLIMID for FL or MZL weekly for the first 3 weeks of Cycle 1 (28 days), every 2 weeks during Cycles 2-4, and then monthly thereafter.
Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism: See Boxed WARNINGS. Venous thromboembolic events (DVT and PE) and arterial thromboses (MI and CVA) are increased in patients treated with REVLIMID. Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the regimen should be based on the patient’s underlying risks. ESAs and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their use should be based on a benefit-risk decision.
Increased Mortality in Patients With CLL: In a clinical trial in the first-line treatment of patients with CLL, single-agent REVLIMID therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single-agent chlorambucil. Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure, occurred more frequently in the REVLIMID arm. REVLIMID is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials.
Second Primary Malignancies (SPM): In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving REVLIMID and in patients with FL or MZL receiving REVLIMID + rituximab therapy, an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor SPM, notably AML, have been observed. In patients with MM, MDS was also observed. Monitor patients for the development of SPM. Take into account both the potential benefit of REVLIMID and risk of SPM when considering treatment.
Increased Mortality With Pembrolizumab: In clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with REVLIMID + dexamethasone. Pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may be risk factors. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop REVLIMID upon elevation of liver enzymes. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered.
Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. These events can be fatal. Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive REVLIMID. Consider REVLIMID interruption or discontinuation for Grade 2-3 skin rash. Permanently discontinue REVLIMID for Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS, TEN, or DRESS.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Fatal instances of TLS have been reported during treatment with REVLIMID. The patients at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Closely monitor patients at risk and take appropriate preventive approaches.
Tumor Flare Reaction (TFR): TFR has occurred during investigational use of REVLIMID for CLL and lymphoma. Monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended in patients with MCL, FL, or MZL. Tumor flare may mimic the progression of disease (PD). In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, it is recommended to withhold treatment with REVLIMID until TFR resolves to ≤Grade 1. REVLIMID may be continued in patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR without interruption or modification, at the physician’s discretion.
Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization: A decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment (>4 cycles) with REVLIMID has been reported. Consider early referral to transplant center to optimize timing of the stem cell collection.
Thyroid Disorders: Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported. Measure thyroid function before starting REVLIMID treatment and during therapy.
Early Mortality in Patients With MCL: In another MCL study, there was an increase in early deaths (within 20 weeks); 12.9% in the REVLIMID arm versus 7.1% in the control arm. Risk factors for early deaths include high tumor burden, MIPI score at diagnosis, and high WBC at baseline (≥10 x 109/L).
Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic reactions to REVLIMID has been reported. Permanently discontinue REVLIMID for angioedema and anaphylaxis.

DRUG INTERACTIONS
Periodically monitor digoxin plasma levels due to increased Cmax and AUC with concomitant REVLIMID therapy. Patients taking concomitant therapies such as erythropoietin-stimulating agents or estrogen-containing therapies may have an increased risk of thrombosis. It is not known whether there is an interaction between dexamethasone and warfarin. Close monitoring of PT and INR is recommended in patients with MM taking concomitant warfarin.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Pregnancy: See Boxed WARNINGS: If pregnancy does occur during treatment, immediately discontinue the drug and refer patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. There is a REVLIMID pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to REVLIMID during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to REVLIMID. This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure to REVLIMID to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to Celgene Corporation at 1-888-423-5436.
Lactation: There is no information regarding the presence of lenalidomide in human milk, the effects of REVLIMID on the breastfed infant, or the effects of REVLIMID on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from REVLIMID, advise female patients not to breastfeed during treatment with REVLIMID.
Renal Impairment: Adjust the starting dose of REVLIMID based on the creatinine clearance value and for patients on dialysis.
Please see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, for REVLIMID.

28698,"Celltrion Reports Submission of MAA to EMA for CT-P17 (biosimilar, adalimumab)",Celltrion applies for European approval of Humira biosimilar,"Celltrion has applied for the commercial approval of CT-P17, a biosimilar referencing Humira (adalimumab) in the EU
 The submission is based on clinical data targeting all approved indications of Humira, including RA, UC, and psoriasis and is expected to be available in the EU market in about a year. Additionally, Celltrion is conducting P-III clinical studies of CT-P16 (biosimilar, bevacizumab) referencing Genentech’s Avastin for multiple cancer indications
 CT-P17 is the first high-concentration adalimumab biosimilar and is different from the existing biosimilars of Humira in terms of dosing. The drug is citrate free that means it will cause less pain upon injection","Celltrion said Monday that it applied for the European Medicine Agency’s commercialization approval of CT-P17, a Humira (adalimumab) biosimilar.
CT-P17 is a highly potent biosimilar of AbbVie’s autoimmune disease treatment Humira, a blockbuster original that recorded $19.1 billion global revenue in 2019.
If approved, the CT-P17 will be a meaningful addition to Celltrion’s portfolio for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease treatment, alongside the company’s Remicade (infliximab) biosimilar Remsima. The TNF-alpha inhibitor market these drugs set out to target is estimated to be 50 trillion won ($41.7 billion) in size, globally.
Celltrion expects to introduce CT-P17 to the European market in about a year’s time, which is how long the EMA typically takes to review.
“We believe the CT-P17 has differentiated value from existing Humira biosimilars, with high market expectations. We will do our best for an early market release of the pipeline,” Celltrion said.
Due to its high potency, CT-P17 can have its targeted effect with less amount of injection than the original. The drug is citrate-free, meaning it causes less pain upon injection.
Celltrion had previously vowed for an annual of output of minimum one biosimilar up to year 2030.
Apart from CT-P17, Celltrion is also carrying out phase 3 clinical trial of Genetech’s Avastin (bevacizumab) biosimilar CT-P16 for metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer indications.
For Novartis’ asthma and rash treatment Xolair (omalizumab) biosimilar, CT-P39, the company is in the research phase.

 The scientists from both the companies will work at the HIV Cure Center, which was created in 2015 at the start of the collaboration. The public-private collaboration will continue to jointly own Qura Therapeutics, a company managing the IP, commercialization, manufacturing and governance needs of the alliance
 The partnership is the first-of-its-kind in HIV that brings academic and pharmaceutical research scientists together for developing a new approach to eradicate HIV","Unique public-private collaboration provides continued funding for HIV Cure Center and Qura Therapeutics, the joint venture that brings academic and pharmaceutical research scientists together
Issued: London, UK
ViiV Healthcare, the global specialist HIV company majority owned by GSK, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a leading global public research university with significant expertise in HIV basic and clinical research, today announced a five-year, $20 million renewal of a unique, public-private research partnership solely focused on discovering a cure for HIV.
Since its inception in 2015, this collaboration, the first-of-its-kind in the field of HIV cure, has brought together the skills of academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers to create a deeper understanding of how HIV works and develop a new approach to eradicating HIV that could be tested in humans for the first time in the next few years.
Deborah Waterhouse, CEO of ViiV Healthcare, said: “Five years ago when we announced this innovative collaboration, we were inspired by the possibility that with the right resources and research teams, we would be able to make a meaningful impact towards a cure for HIV. Although there is still much left to do, this public-private partnership is making a difference. We are excited to continue this partnership with UNC-Chapel Hill for another five years and look forward to the contribution our unique skills and shared commitment could make to finding a cure for HIV.”
Under the terms of the agreement, ViiV Healthcare and UNC-Chapel Hill scientists will continue to work side by side at the HIV Cure Center, which was created at the start of the collaboration five years ago and located on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus. ViiV Healthcare and UNC-Chapel Hill will also continue to jointly own Qura Therapeutics, the company created in 2015 to manage the intellectual property, commercialization, manufacturing and governance needs of the collaboration.
Kevin Guskiewicz, Chancellor at UNC-Chapel Hill, said: “This groundbreaking venture has flourished thanks to the talent and dedication of top scientists and researchers from Carolina and ViiV Healthcare. I am thrilled that this innovative partnership will continue making discoveries and advancing a cure for HIV, one of the most pressing challenges of our times.”
Research currently underway through the HIV Cure Center and Qura Therapeutics is centered on the concept of “induce and reduce.” This strategy is first focused on identifying the copies of HIV that may be hiding in human immune cells while the virus is suppressed through antiretroviral therapy. Once identified, the virus is driven out of hiding (induce) so that it can be eliminated (reduce). This therapeutic approach strives to specifically affect the virus while minimizing the impact on the body beyond the hidden infected cells.
The pioneering research of Qura Therapeutics on the induce strategy was most recently published in the journal Nature.[1] The paper describes how, using a class of drugs new to the HIV field, a signalling pathway in cells was activated that could robustly induce the hidden HIV to reactivate and become visible. Bringing the virus out of hiding is often seen as the greatest obstacle to curing HIV infection as these hidden, HIV-infected cells can persist despite decades of antiretroviral treatment, and these findings mark significant progress towards a cure for HIV.[1]
“Without the Qura partnership we would not have been able to get this far, this fast,” said David Margolis, MD, Director of the UNC HIV Cure Center and Sarah Graham Kenan Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Microbiology & Immunology, and Epidemiology at the UNC School of Medicine. “We have accomplished a great deal in less than five years and hope to accomplish a good deal more in the years to come to help people living with HIV around the world.”
About Qura Therapeutics
Qura Therapeutics was formed in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and ViiV Healthcare and is focused on finding a cure for HIV. This unique public-private partnership is redefining the traditional way of conducting research and is creating a new model to seek the breakthroughs needed to tackle an extraordinarily challenging global health issue. Worldwide, 37 million people are living with HIV. While highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has offered the opportunity for most but not all infected individuals to achieve relatively normal life expectancies, there is, as yet, no cure and the search for one remains a top priority of health organizations worldwide.
Qura Therapeutics is providing financial and material support to the UNC HIV Cure Center to discover a cure for HIV and Qura Therapeutics will also assist in the development of therapies that emerge from the research.

 The P-III INBUILD study results demonstrated that therapy slowed the loss of pulmonary function by 57% (107ml/yr.) across a range of patients while in patients with IP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT, Ofev slowed the loss of pulmonary function by 61% (128.2ml/yr.)
 Ofev is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, approved in 75+ countries for IPF and has received the US FDA’s approval as the first therapy to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-ILD in Sept’2019","Ridgefield, Conn., March 9, 2020 – Boehringer Ingelheim today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ofev® (nintedanib) as the first treatment for people with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype. Unclassifiable ILDs, autoimmune ILDs, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, myositis, sjogren’s syndrome, coal workers pneumoconiosis and idiopathic forms of interstitial pneumonias such as idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia are among the diseases that may develop a progressive form of chronic fibrosing ILD.
Ofev, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits key pathways involved in lung fibrosis in ILDs, is currently approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD), two types of ILDs. Ofev received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. FDA for chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype in October 2019. This new approval now makes Ofev available for patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs in which lung fibrosis continues to worsen.
The FDA approval is based on the INBUILD® trial, the first Phase III clinical trial in the field of ILDs to group patients based on the clinical behavior of their disease rather than the primary clinical diagnosis. In this trial, the safety and tolerability profile of Ofev was consistent with what was previously seen in IPF studies. The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to five percent in Ofev-treated patients compared to placebo were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, liver enzyme elevation, decreased appetite, weight decreased, headache, hypertension, nasopharygitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infections, fatigue and back pain. Please see additional Important Safety Information included below.
“Chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype lead to respiratory symptoms and worsening lung function,” said Kevin Flaherty, M.D., professor of medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and lead investigator of the INBUILD trial. “This approval provides a therapeutic option for many patients who did not have an approved treatment until today.”
Interstitial lung diseases encompass more than 200 disorders, which are classified as rare diseases, that can lead to pulmonary fibrosis – an irreversible scarring of lung tissue that negatively impacts lung function. Chronic fibrosing ILDs in which lung fibrosis continues to worsen are estimated to occur in 18 to 32 percent of patients with ILDs.
“As a leader in the field of ILD research, we are fully committed to better understanding how to treat these devastating diseases,” said Thomas Seck, M.D., senior vice president, Medicine & Regulatory Affairs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “Today’s approval marks a major advancement in ILD research and is an important milestone just six months after the approval of Ofev to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-ILD.”
“Patients with a progressive form of chronic fibrosing ILDs may have symptoms that are similar to other respiratory illnesses and that may delay getting an accurate diagnosis for patients,” said Greg Cosgrove, M.D., chief medical officer, Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation. “The new indication for nintedanib provides a therapeutic option for physicians and their patients as there is now a treatment option that can help slow the decline in lung function.”
About the Phase III INBUILD trial
The INBUILD trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial conducted at 153 sites in 15 countries that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Ofev (150 mg, twice-daily) over 52 weeks in patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype. A total of 663 patients were evaluated, of whom 412 (62.1 percent) had a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like pattern on high-resolution CT (HRCT). Randomization of patients was based on the fibrotic patterns as detected through HRCT. Lung function was assessed by the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC), which is an established measurement of lung function.
Results showed that Ofev slowed the loss of pulmonary function by 57 percent (107 mL/year) across a range of patients relative to placebo. In patients with UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT, results showed that treatment with Ofev-versus placebo slowed the loss of pulmonary function by 61 percent (128.2mL/year).
In this trial, the safety and tolerability profile of Ofev was consistent with what was previously seen in IPF studies, with the most common adverse reaction being diarrhea.
About Ofev
Ofev is already approved in the U.S. and more than 75 countries for the treatment of patients living with IPF. In September 2019, Ofev was approved in the U.S. as the first and only therapy to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-ILD.
Ofev patient support
To support people who are prescribed Ofev, Boehringer Ingelheim has developed OPEN DOORS® – a comprehensive patient support program that provides a broad range of nursing, social resources, and financial support services. Accessible through www.ofev.com and at 1-866-673-6366, OPEN DOORS services and resources include:

What is OFEV?

OFEV is a prescription medicine used:
to treat people with a lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
​
or
to treat people with a chronic (long lasting) interstitial lung disease in which lung fibrosis continues to worsen (progress).
​
or
to slow the rate of decline in lung function in people with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) (also known as scleroderma-associated ILD).
It is not known if OFEV is safe and effective in children.
Important Safety Information
What is the most important information I should know about OFEV (nintedanib)?
OFEV can cause harm, birth defects, or death to an unborn baby. Women should not become pregnant while taking OFEV. Women who are able to become pregnant should have a pregnancy test before starting treatment and should use highly effective birth control during and for at least 3 months after your last dose. Talk with your doctor about what birth control method is right for you during this time. Women using hormonal birth control should also use a barrier method of birth control (such as male condoms or spermicide). If you become pregnant or think you are pregnant while taking OFEV, tell your doctor right away.
What should I tell my doctor before using OFEV?
Before you take OFEV, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you have:

28721,Novo Nordisk's Fiasp (insulin aspart injection) Receives Health Canada's Approval for Children with Diabetes,"Health Canada approves fast-acting mealtime insulin, Fiasp, for children with diabetes","Health Canada has expanded the approval of Fiasp (10mL vials) to include use in insulin infusion pumps for the improvement of glycemic control in pediatric patients aged ≥2yrs with diabetes (T1D/T2D both)
 The approval is based on data from 7 clinical studies that verified the safety & efficacy of Fiasp in children. The label change for use in insulin infusion pumps is based on Health Canada’s review of data from 5 clinical studies which demonstrated the efficacy of Fiasp used in insulin infusion pumps in adults with diabetes
 Fiasp is the first and only fast-acting mealtime insulin injection, administered at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after starting a meal and has received FDA’s approval as an IV infusion or SC MDI in adults with diabetes","Health Canada also expands Fiasp® approval to include insulin infusion pumps

MISSISSAUGA, ON, March 9, 2020 /CNW/ – Fiasp® (insulin aspart injection), a faster acting mealtime insulin, is now approved in Canada for pediatric patients aged 2 years and above giving Canadian families managing type 1 or type 2 diabetes an effective treatment option to support optimal mealtime glucose control.1 Health Canada has also expanded the approval of Fiasp® (10 mL vials) to include use in insulin infusion pumps for the improvement of glycemic control.

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases among children and youth.2 Managing diabetes can be challenging for parents and caregivers given it is hard to know exactly how much or how quickly their children will eat, making mealtime insulin dosing difficult.3,4,5 Missed meals, illness and increased physical activity without a corresponding reduction in insulin or increase in carbohydrate consumption can lead to significant diabetes management complications for children.6
“Children living with diabetes face significant challenges in managing their disease. Just being a kid and factoring common daily events like mealtime, school, travel, activities, play and sick days can dramatically impact hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia,” said Dr. Karen McAssey, Pediatric Endocrinologist at McMaster Children’s Hospital. “As a clinician who treats pediatric diabetes patients daily, it’s essential to have effective, fast-acting mealtime insulin options to support optimal disease management and care.”
Fiasp® for adult and pediatric type one and type two diabetes management – First approved by Health Canada in January 2017 for the treatment of adult patients, Fiasp® is absorbed faster than conventional insulin aspart (e.g. NovoRapid®) appearing twice as fast in the bloodstream after injection,7 which leads to improved glycemic control after a meal.8,9 Fiasp® is now indicated for treatment of adult and pediatric patients (>2 years old) with diabetes mellitus who require mealtime insulin for the control of hyperglycemia.10
Fiasp® pump use – Fiasp® (10 mL vials) may now be used for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in pump systems that are licensed in Canada for insulin infusion. An insulin pump may provide greater lifestyle flexibility and convenience particularly with regards to meal schedules and travel. Both CSII and multiple daily insulin injection therapy are effective means of implementing intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normal levels of blood glucose and improved lifestyle flexibility. Use Fiasp® in accordance with the insulin infusion pumps’ instructions for use. Patients should be trained on using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy and to administer insulin by injection with alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure. Refer to the insulin infusion pump manufacturers’ user manual to see if Fiasp® can be used.11
“We welcome the pediatric approval of Fiasp® for younger Canadians, providing greater choice for effective disease management to support easier, healthier and safer lives for young people with type 1 diabetes,” said Dave Prowten, President and CEO of JDRF Canada.
The approval of Fiasp® in pediatric patients is based on Health Canada’s review of data from the onset 7 clinical trial, which confirmed the efficacy and safety of Fiasp® in children.12 The label change for use in insulin infusion pumps is based on Health Canada’s review of data from the onset 5 clinical trial, which confirmed the efficacy and safety of Fiasp®when used in insulin infusion pumps in adults with diabetes. The pump should be programed based on guidance from healthcare providers and the pump maker’s instructions.13
“At Novo Nordisk, we are continuously researching innovative solutions to improve diabetes management and address critical unmet needs,” said Vicky Chan, Vice President, Clinical Development, Medical and Regulatory Affairs, Novo Nordisk Canada Inc. “We are pleased to offer Fiasp® – a trusted and effective mealtime glucose control treatment – to the pediatric diabetes community in Canada allowing for choice and convenience in supporting diabetes management goals.”
About Fiasp®
Fiasp® is a rapid acting mealtime insulin, developed by Novo Nordisk with the objective of achieving a faster initial absorption, to improve glycemic control after a meal, in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.14 Fiasp® is insulin aspart, a molecule with more than 20 years of clinical experience,15 in an innovative formulation, in which two excipients have been added, Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) to increase the speed of absorption, and a naturally occurring Amino Acid (L-Arginine) for stability.16
Low blood sugar is the most common adverse effect of insulin products, including Fiasp®. If low blood sugar or high blood sugar reactions are not treated, they can cause loss of consciousness, coma or even death. Blood sugar levels should be monitored for all patients with diabetes.17

CEPI has invested up to $23.7M in R&D of COVID-19 vaccines
 Novavax is assessing multiple nanoparticle vaccine candidates to identify the best candidates for clinical studies. CEPI will provide the initial funding to Novavax for the initiation of P-I study, which is expected to be initiated in H1’20
 The company has developed the vaccine candidates using its recombinant protein nanoparticle technology to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike protein and is expected to utilize its Matrix-M adjuvant to enhance the immune response of vaccine candidates","OSLO, NORWAY, March 10, 2020 – CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, today announced the expansion of its COVID-19 vaccine portfolio. CEPI will be investing a further $4.4 million in partnering agreements with Novavax, Inc. and The University of Oxford to rapidly develop vaccine candidates against COVID-19. This brings CEPI’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine R&D to $23.7 million.
CEPI will provide initial funding to Novavax to enable preparations for phase 1 trials. Funding for The University of Oxford project will support the manufacture of vaccine materials required for preclinical and phase 1 testing. Earlier this year, CEPI announced initial funding to Curevac Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., Moderna, Inc., and University of Queensland to develop COVID-19 vaccine candidates using innovative platform technologies.
The investments announced today are a result of a recent global call for proposals that CEPI issued in early February, which invited funding applications for proven vaccine technology that could be used to rapidly develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus, and most importantly at scale and with the necessary equitable access provisions.
COVID-19 is having a huge impact on individuals, societies, and economies. CEPI is working at speed to develop a vaccine, which will be crucial in the world’s efforts to tackle this virus. CEPI has so far invested in the development of 6 vaccine candidates against COVID-19.
We’ve created a diverse portfolio of candidates based on a wide range of vaccine technologies—including novel platforms technologies and other more established approaches—to ensure that we have multiple shots on goal and a balanced portfolio. Vaccine development is complex and difficult and will require concerted global effort. There are no guarantees of success, but we are working as fast and as hard as we can with the hope of delivering safe and effective vaccines that may be available for broader use potentially within the next 12-18 months.
Investing in vaccine development now is an investment in the future health of all our societies. An urgent, global, concerted effort is now needed to raise the money required to advance the development of COVID-19 vaccines.”
Dr. Richard Hatchett
Chief Executive Officer, CEPI

Novavax, Inc. (recombinant protein nanoparticle technology)
Novavax has produced and is currently assessing multiple nanoparticle vaccine candidates to identify the best candidate(s) for human testing, which is expected to begin by the end of spring 2020. Novavax is creating COVID-19 vaccine candidates using its proprietary recombinant protein nanoparticle technology platform to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein. Novavax expects to use its proprietary Matrix-M™ adjuvant with its COVID-19 vaccine candidate to enhance immune responses. Novavax has experience in rapid innovative vaccine development against novel emerging viruses, including efforts to develop vaccines against the similar coronaviruses Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The University of Oxford (ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine)
ChAdOx1 is a replication-deficient simian adenoviral vaccine vector. This vaccine platform has been used to produce vaccine candidates against multiple pathogens, including Influenza, Chikungunya, and Zika. In 2018, CEPI provided up to $19 million to Oxford to develop vaccines against Lassa, Nipah, and MERS. Oxford’s ChAdOx1 MERS candidate has completed phase 1 studies and a second clinical study is underway in Saudi Arabia.

The first biomarker-based test specifically approved by the FDA to triage women with HPV-positive / Pap cytology-negative co-testing results, providing clinicians with a new option to guide patient management
Launch supports the goal of the World Health Organization to eliminate cervical cancer, which is nearly 100 percent preventable
Basel, 11 March 2020 — Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of CINtec® PLUS Cytology as the first biomarker-based triage test for women whose primary cervical cancer screening results are positive for the human papillomavirus (HPV) using the cobas® 4800 HPV Test. This biomarker technology simplifies clinical decision making by providing easy to understand results so that clinicians and women are clear on next steps.
The CINtec PLUS Cytology test identifies those women whose HPV infections are most likely to be associated with cervical pre-cancers. It enables clinicians to more confidently determine which women should be referred to immediate further diagnostic procedures, helping to prevent women from developing more advanced cervical disease.
About 13,800 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in the US in 2020, according to the American Cancer Society, and about 4,290 women will die from the disease this year. Persistent infection with HPV is the principal cause of cervical cancer, with the virus implicated in more than 99 percent of cervical cancers worldwide.
“Despite being nearly 100 percent preventable, cervical cancer is still one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. To address this, Roche is dedicated to investing in next-generation biomarkers that will significantly advance screening strategies and support global efforts to eradicate this disease,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO, Roche Diagnostics. “We are committed to providing women with the protection and care they deserve.” While most HPV infections resolve on their own, some women who test positive for the virus or whose co-testing results are inconclusive – HPV-positive and Pap cytology-negative – may develop pre-cancerous cervical lesions that, if left untreated, may progress to cervical cancer. Early identification of women who are most at risk is vital.
CINtec PLUS Cytology provides definitive information about which HPV-positive women may benefit most from immediate referral to colposcopy versus repeat testing. This is a major step forward to individualize a woman’s care and prevent both overtreatment and undertreatment.
FDA considered data from the Roche-sponsored registrational IMPACT (IMproving Primary screening And Colposcopy Triage) trial, which enrolled more than 35,000 women in the US to clinically validate CINtec PLUS Cytology as a triage test in different screening scenarios. Publication of study data is pending.
CINtec PLUS Cytology is expected to be widely commercially available in the US later in 2020.
About the CINtec PLUS Cytology test
The Roche cobas 4800 HPV Test, used in combination with CINtec PLUS Cytology and CINtec® Histology, offers clinicians and labs in the US powerful support they have not had before. The dual-stain biomarker technology included in the CINtec PLUS Cytology test detects the simultaneous presence within a single cell of the two biomarkers — p16 and Ki-67. This abnormality is associated with HPV infections that are transforming and can, if left untreated, progress to pre-cancer or cancer. A positive result of these two biomarkers in a single cell signals that a woman is more significantly at risk for disease. The ability of CINtec PLUS Cytology to distinguish those women who are at higher risk for cervical disease provides labs, clinicians and women, in conjunction with the physician’s assessment of patient screening history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines information, to guide patient management. This could reduce the number and frequency of follow-up visits, saving worry, time and money.
The new test can be performed using the same liquid sample that is used for HPV or Pap cytology testing. This eliminates the need for additional or repeat sample collection or time spent waiting to find out if an infection is clearing. Primary screening by the cobas 4800 HPV DNA test with triage using the CINtec PLUS Cytology test demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity to detect transforming HPV infections reliably and cost-effectively.
Prior to FDA approval for use in the US, the CINtec PLUS Cytology test, which runs on the BenchMark ULTRA IHC/ISH system, had been used as a triage test for HPV-positive results and mildly abnormal Pap cytology results in Europe, Asia, South America and Australia.

 The study aims to determine the recommended P-II dose in patients with advanced NSCLC. The enrollment of patients is ongoing into part 2 dose expansion cohorts to assess JNJ-6372 as monothx. in multiple NSCLC sub-populations with genomic alteration
 JNJ-6372 is an EGFR-MET bispecific Ab that targets activating and resistant EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications. The development of Ab followed the Janssen’s licensing agreement with Genmab for its DuoBody technology platform","Janssen Announces U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation Granted for JNJ-6372 for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
JNJ-6372, a dual-targeting EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, is being investigated for adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations
RARITAN, NJ, March 10, 2020 – The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for JNJ-61186372 (JNJ-6372) for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 insertion mutations, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. JNJ-6372 is an EGFR-mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific antibody that targets activating and resistant EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications.[1]Currently, there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies for patients with lung cancer who have EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations.[2]
Patients with NSCLC and EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations have a form of disease that is generally insensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatments and carries a worse prognosis compared to patients with more common EGFR mutations (Exon 19 deletions/L858R substitution).[3] The current standard of care for this patient population is conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.[4]
“JNJ-6372 is a novel bispecific antibody that we believe has the potential to benefit patients with Exon 20 mutation insertions who often do not respond to currently available oral EGFR-targeted or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies,” said Peter Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “This Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to advance JNJ-6372 in clinical development and target genetically-defined lung cancer.”
The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is supported by data from a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter study (NCT02609776).5 The study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of JNJ-6372 monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib[i], a novel third-generation EGFR TKI, in adult patients with advanced NSCLC.5
The study seeks to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose in patients with advanced NSCLC.[5]Enrollment into the Part 2 dose expansion cohorts is ongoing, as the study evaluates JNJ-6372 monotherapy activity in multiple NSCLC sub-populations with genomic alterations such as those with C797S resistance mutation or MET amplification.5
A U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation is granted to expedite the development and regulatory review of an investigational medicine that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition.6 The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy Designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy.[6]
About JNJ-61186372 (JNJ-6372) 
JNJ-6372 is an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets activating and resistant EGFR and MET mutations and amplifications.5,[7] The production and development of the antibody followed Janssen’s licensing agreement with Genmab for use of its DuoBody® technology platform.
About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
In the U.S., lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women, after skin cancer; NSCLC makes up 80-85 percent of all lung cancers.[8],[9] The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenoca rcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.10 The most common driver mutation for NSCLC is the EGFR genetic alteration, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase that helps cells grow and divide.[10] EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of patients with NSCLC and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients who have NSCLC adenocarcinoma.[11],[12],[13] EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations identify a distinct subset of lung adenocarcinomas, accounting for at least nine percent of all EGFR mutations.[14] The five-year survival rate for patients with metastatic NSCLC is currently six percent.[15]

For additional information: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01850524

About Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a life-threatening rare blood cancer that arises from the plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that is made in the bone marrow. These plasma cells become abnormal, multiply and release a type of antibody known as a paraprotein, which causes symptoms of the disease, including bone pain, frequent or recurring infections and fatigue, a symptom of anemia. These malignant plasma cells have the potential to affect many bones in the body and can cause a number of serious health problems affecting the bones, immune system, kidneys and red blood cell count. The typical multiple myeloma disease course includes periods of symptomatic myeloma followed by periods of remission. Nearly 230,000 people around the world live with multiple myeloma, with approximately 114,000 new cases diagnosed globally each year.

About NINLAROTM (ixazomib) capsules
NINLARO™ (ixazomib) is an oral proteasome inhibitor which is being studied across the continuum of multiple myeloma treatment settings. NINLARO was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015 and is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. NINLARO is currently approved in more than 60 countries, including the United States, Japan and in the European Union, with more than 10 regulatory filings currently under review. It was the first oral proteasome inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials and to receive approval.

NINLAROTM (ixazomib): GLOBAL IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively) with platelet nadirs typically occurring between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle and recovery to baseline by the start of the next cycle. It did not result in an increase in hemorrhagic events or platelet transfusions. Monitor platelet counts at least monthly during treatment with NINLARO and consider more frequent monitoring during the first three cycles. Manage with dose modifications and platelet transfusions as per standard medical guidelines.
Gastrointestinal toxicities have been reported in the NINLARO and placebo regimens respectively, such as diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), and vomiting (22% vs. 11%), occasionally requiring use of antiemetic and anti-diarrheal medications, and supportive care.
Peripheral neuropathy was reported with NINLARO (28% vs. 21% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). The most commonly reported reaction was peripheral sensory neuropathy (19% and 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Peripheral motor neuropathy was not commonly reported in either regimen (< 1%). Monitor patients for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and adjust dosing as needed.
Peripheral edema was reported with NINLARO (25% vs. 18% in the NINLARO and placebo regimens, respectively). Evaluate patients for underlying causes and provide supportive care, as necessary. Adjust the dose of dexamethasone per its prescribing information or the dose of NINLARO for severe symptoms
Cutaneous reactions occurred in 19% of patients in the NINLARO regimen compared to 11% of patients in the placebo regimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens was maculo-papular and macular rash. Manage rash with supportive care, dose modification or discontinuation.
Thrombotic microangiopathy, sometimes fatal, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), have been reported in patients who received NINLARO. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TPP/HUS and stop NINLARO if diagnosis is suspected. If the diagnosis of TPP/HUS is excluded, consider restarting NINLARO. The safety of reinitiating NINLARO therapy in patients previously experiencing TPP/HUS is not known.
Hepatotoxicity, drug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular injury, hepatic steatosis, and hepatitis cholestatic have been uncommonly reported with NINLARO. Monitor hepatic enzymes regularly and adjust dose for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms.
Pregnancy– NINLARO can cause fetal harm. Advise male and females patients of reproductive potential to use contraceptive measures during treatment and for an additional 90 days after the final dose of NINLARO. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while taking NINLARO due to potential hazard to the fetus. Women using hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of contraception.
Lactation– It is not known whether NINLARO or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There could be potential adverse events in nursing infants and therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued.
SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS
Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
Renal Impairment: Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. NINLARO is not dialyzable and, therefore, can be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers with NINLARO is not recommended.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in the NINLARO regimen, and greater than in the placebo regimen, were diarrhea (42% vs. 36%), constipation (34% vs. 25%), thrombocytopenia (28% vs. 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 21%), nausea (26% vs. 21%), peripheral edema (25% vs. 18%), vomiting (22% vs. 11%), and back pain (21% vs. 16%). Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients included thrombocytopenia (2%) and diarrhea (2%). For each adverse reaction, one or more of the three drugs was discontinued in ≤ 1% of patients in the NINLARO regimen.

#FDA approves new $BMY therapy for patients with previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma
Tweet this
PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) today announced that Opdivo (nivolumab) 1 mg/kg plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) 3 mg/kg (injections for intravenous use) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who have been previously treated with sorafenib.1,2Approval for this indication has been granted under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response seen in the Opdivo + Yervoy cohort of the Phase 1/2 CheckMate -040 trial.1,2,3 Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.1,2
“HCC is an aggressive disease in need of different treatment approaches,”4,5,6 said Anthony B. El-Khoueiry, M.D., lead investigator and associate professor of clinical medicine and phase I program director at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California (USC) and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. “The overall response rate observed in the Opdivo + Yervoy cohort of the CheckMate -040 trial underscores the potential of this dual immunotherapy as a possible treatment option for patients.”1
In the CheckMate -040 cohort of HCC patients previously treated with sorafenib, after a minimum follow up of 28 months,1 33% (16/49; 95% CI: 20-48) of patients responded to treatment with Opdivo + Yervoy; 8% (4/49) had a complete response (CR) and 24% (12/49) had a partial response (PR).1 Duration of responses (DOR) ranged from 4.6 to 30.5+ months, with 88% lasting at least six months, 56% at least 12 months and 31% at least 24 months.1 Overall response rate (ORR) and DOR were assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).1 ORR assessed by BICR using modified RECIST was 35% (17/49; 95% CI: 22-50), with a CR reported in 12% (6/49) of patients and a PR reported in 22% (11/49) of patients.1
Opdivo is associated with the following Warnings and Precautions including immune-mediated: pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction, skin adverse reactions, encephalitis, other adverse reactions; infusion-related reactions; embryo-fetal toxicity; and increased mortality in patients with multiple myeloma when Opdivo is added to a thalidomide analogue and dexamethasone, which is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.1 Please see the Important Safety Information section below, including Boxed WARNING for Yervoy (ipilimumab) regarding immune-mediated adverse reactions, as well as select safety information from CheckMate -040.
“The incidence of liver cancer is rising in the United States, and HCC is the most common and aggressive form of the disease,”4,5,6,7,8,9said Andrea Wilson, president and founder, Blue Faery: The Adrienne Wilson Liver Cancer Association. “Today’s approval provides a new option for patients with HCC previously treated with sorafenib, giving the community more hope.”1
Opdivo + Yervoy is the only dual immunotherapy approved by the FDA in this setting. The therapy features a potentially synergistic mechanism of action that targets two different checkpoints (PD-1 and CTLA-4) and works in complementary ways.1
“We recognize there is a critical need to provide patients with aggressive forms of cancer, like HCC, new treatment options that may offer clinically meaningful and ultimately durable responses,” said Adam Lenkowsky, general manager and head, U.S., Oncology, Immunology, Cardiovascular, Bristol Myers Squibb. “Today’s announcement builds on our legacy in pioneering immunotherapy treatments and is an important step in our commitment to transforming patients’ lives through science.”
Opdivo + Yervoy was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication and a Priority Review from the FDA.

About the CheckMate -040 Trial Design
CheckMate -040 (NCT01658878) is a Phase 1/2 open-label study that included a cohort of patients with HCC who progressed on or were intolerant to sorafenib and received Opdivo + Yervoy.1,10 The trial included patients who were PD-L1 expressors and non-expressors.3Key eligibility criteria included histologic confirmation of HCC and Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis status.1 Additional eligibility criteria included those who were infected with active HCV or active HBV, or were uninfected.1,3 Patients with active autoimmune disease, brain metastasis, a history of hepatic encephalopathy, clinically significant ascites, infection with HIV, or active co-infection with HBV and HCV or HBV and HDV were excluded.1 Patients with known fibrolamellar HCC, sarcomatoid HCC, and mixed cholangiocarcinoma and HCC were also excluded.3 A total of 49 patients were treated with Opdivo 1 mg/kg IV and Yervoy 3 mg/kg IV every three weeks for four doses, followed by Opdivo 240 mg every two weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1 The major efficacy outcome was ORR, as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST.1 Duration of response was also assessed.1
Select Safety Profile from CheckMate -040 Study
The safety of Opdivo 1 mg/kg and Yervoy 3 mg/kg was evaluated in 49 patients.1 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients receiving Opdivo + Yervoy.1 Treatment was discontinued in 29% of patients and delayed in 65% of patients for an adverse reaction.1Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥4% of patients were pyrexia, diarrhea, anemia, increased AST, adrenal insufficiency, ascites, esophageal varices hemorrhage, hyponatremia, increased blood bilirubin, and pneumonitis.1 The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were rash (53%), pruritus (53%), musculoskeletal pain (41%), diarrhea (39%), cough (37%), decreased appetite (35%), fatigue (27%), pyrexia (27%), abdominal pain (22%), headache (22%), nausea (20%), dizziness (20%), hypothyroidism (20%), and weight decreased (20%).1

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS
YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.
Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy, and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests, at baseline and before each dose.
Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or more severe pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, fatal cases of immune-mediated pneumonitis have occurred. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 10% (5/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (24/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.7% (2/119) of patients.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 (of more than 5 days duration), 3, or 4 colitis. Withhold OPDIVO monotherapy for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 or recurrent colitis upon re-initiation of OPDIVO. When administered with YERVOY, withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent colitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 26% (107/407) of patients including three fatal cases. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 10% (5/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 10% (52/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated colitis occurred in 7% (8/119) of patients.
In a separate Phase 3 trial of YERVOY 3 mg/kg, severe, life-threatening, or fatal (diarrhea of ≥7 stools above baseline, fever, ileus, peritoneal signs; Grade 3-5) immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 34 (7%) patients. Across all YERVOY-treated patients in that trial (n=511), 5 (1%) developed intestinal perforation, 4 (0.8%) died as a result of complications, and 26 (5%) were hospitalized for severe enterocolitis.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Addition of an alternative immunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid therapy, or replacement of the corticosteroid therapy, should be considered in corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis if other causes are excluded.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater transaminase elevations. For patients without HCC, withhold OPDIVO for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for Grade 3 or 4. For patients with HCC, withhold OPDIVO and administer corticosteroids if AST/ALT is within normal limits at baseline and increases to >3 and up to 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), if AST/ALT is >1 and up to 3 times ULN at baseline and increases to >5 and up to 10 times the ULN, and if AST/ALT is >3 and up to 5 times ULN at baseline and increases to >8 and up to 10 times the ULN. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO and administer corticosteroids if AST or ALT increases to >10 times the ULN or total bilirubin increases >3 times the ULN.

Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out other causes. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994) of patients. Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. Encephalitis occurred in one melanoma patient receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg (0.2%) after 1.7 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one RCC patient receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg (0.2%) after approximately 4 months of exposure. Encephalitis occurred in one MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patient (0.8%) receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg after 15 days of exposure.
Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO monotherapy or in combination with YERVOY, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.
If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.
Infusion-Related Reactions
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a separate trial in which patients received OPDIVO monotherapy as a 60-minute infusion or a 30-minute infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO. In melanoma patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. In HCC patients receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with YERVOY 3 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients. In RCC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients. In MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with YERVOY 1 mg/kg, infusion-related reactions occurred in 4.2% (5/119) of patients.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on mechanism of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO or YERVOY and for at least 5 months after the last dose.
Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone
In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
Lactation
It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from OPDIVO or YERVOY, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 5 months after the last dose.
Serious Adverse Reactions
In Checkmate 067, serious adverse reactions (74% and 44%), adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation (47% and 18%) or to dosing delays (58% and 36%), and Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (72% and 51%) all occurred more frequently in the OPDIVO plus YERVOY arm (n=313) relative to the OPDIVO arm (n=313). The most frequent (≥10%) serious adverse reactions in the OPDIVO plus YERVOY arm and the OPDIVO arm, respectively, were diarrhea (13% and 2.2%), colitis (10% and 1.9%), and pyrexia (10% and 1.0%).

 The collaboration allows Vir to access VRC’s research experience with coronaviruses to accelerate the development of Ab targeting the unmet medical needs of patients
 Vir has identified several mAbs that bind to SARS-CoV-2 and were isolated from individuals who had survived a SARS infection. The company is evaluating Ab that it may be able to identify from COVID-19 survivors, can be effective as treatment and/or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2","SAN FRANCISCO, Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced a research collaboration agreement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Vaccine Research Center (VRC) to advance characterization and development of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19. The joint project, which will begin this week, will augment ongoing efforts by both parties to identify antibodies that can be used to prevent or treat infection with existing and emerging viruses and help inform the development of vaccines.

Under the terms of the agreement, Vir and NIAID will work together to identify and optimize combinations of antibodies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS, as well as antibodies that may be effective across additional types of coronaviruses. The two parties will exchange antibodies and other materials for testing in combination and individually and, by mutual agreement, will perform in vivo animal studies to analyze immune responses.
“This collaboration expands Vir’s efforts to characterize and develop antibody therapies against coronaviruses by allowing us to access the VRC’s significant and broad research experience with coronaviruses, which is complementary to ours,” said Herbert “Skip” Virgin, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Vir. “This is one of multiple approaches we are taking to rapidly identify and test potential prophylactics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and we expect it to allow us to accelerate finding solutions to this urgent public health need.”

Vir has identified a number of monoclonal antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies were isolated from individuals who had survived a SARS infection. The company is conducting research to determine if its antibodies, or additional antibodies that it may be able to identify from COVID-19 survivors, can be effective as treatment and/or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2.

NIAID-funded scientists are exploring ways to treat and prevent human coronavirus infections by working to develop new antibodies, drugs, and vaccines that block entry to cells, enhance the immune system response, or block viral replication. To date, this research has focused on the coronavirus spike protein and includes development of neutralization assays and competition assays that are used to characterize antibodies.

About Vir’s Antibody Platform

Vir has a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from, or have recovered from, infectious diseases. The platform is used to identify rare antibodies from survivors that have the potential to treat and prevent rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens via direct pathogen neutralization and immune system stimulation. Vir engineers the fully human antibodies that it discovers to enhance their therapeutic potential. This platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including Ebola (mAb114, currently in use in the Democratic Republic of Congo), hepatitis B virus, influenza A, malaria, and others.

28802,"Henlius Reports the NMPA's Acceptance of IND for HLX14 (biosimilar, denosumab)",Henlius Received Acceptance Notification for Clinical Trial Application from NMPA for its Denosumab Biosimilar HLX14,"The NMPA has accepted the IND for HLX14, a biosimilar referencing Prolia, indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture
 HLX14 is developed in harmony with biosimilar guidelines and was highly similar to the reference product in preclinical pharmacology, toxicology and PK studies
 Henlius has a robust biosimilar portfolio which includes HLX01 (the first approved biosimilar in China) and HLX03 (adalimumab, biosimilar) & HLX02 (trastuzumab, biosimilar) which are currently under NMPA’s priority review. The development of HLX14 will boost Henlius’ portfolio to cover multiple disease areas","Shanghai, China, March 9, 2020 – Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. (2696.HK) announced that an investigational new drug (IND) application has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for HLX14, a Denosumab biosimilar independently developed by Henlius, indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.
HLX14 can prevent RANKL/RANK mediated bone-related diseases

HLX14, a recombinant anti-RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) human monoclonal antibody (mAb) injection, is a biosimilar of Denosumab (Trade Name: Prolia®) developed in accordance with Biosimilar Guidelines. HLX14 can specifically bind to RANKL and block the interaction between RANKL and RANK, which is expressed on the surface of osteoclasts, thus inhibiting RANKL/RANK-mediated differentiation, maturation and activation of osteoclasts, thereby reducing bone resorption and the incidence of skeletal-related events[1].
Several studies have shown the similarity between HLX14 and its original drug

Currently, the original drug of HLX14, Denosumab has been approved in the United States and the European Union, for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, as well as for the treatment of patients with giant cell tumor of bone and patients with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Denosumab can increase the bone density and reduce the risk of fracture for these patient populations. In China, Denosumab has already been approved to treat giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, while the other indications like osteoporosis have not been approved. Developed in accordance with Biosimilar Guidelines and via step-by-step comparison , HLX14 was proved to be in high similarity with Denosumab in preclinical pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies.
Increasing medical needs endow HLX14 a broad market prospect

Nowadays, the serious problem of osteoporosis is arising throughout the world. Among all countries, China has the largest population that is suffering from osteoporosis, which mainly occurs in postmenopausal women and elderly people[2]. Health problems caused by osteoporosis, like facture, can result in significant loss of quality of life. Nonetheless, the percentage of patients with osteoporosis that have received standardized treatment is relatively low. With the increasing patient number and improved diagnosis of osteoporosis in China, the huge unmet medical needs in the treatment of osteoporosis are urgently to be addressed[3].
The original drug of HLX14, Denosumab, can also be used in the treatment of bone metastasis from solid tumors. Bone is a frequent site of metastases in cancer patients, but the overall incidence of bone metastasis is not known. The relative incidence of bone metastasis by type of tumor, in patients with advanced metastatic disease, is: 65-75% in BC; 65-75% in prostate; 60% in thyroid; 30-40% in lung; 40% in bladder; 20-25% in renal cell carcinoma and 14-45% in melanoma[4]. Another indication of Denosumab is giant cell tumor of bone, which is a benign but usually aggressive neoplasm of bone[5]. Globally, giant cell tumor accounts for 4% to 5% of primary bone tumors[6]. Compared with western population, the incidence of giant cell tumor is relatively higher in Chinese population, accounting for 20% of primary bone tumors[7]. Despite the fact that most giant cell tumors are benign, without proper treatment, they often causes serious damage of the affected bone and can finally result in bone fracture, joint dysfunction or even amputation.
The development of HLX14 expands Henlius’ portfolio to cover more disease areas
Henlius actively implements its product development strategy and the product portfolio covers several advanced mAb biosimilar candidates with near-term commercialization possibility. Following HLX01(汉利康), the first approved biosimilar in China, HLX03 (adalimumab injection) and HLX02 (trastuzumab for injection) are now having their NDA under priority review by the NMPA. Remarkably, the Marketing Authorization Application for HLX02, the first biosimilar developed in China to enter a global multi-center phase 3 clinical trial, was accepted to review by EMA in June 2019. The development of HLX14 is an active attempt of Henlius in advancing forward products in the field of osteoporosis and will help the company to further expand portfolio to cover more disease areas.
On top of biosimilar, Henlius has built an extensive pipeline in bio-innovative and combination therapy. While quickly driving clinical studies of novel products in different countries and areas, Henlius is also actively diversifying versatile in-house combination therapy portfolio with a focus on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs to capture future immuno-oncology opportunities. Looking forward, Henlius will continue to advance the development of innovative biologics by virtue of its established and integrated innovation platform, underscoring its long-term commitment to providing affordable and effective therapies for patients worldwide.

28809,Teva's Ajovy (fremanezumab) Receives NICE Positive Recommendation for Prevention of Migraine in Adults,Positive Recommendation by NICE for first anti-CGRP migraine therapy: AJOVY (fremanezumab),"NICE has recommended Ajovy in its final appraisal document (FAD) to prevent migraine in patients with chronic migraine who have not responded to at least three prior preventive drug treatments
 The recommendation is based on a dossier submitted to NICE for a single technology appraisal (STA). Following the issuance of the FAD, NICE will provide its formal guidance to the NHS
 Ajovy is the first and only anti-CGRP therapy, approved in the US and EU, indicated for the treatment of migraine, offering both quarterly and monthly dosing options and is currently under development in Japan by Otsuka, in accordance with a 2017 licensing agreement signed b/w the companies","March 12, 2020 03:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
TEL AVIV, Israel–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Teva Pharmaceutical Europe BV an affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) today announced that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended AJOVY (fremanezumab) in its Final Appraisal Document (FAD) for the prevention of migraine in adults with chronic migraine. NICE recommends AJOVY® for chronic migraine patients who have not responded to at least three prior preventive drug treatments.
“NICE’s decision to approve the use of AJOVY® on the NHS in England and Wales for patients with chronic migraine is fantastic news”

Tweet this

AJOVY® is one of several monoclonal antibodies specifically designed to target the CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) pathway, a key contributor to migraine and is the first anti-CGRP preventive therapy approved by NICE. AJOVY ® is a long-acting treatment that offers monthly or quarterly dosing options and can be self-injected. 1
Until the anti-CGRPs were approved, migraine preventive therapies in Europe were limited and none of the commonly used treatments (anti-epileptics, anti-depressants, beta blockers and botulinum toxin injections) were developed specifically to target the molecular pathways of migraine.2
“NICE’s decision to approve the use of AJOVY® on the NHS in England and Wales for patients with chronic migraine is fantastic news,” comments Dr Mark Weatherall, President of the British Association for the Study of Headache. “Anyone who looks after people with chronic migraine understands just how debilitating this neurological disorder can be. We have waited a long time for this new class of drug to be made available in the NHS, but now that we can prescribe fremanezumab, I am excited to see what a difference it will make to the lives of many of my worst affected patients,” said Dr Mark Weatherall, President of the British Association for the Study of Headache.
Migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated in at least 50% of all patients. Less than 50% of people with migraine are not recognized by their general practitioner and less than 30% of migraine patients have management of their disease.3 Migraine typically presents as a moderate to severe throbbing headache, often accompanied by nausea and/or vomiting, with sensitivity to noise, light and/or smell.4
It is estimated that 1 in 7 adults are affected by migraine and women are three times more likely to be affected than men.5 Chronic migraine, defined as 15 or more headache days and at least 8 migraine days per month for more than three months, is estimated to affect around 900,000 6.7 of the adult population in the UK and can have a tremendous impact on quality of life. With 15% of people affected, Europe has the highest percentage of people with migraine of all continents. 8
NICE recommends AJOVY® for chronic migraine patients who have not responded to at least three prior preventive drug treatments. This decision is based on a dossier submitted to NICE for a Single Technology Appraisal (STA). Following issuance of the FAD, NICE will provide its formal guidance to the NHS in England. The full NICE recommendations and conditions can be viewed on their website.
Richard Daniell, Executive Vice President European Commercial, Teva: “This is an important decision to help the lives of migraine patients in England and signifies a recognition of the impact of this disease. Patients’ lives and choices are limited by their migraine. We are proud that Teva’s AJOVY® is the first anti-CGRP preventive therapy that NICE has considered to demonstrate cost-effectiveness leading to a reimbursement decision. In time we hope that this treatment becomes available for all adult chronic migraine patients across Europe.”

28815,AstraZeneca's Calquence (acalabrutinib) Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Treat Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) in Adults,Calquence granted US Breakthrough Therapy Designation for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"The FDA’s BT Designation is based on the P-III ELEVATE-TN assessing Calquence (100 mg, bid) as monothx or in combination with obinutuzumab vs chlorambucil + obinutuzumab and in 535 patients in ratio (1:1:1) in previously untreated patients with CLL and in another P-III ASCEND Trial (ACE-CL-309) involves assessing of Calquence (310 mg) vs rituximab + idelalisib/ bendamustine in 310 patients in ratio (1:1) with previously untreated patients with CLL
 The two P-III trials ELEVATE-TN and ASCEND trials resulted in positive data showed increased the time patients lived without disease progression or death, with safety and tolerability that was consistent with its established profile and will serve as the foundation for regulatory submissions later this year
 Calquence (acalabrutinib) is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor and is developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinaemia, FL, and MM and other haematologic malignancies","Designation based on positive results from two Phase III trials
AstraZeneca today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for Calquence (acalabrutinib) as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), one of the most common types of leukaemia in adults.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “This is an important regulatory milestone for our work in haematology and for patients living with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a life-threatening disease. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation acknowledges the growing body of evidence that supports Calquence as a highly-selective Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the potential to offer patients a new, differentiated, chemotherapy-free treatment option with a favourable safety profile.”
The FDA granted the BTD based on positive results from the interim analyses of the ELEVATE-TN and ASCEND Phase III clinical trials. Together the trials showed that Calquence alone or in combination significantly increased the time patients lived without disease progression or death, with safety and tolerability that was consistent with its established profile.
This is the 10th BTD that AstraZeneca has received from the FDA since 2014. An FDA BTD is designed to accelerate the development and regulatory review of new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and that have shown encouraging early clinical results which may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically-significant endpoint over currently-available medicines.
Calquence is currently approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the US, Brazil, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Argentina and recently Singapore and is being developed for the treatment of CLL and other blood cancers. The positive results from both the ELEVATE-TN and ASCEND trials will serve as the foundation for regulatory submissions later this year.
About ELEVATE-TN
ELEVATE-TN (ACE-CL-007) is a randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Calquence alone or in combination with obinutuzumab vs. chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab in previously-untreated patients with CLL. In the trial, 535 patients were randomised (1:1:1) into three arms. Patients in the first arm received chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the second arm received Calquence (100mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) in combination with obinutuzumab. Patients in the third arm received Calquence monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).2
The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) in the Calquence and obinutuzumab arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm, assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), and a key secondary endpoint is IRC-assessed PFS in the Calquence monotherapy arm compared to the chlorambucil and obinutuzumab arm. Other secondary endpoints include objective response rate, time to next treatment and overall survival.2
About ASCEND
ASCEND (ACE-CL-309) is a global, randomised, multicentre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of Calquence in previously-treated patients with CLL.2 In the trial, 310 patients were randomised (1:1) into two arms. Patients in the first arm received Calquence monotherapy (100mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). Patients in the second arm received physician’s choice of either rituximab in combination with idelalisib or rituximab in combination with bendamustine.3,4
The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by an IRC, and key secondary endpoints include physician-assessed PFS, IRC- and physician-assessed overall response rate and duration of response, as well as overall survival, patient-reported outcomes and time to next treatment.3,4
About Calquence
Calquence (acalabrutinib) was granted accelerated approval by the US FDA in October 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Calquence is an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). Calquence binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.5 In beta (B) cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.
As part of an extensive clinical development programme, AstraZeneca and Acerta Pharma are currently evaluating Calquence in 26 company-sponsored clinical trials. Calquence is being developed for the treatment of multiple B-cell blood cancers including CLL, MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinaemia, follicular lymphoma, and multiple myeloma and other haematologic malignancies. Several Phase III clinical trials in CLL are ongoing, including ASCEND, ELEVATE-TN, ELEVATE-RR (ACE-CL-006) evaluating acalabrutinib vs. ibrutinib in patients with previously-treated high-risk CLL, and ACE-CL-311 evaluating acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax and with/without obinutuzumab in patients with previously-untreated CLL without 17p deletion or TP53 mutation.
About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is one of the most common type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 105,000 new cases globally and 20,720 new cases in the US annually, and prevalence that is expected to grow with improved treatment.1,6,7,8 In CLL, too many blood stem cells in the bone marrow become abnormal lymphocytes and these abnormal cells have difficulty fighting infections.1 As the number of abnormal cells grows there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.1 This could result in anaemia, infection and bleeding.1 B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.
About AstraZeneca in haematology
Leveraging its strength in oncology, AstraZeneca has established haematology as one of four key oncology disease areas of focus. The Company’s haematology franchise includes two US FDA-approved medicines and a robust global development programme for a broad portfolio of potential blood cancer treatments.

Additionally, the company gets right to commercialize SII-manufactured vaccine in high-income countries, primarily in the travelers and military vaccine markets
 SII gets access to utilize Novavax’s Matrix-M vaccine adjuvant with its malaria vaccine candidate (R21 malaria vaccine), licensed from the Jenner Institute at Oxford University in 2017
 R21 malaria vaccine along with Matrix-M is currently being evaluated in P-IIb study to target Plasmodium falciparum-induced malaria with its expected results to be reported in Q2’20","Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M vaccine adjuvant enhances immune response of malaria antigen developed at Jenner Institute at Oxford University
Phase 2b clinical efficacy study of experimental malaria vaccine with Matrix‑M nearing completion in Burkina Faso
GAITHERSBURG, Md., March 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, and Serum Institute of India (SII) today announced a commercial license agreement for the use of Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M™ vaccine adjuvant with SII’s malaria vaccine candidate. SII licensed the R21 malaria vaccine, which targets the most severe plasmodium falciparum-induced malaria disease, from the Jenner Institute at Oxford University in 2017. Matrix-M is a key component in the malaria vaccine candidate, currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial sponsored by the Jenner Institute, with top-line data expected to be reported in the second quarter of 2020.

Under the terms of the agreement, SII is granted rights to use Matrix-M in the vaccine in regions where the disease is endemic and will pay Novavax royalties on its market sales of the vaccine. Matrix-M will be manufactured and supplied to SII by Novavax AB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novavax based in Uppsala, Sweden.

In addition, as part of the arrangement, Novavax has gained the rights to sell and distribute the SII-manufactured vaccine in high-income countries, primarily in the travelers and military vaccine markets.

Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, is leading the clinical studies of the experimental vaccine, which was created using the R21 malaria antigen combined with Matrix-M. He commented, “It has proven very challenging to develop a vaccine against malaria and many different approaches have been tested. After a thorough evaluation of several adjuvants pre-clinically many years ago, we selected Matrix-M for this program based on the strong immune responses elicited in those preclinical studies. Multiple clinical trials sponsored by the Jenner Institute have now confirmed these immunogenicity results. The current Phase 2b efficacy trial represents an important opportunity to test the efficacy of a malaria vaccine using the potent Matrix-M adjuvant in infants in an endemic setting.”

“Novavax’ next-generation adjuvant, Matrix-M, is an impressive and critical component in this much-needed malaria vaccine,” said Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer of Serum Institute of India. “This will be an important long-term partnership in advancing an innovative potential malaria vaccine and while we have much work to do, this marks a key step forward.”

“As the world’s largest vaccine producer in terms of doses delivered, Serum Institute of India is the ideal partner to ensure that an improved malaria vaccine ultimately reaches the many millions of individuals at risk in areas where malaria is endemic,” said Stanley C. Erck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novavax. “This agreement highlights our mutual confidence in Matrix-M’s ability to induce a strong immune response that will ultimately increase vaccine effectiveness.”

About Malaria

Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by at least four different parasites that are found on certain types of mosquitos. Plasmodium falciparum, the most severe of these parasites, causes the type of malaria that is most likely to result in severe infections and, if not promptly treated, can lead to death. There are approximately 2,000 annual cases of malaria diagnosed in the U.S.; the vast majority of which are in travelers and immigrants returning from endemic parts of the world where malaria transmission occurs.

Globally, the World Health Organization estimated that in 2018, over 200 million clinical cases of malaria occurred, resulting in over 400,000 deaths, mostly children in Africa.1 Globally, malaria is the one of the leading causes of death in children younger than age five years.

About Matrix-M™

Matrix-M™ is Novavax’ next-generation saponin-based adjuvant, powered by a novel formulation that provides a potent and well-tolerated adjuvant effect. Saponins are steroid or triterpenoid glycosides, which occur in many plant species. In Matrix-M, purified saponin fractions are mixed with synthetic cholesterol and a phospholipid to form stable particles than can be readily formulated with a variety of vaccine antigens. Saponin-based adjuvants act in part by stimulating the entry of antigen-presenting cells into the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation in the local lymph nodes. Matrix-M has the ability to stimulate cell-mediated immunity as well as to enhance antibody production; and importantly, when facing rapidly emerging diseases such as those caused by coronaviruses, Ebola virus or pandemic influenza, they can allow immune responses to be achieved with much lower doses of antigen, known as “dose-sparing.” Matrix-M also increases the opportunity for longer-lasting immunity, which may reduce the number of vaccinations needed to gain optimal protection.

Novavax’ past experience with saponin-based adjuvants in both animals and humans indicates that, like all adjuvants, they increase the local reaction at the injection site. However, those local reactions are transient and there is no evidence of longer-term adverse effects. Matrix-M has been evaluated in several Novavax vaccine candidates, including Novavax’ Phase 3 NanoFlu™ vaccine for influenza in older adults, and is expected to be included in Novavax’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which is expected to go into clinical trials in spring of 2020.

 Selumetinib is a MEK 1/2 inhibitor also received the US FDA’s ODD to treat NF1 in Feb 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in Aug 2018. In 2017, AstraZeneca and MSD signed a co-development and co-commercialisation agreement for selumetinib","Designation based on Phase II SPRINT trial in
paediatric patients with NF1 plexiform neurofibromas
Selumetinib is a MEK 1/2 Inhibitor being co-developed by AstraZeneca and MSD
AstraZeneca and MSD, Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for the MEK 1/2 inhibitor and potential new medicine selumetinib.
This designation is for the treatment of paediatric patients aged three years and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) symptomatic and/or progressive, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN), a rare, incurable genetic condition.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Oncology, said: “Selumetinib shows promise in the treatment of NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas, a rare and debilitating disease with no approved medications to date. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation acknowledges the significant unmet need of these patients and the potential benefit of selumetinib in this setting.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, at MSD Research Laboratories, said: “This new designation validates our ongoing development of selumetinib. As a result of this, selumetinib has the potential to receive expedited regulatory review and we hope to bring this medicine to patients as soon as possible.”
The BTD is based on Phase II data from the SPRINT trial, testing selumetinib as an oral monotherapy in paediatric patients, aged three years or older with inoperable NF1-related PN. The results of the trial were presented by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.
This is the ninth BTD that AstraZeneca has received from the FDA since 2014. BTD is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and that have shown encouraging early clinical results, which may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically-significant endpoint over available medicines.
Selumetinib was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NF1 by the US FDA in February 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in August 2018.
Selumetinib is a MEK 1/2 inhibitor and potential new medicine licensed by AstraZeneca from Array BioPharma Inc. in 2003. AstraZeneca and MSD entered a co-development and co-commercialisation agreement for selumetinib in 2017.
The NF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin, which negatively regulates the RAS/MAPK pathway, helping to control cell growth, differentiation and survival. Mutations in the NF1 gene may result in dysregulations in RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling, which can cause cells to grow, divide and copy themselves in an uncontrolled manner, and may result in tumour growth. Selumetinib inhibits the MEK enzyme in this pathway, potentially leading to inhibition of tumour growth.
Selumetinib is being assessed as a monotherapy and in combination with other treatments in ongoing trials.
About SPRINT
The SPRINT trial is a US Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) NCI-sponsored Phase I/II trial. The Phase I trial was designed to identify the optimal Phase II dosing regimen, and the results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.1
About NF1
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an incurable genetic condition that affects one in 3,000 to 4,000 individuals.2,3 It is caused by a spontaneous or inherited mutation in the NF1 gene and is associated with many symptoms, including soft lumps on and under the skin (cutaneous neurofibromas), skin pigmentation (so-called ‘cafe au lait’ spots) and, in 20-50% of patients, tumours develop on the nerve sheaths (plexiform neurofibromas). These plexiform neurofibromas can cause clinical issues such as pain, motor dysfunction, airway dysfunction, bowel/bladder dysfunction and disfigurement as well as having the potential to transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST).
People with NF1 may experience a number of complications such as learning difficulties, visual impairment, twisting and curvature of the spine, high blood pressure, and epilepsy. NF1 also increases a person’s risk of developing other cancers, including malignant brain tumours, MPNST and leukaemia. Symptoms begin during early childhood, with varying degrees of severity, and can reduce life expectancy by up to 15 years.4
About the AstraZeneca and MSD Strategic Oncology Collaboration
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza (olaparib), the world’s first PARP inhibitor and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

28831,F2G's Olorofim Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Treat Invasive Mold Infections in Patients with Limited or No Treatment Options,F2G Receives US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Olorofim,"The BT designation follows the P-IIb Trial in patients with IFD or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) and either refractory disease, resistance, or intolerance to available agents
 The study resulted in well tolerable results across more than 10 years of patient dosing days with a median therapy duration of 12 wks.
 Olorofim is first antifungal agent targeted to treat invasive fungal mold infections such as azole-resistant aspergillosis, scedosporiosis, lomentosporiosis, and other rare mold infections and is being developed as IV and oral formulation","MANCHESTER, England and VIENNA, F2G Ltd, a UK- and Austria-based biotech company developing novel therapies for life-threatening systemic fungal infections, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to its lead first-in-class candidate, olorofim (formerly F901318) for the indication of ‘Treatment of invasive mold infections in patients with limited or no treatment options, including aspergillosis refractory or intolerant to currently available therapy, and infections due to Lomentospora prolificans, Scedosporium, and Scopulariopsis species’. Olorofim is the first antifungal agent to be granted Breakthrough Therapy designation.
Olorofim is currently being investigated in an open-label single-arm Phase 2b study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03583164) in patients with proven invasive fungal disease (IFD) or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) and either refractory disease, resistance, or intolerance to available agents. Olorofim has been well tolerated across more than 10 years of patient dosing days with a median therapy duration of 12 weeks. Preliminary data from this study were provided to the FDA as part of the Breakthrough Therapy designation submission.
Breakthrough Therapy designation is an FDA process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and is granted based on preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
Breakthrough Therapy designation conveys all the features of fast track designation, more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organisational commitment by FDA to involve senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.
Commenting on the news, Ian Nicholson, CEO of F2G Ltd, said: 
“The granting of FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is a truly transformational step for our company and will support our goal of rapidly developing this novel treatment for patients suffering from serious and life-threatening fungal infections. Olorofim acts via a novel and differentiated mechanism to traditional antifungals, and preliminary data have indicated that it is efficacious in tackling life-threatening invasive fungal infections that cannot be managed with currently approved agents.
“Our Phase 2b programme is on track with over 40 patients recruited in Europe, Australia and the US. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to accelerate development of this therapy for patients having limited or no approved treatment options for an invasive mold infection.”
Professor Sharon Chen, Westmead Hospital Sydney and Principal Investigator for the Phase 2b study said:
“This news is very exciting for clinicians caring for patients with these very serious, and devastating mold infections. We have had limited treatment options for many years and now the news about olorofim brings realistic hope that we can cure these previously treatment–refractory infections.”
About Olorofim / Clinical trial
The Phase 2b study for olorofim (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03583164) is a global open-label study in patients who have limited treatment options for difficult-to-treat invasive fungal mold infections such as azole-resistant aspergillosis, scedosporiosis, lomentosporiosis, and other rare mold infections. 26 centres are currently open in six countries (AU, BE, ES, NL, USA, IS) and a further 20 will open in 2019/2020. Olorofim is being developed both as IV and oral formulations.
About F2G
F2G is a world-leading UK- and Austria-based biotech company (F2G Ltd and F2G Biotech GmbH) focused on the discovery and development of novel therapies to treat life-threatening invasive fungal infections. F2G has discovered and developed a completely new class of antifungal agents called the orotomides. The orotomides selectively target fungal dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. This is a completely different mechanism from that of the currently marketed antifungal agents and gives the orotomides fungicidal activity against a broad range of rare and resistant fungal mold infections. Olorofim (formerly, F901318) is F2G’s leading candidate from this class and is in a Phase 2b open-label study focussing on rare and resistant invasive fungal infections such as aspergillosis (including azole-resistant strains), scedosporiosis (including lomentosporiosis). Olorofim has received orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive scedosporiosis. Olorofim is being developed both as IV and oral formulations. www.f2g.com

28834,AbbVie's Dual Regimen Receives EC's Approval for Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,AbbVie Receives European Commission Approval of VENCLYXTO Combination Regimen for Patients with Previously-Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,"The approval is based on P-III CLL14 study assessing Venclyxto (venetoclax) + obinutuzumab vs obinutuzumab + chlorambucil in 432 patients with previously untreated CLL and coexisting medical condition
 The P-III CLL14 study results: median follow up @28mos. superior PFS; @40mos. median PFS had not been reached (35.6mos.); @36mos. PFS (81.9% vs 49.5%) @1yr. patients experienced deep response as measured by higher rates of undetectable MRD or CR
 Venclyxto is a first-in-class therapy targeting BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis and has received a CHMP’s positive opinion for MAA in combination with obinutuzumab to treat CLL in Jan’2020","VENCLYXTO® plus obinutuzumab is the first chemotherapy-free, fixed-duration combination regimen approved by the European Commission (EC) for patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
– Approval is based on data from the Phase 3 CLL14 trial, which showed that patients treated with obinutuzumab plus one year of treatment with VENCLYXTO had superior progression-free survival (PFS) and higher rates of undetectable minimal residual disease compared to patients receiving a standard of care chemoimmunotherapy regimen of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil[1],[5]
NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., March 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, announced today that the European Commission (EC) has approved VENCLYXTO® (venetoclax) in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who were previously untreated. The approval is valid in all 27 member states of the EU, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and the United Kingdom.
“This approval underscores the growing utility of VENCLYXTO in treating CLL and demonstrates its clinical benefit as a chemotherapy-free combination therapy option for CLL patients in Europe who have not yet been treated,” said Neil Gallagher, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and vice president of development. “We look forward to bringing VENCLYXTO to even more patients who can potentially benefit from achieving a deep response and sustained progression free survival, with the added benefit of a finite treatment duration.”
This is the third approval for VENCLYXTO, a first-in-class B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor. BCL-2 is a protein that prevents cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis, the process that leads to the natural death or self-destruction of cancer cells. VENCLYXTO is also approved in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy, and as a monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence or absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.
This most recent approval is based on results from the Phase 3 CLL14 clinical trial primary analysis (median follow up of 28 months), which demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS; the time on treatment without disease progression or death) as assessed by investigators in patients treated with VENCLYXTO plus obinutuzumab compared to patients who received a standard of care chemotherapy regimen of chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (hazard ratio 0.35; 95% CI (0.23,0.53), p<0.0001, medians not yet reached). At an updated CLL14 efficacy analysis (median follow-up of 40 months), the median PFS had not been reached in the VENCLYXTO + obinutuzumab arm and was 35.6 months [95% CI: 33.7,40.7] in the obinutuzumab + chlorambucil arm (hazard ratio 0.31; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.44). The 36-month PFS estimate in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab arm was 81.9% [95% CI: 76.5, 87.3] and in the obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil arm was 49.5% [95% CI: 42.4, 56.6]. Additionally, after completing one year of treatment, patients treated with the VENCLYXTO combination experienced deep response as measured by higher rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) or complete response (CR) as compared to patients receiving a standard of care regimen.1,5
In the trial, adverse events (AEs) were consistent with the known safety profiles of venetoclax and obinutuzumab alone. At least one AE of any grade occurred in 94.3% of patients in the venetoclax combination arm. The most common Grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia and infections. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) was reported in three patients in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab group (all during treatment with obinutuzumab and before venetoclax).1
“CLL is the most common of the nearly 95,000 new cases of leukemia in Europe each year, and chemotherapy is often the first line of treatment,” said Michael Hallek, M.D., lead investigator of the CLL14 study, director of the Department of Internal Medicine and Center of Integrated Oncology at the University Hospital Cologne in Germany, and head of the German CLL Study Group. “Having the option to utilize a first-line, chemotherapy-free treatment combination that can produce a deep response, thus allowing patients to stop treatment, will change the way we treat CLL and have a significant impact on patients.”
In January 2020, AbbVie announced that the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted a positive opinion for the Marketing Authorization Application for VENCLYXTO plus obinutuzumab for the treatment of patients with previously untreated CLL.
VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.
About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
CLL is a slow-growing form of leukemia, or blood cancer, in which too many immature lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are found predominantly in the blood and bone marrow. In 2018, approximately 95,000 new cases of leukemia were diagnosed in Europe.2 CLL is the most common form of leukemia in the Western Hemisphere, accounting for approximately one third of new leukemia diagnoses.3,4
About the CLL14 Trial
The randomized, multicenter, open-label, actively controlled Phase 3 CLL14 trial, which was conducted in close collaboration with the German CLL Study Group (DCLLSG), evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combined regimen of VENCLYXTO and obinutuzumab (n=216) versus obinutuzumab and chlorambucil (n=216) in patients with previously-untreated CLL and coexisting medical conditions (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score >6 or creatinine clearance <70 mL/min). The therapies were administered for a fixed duration of 12 cycles for VENCLYXTO in combination with six cycles of obinutuzumab. Cycles were comprised of 28 days. The trial enrolled 432 patients, all of whom were diagnosed according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria and were previously untreated. The primary efficacy outcome was PFS as assessed by the investigator.1 Key secondary endpoints were MRD-negativity in peripheral blood and bone marrow, and overall and complete response rates.1
About VENCLYXTO® (venetoclax tablets)
VENCLYXTO® is a first-in-class medicine that selectively binds and inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein. In some blood cancers and other cancerous tumors, BCL-2 builds up and prevents cancer cells from undergoing their natural death or self-destruction process, which is called apoptosis. VENCLYXTO targets the BCL-2 protein and works to restore the process of apoptosis.
VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Roche. It is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. Together, the companies are committed to BCL-2 research and to studying venetoclax in clinical trials across several blood and other cancers.
VENCLYXTO is approved in more than 50 countries, including the U.S. AbbVie and Roche are currently working with regulatory agencies around the world to bring this medicine to additional eligible patients in need.
VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) EU Indication and Summary of Important Safety Information5
Indication
Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL:
in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B‑cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or
in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B‑cell receptor pathway inhibitor.
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is contraindicated. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during the dose-titration phase due to increased risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Concomitant use of preparations containing St. John’s wort as VENCLYXTO efficacy may be reduced.
Special Warnings & Precautions for Use
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal events, has occurred in patients with previously treated CLL with high tumour burden when treated with VENCLYXTO. VENCLYXTO poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week dose-titration phase. Changes in electrolytes consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLYXTO and at each dose increase. Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis for TLS. Blood chemistries should be monitored, and abnormalities managed promptly. More intensive measures (including IV hydration, frequent monitoring and hospitalization) should be employed as overall risk increases.
Neutropenia (grade 3 or 4) has been reported and complete blood counts should be monitored throughout the treatment period. Serious infections including events of sepsis with fatal outcome have been reported. Patients require monitoring of signs and symptoms of infection and prompt treatment. Supportive measures including antimicrobials for any signs of infection should be considered.
Live vaccines should not be administered during treatment or thereafter until B-cell recovery.
Drug Interactions
CYP3A inhibitors may increase VENCLYXTO plasma concentrations. At initiation and dose-titration phase: Strong CYP3A inhibitors are contraindicated due to increased risk for TLS and moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be used, physicians should refer to the SmPC for dose adjustment recommendations. At steady daily dose: If moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors must be used, physicians should refer to the SmPC for dose adjustment recommendations.
CYP3A4 inducers may decrease VENCLYXTO plasma concentrations.
Avoid coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. These agents may decrease venetoclax plasma concentrations.
Co-administration of bile acid sequestrants with VENCLYXTO is not recommended as this may reduce the absorption of VENCLYXTO.
Adverse Reactions
The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax in the combination studies with obinutuzumab or rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract infection. In the monotherapy studies, the most common adverse reactions were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection.
The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (≥2%) in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab were pneumonia, sepsis febrile neutropenia, and TLS. In the monotherapy studies, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were pneumonia and febrile neutropenia.
Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients treated with venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab in the CLL14 and MURANO studies, respectively. In the monotherapy studies with venetoclax, 11% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions.
Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab in the CLL14 study, in 15% of patients treated with the combination of venetoclax and rituximab in the MURANO study and 14% of patients treated with venetoclax in the monotherapy studies.
Specific Populations
Patients with reduced renal function (CrCl <80 mL/min) may require more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring to reduce the risk of TLS. Safety in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) or on dialysis has not been established, and a recommended dose for these patients has not been determined. VENCLYXTO should be administered to patients with severe renal impairment only if the benefit outweighs the risk and patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity due to increased risk of TLS.
For patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction of at least 50% throughout treatment is recommended.
VENCLYXTO may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment. Advise nursing women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment.

28849,Bayer's Aliqopa (copanlisib) Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Treat Marginal Zone Lymphoma in Adults,Bayer Receives U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) for the Treatment of Marginal Zone Lymphoma,"The BT Designation is based on the P-II CHRONOS-1 study which involves assessing of 25 patients with relapsed or refractory MZL who have received at least two prior therapies
 The study resulted in ORR of overall iNHL population (n=142) was 59.2%, while the MZL patients (23%), @18 mos. ORR (60.6% and 78.3%) in FAS population and MZL histology
 Aliqopa is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with inhibitory activity against PI3K-α and PI3K-δ isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. Additionally, Bayer is conducting two P-III studies CHRONOS-3 and CHRONOS-4 evaluating the safety and efficacy of Aliqopa","WHIPPANY, N.J., May 29, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Bayer announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least two prior therapies. MZL is an indolent form of non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (iNHL) and accounts for about 10% of all non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in the U.S.1
The Breakthrough Therapy Designation was granted based on data from the MZL subgroup of the pivotal Phase II CHRONOS-1 study, which is the trial that accelerated the U.S. FDA approval of Aliqopa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) – the most common histological subtype of iNHL – who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate (ORR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
Aliqopa is an intravenous phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor with inhibitory activity predominantly against the PI3K-alpha and PI3K-delta isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. The compound is currently not approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or other authorities outside of the U.S.
“The clinical evidence suggests that Aliqopa may address an unmet medical need by providing physicians and MZL patients with a therapy in a relapsed setting,” said Dr. Scott Z. Fields, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology Development at Bayer’s Pharmaceutical Division. “We will continue working closely with the FDA in order to bring Aliqopa to these underserved patients as soon as possible.”
The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drug candidates that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapies.2
Bayer is conducting two additional Phase III studies – CHRONOS-3 and CHRONOS-4 – to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aliqopa in combination with other therapies for those with iNHL (including MZL) who have relapsed following one or more prior therapies. 
Clinical Evidence for Aliqopa in Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) In the Phase II study 16439 part B (CHRONOS-1), Aliqopa showed preliminary efficacy in indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (iNHL) patients including 23 patients with relapsed or refractory MZL, who have received at least two prior therapies. At the primary analysis, the overall response rate (ORR) of overall iNHL population (n=142) was 59.2%, while MZL patients was 69.6% (n=23). An 18 month follow-up analysis of CHRONOS-1 showed an ORR in the full analysis set (FAS) population of 60.6% and in the MZL histology an ORR of 78.3% (n=23). The most common treatment emergent adverse events (experienced by greater than or equal to 20% of the MZL subgroup) were hyperglycemia and fatigue (47.8%), hypertension and diarrhea (43.5%), nausea (26.1%), pyrexia and cough (21.7%). The most common worst Grade 3 TEAEs were hypertension (39.1%) and hyperglycemia (34.8%).
About MZL MZL is an indolent form of non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (iNHL) and accounts for about 10% of all non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in the U.S.1 Typically chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy are often chosen for the treatment of MZL. While initial therapies are often successful, there continues to be an unmet need for relapsed (advanced) MZL.
About Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) Injection3 Aliqopa (copanlisib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.
Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
Aliqopa is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K-α and PI3K-δ isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. Aliqopa has been shown to induce tumor cell death by apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of primary malignant B cell lines. Aliqopa inhibits several key cell-signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor signaling, CXCR12 mediated chemotaxis of malignant B cells, and NFκB signaling in lymphoma cell lines.
The broad clinical development program for copanlisib also includes ongoing Phase III studies in indolent NHL (iNHL) patients who have relapsed or are refractory to prior therapies. The CHRONOS-3 Phase III study is evaluating copanlisib in combination with rituximab in relapsed iNHL and the CHRONOS-4 Phase III study is evaluating copanlisib in combination with standard immunochemotherapy in relapsed iNHL. More information about these trials can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Important Safety Information for Aliqopa (copanlisib) Injection
Infections: Serious, including fatal, infections occurred in 19% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. The most common serious infection was pneumonia. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and withhold ALIQOPA for Grade 3 and higher infection.
Serious pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) infection occurred in 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Before initiating treatment with ALIQOPA, consider PJP prophylaxis for populations at risk. Withhold ALIQOPA in patients with suspected PJP infection of any grade. If confirmed, treat infection until resolution, then resume ALIQOPA at previous dose with concomitant PJP prophylaxis.
Hyperglycemia: Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (blood glucose 250 mg/dL or greater) occurred in 41% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious hyperglycemic events occurred in 2.8% of patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels typically peaked 5 to 8 hours post-infusion and subsequently declined to baseline levels for a majority of patients; blood glucose levels remained elevated in 17.7% of patients one day after ALIQOPA infusion. Of 155 patients with baseline HbA1c <5.7%, 16 (10%) patients had HbA1c >6.5% at the end of treatment.
Of the twenty patients with diabetes mellitus treated in CHRONOS-1, seven developed Grade 4 hyperglycemia and two discontinued treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus should only be treated with ALIQOPA following adequate glucose control and should be monitored closely. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia.
Achieve optimal blood glucose control before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia.
Hypertension: Grade 3 hypertension (systolic 160 mmHg or greater or diastolic 100 mmHg or greater) occurred in 26% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious hypertensive events occurred in 0.9% of 317 patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hypertension. The mean change of systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 2 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 was 16.8 mmHg and 7.8 mmHg,
respectively. The mean BP started decreasing approximately 2 hours post-infusion; BP remained elevated for 6 to 8 hours after the start of the ALIQOPA infusion. Optimal BP control should be achieved before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Monitor BP pre- and post-infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hypertension.
Non-infectious Pneumonitis: Non-infectious pneumonitis occurred in 5% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Withhold ALIQOPA and conduct a diagnostic examination of a patient who is experiencing pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exam. Patients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by ALIQOPA have been managed by withholding ALIQOPA and administration of systemic corticosteroids. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of non-infectious pneumonitis.
Neutropenia: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 24% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious neutropenic events occurred in 1.3%. Monitor blood counts at least weekly during treatment with ALIQOPA. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of neutropenia.
Severe Cutaneous Reaction: Grade 3 and 4 cutaneous reactions occurred in 2.8% and 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy respectively. Serious cutaneous reaction events were reported in 0.9%. The reported events included dermatitis exfoliative, exfoliative rash, pruritus, and rash (including maculo-papular rash). Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of severe cutaneous reactions.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of copanlisib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rats at maternal doses as low as 0.75 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m2/day body surface area) corresponding to approximately 12% the recommended dose for patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.
Adverse Drug Reactions: Serious adverse reactions were reported in 44 (26%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were pneumonia (8%), pneumonitis (5%) and hyperglycemia (5%). Adverse reactions resulted in dose reduction in 36 (21%) and discontinuation in 27 (16%) patients. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (≥20%) in ALIQOPA-treated patients were: hyperglycemia (54%), leukopenia (36%), diarrhea (36%), decreased general strength and energy (36%), hypertension (35%), neutropenia (32%), nausea (26%), thrombocytopenia (22%), and lower respiratory tract infections (21%).
Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers. Reduce the ALIQOPA dose to 45 mg when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors.

28857,Merck and Eisai's Dual Regimen Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation as 1L Treatment for Advanced Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Merck and Eisai Receive Third Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) plus LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) Combination Treatment,"The BT designation is based on P-Ib KEYNOTE-524/Study 116 trial assessing Keytruda (200mg, IV, q3w) + Lenvima (12mg/day for patients weighing ≥60kg, and 8mg/day for patients weighing <60kg) in patients with unresectable HCC not amenable to locoregional treatment
 The FDA’s BT designation intended to expedite development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions
 This marks the third BT designation for the combination therapy. The first two BT designation for dual regimen was in advanced/m-RCC & advanced/ m-non- MSI-H/ pMMR endometrial carcinoma, received in Jan’2018 & July’2018 respectively","KENILWORTH, N.J. & WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.-Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Eisai today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with LENVIMA, the orally available kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, for the potential first-line treatment of patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable to locoregional treatment. This is the third Breakthrough Therapy designation for the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination and is based on updated interim results from the Phase 1b trial KEYNOTE-524/Study 116. An earlier interim analysis was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2019. The first two Breakthrough Therapy designations for the combination were in advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced and/or metastatic non-microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) endometrial carcinoma, received in January 2018 and July 2018, respectively. The combination of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is investigational. The efficacy and safety of this combination has not been established. The KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination is not approved in any cancer types today.
“As part of our ongoing collaboration with Eisai, we are committed to evaluating the potential of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA across a number of different types of cancer,” said Dr. Jonathan Cheng, Vice President, Oncology Clinical Research, Merck Research Laboratories. “With this Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA, we look forward to working with Eisai to potentially build upon our existing indications for this difficult-to-treat cancer, so that we can help patients through a combination approach.”
“We are excited that the FDA has recognized the potential of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA in combination in advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to locoregional treatment with this Breakthrough Therapy designation,” said Dr. Takashi Owa, Vice President, Chief Medicine Creation and Chief Discovery Officer, Oncology Business Group at Eisai. “We are dedicated to working together with Merck to potentially bring another important option to patients.”
The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions and to qualify for this designation, preliminary clinical evidence must demonstrate that the therapy may provide substantial improvement over currently available therapy on at least one clinically significant endpoint.
About KEYNOTE-524/Study 116
KEYNOTE-524/Study 116 is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously every three weeks) and LENVIMA (12 mg/day for patients weighing 60 kg or more, and 8 mg/day for patients weighing less than 60 kg) in patients with unresectable HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B (not eligible for transarterial chemoembolization [TACE]) or C, Child-Pugh class A, and ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. The primary endpoints are tolerability and safety, and the secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria. Tumor assessments of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were confirmed at least four weeks (or longer) after initial response. The first part of the trial evaluated tolerability by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of treatment in patients for whom no other appropriate therapy was available. After tolerability was confirmed, additional patients with no prior systemic therapy for unresectable HCC were enrolled in the expansion part of the trial, which is evaluating ORR and duration of response as measured by mRECIST and Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) based on independent imaging review (IIR).
About Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The prevalence and mortality rate of liver cancer have been rising steadily over the past decade. In 2019, it is estimated there will be more than 42,000 new liver cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. (including intrahepatic bile duct cancer). Additionally, it is estimated there will be nearly 32,000 deaths from liver cancer in the U.S. Liver cancer — which is often diagnosed at an advanced stage — has one of the highest mortality rates of solid cancers, with a five-year survival rate of about 18%. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of these cases. The stage of disease at diagnosis largely determines the treatment approach, with potentially curative options, like resection or transplantation, only available for early-stage HCC. Unresectable HCC, a type of liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery, has a worse prognosis, with a median survival of less than one year. Unfortunately, approximately 70% of patients are diagnosed too late to be eligible for resection, ablation or transplantation, and there have been limited treatment options available for patients with unresectable disease.
About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grade 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination with Axitinib)
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.
Hepatotoxicity in Combination with Axitinib
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%), receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%).

28858,Novartis's Capmatinib (INC280) Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MET-Mutated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Novartis investigational lung cancer therapy capmatinib (INC280) granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with MET-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"The US FDA’s BT designation is based on GEOMETRY mono-1 study involves assessing of Capmatinib and the results were also updated in American Society of Clinical Oncology
 The BT designation is granted to serious or life-threatening disease therapies demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more significant preliminary research endpoints
 Capmatinib (INC280) is an oral potent and selective MET inhibitor with expected regulatory submission in Q4’19. In 2009, Novartis signed an exclusive development and commercialization agreement with Incyte for Capmatinib","Currently, there are no targeted therapies approved to treat MET exon14 skipping-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a particularly aggressive form of the disease
Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) now covers treatment-naïve and patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy
Regulatory filing for capmatinib in the U.S. is anticipated in Q4 2019
Basel, “We are pleased to announce that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to capmatinib (INC280) as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic MET exon14 skipping-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis.
Recent research concludes that the cMET gene is an oncogenic driver[1],[2], and the investigational lung cancer therapy capmatinib has been shown to be a highly potent and selective MET inhibitor. The MET mutation is seen in an estimated 3% – 4% of all patients with NSCLC[3]. These patients are generally older and often have a poor prognosis that can limit lung cancer treatment options[4-6]. “As we continue to reimagine medicine and place a renewed focus on the development of innovative lung cancer treatments, we look forward to working with the FDA and global health authorities to bring capmatinib to patients who currently have no available targeted therapy options,” continued Dr. Tsai.
According to FDA guidelines, treatments that receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation must target a serious or life-threatening disease and demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more significant preliminary research endpoints. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for capmatinib based on positive primary results from the GEOMETRY mono-1 study presented at the 2019 meeting of American Society of Clinical Oncology.

 The P-I study results: median treatment duration (11.4mos.); as of Nov 02, 2018, patients showing response (75%); CR (42%); patients who have CR (60% remained relapse-free @12mos.); 75% were transfusion-independent for 56 days or longer
 Tibsovo is an IDH1 inhibitor, indicated to treat adults with r/r AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGIO), a leader in the field of cellular metabolism to treat cancer and rare genetic diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. MDS is a group of bone marrow disorders that can cause severe complications, such as infections and uncontrolled bleeding, and can lead to the development of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

“There is a significant need for new targeted therapeutic approaches for individuals with MDS whose disease continues to progress despite treatment with standard of care,” said Chris Bowden, M.D., chief medical officer at Agios. “The Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on results from the initial 12 patients in the MDS arm of our Phase 1 study in advanced hematologic malignancies with an IDH1 mutation and recognizes the potential for single-agent treatment with TIBSOVO® to make an impact on these patients. We recently re-opened the MDS arm of this study with the goal of generating sufficient data to pursue a regulatory filing in this indication.”
The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is under investigation to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
Results from the MDS arm of the ongoing TIBSOVO® Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study in hematologic malignancies were presented at the 7thSociety of Hematologic Oncology Annual Meeting, held September 11-14, 2019, in Houston, Texas. These demonstrate that TIBSOVO® administered as a monotherapy was well tolerated and associated with durable remissions as well as the achievement and maintenance of transfusion independence in patients with relapsed or refractory MDS with an IDH1 mutation. Among the 12 patients who received 500 mg of oral TIBSOVO®daily, the median treatment duration was 11.4 months. The median age was 72.5 years, and 42% of patients were age 75 or older. As of the November 2, 2018 data cut-off, 75% (9/12) of patients had a response and 42% (5/12) had a complete response (CR). The median duration of CR had not been reached (95% CI, 2.8 months, NE). Of the patients who had a CR, 60% remained relapse-free at 12 months. In addition, 9 (75%) patients were transfusion-independent for 56 days or longer during study treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) of any grade were back pain, diarrhea, fatigue and rash. Grade 2 IDH differentiation syndrome was observed in 1 of 12 patients. No AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of treatment.
TIBSOVO® Clinical Development in MDS
The MDS arm of the Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib) in adults with advanced hematologic malignancies with IDH1 mutations is assessing the clinical activity, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TIBSOVO® in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MDS with a susceptible IDH1 mutation. The arm was re-opened in October 2019 and will enroll up to 25 total patients with the goal of generating sufficient data to pursue a potential regulatory filing in this indication. Study recruitment is ongoing across 22 sites in the U.S. and France.
About Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
MDS comprises a diverse group of bone marrow disorders in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature or become healthy blood cells. The National Cancer Institute estimates that more than 10,000 people are diagnosed with MDS in the U.S. each year. Failure of the bone marrow to produce mature healthy cells is a gradual process, and reduced blood cell and/or reduced platelet counts may be accompanied by the loss of the body’s ability to fight infections and control bleeding. For roughly 30 percent of the patients diagnosed with MDS, this bone marrow failure will progress to AML. Chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents and supportive blood products are used to treat MDS.
TIBSOVO® is not approved in any country for the treatment of patients with MDS.
About TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib)
TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib) is an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. For more information, visit TIBSOVO.com.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME
Patients treated with TIBSOVO have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal if not treated. Symptoms may include fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, rapid weight gain or peripheral edema, hypotension, and hepatic, renal, or multi-organ dysfunction. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Differentiation Syndrome: See Boxed WARNING. In the clinical trial, 19% (34/179) of patients with relapsed or refractory AML treated with TIBSOVO experienced differentiation syndrome. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal if not treated. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with TIBSOVO included noninfectious leukocytosis, peripheral edema, pyrexia, dyspnea, pleural effusion, hypotension, hypoxia, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, pericardial effusion, rash, fluid overload, tumor lysis syndrome, and creatinine increased. Of the 34 patients who experienced differentiation syndrome, 27 (79%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of TIBSOVO. Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 3 months after TIBSOVO initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis.
If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours (or an equivalent dose of an alternative oral or IV corticosteroid) and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement. If concomitant noninfectious leukocytosis is observed, initiate treatment with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis, as clinically indicated. Taper corticosteroids and hydroxyurea after resolution of symptoms and administer corticosteroids for a minimum of 3 days. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroid and/or hydroxyurea treatment. If severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids, interrupt TIBSOVO until signs and symptoms are no longer severe.
QTc Interval Prolongation: Patients treated with TIBSOVO can develop QT (QTc) prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. One patient developed ventricular fibrillation attributed to TIBSOVO. Concomitant use of TIBSOVO with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., anti-arrhythmic medicines, fluoroquinolones, triazole anti-fungals, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists) and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation. Conduct monitoring of electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes. In patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or in those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval, more frequent monitoring may be necessary.
Interrupt TIBSOVO if QTc increases to greater than 480 msec and less than 500 msec. Interrupt and reduce TIBSOVO if QTc increases to greater than 500 msec. Permanently discontinue TIBSOVO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs or symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred in <1% (2/258) of patients treated with TIBSOVO in the clinical study. Monitor patients taking TIBSOVO for onset of new signs or symptoms of motor and/or sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, paresthesias, or difficulty breathing. Permanently discontinue TIBSOVO in patients who are diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome.
ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade were fatigue (39%), leukocytosis (38%), arthralgia (36%), diarrhea (34%), dyspnea (33%), edema (32%), nausea (31%), mucositis (28%), electrocardiogram QT prolonged (26%), rash (26%), pyrexia (23%), cough (22%), and constipation (20%).
The most frequently reported ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions (≥5%) were electrocardiogram QT prolonged (10%), dyspnea (9%), leukocytosis (8%), tumor lysis syndrome (6%), and differentiation syndrome (5%).
Serious adverse reactions (≥5%) were differentiation syndrome (10%), leukocytosis (10%), and electrocardiogram QT prolonged (7%). There was one case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce TIBSOVO dose with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Monitor patients for increased risk of QTc interval prolongation.
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO.
Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO.
QTc Prolonging Drugs: Avoid concomitant use with TIBSOVO. If co-administration is unavoidable, monitor patients for increased risk of QTc interval prolongation.
LACTATION
Many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TIBSOVO and for at least 1 month after the last dose.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia and INDIANAPOLIS, AbCellera and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced today they have entered into an agreement to co-develop antibody products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus. The collaboration will leverage AbCellera’s rapid pandemic response platform, developed under the DARPA Pandemic Prevention Platform (P3) Program, and Lilly’s global capabilities for rapid development, manufacturing and distribution of therapeutic antibodies.
Within one week of receiving a blood sample from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19, AbCellera screened over 5 million immune cells looking for ones that produced functional antibodies that helped the patient neutralize the virus and recover from the disease. From this effort, AbCellera has identified over 500 unique fully human antibody sequences, the largest panel of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ever reported. The next step is to screen these antibodies to find the ones most effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. Many of these antibodies will be expressed in collaboration with partners at the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and pending agreement with NIAID will be tested for their ability to neutralize the virus.
“AbCellera’s platform has delivered, with unprecedented speed, by far the world’s largest panel of anti-SAR-CoV-2 antibodies,” said Carl Hansen, Ph.D., CEO of AbCellera. “In 11 days, we’ve discovered hundreds of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the current outbreak, moved into functional testing with global experts in virology, and signed a co-development agreement with one of the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies. We’re deeply impressed with the speed and agility of Lilly’s response to this global challenge. Together, our teams are committed to delivering a countermeasure to stop the outbreak.”
“With the number of cases rapidly increasing all over the world, doctors and patients are seeking a therapeutic intervention that can speed their recovery or prevent the disease. Lilly is committed to playing our part to bring innovation to patients amidst this global outbreak,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “We’ve partnered with AbCellera because we’re impressed with the speed and quality of their efforts. We are moving at top speed to create a potential treatment to help patients. While typically a new therapeutic antibody program might take years to get in the clinic, our goal with AbCellera is to be testing potential new therapies in patients within the next four months.”
Under the terms of the agreement, AbCellera and Lilly have committed to equally share initial development costs towards a product, after which Lilly will be responsible for all further development, manufacturing and distribution. If successful, Lilly is ready to work with global regulators to bring a treatment to patients.

About SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus)
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain which has not previously been identified in humans.1
Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and fever. In more severe cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death can occur.
To control the spread of the infection, WHO recommends regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness.

28895,Usona Institute's Psilocybin Receives the US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Major Depressive Disorder,FDA grants Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Usona Institute's psilocybin program for major depressive disorder,"The US FDA has granted the BT designation to psilocybin for promoting the efficient development of programs for psilocybin in MDD
 The BT designation follows the launch of Usona’s P-II PSIL201 which includes ~80 patients at 7sites across the US. 2/7 study sites are recruiting while others are expected to be active by Q1’20
 The BT designation to psilocybin targets the unmet medical need and the potential for improvement over existing therapies and foster Usona’s goal to advance the treatment paradigm toward new drug approval","November 22, 2019 01:15 PM Eastern Standard Time
MADISON, Wis.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Usona Institute has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for psilocybin in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Breakthrough Therapy Designation establishes FDA’s organizational commitment to promoting an efficient development program for psilocybin in MDD.
@usonainstitute psilocybin program for major depressive disorder (MDD) receives Breakthrough Therapy Designation from US FDA

Tweet this

The designation of psilocybin as a Breakthrough Therapy for MDD acknowledges both the unmet medical need in this broad population and the potential for significant improvements over existing therapies, and bolsters Usona’s mission to advance this revolutionary treatment paradigm toward new drug approval.
“The results from previous studies clearly demonstrate the remarkable potential for psilocybin as a treatment in MDD patients, which Usona is now seeking to confirm in its own clinical trials. What is truly groundbreaking is FDA’s rightful acknowledgement that MDD, not just the much smaller treatment-resistant depression population, represents an unmet medical need and that the available data suggest that psilocybin may offer a substantial clinical improvement over existing therapies,” says Charles Raison, MD, Director of Clinical and Translational Research at Usona. “Given that there is so much complexity with psilocybin and that Usona is charting new ground, these interactions will ensure that Usona and the FDA are aligned in approaching the development program with acceptable best practices.”
The new status follows the recent launch of Usona’s Phase 2 clinical trial, PSIL201, which will include approximately 80 participants at seven study sites around the US. Two of the seven study sites are currently recruiting, with the others expected to be active by the first quarter of 2020.
Significance for Patients Suffering from MDD
This is a significant milestone for the over 17 million people in the US who suffer from MDD. Although there are several existing MDD treatments, Breakthrough Therapy Designation recognizes that psilocybin may offer a clinically significant improvement over these therapies. Psilocybin potentially offers a novel paradigm in which a short-acting compound imparts profound alterations in consciousness and could enable long-term remission of depressive symptoms.
Depression is the world’s leading cause of disability, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. With such a broad potential impact, this designation represents a major step forward in mental health research and for patients suffering from depression.
For more information on Usona’s ongoing clinical trials, please visit www.usonaclinicaltrials.org.
Usona Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit medical research organization (MRO) that conducts and supports pre-clinical and clinical research to further the understanding of the therapeutic effects of psilocybin and other consciousness-expanding medicines. Its focus is on alleviating depression and anxiety in people for whom current medical treatments fall short in offering relief and a better quality of life.

28908,AstraZeneca and MSD Report Results of Cediranib + Lynparza in P-III GY004 Study for Patients with Platinum-Sensitive Relapsed Ovarian Cancer,Update on Phase III GY004 trial for cediranib added to Lynparza in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer,"The P-III GY004 study involves assessing of cediranib + Lynparza vs Lynparza as monothx. vs standard platinum-based CT in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive OC, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer patients, with/without a BRCA mutation
 The P-III GY004 study resulted in not meeting its 1EPs in IIT population i.e. an improvement in PFS when cediranib added to Lynparza, safety & tolerability profile is consistent with the known profile of individual therapy
 Lynparza is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor acts by targeting DDR in cells/tumors harboring a deficiency in HRR (BRCA1& 2 mutation). Cediranib is an oral VEGFR inhibitor, targeting the growth of blood vessels supporting tumor growth","The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of progression- free survival vs. platinum-based chemotherapy
AstraZeneca and MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada) today announced high-level results from the Phase III GY004 trial, led by NRG Oncology and sponsored by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), that examined primarily the efficacy and safety of the potential new medicine cediranib added to Lynparza (olaparib) versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide.
The trial did not meet the primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with cediranib added to Lynparza versus platinum-based chemotherapy. Cediranib is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor, which blocks the growth of blood vessels supporting tumour growth.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “Despite these disappointing results, we remain committed to expanding on the benefits already demonstrated with Lynparza for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We will work closely with NRG Oncology and the NCI to review the full results to inform our ongoing research.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “Ovarian cancer is one of the most difficult tumours to diagnose and treat early. AstraZeneca, MSD and our partners will continue to explore ways to help patients through our joint clinical trial development programme.”
The safety and tolerability profiles observed in GY004 were generally consistent with those known for each medicine.
The NCI and NRG Oncology will present the full data at a forthcoming medical meeting.
Ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide.1 In 2018, there were nearly 300,000 new cases diagnosed2 and around 185,000 deaths.1 Most women are diagnosed with advanced (Stage III or IV) ovarian cancer and have a five-year survival rate of approximately 30%.3 The primary aim of treatment in relapsed ovarian cancer is to delay progression of the disease for as long as possible, therefore increasing the time to re-initiation of chemotherapy with its associated toxicities, and maintaining quality of life for these patients.4,5,6
GY004
GY004 is an open-label, randomised, multicentre, Phase III trial testing the efficacy and safety of the potential new medicine cediranib added to Lynparza, versus Lynparza monotherapy versus standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer patients, with or without a BRCA mutation.
The GY004 trial is led by NRG Oncology, a non-profit research organisation funded by the NCI, in collaboration with AstraZeneca. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. AstraZeneca provided both cediranib and Lynparza to support the trial through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI.
Lynparza
Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.
Lynparza is currently approved in 73 countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in 58 countries, including the US and Japan, for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. In 2019, Lynparza was additionally approved in the US for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in other jurisdictions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.
Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, is approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. It has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical-trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
Cediranib
Cediranib is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination in various cancers. Cediranib has shown anti-tumour activity in many cancers, including ovarian, breast, colorectal, renal, lung, sarcoma and glioblastoma. Cediranib is being evaluated in combination with Lynparza in advanced ovarian cancer in the Phase II CONCERTO trial, Phase II/III GY005 trial (sponsored by the NCI) and Phase III ICON9 trial (sponsored by University College, London).
The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

 Jardiance is an oral therapy used to lower the blood sugar level in adults with T2D and CV diseases and is contraindicated in patients with T1D and diabetic ketoacidosis","— FDA Fast Track designation is for the investigation of potential new therapies that treat serious conditions and fulfill an unmet medical need

RIDGEFIELD, Conn. and INDIANAPOLIS, March 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for the investigation of Jardiance® (empagliflozin) to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular death in adults with chronic kidney disease, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced. This Fast Track designation for Jardiance underscores the urgent need for additional treatment options for the over 30 million Americans living with chronic kidney disease, many of whom are at risk of progressing to end-stage kidney disease.
“Chronic kidney disease can have a devastating impact on people’s lives. Not only does it cause damage to the kidneys that can eventually lead to the need for dialysis or transplant, but it could also increase the risk of cardiovascular death,” said Mohamed Eid, M.D., M.P.H., M.H.A, vice president, Clinical Development & Medical Affairs, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “Chronic kidney disease is a common and deadly condition, and there are still only limited treatment options, which is what motivates us to explore the potential role Jardiance may play in improving outcomes.”
Chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of premature death from cardiovascular causes and is the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. About two-thirds of cases are attributed to metabolic conditions such as diabetes (known as diabetic kidney disease), hypertension and obesity.
“We recognize the close link between the health of the heart, kidneys and metabolic system, and we have committed to a broad clinical development program assessing the cardiorenal metabolic benefits of Jardiance,” said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly. “The Fast Track designation from the FDA is an important step in evaluating the potential of Jardiance to enhance care for those with chronic kidney disease.”
The ongoing EMPA-KIDNEY clinical study is evaluating the effect of Jardiance on the progression of kidney disease and the occurrence of cardiovascular death in adults with established chronic kidney disease with and without diabetes. The EMPA-KIDNEY study was initiated based on promising exploratory results from the landmark EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, which found that treatment with Jardiance reduced the risk of new-onset and worsening kidney disease by 39 percent in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease compared with placebo.
EMPA-KIDNEY is being independently conducted, analyzed and reported by the Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit at the University of Oxford (MRC PHRU), which is based in the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU), in partnership with the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are providing the funding for the study.
Jardiance is a once-daily tablet used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and known cardiovascular disease. Jardiance is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).
In June 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the clinical investigation of Jardiance to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in people with chronic heart failure.
About EMPA-KIDNEY [NCT03594110]
EMPA-KIDNEY is a multinational randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is designed to evaluate the effect of Jardiance on kidney disease progression and cardiovascular mortality risk. The primary outcome is defined as time to a first event of either cardiovascular death or kidney disease progression, defined as end-stage kidney disease (the need for kidney replacement therapy such as dialysis or kidney transplantation), a sustained decline in eGFR to <10 mL/min/1.73 m2, renal death, or a sustained decline of ≥40% in eGFR from randomization. EMPA-KIDNEY includes adults with established chronic kidney disease both with and without diabetes.
The study is a global trial aiming to randomize about 6,000 participants to receive either Jardiance 10 mg once daily or placebo, each on top of standard of care.
About Chronic Kidney Disease
Chronic kidney disease is defined as a progressive decline of kidney function over time. About two-thirds of chronic kidney disease cases are attributable to metabolic diseases such as diabetes (known as diabetic kidney disease), hypertension and obesity. Notably, chronic kidney disease is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The majority of deaths among people with chronic kidney disease occur as a result of cardiovascular complications, often before reaching end stage renal disease. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 15 percent of adults in the United States and treatment costs are estimated to exceed $48 billion annually. Since there are currently only few treatment options, the overarching unmet medical need for additional treatment options in chronic kidney disease is evident.
About Cardiorenal Metabolic Conditions
Cardiorenal metabolic conditions are a group of interconnected disorders affecting the heart, kidneys and endocrine system. In aggregate, these conditions are the leading cause of deaths worldwide, accounting for up to 20 million deaths annually. Conditions within this group include coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, among many others.
Emerging science on the link between the cardiorenal and metabolic systems supports taking a multidisciplinary approach toward diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies for people living with these conditions. We remain committed to developing treatments with broad cardiorenal metabolic effects, which may help improve outcomes for people with serious chronic conditions such as these.
What is JARDIANCE? (www.jardiance.com)
JARDIANCE is a prescription medicine used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.
JARDIANCE is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease.
JARDIANCE is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine).
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Do not take JARDIANCE if you are allergic to empagliflozin or any of the ingredients in JARDIANCE.
Do not take JARDIANCE if you have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis.
JARDIANCE can cause serious side effects, including:
Dehydration. JARDIANCE can cause some people to have dehydration (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, light-headed, or weak, especially when you stand up.
You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you:

have low blood pressure
take medicines to lower your blood pressure, including water pills (diuretics)
are on a low salt diet
have kidney problems
are 65 years of age or older.
Vaginal yeast infection. Women who take JARDIANCE may get vaginal yeast infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), and/or vaginal itching.
Yeast infection of the penis. Men who take JARDIANCE may get a yeast infection of the skin around the penis, especially uncircumcised males and those with chronic infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience redness, itching or swelling of the penis, rash of the penis, foul smelling discharge from the penis, and/or pain in the skin around penis.
Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine). Ketoacidosis is a serious condition and may need to be treated in the hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. Ketoacidosis occurs in people with type 1 diabetes and can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes taking JARDIANCE, even if blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL. Ketoacidosis has also happened in people with diabetes who were sick or who had surgery during treatment with JARDIANCE. Stop taking JARDIANCE and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms, and if possible, check for ketones in your urine:
nausea
vomiting
stomach-area (abdominal) pain
tiredness
trouble breathing
Kidney problems. Sudden kidney injury has happened in people taking JARDIANCE. Talk to your doctor right away if you reduce the amount you eat or drink, or if you lose liquids; for example, from vomiting, diarrhea, or being in the sun too long.
Serious urinary tract infections. Serious urinary tract infections can occur in people taking JARDIANCE and may lead to hospitalization. Tell your doctor if you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as a burning feeling when passing urine, a need to urinate often or right away, pain in the lower part of your stomach or pelvis, or blood in the urine. Sometimes people also may have a fever, back pain, nausea or vomiting.
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia): If you take JARDIANCE with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as sulfonylurea or insulin, your risk of low blood sugar is higher. The dose of your sulfonylurea or insulin may need to be lowered. Symptoms of low blood sugar may include:
headache
drowsiness
weakness
dizziness
confusion
irritability
hunger
fast heartbeat
sweating
shaking or feeling jittery
Necrotizing fasciitis. A rare but serious bacterial infection that causes damage to the tissue under the skin in the area between and around your anus and genitals (perineum). This bacterial infection has happened in women and men who take JARDIANCE, and may lead to hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.Seek medical attention immediately if you have fever or are feeling very weak, tired or uncomfortable (malaise), and you develop any of the following symptoms in the area between and around your anus and genitals: pain or tenderness, swelling, and redness of skin (erythema).
Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. Symptoms of serious allergic reactions to JARDIANCE may include:
swelling of your face, lips, throat and other areas of your skin
difficulty with swallowing or breathing
raised, red areas on your skin (hives)
If you have any of these symptoms, stop taking JARDIANCE and contact your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room right away.

Increased fats in your blood (cholesterol).
The most common side effects of JARDIANCE include urinary tract infections and yeast infections in females.

28933,EMD Serono and Pfizer to Terminate P-III JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 Study Evaluating Bavencio + CRT for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck,EMD Serono and Pfizer Provide Update on Phase III JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 Study,"The P-III JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 study involve assessing of Bavencio (avelumab) + CRT followed by avelumab maintenance vs CRT alone in 697 patients with previously untreated LA SCCHN
 The companies have accepted DMC’s recommendation to terminate the P-III JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 study as it did not meet its 1EPs i.e. improvement in PFS. A detailed analysis of the Phase III JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 study is being conducted and results will be shared with the scientific community
 Bavencio is a PD-L1 antibody, acts by blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors. In Nov’2014, Merck KGaA and Pfizer signed an agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Bavencio","ROCKLAND, Mass. and NEW YORK, March 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in the US and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced an update from the Phase III JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 study evaluating avelumab in addition to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) versus standard-of-care CRT in patients with untreated locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA SCCHN). The alliance has accepted the recommendation of the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to terminate the JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 trial, as the study is unlikely to show a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) based on a preplanned interim analysis. A detailed analysis of the Phase III JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 study is being conducted and study findings will be shared with the scientific community.

EMD Serono and Pfizer Logo (PRNewsfoto/EMD Serono)
There has been limited innovation for patients with locally advanced SCCHN over the past 10 years.1 Despite aggressive standard-of-care treatment with high-dose chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy, LA SCCHN will ultimately recur in a large proportion of patients.2 In recognition of the unmet need for additional treatment options that can prevent recurrence or metastatic disease,3 the alliance initiated the JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 trial, which is the first Phase III study to report topline results for an immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination with CRT in LA SCCHN.
About JAVELIN Head and Neck 100
JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 (NCT02952586) is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study investigating treatment with avelumab plus standard-of-care CRT followed by avelumab maintenance versus CRT alone in patients with previously untreated LA SCCHN. A total of 697 patients who had not received prior therapy for locally advanced SCCHN and were eligible for CRT with curative intent were randomly assigned to receive avelumab plus CRT or CRT alone. The primary endpoint was PFS per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), time to locoregional failure, time to distant metastatic failure, overall response, duration of response and pathologic complete response.
About Head and Neck Cancer
Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide.4 In 2016, there were nearly 150,000 newly diagnosed cases in the United States, Japan and Europe.4 Approximately 60% of people are diagnosed with head and neck cancer when their disease has already progressed to the locally advanced stage (Stage III-IVB).5 At this stage, the cancer has spread from its site of origin to local lymph nodes, but not another part of the body.6 Standard of care for these patients includes high-dose chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy.7
About BAVENCIO® (avelumab)
BAVENCIO is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. BAVENCIO has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptors, BAVENCIO has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in preclinical models.8-10 In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize BAVENCIO.
BAVENCIO Approved Indications
BAVENCIO® (avelumab) in combination with axitinib is indicated in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
In the US, the FDA granted accelerated approval for BAVENCIO for the treatment of (i) adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Avelumab is currently approved for patients with MCC in 50 countries globally, with the majority of these approvals in a broad indication that is not limited to a specific line of treatment.
BAVENCIO Important Safety Information from the US FDA-Approved Label
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis, and evaluate suspected cases with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis occurred in 1.2% of patients, including one (0.1%) patient with Grade 5, one (0.1%) with Grade 4, and five (0.3%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause hepatotoxicity and immune-mediated hepatitis, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) immune-mediated hepatitis until resolution and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred with BAVENCIO as a single agent in 0.9% of patients, including two (0.1%) patients with Grade 5, and 11 (0.6%) with Grade 3.

BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib can cause hepatotoxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used as monotherapy. Withhold BAVENCIO and axitinib for moderate (Grade 2) hepatotoxicity and permanently discontinue the combination for severe or life-threatening (Grade 3 or 4) hepatotoxicity. Administer corticosteroids as needed. In patients treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST occurred in 9% and 7% of patients, respectively, and immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% of patients, including 4.9% with Grade 3 or 4.

BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold BAVENCIO until resolution for moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) colitis until resolution. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening (Grade 4) or recurrent (Grade 3) colitis upon reinitiation of BAVENCIO. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.5% of patients, including seven (0.4%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during and after treatment, and administer corticosteroids as appropriate. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency was reported in 0.5% of patients, including one (0.1%) with Grade 3.

Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Manage hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy and hyperthyroidism with medical management. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) thyroid disorders. Thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, were reported in 6% of patients, including three (0.2%) with Grade 3.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus including diabetic ketoacidosis: Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Withhold BAVENCIO and administer antihyperglycemics or insulin in patients with severe or life-threatening (Grade ≥3) hyperglycemia, and resume treatment when metabolic control is achieved. Type 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative etiology occurred in 0.1% of patients, including two cases of Grade 3 hyperglycemia.

BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) nephritis until resolution to Grade 1 or lower. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.1% of patients.
BAVENCIO can result in other severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions involving any organ system during treatment or after treatment discontinuation. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate to confirm or rule out an immune-mediated adverse reaction and to exclude other causes. Depending on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and initiate hormone replacement therapy, if appropriate. Resume BAVENCIO when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or lower following a corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for any severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 1738 patients treated with BAVENCIO as a single agent or in 489 patients who received BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib: myocarditis including fatal cases, pancreatitis including fatal cases, myositis, psoriasis, arthritis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, hypopituitarism, uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and systemic inflammatory response.
BAVENCIO can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to the first 4 infusions and for subsequent infusions based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25% of patients, including three (0.2%) patients with Grade 4 and nine (0.5%) with Grade 3.
BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib can cause major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including severe and fatal events. Consider baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular events. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue BAVENCIO and axitinib for Grade 3-4 cardiovascular events. MACE occurred in 7% of patients with advanced RCC treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib compared to 3.4% treated with sunitinib. These events included death due to cardiac events (1.4%), Grade 3-4 myocardial infarction (2.8%), and Grade 3-4 congestive heart failure (1.8%).
BAVENCIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus including the risk of fetal death. Advise females of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BAVENCIO and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO. It is not known whether BAVENCIO is excreted in human milk. Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.
The most common adverse reactions (all grades, ≥ 20%) in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) were fatigue (50%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), diarrhea (23%), nausea (22%), infusion-related reaction (22%), rash (22%), decreased appetite (20%), and peripheral edema (20%).

28946,I-Mab to Initiate the Development of TJM2 for Treating Cytokine Release Syndrome Associated with COVID-19,I-Mab Biopharma Announces Development of TJM2 to Treat Cytokine Release Syndrome Associated with Severe and Critically-Ill Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),"The initiation of clinical study follows the US FDA’s acceptance of IND for TJM2 (TJ003234). The study will explore the potential of TJM2 and initially be conducted in the US and is expected to expand in other countries
 The company has successfully completed its P-I SAD study, which demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and immunogenicity profile of TJM2.
 TJM2 is mAb targeting GM-CSF, acts by blocking its binding to its receptor hereby preventing downstream signaling and target cell activation and has received NMPA’s IND for P-Ib study in patients with RA. TJM2 is expected to be the first Ab of its class to enter clinical studies in China in 2020","-The clinical study will explore the potential of TJM2, a proprietary mAb against GM-CSF, to fight “cytokine storm” during severe COVID-19 disease

-The study to be conducted initially in the United States with planned expansion of study into other countries
SHANGHAI, China and ROCKVILLE, MD., March 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — I-Mab Biopharma (Nasdaq: IMAB), (“I-Mab” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel or highly differentiated biologics to treat diseases with significant unmet medical needs, particularly cancers and autoimmune disorders, today announced that it is initiating the development of TJM2 (TJ003234) to treat cytokine storm in severe and critically ill patients caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). TJM2 is an I-Mab-discovered neutralizing antibody against human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an important cytokine that plays a critical role in acute and chronic inflammation.
The development will start following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) acceptance of I-Mab’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and the study will commence initially in the United States with plans to expand into other hardest-hit countries.
Cytokine storm is characterized by surge of high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines, and is an overreaction of the immune system under the conditions, such as CAR-T therapy [1] and patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies revealed that high levels of GM-CSF, along with a few other cytokines, are critically associated with severe clinical complications in COVID-19 patients. High concentration of GM-CSF was found in the plasma of severe and critically ill patients [2], which account for approximately 20% of all patients [3], especially in those requiring intensive care.
“Research data provide the rationale to use TJM2 as a potential treatment for cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, because the antibody effectively neutralizes circulating GM-CSF to control acute inflammatory responses, and it may also exhibit potential advantages over conventional IL-6 antibodies [4], ” said Dr. Joan Shen, CEO of I-Mab. “This expanded IND application of TJM2 would allow us to act timely to help battle the global COVID-19 pandemic.”
The Company has successfully completed a Phase I single ascending dose (SAD) study of TJM2 in the United States (NCT03794180), in which TJM2 has exhibited favorable safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and immunogenicity profiles. TJM2 also received IND clearance from China’s National Medical Products Administration for a multiple-dose Phase 1b study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results from the planned COVID-19 study will also be used to further evaluate the potential therapeutic role of TJM2 in reducing or preventing cytokine storm and neurotoxicity associated with CAR-T therapy.
According to the WHO, as of March 12, 2020, there were 125,048 confirmed cases and 4,613 deaths of COVID-19 globally.

About TJM2
TJM2 is an internally discovered neutralizing antibody against human GM-CSF, an important cytokine that plays a critical role in chronic inflammation and destruction in autoimmune diseases such as RA. GM-CSF can polarize macrophages into the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and is known to induce an inflammatory cascade involving other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23. It is evident that GM-CSF plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and disease progression of multiple autoimmune conditions.
TJM2 specifically binds to human GM-CSF with high affinity and can block GM-CSF from binding to its receptor, thereby preventing downstream signaling and target cell activation. As a result, it can effectively inhibit inflammatory responses mediated by macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, leading to reduced tissue inflammation and damage.
TJM2 is expected to be the first antibody of its class to enter clinic trials in China in 2020.

28987,Eli Lilly and Incyte's Olumiant (baricitinib) Receives the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Alopecia Areata,Lilly Receives FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Baricitinib for the Treatment of Alopecia Areata,"The FDA’s BT designation is based on P-II results of P-II/III BRAVE-AA1 study assessing baricitinib vs PBO in patients with AA
 The P-II portion of the BRAVE-AA1 study demonstrated no new safety signals with no SAEs @36wks. Additionally, P-III portion of BRAVE-AA1 & P-III BRAVE-AA2 study, are currently evaluating baricitinib (2mg/4mg) vs PBO in patients with AA
 Olumiant is an approved treatment for adults with moderately to severely active RA, approved in ~65+ countries, including the US, member states of the EU and Japan","Recognition reinforces baricitinib’s potential to be the first FDA-approved medicine for individuals living with alopecia areata

INDIANAPOLIS, March 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to baricitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata (AA), an autoimmune disorder that can cause unpredictable hair loss on the scalp, face and other areas of the body. The Breakthrough Therapy designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over already available therapies on a clinically significant endpoint(s).
“Patients with AA currently do not have any FDA-approved treatment options available to them,” said Lotus Mallbris, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of immunology development at Lilly. “AA not only causes hair loss but also may be a psychosocial burden for people living with this disease. At Lilly, we aspire to create new medicines that can give hope to patients. We look forward to working with the FDA to further explore baricitinib’s potential to become the first approved treatment option for these individuals.”
The FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on the positive Phase 2 results of Lilly’s adaptive Phase 2/3 study BRAVE-AA1, which evaluated treatment with baricitinib versus placebo in adult patients with AA. In the Phase 2 portion of the BRAVE-AA1 study up to Week 36, there were no new safety signals with no serious adverse events reported. The reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate and the most common included upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis and acne.
Based on the interim results of the Phase 2 part of the study, the Phase 3 portion of BRAVE-AA1 and an additional Phase 3 double-blind study (BRAVE-AA2), are currently assessing the efficacy and safety of the 2-mg and 4-mg doses of baricitinib relative to placebo.
“There are millions of people around the world affected by and living with AA,” said Dory Kranz, president and CEO of the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. “We’re encouraged by baricitinib’s potential to be one of the first FDA-approved medicines to treat AA.”
Baricitinib is currently approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). More than 100,000 patients have experience using baricitinib, which is approved in over 65 countries including the U.S., member states of the EU and Japan. It is marketed as OLUMIANT®.
Indication and Usage for OLUMIANT (baricitinib) tablets (in the United States) for RA patients
OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Limitation of Use: Use of OLUMIANT in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (baricitinib) TABLETS 
WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MALIGNANCY, AND THROMBOSIS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Patients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:
Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to Olumiant use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.
Carefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.
Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.
MALIGNANCIES: Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant.
THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: The most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than local disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Avoid Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.
Closely monitor patients for infections during and after Olumiant treatment. Interrupt Olumiant if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. Do not resume Olumiant until the infection is controlled.
Tuberculosis – Before initiating Olumiant evaluate and test patients for latent or active infection and treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Monitor patients for TB during Olumiant treatment.
Viral Reactivation – Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves.
The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.
MALIGNANCY AND LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS: Malignancies were observed in Olumiant clinical studies. Consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing Olumiant in patients who develop a malignancy. NMSCs were reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.
THROMBOSIS: Thrombosis, including DVT and PE, has been observed at an increased incidence in Olumiant-treated patients compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, evaluate patients promptly and treat appropriately.
GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS: Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. Use Olumiant with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.
LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES:
Neutropenia – Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Lymphopenia – Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Anemia – Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.
Liver Enzyme Elevations – Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases to ≥5x and ≥10x upper limit of normal were observed for both ALT and AST in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.
Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.
Lipid Elevations – Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.
VACCINATIONS: Avoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Olumiant therapy.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse reactions (≥1%) include: upper respiratory tract infections (16.3%, 14.7%, 11.7%), nausea (2.7%, 2.8%, 1.6%), herpes simplex (0.8%, 1.8%, 0.7%) and herpes zoster (1.0%, 1.4%, 0.4%) for Olumiant 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: No information is available to support the use of Olumiant in pregnancy or lactation. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant.
HEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Olumiant is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment.

29003,Sanofi and Regeneron to Initiate the Clinical Program Evaluating Kevzara (sarilumab) in Patients with Severe COVID-19,Sanofi and Regeneron begin global Kevzara (sarilumab) clinical trial program in patients with severe COVID-19,"The P-II/III study will assess the safety & efficacy Kevzara + supportive care vs PBO + supportive care in ~400 patients in a ratio (2:2:1) hospitalized with serious complications from COVID-19
 The study is designed into two parts: First part will evaluate the impact of Kevzara on fever and patients’ need for supplemental oxygen while the second part will evaluate the improvement in longer-term outcomes including preventing death & reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen and/or hospitalization
 Kevzara is a mAb inhibiting IL-6 pathway by targeting the IL-6 receptor. The companies will continue to collaborate on COVID-19 and other ARDS development, with Regeneron leading US studies and Sanofi leading ex-US studies. In 2019, the companies intend to simplify the joint collaboration for Kevzara, which is expected to be finalized in the Q1’20","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and TARRYTOWN, N.Y., March 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc today announced they have started a clinical program evaluating Kevzara® (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway by binding and blocking the IL-6 receptor. IL-6 may play a role in driving the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19 infection. The role of IL-6 is supported by preliminary data from a single-arm study in China using another IL-6 receptor antibody.
This U.S.-based trial will begin at medical centers in New York, one of the epicenters of the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak, and will assess the safety and efficacy of adding Kevzara to usual supportive care, compared to supportive care plus placebo. The multi-center, double-blind, Phase 2/3 trial has an adaptive design with two parts and is anticipated to enroll up to 400 patients. The first part will recruit patients with severe COVID-19 infection across approximately 16 U.S. sites, and will evaluate the impact of Kevzara on fever and patients’ need for supplemental oxygen. The second, larger part of the trial will evaluate the improvement in longer-term outcomes including preventing death and reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen and/or hospitalization.
“At Sanofi, we are taking a leading role in addressing the global challenge of COVID-19 disease. We believe that there is scientific evidence to suggest that Kevzara may be a potentially important treatment option for some patients, and this trial will provide the well-controlled, rigorous scientific data we need to determine if IL-6 inhibition with Kevzara is better than current supportive care alone. Additionally, we expect to rapidly initiate trials outside the U.S. in the coming weeks, including areas most affected by the pandemic such as Italy,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Sanofi’s Global Head of Research and Development. “In addition to Kevzara, Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, is leveraging previous development work for a SARS vaccine as part of our goal to quickly develop a COVID-19 vaccine.”

Scientists have preliminary evidence that IL-6 may play a key role in driving the inflammatory immune response that causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients critically ill from COVID-19. Initial non-peer reviewed results from a single-arm, 21-patient Chinese trial found COVID-19 patients experienced rapidly reduced fevers and 75% of patients (15 out of 20) reduced their need for supplemental oxygen within days of receiving another IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab). Based on these results, China recently updated its COVID-19 treatment guidelines and approved the use of that IL-6 inhibitor to treat patients with severe or critical disease.

“To initiate this trial quickly, Regeneron and Sanofi have worked closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, otherwise known as the FDA and BARDA ,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “Data from China suggest that the IL-6 pathway may play an important role in the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Despite this encouraging finding, it’s imperative to conduct a properly designed, randomized trial to understand the true impact. Our trial is the first controlled trial in the U.S. to evaluate the effect of IL-6 inhibition prospectively in COVID-19 patients. In addition to our Kevzara program, Regeneron is also rapidly advancing a novel antibody cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, which we hope to have available for human testing this summer. Both of these programs are made possible by our unprecedented end-to-end antibody discovery, development and manufacturing technologies, starting with our proprietary VelocImmune human antibody mouse, and incorporating our associated rapid manufacturing technologies designed to select and produce the best neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, these technologies expedite a typically years-long process into a matter of months. This same technology was applied to the Ebola virus, where our therapy, REGN-EB3, was shown to dramatically improve survival in infected patients last year.”

In late 2019, Regeneron and Sanofi announced their intent to simplify the joint collaboration for Kevzara, which is expected to be finalized in the first-quarter of 2020. The companies will continue to collaborate on COVID-19 and other related ARDS development, with Regeneron leading U.S.-based work and Sanofi leading work outside of the U.S.
The use of Kevzara to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 is investigational and has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.
About the Trial
This Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial uses an adaptive design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Kevzara in adults hospitalized with serious complications from COVID-19. To enter the trial, patients must be hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 that is classified as severe or critical, or who are suffering from multi-organ dysfunction. All patients must have pneumonia and fever. After receiving the study dose, patients will be assessed for 60 days, or until hospital discharge or death.
In the Phase 2 part of the trial, patients will be randomized 2:2:1 into three groups: Kevzara high dose, Kevzara low dose and placebo. The primary endpoint is reduction of fever and the secondary endpoint is decreased need for supplemental oxygen.
The Phase 2 findings will be utilized in an adaptive manner to determine transition into Phase 3, helping to determine the endpoints, patient numbers and doses. The second, larger part of the trial will evaluate the improvement in longer-term outcomes including preventing death and reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen and/or hospitalization.
If the trial continues with all three treatment arms to the end, it is expected to enroll approximately 400 patients, depending on the status of the COVID-19 outbreak and the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 and high levels of IL-6.
About Kevzara® (sarilumab) Injection
Kevzara was jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody. Kevzara binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor, and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is a signaling protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity, joint destruction and other systemic problems. It is also being investigated for its ability to reduce the overactive inflammatory immune response associated with COVID-19.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KEVZARA® (sarilumab) INJECTION
KEVZARA can cause serious side effects including:

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: KEVZARA is a medicine that affects your immune system. KEVZARA can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have serious infections while using KEVZARA, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting KEVZARA. Your healthcare provider should monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with KEVZARA.
Before starting KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you:
think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, with or without a fever. Symptoms may include sweats or chills, muscle aches, a cough, shortness of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, if you feel very tired, or if you are being treated for an infection, get a lot of infections or have repeated infections
have diabetes, HIV, or a weakened immune system
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance of getting certain fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis)
have or have had hepatitis
After starting KEVZARA, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection.
CHANGES IN CERTAIN LABORATORY TEST RESULTS: Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before and after starting KEVZARA to check for low neutrophil (white blood cells that help the body fight off bacterial infections) counts, low platelet (blood cells that help with blood clotting and stop bleeding) counts, and an increase in certain liver function tests. Changes in test results are common with KEVZARA and can be severe. You may also have changes in other laboratory tests, such as your blood cholesterol levels. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests 4 to 8 weeks after starting KEVZARA and then every 6 months during treatment to check for an increase in blood cholesterol levels.
TEARS (PERFORATION) OF THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES: Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines. Some people using KEVZARA had tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go away.
CANCER: KEVZARA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS: Serious allergic reactions can happen with KEVZARA. Get medical attention right away if you have any of the following signs: shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling dizzy or faint; swelling of your lips, tongue or face; moderate or severe stomach (abdominal) pain or vomiting; or chest pain.
Do not use KEVZARA if you are allergic to Sarilumab or any of the ingredients of KEVZARA.
Before using KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you
have an infection
have liver problems
have had stomach (abdominal) pain or a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines
recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People who take KEVZARA should not receive live vaccines
plan to have surgery or a medical procedure
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if KEVZARA will harm your unborn baby
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you use KEVZARA. It is not known if KEVZARA passes into your breast milk
take any prescription or nonprescription medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements. It is especially important to tell your healthcare provider if you use any other medicines to treat your RA. Using KEVZARA with these medicines may increase your risk of infection
medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these
The most common side effects include:
injection site redness
upper respiratory tract infection
urinary tract infection
nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose
These are not all the possible side effects of KEVZARA. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. You are encouraged to report side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA at www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

TEL AVIV, Israel & PARSIPPANY, N.J. & INCHEON, South Korea–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a U.S. affiliate of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.(NYSE and TASE: TEVA), and Celltrion Healthcare, Co., Ltd. (KRX KOSDAQ:091990), today announced that HERZUMA®1 (trastuzumab-pkrb) for Injection, a biosimilar to HERCEPTIN®1, is now available in the United States with the same indications as the reference product including:

Adjuvant Breast Cancer
HERZUMA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-overexpressing node-positive or node-negative (ER/PR negative or with one high-risk feature) breast cancer
as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel
as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin
as a single agent following multi-modality anthracycline based therapy
Metastatic Breast Cancer
HERZUMA is indicated:
In combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer
As a single agent for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease
Metastatic Gastric Cancer
HERZUMA is indicated in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease.
In these indications, patients should be selected for therapy based on a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved companion diagnostic for a trastuzumab product.
“We are proud to make HERZUMA available to patients in the U.S. living with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, and their providers,” said Brendan O’Grady, Executive Vice President, North America Commercial, Teva. “The launch of HERZUMA continues our commitment to help lower healthcare costs and increase price competition through the availability of biosimilars. Teva is continuing to invest in biopharmaceuticals as part of our long-term strategy for the future, and to help patients around the world, and we look forward to additional milestones for our biosimilar products later this year.”
HERZUMA has received FDA approval for the same indications of the reference product.
“We are pleased that HERZUMA is now available to patients in the U.S.,” said Mr. Hyoung-Ki Kim, Vice Chairman at Celltrion Healthcare. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Teva to bring biosimilars to as many patients as possible in the U.S., as we believe they address an unmet need in the market.”
The Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC or “list price”) for HERZUMA 150 mg is $1,402.50 and HERZUMA 420 mg is $3,927, which is a 10 percent discount to the WAC of HERCEPTIN®. Actual costs to individual patients and providers for HERZUMA are anticipated to be lower than WAC because WAC does not account for additional rebates and discounts that may apply. Savings on out-of-pocket costs may vary depending on the patient’s insurance payer and eligibility for participation in the assistance program.
Dedicated patient support services are also available from Teva through the CORE program. CORE is available to help eligible patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals navigate the reimbursement process. CORE offers a range of services, including benefits verification and coverage determination, support for precertification and prior authorization, assistance with coverage guidelines and claims investigation, and support through the claims and appeals process. A savings program is also available for eligible commercially insured patients. To learn more, please visit TevaCORE.com.

Please see the full Boxed Warning and additional Important Safety Information in this release and accompanying Prescribing Information.
Important Safety Information

WARNING: CARDIOMYOPATHY, INFUSION REACTIONS, EMBRYO‑FETAL TOXICITY, AND PULMONARY TOXICITY

Cardiomyopathy – Administration of trastuzumab products can result in sub-clinical and clinical cardiac failure. The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving trastuzumab with anthracycline‑containing chemotherapy regimens.

Evaluate left ventricular function in all patients prior to and during treatment with HERZUMA. Discontinue HERZUMA treatment in patients receiving adjuvant therapy and withhold HERZUMA in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function.

Infusion Reactions; Pulmonary Toxicity – Administration of trastuzumab products can result in serious and fatal infusion reactions and pulmonary toxicity. Symptoms usually occur during or within 24 hours of administration. Interrupt HERZUMA infusion for dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension. Monitor patients until symptoms completely resolve. Discontinue HERZUMA for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity – Exposure to trastuzumab products during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Cardiomyopathy

Administration of trastuzumab products can result in sub-clinical and clinical cardiac failure. The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving trastuzumab with anthracycline‑containing chemotherapy regimens
Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death
Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
Discontinue HERZUMA treatment in patients receiving adjuvant therapy and withhold HERZUMA in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function
The safety of continuation or resumption of HERZUMA in patients with trastuzumab product-induced LV cardiac dysfunction has not been studied
Cardiac Monitoring

Evaluate cardiac function prior to and during treatment. For adjuvant breast cancer therapy, also evaluate cardiac function after completion of HERZUMA
Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan
Monitor frequently for decreased left ventricular function during and after HERZUMA treatment
Monitor more frequently if HERZUMA is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction
Infusion Reactions

Administration of trastuzumab products can result in serious and fatal infusion reactions
Symptoms usually occur during or within 24 hours of administration
Interrupt HERZUMA infusion for dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension
Monitor patients until symptoms completely resolve
Discontinue HERZUMA for anaphylaxis or angioedema. Strongly consider permanent discontinuation in all patients with severe infusion reactions
Infusion reactions consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and chills, and on occasion included nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, rash, and asthenia
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Exposure to trastuzumab products during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of HERZUMA
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to HERZUMA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of HERZUMA. Advise female patients to contact their healthcare provider with a known or suspected pregnancy
Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother’s clinical need for HERZUMA treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HERZUMA or from the underlying maternal condition
Pulmonary Toxicity

Administration of trastuzumab products can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity, which includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non‑cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions
Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity
Discontinue HERZUMA in patients experiencing pulmonary toxicity
Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia

In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not
Most Common Adverse Reactions

Adjuvant Breast Cancer – Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, and chills
Metastatic Breast Cancer- Most common adverse reactions (≥10%) are fever, chills, headache, infection, congestive heart failure, insomnia, cough, and rash
Metastatic Gastric Cancer- Most common adverse reactions (≥10%) are neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia

29033,Novo Nordisk Halts Clinical Studies Evaluating Concizumab (anti-TFPI mAb) for Hemophilia A and B With or Without Inhibitors,Novo Nordisk pauses the clinical trials investigating concizumab (anti-TFPI mAB) in haemophilia A and B with or without inhibitors,"Novo Nordisk has paused its two P-III clinical studies (explorer7 and 8) and one P-II clinical study (explorer5) investigating concizumab prophylaxis treatment in hemophilia A and B patients regardless of inhibitor status
 The studies have been paused due to the occurrence of non-fatal thrombotic events in three patients enrolled in the ongoing P-III program. Novo Nordisk and DMC are evaluating the relevance of the events for the continuation of the program, yet no conclusions have been made
 In Oct’2019, P-III explorer7 has initiated to establish the safety and efficacy of concizumab (qd, SC) delivered in a pen device for reducing the number of bleeds. The explorer8 study was initiated in Nov’2019 which enroll ~293 patients from 32 countries while P-II explorer5 study was started in Oct’2017","Bagsværd, Denmark, 16 March 2020 – Novo Nordisk today announced that two clinical trials in the concizumab phase 3 programme (explorer7 and 8) and one clinical trial in the phase 2 programme (explorer5) have been paused. The three clinical trials were investigating concizumab prophylaxis treatment in haemophilia A and B patients regardless of inhibitor status. Consequently, no additional patients will be recruited, and further treatment of patients currently enrolled in the trials with concizumab will cease.
The decision is a result of the occurrence of non-fatal thrombotic events in three patients enrolled in the ongoing phase 3 programme. Novo Nordisk and an independent Data Monitoring Committee are currently assessing the relevance of the events to the continuation of the programme and no conclusions have yet been made.
“While it is disappointing to pause the trials, patient safety is of utmost importance to Novo Nordisk – both for those taking part in our clinical trials and those who use our products on a daily basis” said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. “Together with relevant authorities, we will now carefully evaluate all available data and decide how to best move forward”.
About the concizumab phase 2 and 3 programmes 
In October 2019, Novo Nordisk initiated the explorer7 phase 3 clinical trial with concizumab in patients with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors towards FVIII or FIX. The objective of the trial was to establish the safety and efficacy of once-daily prophylactic subcutaneous concizumab delivered in a pen device to reduce the number of bleeds. A parallel phase 3 trial in haemophilia A or B patients without inhibitors, explorer8, was initiated in November 2019. The trials were to enrol approximately 293 patients from 32 countries. The explorer5 phase 2 trial was initiated in October 2017 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily prophylactic subcutaneous concizumab delivered in a pen device to reduce the number of bleeds of haemophilia A patients. The trial currently includes 15 patients. Approximately 109 patients are currently being treated with concizumab.

29048,AstraZeneca Reports Results of Imfinzi + Tremelimumab in P-III CASPIAN Study as 1L Treatment for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,Imfinzi confirmed a sustained overall survival benefit in final analysis of the Phase III CASPIAN trial in 1st-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer,"The P-III CASPIAN study involves assessing of Imfinzi + SOC (etoposide and carboplatin/ cisplatin CT) or Imfinzi + Tremelimumab vs CT as monothx. as a 1L treatment for 805 patients with ES-SCLC in 200+ centers across 23 countries
 The first arm (Imfinzi + SOC) has met its 1EPs of OS in Jun’2019 while the second arm (Imfinzi + tremelimumab) did not meet its 1EPs of OS. The safety profile of each therapy is consistent with the known safety profiles
 Imfinzi (durvalumab) is mAb targeting PD-L1, acts by blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 & CD80 and is currently under review in combination with etoposide and carboplatin/cisplatin as 1L treatment for ES-SCLC in the US, EU and Japan with its anticipated PDUFA date in 2021","A second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, added
to Imfinzi, did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival
High-level results from the final analysis of the Phase III CASPIAN trial showed AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) in combination with a choice of standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapies confirmed a sustained, clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) treated in the 1st-line setting.
In June 2019, the CASPIAN trial met one primary endpoint for Imfinzi plus SoC (etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy) by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS versus SoC alone at a planned interim analysis.
The second experimental arm testing tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, added to Imfinzi and SoC did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in OS in this analysis.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, said: “We are pleased to see the sustained and meaningful survival benefit of Imfinzi for patients with small cell lung cancer after more than two years median follow up. We have already received the first global regulatory approval for Imfinzi with etoposide plus either carboplatin or cisplatin and remain on track for more approvals soon as we provide patients an important new 1st-line treatment option.”
The safety and tolerability for Imfinzi and tremelimumab were consistent with the known safety profiles of these medicines. The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
Imfinzi in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is currently under regulatory review for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the 1st-line setting based on the Phase III CASPIAN trial in the US, EU and Japan. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted a Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date set for the first quarter of 2020.
As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested following concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC in the Phase III ADRIATIC trial with data anticipated in 2021.
Small cell lung cancer
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.1 Lung cancer is broadly split into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with about 15% classified as SCLC.2 SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to chemotherapy.3,4 About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.5 Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.5
CASPIAN
CASPIAN is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared Imfinzi in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy, or Imfinziand chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation. The trial was conducted in more than 200 centres across 23 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was OS in each of the two experimental arms.
Imfinzi
Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.
Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. Imfinzi recently received its first global approval for the 1st-line treatment of ES-SCLC in combination with SoC chemotherapy in Singapore. Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.
As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.
Tremelimumab
Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death. Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with Imfinzi in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and liver cancer.
AstraZeneca in lung cancer
AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. We aim to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso (osimertinib), and its ongoing Phase III trials ADAURA, LAURA, and FLAURA2.6-8We are also committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments.
An extensive late-stage Immuno-Oncology programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.9 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON, and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II combination trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline.
AstraZeneca’s approach to Immuno-Oncology (IO)
Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca believes that IO-based therapies offer the potential for life-changing cancer treatments for the clear majority of patients.
The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.
AstraZeneca in Oncology

29058,Alphabet's Verily Launched its COVID-19 Screening Site in Collaboration with California's Government,Verily’s coronavirus screening site is already out of testing appointments,"From Mar 16, 2020, the Californians availed an online COVID-19 screener survey and till date, the site has run out of appointments. The people who met the eligibility criteria for the test have been directed to sites for completing the nasal swab test with its expected results to be available within a few days post-completion
 The collaboration avails the online tool, increasing the risk for screening and testing the people at high risk of COVID-19. Additionally, the tool helped the people concerned with COVID-19 risk into testing sites based on guidance from public health officials and test availability
 The program tests the highest risk areas including the San Francisco Bay Area. The baseline COVID-19 program is live at projectbaseline.com/covid19. In 2017, the Project Baseline was launched and is a technology cloud-based platform supporting research and community health initiatives","Last night, slightly ahead of schedule, Verily launched its much-discussed coronavirus screening site. On the site, which is only available in parts of the Bay Area, users can describe their symptoms and Verily will then direct them to a testing site if necessary. After only a few hours online, though, the site has already run out of appointments.

“Appointments will continue to expand through this program as we scale capacity in the near future. Please check back later,” the site now says, but only after you’ve gone through most of the questionnaire.
It’s obviously not Verily’s fault that the state’s testing sites are at capacity and, if anything, this proves the need for a service like this on a national scale.

Originally, in a press conference on Friday, President Trump said a site Google was working on was going to be the core feature of a national testing strategy. That story changed quite a bit over the weekend as Google and Verily clarifiedtheir efforts and it became clear that the White House overpromised, but Verily then launched its pilot site ahead of schedule on Sunday night.
We have asked Verily for more information and will update this post once we hear more.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/verily-3.jpg,COVID-19|DigiHealth,0,0,Alphabet|California Governor|Collaboration|COVID-19|Launch|Screening Site|Verily,publish,17/3/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/verilys-coronavirus-screening-site-is-already-out-of-testing-appointments/,https://pharmashots.com/29058/alphabets-verily-launched-its-covid-19-screening-site-in-collaboration-with-californias-government/

 The extension of NUCALA’s indication for adolescents and children aged ≥6yrs. allow the company to bring the therapy to patients and their families with limited treatment options
 Nucala is the first IL5 biologic to be approved for SAE in a pediatric population (as young as 6 yrs. old) in Canada. The therapy has received approval in 20+ markets, including the US & EU for adult patients with SAE and indicated as an approved therapy for pediatric use in patients aged 6-17yrs. as an add-on treatment for SAE","MISSISSAUGA, ON, March 16, 2020 /CNW/ – NUCALA (mepolizumab) has now been approved in Canada as an add-on maintenance treatment for use in adults, adolescents and children (aged 6 years and older) with severe eosinophilic asthma1.
NUCALA is the first anti-Interleukin-5 (IL5) biologic to be approved for the condition in a pediatric population (as young as 6 years old) in Canada. IL-5 plays an important role in regulating the function of eosinophils, an inflammatory cell known to be active in asthma.
Dr. Alex Romanovschi, Country Medical Director, GSK Canada, said: “Severe asthma is a chronic disease that can make daily activities a challenge for adolescents, children and their caregivers. GSK has a long and established history in respiratory health innovation, with treatments for asthma, COPD and other respiratory diseases. We are pleased to announce the extension of NUCALA’s indication to adolescents and children aged 6 years and older, thereby bringing our specialty biologic medicines to patients and their families who have limited treatment options”.
About asthma
Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways2. The causes of asthma are not completely understood but likely involve an interaction between a person’s genetic make-up and the environment.
About severe asthma and eosinophilic inflammation 
Severe asthma is a chronic disease with symptoms that can be life-threatening3. Approximately 250,000 Canadians live with severe asthma4, which can have several underlying causes, including eosinophilic inflammation5. In a sub-set of severe asthma patients, the over-production of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) is known to cause inflammation in the lungs. Studies suggest about 60% of severe asthma patients may have eosinophilic airway inflammation6. IL-5 is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. The prevalence of severe uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma is ≤1% among treated children aged 6-17 years old. Although the proportion of severe asthmatics among children is less than adult asthma patients, the severity of disease is greater among children and adolescents as evidenced by increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations7,8.

About NUCALA (mepolizumab)
NUCALA contains the active substance, mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking a specific protein called interleukin‑5. By blocking the action of interleukin-5, NUCALA limits the production of more eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the number of eosinophils in the blood, lungs and tissues1.
In Canada NUCALA is indicated as add-on maintenance treatment for adults, adolescents, and children (aged 6 years and older) with severe eosinophilic asthma who:
are inadequately controlled with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (patients ≥ 18 years of age) or medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (patients 6-17 years of age) and an additional asthma controller(s) (e.g., LABA); and
have a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150 cells/μL (0.15 GI/L) at initiation of treatment with NUCALA OR ≥ 300 cells/μL (0.3 GI/L) in the past 12 months.
NUCALA is also approved in the US, Europe and in over 20 other markets for adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, and in the US, Europe, and other jurisdictions for paediatric use from ages 6 to 17 as an add-on treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma. In Canada, the US, Japan and several other markets, it is approved as add-on maintenance treatment for patients with a rare blood vessel disease associated with increased eosinophils, called Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA).
NUCALA has been studied in over 3,000 patients in 21 clinical trials, across a number of eosinophilic conditions.

29070,NIH Initiates its P-I Trial for COVID-19 at KPWHRI in Seattle,NIH clinical trial of investigational vaccine for COVID-19 begins,"The study involves assessing of investigational vaccine mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 enrolling 45 patients with age of 18 to 55 years ~6wks. and the first patient has been dosed. Additionally, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is funding the P-I trial
 The study will be evaluating two doses of the vaccine (IM, 25mcg, 100/250 mcg) in the upper arm ~ for 28 days apart due to its safety, and the ability to induce immune response. Till Mar 15, 2020 WHO has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide with confirmed 2,800 cases and 58 deaths in the US
 mRNA-1273 is an investigational vaccine developed by NIAID scientists in collaboration with Moderna. Additionally, the adults in Seattle who are interested in joining the study needs to visit https://corona.kpwashingtonresearch.org","Study enrolling Seattle-based healthy adult volunteers.
A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial. KPWHRI is part of NIAID’s Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium. The open-label trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks. The first participant received the investigational vaccine today.
The study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine.
The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.
“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.”
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As of March 15, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide. More than 2,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths have been reported in the United States as of March 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA). The investigational vaccine directs the body’s cells to express a virus protein that it is hoped will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans.
Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry. VRC and Moderna scientists already were working on an investigational MERS vaccine targeting the spike, which provided a head start for developing a vaccine candidate to protect against COVID-19. Once the genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 became available, the scientists quickly selected a sequence to express the stabilized spike protein of the virus in the existing mRNA platform.
The Phase 1 trial is led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., senior investigator at KPWHRI. Study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort. The first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose. Investigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations. Another safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort.
Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up visits between vaccinations and for additional visits across the span of a year after the second shot. Clinicians will monitor participants for common vaccination symptoms, such as soreness at the injection site or fever as well as any other medical issues. A protocol team will meet regularly to review safety data, and a safety monitoring committee will also periodically review trial data and advise NIAID. Participants also will be asked to provide blood samples at specified time points, which investigators will test in the laboratory to detect and measure the immune response to the experimental vaccine.
“This work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus,” Dr. Jackson said. “We are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an NIH clinical trials center since 2007.”

HOUSTON, March 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Moleculin Biotech, Inc., (Nasdaq: MBRX) (“Moleculin” or the “Company”), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a broad portfolio of drug candidates targeting highly resistant tumors, announced that it has entered into an agreement with the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) to conduct research on Moleculin’s patented portfolio of molecular inhibitors, including drug candidate, WP1122, for antiviral properties against a range of viruses, including Coronavirus. UTMB’s Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases collaborates with the Galveston National Laboratory, which is funded by NIAID, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and other federal agencies, as well as academic partners, private foundations, and the biopharmaceutical industry.

“Published research has revealed that viral replication can be highly dependent on specific monosaccharides and has demonstrated the effectiveness of a compound known as ‘2-DG,’ a dual decoy of glucose and mannose, in the treatment of certain viruses1,” commented Walter Klemp, Moleculin’s Chairman and CEO. “And, this is rooted in an emerging field of research focused on the role of glycolysis and glycosylation, or more specifically, on glucose and mannose metabolism in viral activity, including the coronavirus2. Importantly, although 2-DG has shown promise in the laboratory in relevant in vivo models, its potential as a therapy is severely limited by its lack of drug-like properties, including circulation time and organ uptake. Our drug candidate, WP1122, is a prodrug of 2-DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose) that, based on recently developed preclinical data appears to overcome 2-DG’s lack of drug-like properties and is able to significantly increase tissue/organ concentration.”
Dr. Donald Picker, Chief Science Officer for Moleculin added: “the in vivo research supporting the use of 2-DG as dual inhibitor of glycolysis and glycosylation to defeat viruses like Coronavirus through multiple effects critical to the progression of viral infection is promising. And, with the improved drug-like properties of WP1122 and an apparent ability to increase concentration of the drug in the infected organs, we are excited to begin testing against coronavirus, as well as others. Our hope for this kind of therapeutic approach is not only as a potential treatment for infected patients, but even as a possible preventative measure.”
Under the agreement, Moleculin will supply the lead drug candidate, WP1122, and related inhibitors, as well as technical support and UTMB will begin testing these candidates against various viral disease models, including COVID-19, in connection with the UTMB Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases.
The UTMB Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases (CBEID) was established in 2003, the same year the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) selected UTMB as one of eight institutions to lead a Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCE) and to receive a grant to construct on the UTMB campus one of two National Biocontainment Laboratories, now known as the Galveston National Laboratory.

29089,Merck &amp; Co. Reports Results of Gefapixant (MK-7264) in Two P-III Studies for Refractory or Unexplained Chronic Cough,"Merck Announces Top-Line Results from Phase 3 Trials Evaluating Gefapixant, an Investigational Treatment for Refractory or Unexplained Chronic Cough","The two P-III studies (COUGH-1 &-2) involves assessing of gefapixant (45mg, 15mg, bid) vs PBO in 732 & 1,317 patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough with 1EP as 24hrs. cough/hr. @12wks. and 24wks. respectively
 Gefapixant (45mg, bid) arm met its 1EPs i.e, decrease in 24hrs. coughs/hr. @12wks. & 24wks. while gefapixant (15mg, bid) arm did not meet its 1EP, safety & tolerability of gefapixant is consistent with the previous studies
 Gefapixant (PO) is an investigational, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, to treat refractory or unexplained chronic cough","Gefapixant (45 mg Twice Daily) Demonstrated Statistically Significant Decrease in 24-hour Coughs Per Hour Compared to Placebo at Week 12 and 24 in Phase 3 Trials

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced top-line efficacy results from two ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trials (COUGH-1 and COUGH-2) evaluating the efficacy and safety of gefapixant (MK-7264), an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. In these studies, the primary efficacy endpoints were met for the gefapixant 45 mg twice daily treatment arms – demonstrating a statistically significant decrease in 24-hour coughs per hour (average hourly cough frequency based on 24-hour sound recordings) versus placebo at 12 (COUGH-1) and 24 weeks (COUGH-2). The gefapixant 15 mg twice daily treatment arms did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint in either Phase 3 study. The safety and tolerability profile of gefapixant during the trials to date is consistent with the previously reported Phase 2 study. The trials will continue for long-term follow-up to collect additional safety data.
“The burden for patients faced with this disease underscores the need for effective therapeutic options for refractory and unexplained chronic cough,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are pleased gefapixant at the 45 mg dose met the primary efficacy endpoints in both Phase 3 studies and we look forward to sharing the detailed findings at an upcoming medical meeting.”
About COUGH-1 and COUGH-2
COUGH-1 (NCT03449134) and COUGH-2 (NCT03449147) are international Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gefapixant in reducing cough frequency in adult participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. COUGH-1 enrolled 732 participants and COUGH-2 enrolled 1,317 participants, with refractory or unexplained chronic cough for at least one year, as defined by guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). In both studies, patients were randomized to one of three groups: gefapixant 45 mg twice daily, gefapixant 15 mg twice daily, or placebo. Participants remained on their assigned treatment at randomization throughout both studies. The primary efficacy outcomes measure for COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were 24-hour coughs per hour at Week 12, and 24-hour coughs per hour at week 24, respectively, measured using an ambulatory digital audio recording device. Secondary endpoints in both trials included awake coughs per hour, percentage of participants with a greater than 1.3-point increase from baseline in the Leicester Questionnaire (LCQ) total score, and percentage of participants with a greater than 30% reduction from baseline in 24-hour coughs per hour. COUGH-1 had a 12-week treatment period and a 40-week extension period, while COUGH-2 had a 24-week treatment period and a 28-week extension period. Primary safety outcomes include the percentage of patients experiencing greater than one adverse event during treatment and follow up, and the percentage of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events.
About Gefapixant
Gefapixant is an investigational, orally administered, selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. It is believed that excessive activation of P2X3 receptors is associated with hyper-sensitization of sensory neurons. Neuronal hyper-sensitization in the airways and lungs, triggered by injury or infection, can cause an exaggerated, persistent and frequent urge to cough, otherwise known as chronic cough.
About Chronic Cough
The prevalence of chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 8 weeks) is estimated at 10% of the general adult population globally, and in up to 46% of these cases, no treatable cause can be identified despite a thorough diagnostic investigation.

29099,NuProbe Collaborates with QIAGEN to Develop Diagnostics Tests for Cancer Indications,"NuProbe Announces Strategic Collaboration with QIAGEN, Completes Multiple CE IVD Product Registrations","The collaboration leverages NuProbe’s BDA technology and QIAGEN’s SPE technology to develop NGS based cancer diagnostic tests for non-invasive liquid biopsy. Integration of both the technologies will enable an accurate & affordable analysis of DNA mutations with low variant allele fractions
 The partners will initially focus on developing research use only products for clinical researchers in oncology and may further work on other commercial products in the future
 Additionally, NuProbe has completed five CE IVD registrations for diagnostic products, including liquid biopsy mutation detection kits for the EGFR and BRAF genes","HOUSTON, March 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — NuProbe Global, a global molecular diagnostics company based in Shanghaiand Suzhou, China and Houston, TX, today announced it has entered into a collaboration agreement with QIAGEN to develop next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based cancer diagnostic tests for non-invasive liquid biopsy. Under terms of the collaboration agreement, NuProbe and QIAGEN will explore integrating their two amplicon-based enrichment and sequencing technologies: NuProbe’s proprietary Blocker Displacement Amplification (BDA) technology and QIAGEN’s Single Primer Extension (SPE) technology, for accurate and affordable analysis of DNA mutations with very low variant allele fractions and to advance non-invasive cancer genomic profiling.
Meanwhile, NuProbe has also recently completed five CE IVD registrations for molecular diagnostic products, including for common mutations related to non-small-cell lung cancer (EGFR mutations) and for melanoma and thyroid cancer (BRAF mutations).
Liquid biopsy is gaining emerging popularity for non-invasive profiling of cancer mutations to inform optimal target therapy selection and provide timely early warning of cancer recurrence. The NGS liquid biopsy oncology panels that the two companies are investigating will achieve adequate limit of detection in a cost-effective manner that other current technologies cannot equal on liquid biopsies.
“BDA technology is one of our core technologies and have been demonstrated robustness across multiple platforms including NGS,” said David Y. Zhang, co-founder of and head of innovation at NuProbe, and associate professor of bioengineering at Rice University. “We are enthusiastic to further expand its application to QIAGEN’s recognized SPE platform.”
The QIAGEN and NuProbe teams will initially work on developing research use only products, for clinical researchers in oncology. The two companies may explore further strategic collaboration and develop other commercial products in the future.
“We are excited about the potential products that will come out of the two synergistic rare variant enrichment and detection methods,” said Yingshuang Chai, CEO and Chairman of NuProbe. “This collaboration further demonstrates the adoption of our cutting-edge technology by industry leaders, and our high valuable products will help more eligible patients benefit from therapy selection and recurrence monitoring with non-invasive detection.”
Separately from the QIAGEN collaboration, NuProbe announces that it has recently completed five CE IVD registrations for molecular diagnostic products, including liquid biopsy mutation detection kits for the EGFR and BRAF genes. NuProbe is planning CE IVD and NMPA (China’s equivalent of FDA) registrations for additional products including the recently released VarTrace™ AML Multi-gene Panel.

29108,Regeneron to Initiate COVID-19 Antibody Program in Early Summer,REGENERON ANNOUNCES IMPORTANT ADVANCES IN NOVEL COVID-19 ANTIBODY PROGRAM,"Regeneron advances its program to discover and develop a novel multi-Ab cocktail, administered as prophylaxis before exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or as a treatment for already infected patients
 The company plans to initiate the clinical studies by early summer and has isolated mAb from its VelocImmune mice and from humans who have recovered from COVID-19 and would pick two of them to test as a cocktail treatment
 The program follows Regeneron’s ongoing clinical program evaluating Kevzara (sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody) in severe COVID-19 patients","Regeneron has identified hundreds of virus-neutralizing antibodies; plans to initiate large-scale manufacturing by mid-April with antibody cocktail therapy
Potential to enter human clinical studies by early summer
This program is in addition to Regeneron’s separate ongoing clinical program evaluating Kevzara® (sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody) in severe COVID-19 patients
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the latest progress in its efforts to discover and develop a novel multi-antibody cocktail that can be administered as prophylaxis before exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or as treatment for those already infected. Regeneron scientists have now isolated hundreds of virus-neutralizing, fully human antibodies from the company’s VelocImmune® mice, which have been genetically-modified to have a human immune system. Regeneron has also isolated antibodies from humans who have recovered from COVID-19, in order to maximize the pool of potentially potent antibodies. From this large pool of candidates, Regeneron will select the top two antibodies for a ‘cocktail’ treatment based on potency and binding ability to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, as well as other desirable qualities. Using a multi-antibody approach allows for targeting of different parts of the virus and may help protect against multiple viral variants. Regeneron previously used these technologies to rapidly develop a successful treatment for Ebola virus infection, which is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In order to meet the pressing public health need, Regeneron is applying its VelociMab®technology to prepare manufacturing-ready cell lines as lead antibodies are selected, so that clinical-scale production can begin immediately. The company is working toward the goal of producing hundreds of thousands of prophylactic doses per month by the end of summer and hopes to have smaller quantities available for initial clinical testing at the beginning of the summer. The company is working with the U.S. Health & Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Defense Authority (BARDA) to increase capacity even further.
“Our three decades of investment in our VelociSuite antibody technologies, which accelerate and improve the traditional drug discovery process, have hopefully prepared us for this critical time and to meet this important challenge,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “Given the tremendous interest and concern around the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be providing regular and transparent updates on our discovery and development programs. I want to recognize our incredible team, which is working around the clock to develop needed solutions to this global health crisis.”
All coronaviruses have a single glycoprotein on the virus surface called the spike protein, which is the protein on the virus cell surface that binds to the host cell and is required for infectivity. Regeneron’s SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will target the spike protein in order to block its interaction with the host cell, and thus neutralize the virus.
“I’m so proud to be part of this cross-company team, which delivered a novel and effective fully human antibody treatment for Ebola in record time and is making every effort to once again rise to this unprecedented challenge,” said Christos Kyratsous, Ph.D., Vice President of Research, Infectious Diseases and Viral Vector Technologies at Regeneron.
Yesterday, Regeneron and its collaborator Sanofi also announced the initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating Kevzara® (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Kevzara inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6), which may play a role in driving the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19.

 The study is expected to be initiated in early Apr’2020 and will evaluate the therapy in ~300 patients globally, including the US with the 1EPs & 2EPs as clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and ICU variables
 Actemra/RoActemra (IV, SC) is the first approved anti-IL-6 receptor biologic indicated to treat patients with moderate-to-severe active RA. Additionally, Roche received FDA’s EUA for the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test on Mar 13, 2020, to detect COVID-19","Basel, 19 March 2020- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced we are working with the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the US Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care.
This is the first global study of Actemra/RoActemra in this setting and is expected to begin enrolling as soon as possible in early April with a target of approximately 330 patients globally, including the US. The primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) variables.
“We are initiating a clinical trial to study Actemra/RoActemra for the treatment of people hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia, so that we can better establish the potential role for Actemra/RoActemra in fighting this disease,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “In these unprecedented times, today’s announcement is an important example of how industry and regulators can collaborate quickly to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will share the results as soon as possible.”
To date, there are several independent clinical trials exploring the efficacy and safety of Actemra/RoActemra for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Actemra/RoActemra has been included in the 7th updated diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 issued by China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on March 3, 2020.
However, this new trial is vital because there are no well-controlled studies and limited published evidence on the safety or efficacy of Actemra/RoActemra in the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19. In addition, Actemra/RoActemra is not currently approved for this use by any health authorities, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In addition to initiating this trial, Roche received FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test on March 13, 2020, to detect the novel virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Learn more here.
About the Clinical Trial
Roche is initiating a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (COVACTA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra/RoActemra added to standard of care in adult patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. The primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) variables. Patients will be followed for 60 days post-randomisation, and an interim analysis will be conducted to look for early evidence of efficacy.
About Actemra/RoActemra
Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved anti-IL-6 receptor biologic available in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Actemra/RoActemra can be used alone or with methotrexate (MTX) in adult RA patients who are intolerant to, or have failed to respond to, other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In Europe, RoActemra IV and SC are also approved for use in adult patients with severe, active and progressive RA who previously have not been treated with MTX. Actemra/RoActemra IV and SC are approved globally for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and in the US and Europe for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in children two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra SC injection is also the first approved therapy for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in more than 40 countries, including the US and Europe. In the US and Europe, Actemra/RoActemra IV injection is approved for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in people two years of age and older. Actemra/RoActemra was the first approved treatment for CRS in this setting. A prefilled autoinjector ACTPen has been approved in the US and Europe. In Japan, Actemra is also approved for the treatment of Castleman’s Disease and Takayasu Arteritis. Actemra/RoActemra is part of a co-development agreement with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd and has been approved in Japan since April 2005. Actemra/RoActemra is approved in more than 110 countries worldwide.

Designated as an intractable disease in Japan, SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death and, if left untreated in its most common form (Type 1), leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases1,2
Reimbursement with MHLW is expected by the end of 1H20, pending agreement, Zolgensma will be available at that time
Basel, March 19, 2020 — Novartis Pharma K.K. (“Novartis Pharma”) today announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved Zolgensma®(onasemnogene abeparvovec) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients under the age of two, including those who are pre-symptomatic at diagnosis. Patients must be negative for elevated anti-AAV9 antibodies. A rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, SMA results in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.3 Approximately 60% of all SMA is Type 1. Zolgensma is a one-time gene therapy designed to address the genetic root cause of the disease by replacing the function of the missing or nonworking SMN1 gene. Zolgensma is administered during a single intravenous (IV) infusion, delivering a new working copy of the SMN gene into a patient’s cells, halting disease progression. Approximately 15-20 SMA patients in Japan are expected to be eligible for treatment each year. Reimbursement with MHLW is expected by the end of 1H20 and, pending agreement, Zolgensma will be available at that time.
“SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death and, if left untreated in its most common form, Type 1, leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases,” said Kazunari Tsunaba, president and representative director, Novartis Pharma. “A one-time dose of Zolgensma has the potential to make a truly transformative impact on this life-threatening disease. This is an important day for the children and families in Japan impacted by SMA, both today and in the future.”
Approval is based on the Phase 1 START, START Long-term follow-up, Phase 3 STR1VE-US, Phase 3 SPR1NT and Phase 1/2 STRONG (intrathecal injection) trials. START and STR1VE-US were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in symptomatic SMA Type 1 patients <6 months of age at dosing, who had one or two copies of the SMN2 backup gene, or two copies of the SMN2 backup gene, respectively. Zolgensma demonstrated rates of survival never seen in the natural history of the disease; rapid motor function improvement, often within one month of dosing; and milestone achievement, including the ability to sit without support, a milestone never achieved in untreated patients. Patients in START Long-term follow-up are now reaching five years of age. Interim results from the ongoing SPR1NT trial, a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm study of a single, one-time IV infusion of Zolgensma in pre-symptomatic patients (<6 weeks at age of dosing) genetically defined by bi-allelic deletion of SMN1 with 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 demonstrate rapid, age‑appropriate major milestone gain, reinforcing the critical importance of early intervention in SMA patients. It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.
The most commonly observed side effects after treatment were elevated liver enzymes and vomiting. Acute serious liver injury and elevated aminotransferases can occur. Patients with pre-existing liver impairment may be at higher risk. Prior to infusion, physicians should assess liver function of all patients by clinical examination and laboratory testing. And, they should administer systemic corticosteroid to all patients before and after treatment, and then continue to monitor liver function for at least 3 months after infusion.
“Zolgensma provided rapid, significant and clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit in symptomatic and pre-symptomatic SMA, including prolonged event-free survival and achievement of motor milestones never seen before in natural history of the disease. We are proud to bring the first gene therapy for SMA to Japan, and especially of the transformational impact Zolgensma will have on the children and families affected by SMA,” said Dave Lennon, president, AveXis.
In May 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zolgensma for the treatment of pediatric patients less than two years of age with SMA with bi-allelic mutations in the SMN1 gene. Approximately 400 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program in the U.S. In the U.S. nearly all on-label patients have been approved by their payer for access to Zolgensma. AveXis is pursuing registration in close to three dozen countries with a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use opinion expected in 1Q 2020 and regulatory decisions anticipated in Switzerland, Canada and Australia in late 2020 or early 2021.
About Spinal Muscular Atrophy
SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death and is designated as an intractable disease in Japan.1 If left untreated, SMA Type 1 leads to death or the need for permanent ventilation by the age of two in more than 90% of cases.2 Approximately 60% of all SMA is Type 1. Approximately 15-20 SMA patients in Japan are expected to be eligible for treatment each year 4,5 . SMA is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, resulting in the rapid and irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.3 It is imperative to diagnose SMA and begin treatment, including proactive supportive care, as early as possible to halt irreversible motor neuron loss and disease progression.6 This is especially critical in SMA Type 1, where motor neuron degeneration starts before birth and escalates quickly. Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so SMA patients with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities.7 More than 30% of patients with SMA Type 2 will die by age 25.8
About Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec)
Zolgensma is designed to address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN gene to halt disease progression through sustained SMN protein expression with a single, one-time IV infusion. Zolgensma represents the first approved therapeutic in the company’s proprietary platform to treat rare, monogenic diseases using gene therapy. Approximately 400 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, including clinical trials, commercially and through the managed access program in the U.S.
AveXis has an exclusive, worldwide license with Nationwide Children’s Hospital to both the intravenous and intrathecal delivery of AAV9 gene therapy for the treatment of all types of SMA; has an exclusive, worldwide license from REGENXBIO for any recombinant AAV vector in its intellectual property portfolio for the in vivo gene therapy treatment of SMA in humans; an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Genethon for in vivo delivery of AAV9 vector into the central nervous system for the treatment of SMA; and a non-exclusive, worldwide license agreement with AskBio for the use of its self-complementary DNA technology for the treatment of SMA.

Additionally, Lilly is piloting a drive-thru testing system enable to test patients outside of the healthcare facilities to avoid further spreading of the virus
 The collaboration will expand the states’ ability to conduct testing and receive a timely diagnosis of individuals who suspect they may be carrying the virus. The alliance will maximize the impact of broader testing","INDIANAPOLIS, March 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE:LLY) announced today its scientists are partnering with the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH), with support from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to accelerate testing in Indiana for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
“Lilly is bringing the full force of our scientific and medical expertise to attack the coronavirus pandemic around the world,” said David A. Ricks, Lilly’s chairman and chief executive officer. “For more than 140 years Lilly has played a leading role in solving problems in our Indiana home. Today we are marshalling our people and our assets to confront and defeat the novel coronavirus in our state.”
Lilly will use its specialized research laboratories to analyze samples taken in Indiana healthcare facilities, including nursing homes and emergency rooms. Assuming the company can continuously access required diagnostic reagents, this should start to expand the state’s ability to conduct testing and receive a timely diagnosis of individuals who suspect they may be carrying the virus. As Lilly’s testing capacity expands, Lillyand ISDH will work together to maximize the impact of broader testing.
“As the global COVID-19 pandemic has intensified, Lilly has redirected efforts to help solve critical issues – including potential therapeutics, diagnostics and testing,” said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “Lilly’s scientists have been working day and night for several weeks to implement and validate this testing approach, and access or produce the chemical reagents that are in short supply across the country. Lilly’s lab meets the required certifications to conduct testing, and we’re optimistic in our ability to help accelerate testing.”
“At the State Department of Health, we started partnering with Lilly from the early stages to tap into the capabilities of this innovative Indiana company,” said Dr. Kris Box, Indiana State Health Commissioner. “We know the magnitude of the impact that advances by Lilly can have on how we diagnose and treat Hoosiers and people worldwide, and we’re grateful for Lilly’s commitment to help accelerate solutions.”
In addition, Lilly is piloting drive through testing that may eventually be able to test patients outside of a healthcare facility to avoid spread of the virus. The company hopes to have additional details in the coming days.
Lilly will not accept money from government agencies, hospitals, insurance companies or patients for conducting or analyzing tests. “This is one contribution we can make to help slow the spread of coronavirus in our community, and this testing will be entirely free,” Ricks said.

29217,AstraZeneca's Lynparza (olaparib) Receives MHLW's Orphan Drug Designation for BRCA-Mutated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,Lynparza granted orphan drug designation in Japan for BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer,"The ODD is based on P-III POLO study assessing Lynparza (300mg, bid) as maintenance monothx. vs PBO in 154 patients in a ratio (3:2) with gBRCAm metastatic PC without disease progression on 1L Pt. based CT
 The P-III POLO study results: improvement in PFS (7.4 vs 3.8mos.); 47% reduction in disease progression; patients with measurable disease at baseline, responded patients (23% vs 12%); median duration of treatment in excess of 2yrs. (24.9 vs 3.7mos.); median OS (18.9 vs 18.1mos.)
 Lynparza is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor acts by targeting DDR in cells/tumors harboring a deficiency in HRR (BRCA1& 2 mutation) and has received the US FDA’s approval in Dec’2019 with its ongoing regulatory reviews in the EU and other regulatory bodies","Designation based on the Phase III POLO trial that showed Lynparza nearly doubled the time patients lived without disease progression vs. placebo
AstraZeneca today announced that Lynparza (olaparib) has been granted orphan drug designation (ODD) in Japan for the maintenance treatment of germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) curatively unresectable pancreatic cancer. Lynparza is co-developed and co-commercialised with MSD Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., US (MSD: known as Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada).
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare grants ODD to medicines intended for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan and for which there is a high unmet medical need.
Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate of the most common cancers and is the only major cancer with a five-year survival rate below 10% in almost every country.
José Baselga, Executive Vice President, R&D Oncology, said: “Japan has the fifth-highest incidence of pancreatic cancer worldwide and patients have seen limited treatment advances over the last few decades. This designation is an important step forward in bringing the first targeted medicine to biomarker-selected patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in Japan.”
Roy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, MSD Research Laboratories, said: “A pancreatic cancer diagnosis is devastating and we are committed to research that aims to change the prognosis for patients. The POLO trial demonstrated that treatment with Lynparza extended time without disease progression or death in patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer and we are hopeful that we will be able to bring this treatment to patients in Japan soon.”
The Phase III POLO trial showed Lynparza nearly doubled the time patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death to a median of 7.4 months versus 3.8 months on placebo. The safety and tolerability profile of Lynparza in the POLO trial was in line with that observed in previous trials.
Lynparza was approved in the US as a 1st-line maintenance treatment for patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer in December 2019 with ongoing regulatory reviews in the EU and other jurisdictions.
Pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic cancer is a deadly cancer with a high unmet medical need. The disease has the lowest survival rate of the most common cancers.1 Japan has the fifth-highest rate of pancreatic cancer in the world with 43,000 new cases diagnosed in 2018.2,3 Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in Japan, resulting in 37,000 deaths in 2018.3
Globally, pancreatic cancer is the 11th-most commonly occurring cancer and the seventh leading cause of cancer death.4,5There were approximately 460,000 new cases worldwide in 2018.5 As there are often no symptoms, or symptoms may be non-specific in the early stages, it is most commonly diagnosed at an incurable stage.6,7 Around 80% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed when the disease has metastasised, at which point average survival is less than a year.8 Despite advances in treatment, few improvements have been made in diagnosis and treatment in the past few decades.9 Current treatment is surgery (for which approximately only 10-20% of patients are eligible), chemotherapy and radiotherapy, highlighting a critical unmet medical need for more effective treatment options.10
POLO
POLO is a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial of Lynparza tablets (300mg twice daily) as maintenance monotherapy versus placebo. The trial randomised 154 patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed on 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomised (3:2) to receive Lynparza or placebo until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), time to second disease progression, overall response rate and health-related quality of life.
The results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, where Lynparza nearly doubled the time patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer lived without disease progression or death to a median of 7.4 months versus 3.8 months on placebo and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47% (HR 0.53 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35-0.82], p=0.004). In patients with measurable disease at baseline, 23% responded to Lynparzaversus 12% on placebo (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% CI, 0.89-6.76]) and had a median duration of treatment in excess of two years (24.9 months [95% CI, 14.8-could not be calculated]) versus 3.7 months on placebo (95% CI, 2.10-could not be calculated). The median OS, a secondary endpoint, at interim analysis and at a data maturity of 46% was 18.9 months for Lynparzaversus 18.1 months for placebo but did not reach statistical significance (HR=0.91; p=0.68).
The safety and tolerability profile of Lynparza in the POLO trial was in line with that observed in previous trials.
BRCA mutations
BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role in maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.
Lynparza
Lynparza (olaparib) is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to block DNA damage response (DDR) in cells/tumours harbouring a deficiency in homologous recombination repair, such as mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2. Inhibition of PARP with Lynparza leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. Lynparza is being tested in a range of PARP-dependent tumour types with defects and dependencies in the DDR pathway.
Lynparza is currently approved in a number of countries, including those in the EU, for the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. It is approved in the US, the EU, Japan, China, and several other countries as 1st-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also approved in the US, Japan, and a number of other countries for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy; in the EU, this includes locally advanced breast cancer. In 2019, Lynparza was additionally approved in the US for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Regulatory reviews are underway in several jurisdictions for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers.
Lynparza, which is being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and MSD, has been used to treat over 30,000 patients worldwide. Lynparza has the broadest and most advanced clinical trial development programme of any PARP inhibitor, and AstraZeneca and MSD are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumours as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. Lynparza is the foundation of AstraZeneca’s industry-leading portfolio of potential new medicines targeting DDR mechanisms in cancer cells.
The AstraZeneca and MSD strategic oncology collaboration
In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop Lynparza and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.
AstraZeneca in oncology
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly-growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investment that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

29228,FDA Divulges Guidance for Conducting Clinical Studies During COVID-19 Pandemic,Updated: WHO Now Doesn't Recommend Avoiding Ibuprofen For COVID-19 Symptoms,"The US FDA has issued guidance to aid sponsors & IRBs for assuring the safety of participants in clinical studies, maintaining compliance with GCP and to reduce the risk to trial integrity during the COVID-19 pandemic
 FDA recommended alternative methods for assessments i.e. contacting patients by phone or virtual visits and offering additional safety monitoring for candidates who may not have access to the investigational therapy or trial site
 The FDA plans to keep clinical research going and is offering a level of flexibility to work with sponsors to manage how clinical studies may be impacted by changing conditions","Editor’s note (19 March 2020): Since the publication of this article, the World Health Organization has updated its advice on the official Twitter account: “Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen.”
In light of this, the headline of this article has been changed to reflect the current advice. The original news text, provided by the news wire service AFP, remains below.

Original (18 March 2020): The World Health Organization recommended Tuesday that people suffering COVID-19 symptoms avoid taking ibuprofen, after French officials warned that anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen effects of the virus.
The warning by French Health Minister Olivier Veran followed a recent study in The Lancet medical journal that hypothesised that an enzyme boosted by anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen could facilitate and worsen COVID-19 infections.
Asked about the study, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva the UN health agency’s experts were “looking into this to give further guidance.”
“In the meantime, we recommend using rather paracetamol, and do not use ibuprofen as a self-medication. That’s important,” he said.
He added that if ibuprofen had been “prescribed by the healthcare professionals, then, of course, that’s up to them.”
His comments came after Veran sent a tweet cautioning that the use of ibuprofen and similar anti-inflammatory drugs could be “an aggravating factor” in COVID-19 infections.

“In the case of fever, take paracetamol,” he wrote.
The French minister stressed that patients already being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs should ask advice from their doctor.
Paracetamol must be taken strictly according to the recommended dose, because too much of it can damage the liver.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected around 190,000 people worldwide and killed more than 7,800, causes mild symptoms in most people, but can result in pneumonia and in some cases severe illness that can lead to multiple organ failure.
Even before the pandemic, French authorities sounded the alarm over serious “infectious complications” linked to the use of ibuprofen, which is sold under various brands like Nurofen and Advil, and other anti-inflammatory drugs.
A spokesperson for British pharmaceutical company Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Nurofen, said in an email statement that the company was aware of concerns raised about “the use of steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) products, including ibuprofen, for the alleviation of COVID-19 symptoms.”
“Consumer safety is our number one priority,” the spokesperson said, stressing that “ibuprofen is a well-established medicine that has been used safely as a self-care fever and pain reducer, including in viral illnesses, for more than 30 years.”
“We do not currently believe there is any proven scientific evidence linking over-the-counter use of ibuprofen to the aggravation of COVID-19,” the statement said.
The spokesperson said Reckitt Benckiser was “engaging with the WHO, EMA (the European Medicines Agency) and other local health authorities” on the issue and would provide “any additional information or guidance necessary for the safe use of our products following any such evaluation.”",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FDA.jpg,COVID-19|Regulatory,0,0,Clinical Studies|Conducting|COVID-19 Pandemic|Divulges|During|FDA|Guidance,publish,19/3/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/updated-who-now-doesnt-recommend-avoiding-ibuprofen-for-covid-19-symptoms/,https://pharmashots.com/29228/fda-divulges-guidance-for-conducting-clinical-studies-during-covid-19-pandemic/
29231,Janssen Reports Submission of Ponesimod's NDA to the US FDA for the Treatment of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,Janssen Submits Ponesimod New Drug Application to the U.S. FDA for Treatment of Adults with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis',"The NDA is based on P-III OPTIMUM study assessing ponesimod (20mg) vs Aubagio (teriflunomide, 14 mg) in patients with relapsing MS
 The P-III OPTIMUM study results: reduction in ARR (30.5%); reduction in CUALs (56%); reduction in fatigue symptoms; safety profile is consistent with the previous studies
 Ponesimod is an investigational S1P1 modulator, act by inhibiting the S1P protein activity and has the potential to reduce the number of circulating lymphocytes crossing BBB","TITUSVILLE, N.J., March 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) today announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ponesimod for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).
Ponesimod is an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator that inhibits S1P protein activity and in so doing is believed to reduce the number of circulating lymphocytes that can cross the blood-brain barrier. In patients with MS, the movement of immune cells into the brain damages myelin, the protective sheath that insulates nerve cells. Damage to myelin slows or halts nerve conduction, producing the neurologic signs and symptoms of MS.i
“Nearly 1 million people over the age of 18 in the U.S. live with MSii, and approximately 85 percent of people with the condition are initially diagnosed with relapsing MS.iii Despite new advancements and treatments coming to market, a number of unmet needs still remain – leaving patients struggling to manage often-debilitating symptoms,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “In the coming months, we’ll work closely with the FDA to bring ponesimod one step closer to the MS patient community and remain encouraged by its superior efficacy profile – specifically in reducing new inflammatory lesions and disability accumulation – in comparison to a leading therapy on the market.”
The NDA is based on the head-to-head OPTIMUM Phase 3 study, which showed superior efficacy of ponesimod 20 mg on the primary endpoint of reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR), as well as most secondary endpoints, compared to Aubagio® (teriflunomide) 14 mg in adults with relapsing MS.
At week 108, a highly statistically significant reduction of 30.5 percent on ARR was observed with ponesimod when compared to Aubagio®. Additionally, a statistically significant reduction of fatigue symptoms and a 56 percent reduction on combined unique active lesions (CUALs) in the brain were observed with ponesimod compared to Aubagio®. The safety profile observed for ponesimod was consistent with previous studies of ponesimod and the known safety profile for other S1P receptor modulators.
“What’s interesting about MS is that symptoms are not always visible. Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of MS and yet, it’s one of the most challenging to manage and treat,” said Husseini Manji, M.D., F.R.C.P.C., Global Therapeutic Area Head for Neuroscience at Janssen Research & Development, LLC. “We were thrilled to see improvement in fatigue-related symptoms as part of the Phase 3 OPTIMUM trial as we know the profound impact it may have on a person’s daily life. The improvement in fatigue, coupled with reduction in ARR, demonstrate great promise for ponesimod with patients seeking a more targeted treatment option.”
The clinical study data that supports this filing was presented in September 2019 at the 35th Congress of The European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis Conference (ECTRIMS) in Stockholm, Sweden. More information may be found here.
About Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
MS is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system affecting 2.3 million people worldwide,iv with females more impacted than males.v The disease is characterized by demyelinationii and axonal loss leading to neurological impairment and severe disability.vi Relapsing forms of MS, which make up 85 percent of all MS cases, include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS.vii In addition to the debilitating neurological symptoms of the disease, patients often also suffer from “hidden symptoms,” namely fatigue and depression, both of which are major contributors to the reduced quality of life.viii Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of MS, occurring in about 80 percent of people.ix
Relapses are defined as new, worsening or recurrent neurological symptoms that last for more than 24 hours with the absence of fever or infections. Relapses may be fully resolved over days or weeks or lead to persistent residual deficits and accumulation of disability.x

 CEPI will provide initial funding to HKU for preclinical testing of their vaccine candidate and will provide further funding for clinical testing, following the results of preclinical studies
 The collaboration is a result of the global call for proposals, issued by CEPI in early Feb, which invited funding applications for proven vaccine technology which can be used to develop a vaccine against COVID-19","OSLO, NORWAY, March 18, 2020 – CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, today announced its seventh COVID-19 vaccine project. CEPI will be investing an initial US$620,000 in a partnering agreement with The University of Hong Kong (HKU) to rapidly develop a vaccine candidate against COVID-19. This collaboration brings CEPI’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine R&D to $24.3 million.
CEPI will provide initial funding to HKU to undertake preclinical testing of their vaccine candidate and will consider additional funding for further clinical testing pending results of these preclinical studies.
To date, CEPI has provided initial funding to Curevac Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., Moderna, Inc., Novavax, Inc., The University of Oxford and The University of Queensland to develop COVID-19 vaccine candidates.
This investment is a result of a recent global call for proposals that CEPI issued in early February, which invited funding applications for proven vaccine technology that could be used to rapidly develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus, and most importantly at scale and with the necessary equitable access provisions.
“
COVID-19 has now moved into the pandemic phase. It is impacting all of our lives and has shaken the economy. The spread of this virus is unprecedented in modern times. In response, CEPI is intensifying its efforts to develop a vaccine against this virus. We now have 7 COVID-19 vaccines in development, and we plan to initiate more projects in the coming days and weeks.
“
Be under no illusion – vaccine development is tough. It is complex and costly but CEPI was set-up specifically to overcome these challenges to rapidly develop vaccines against emerging infectious threats like the COVID-19 virus. There are no guarantees of success, but we are working flat out and, if all goes well, hope that a safe and effective vaccine will begin to become available for individuals at greatest risk within the next 12-18 months.
“
The only way we can vanquish the threat of COVID-19 is to invest in vaccine development now so we can protect the future health of all our societies.
Dr. Richard Hatchett
Chief Executive Officer, CEPI

“
I’m thankful for the support from CEPI. The University of Hong Kong has outstanding researchers in emerging infectious diseases. I’m hopeful the vaccine being developed in our labs will contribute to the containment of COVID-19.
Professor Xiang Zhang
President of The University of Hong Kong

The University of Hong Kong (live-attenuated influenza vaccine platform)
Researchers at the University of Hong Kong have created a vaccine candidate using a weakened version of the flu virus and have adapted it to express the surface protein of the COVID-19 virus. This approach has previously been used to develop preclinical vaccine candidates against MERS.

Urgent call for US$2 billion to develop COVID-19 vaccine
On March 6, CEPI issued an urgent call for $2 billion of new funding to enable the organisation to expand the number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development and to fund the clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. Our ambition is to have at least 3 vaccine candidates, which could be submitted to regulatory authorities for licensure for general use/use in outbreaks.
To date, the Governments of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and the UK have committed over $185 million towards our COVID-19 vaccine development efforts. CEPI still urgently needs additional financial contributions to ensure that the vaccine programmes we have initiated can continue to progress at their current pace. We call on other sovereign states, private sector partners, and philanthropies around the world to invest in CEPI’s crucial push to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 virus.
Detailed information about our funding needs is available here.
 

CEPI’s commitment to access
As COVID-19 demonstrates, infectious diseases utterly ignore political borders. We cannot prevent or stop a global infectious disease threat without equitable access to globally fair allocation of vaccines. CEPI is wholly committed to equitable access. This commitment drives every aspect of our work and the way we are approaching COVID-19 vaccine development. CEPI’s support for equitable access is key to our success as a global health organisation. Equitable access to epidemic vaccines—in the context of an outbreak—means that appropriate vaccines are first available to populations when and where they are needed to end an outbreak or curtail an epidemic, regardless of ability to pay. The COVID-19 vaccines that we are developing will exist for the benefit of all humanity, in rich, middle income, and poor countries alike.
 

About CEPI
CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has reached over US$750 million of its $1 billion funding target. CEPI’s priority diseases include Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invests in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (ie, Disease X). To date, CEPI has committed to investing nearly $480 million in vaccine and platform development.

CEPI’s work on COVID-19
The rapid global spread and unique epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are deeply concerning. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO, who is leading the development of a coordinated international response. So far, we have initiated 7 partnerships to improve our understanding and to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes will leverage rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships. The aim is to advance COVID-19 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible.

Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic, protease inhibitor-free regimen approved in the United States for adults and children.
In the United States, there are approximately 23,000-46,000 children living with HCV. Children born to mothers with HCV are a growing concern, increasing in prevalence by 60 percent from 2011 to 2014. Additionally, engagement in high‐risk practices, such as intravenous drug use, is an increasingly common route of HCV transmission in adolescents and young adults.
“While the treatment of HCV has been transformed in recent years, physicians caring for some children have still needed to take several factors into consideration, including genotype and liver disease severity, when selecting the appropriate treatment plan,” said Kathleen B Schwarz, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “The expanded approval of Epclusa can help eligible children living with HCV combat this life-threatening and debilitating disease.”
The approval of Epclusa is based on data from a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial (Study 1143) that enrolled 175 children who were treated with Epclusa for 12 weeks, of which 173 were included in the efficacy analysis. In children 12 to <18 years old, treatment with Epclusa resulted in a cure rate (SVR12) of 93 percent (71/76) in those with genotype 1 HCV infection and 100 percent in those with genotype 2 (6/6), genotype 3 (12/12), genotype 4 (2/2) and genotype 6 (6/6) HCV infection. In children 6 to <12 years old, the SVR rate was 93 percent (50/54) in those with genotype 1 HCV infection, 91 percent (10/11) in those with genotype 3 HCV infection, and 100 percent in those with genotype 2 (2/2) and genotype 4 (4/4) HCV infection. The safety profile of Epclusa in children 6 years of age and older treated was generally consistent with that observed in clinical trials in adults. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10 percent, all grades) observed with treatment with Epclusa for 12 weeks in adults are headache and fatigue.
“Gilead’s continued commitment to HCV elimination includes bringing our medicines to the most difficult-to-cure populations and today’s decision by the FDA represents an important step toward that goal,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “With consistently high cure rates in clinical trials and in the real world, Epclusa has the potential to help many of the children living with HCV in the United States.”
For adults, Epclusa was first approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2016. A line extension application for the use of Epclusa in children aged 6 to <18 years of age is currently under review with the EMA.
The U.S. product label for Epclusa contains a BOXED WARNING for the risk of hepatitis B reactivation in HCV/HBV co-infected patients. See below for U.S. Important Safety Information.
IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR THE USE OF EPCLUSA
BOXED WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN HCV/HBV COINFECTED PATIENTS
Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating treatment with EPCLUSA. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals (DAAs) and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive, in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV, and also in patients receiving certain immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV DAAs may be increased in patients taking these other agents. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.
Contraindications
If EPCLUSA is used in combination with ribavirin (RBV), all contraindications, warnings and precautions, in particular pregnancy avoidance, and adverse reactions to RBV also apply. Refer to RBV prescribing information.
Warnings and Precautions
Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone: Amiodarone is not recommended for use with EPCLUSA due to the risk of symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in patients also taking beta blockers or with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or with advanced liver disease. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir containing regimen. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. Patients should seek immediate medical evaluation if they develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia.
Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers and/or Moderate to Potent Inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 or CYP3A4: Rifampin, St. John’s wort and carbamazepine are not recommended for use with EPCLUSA as they may significantly decrease sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir plasma concentrations.
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (≥10%, all grades) with EPCLUSA were headache and fatigue; and when used with RBV in decompensated cirrhotics were fatigue, anemia, nausea, headache, insomnia, and diarrhea.
Drug Interactions
Coadministration is not recommended with topotecan due to increased concentrations of topotecan; or with proton-pump inhibitors, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifapentine, efavirenz, and tipranavir/ritonavir due to decreased concentrations of sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir.
Consult the full Prescribing Information for EPCLUSA for more information on potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments.
INDICATION
EPCLUSA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older or weighing at least 17 kg with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis and in combination with ribavirin for those with decompensated cirrhosis.

29285,FDA Recommends Avoiding the Use of NSAIDs for COVID-19 Symptoms,FDA advises patients on use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for COVID-19,"The US FDA reports that the use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can worsen COVID-19. The report followed a letter in The Lancet medical journal which hypothesized that enzyme boosted by NSAIDs and could worsen COVID-19 symptoms
 The US FDA advises the public to read the full Drug Facts Label on OTC medications before use. FDA also recommended switching to other OTC medication approved for reducing pain & fever
 The US FDA is investigating for the scientific evidence on this issue and will communicate publicly when more information is available","[3/19/2020] FDA is aware of news reports stating the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, could worsen coronavirus disease (COVID-19). These news reports followed a March 11, 2020 letter in The Lancet medical journalExternalLink Disclaimer, which hypothesized that an enzyme (a molecule that aids a biochemical reaction in the body) is increased by NSAIDs and could aggravate COVID-19 symptoms.
At this time, FDA is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, with worsening COVID-19 symptoms. The agency is investigating this issue further and will communicate publicly when more information is available. However, all prescription NSAID labels warn that “the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.”
For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are multiple over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. FDA suggests speaking to your health care professional if you are concerned about taking NSAIDs and rely on these medications to treat chronic diseases.
FDA advises the public to read the full Drug Facts Label on OTC medications prior to use. OTC medications are safe and effective when you follow the directions on the label and/or as directed by your health care professional. Patients who use prescription drugs should take these medications as directed by your health care professional and in accordance with instructions on the label.
FDA encourages health care professionals and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of any medication to FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program:

Highly sensitive and quick test with 3-hour turnaround time
 
CAMBRIDGE, MA, March 18, 2020 — BGI Genomics. Co. Ltd. (SZSE:300676) and US subsidiary BGI Americas Corp., today announced that its Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is now commercially available in the United States. With the updated guidance from FDA issued on March 16, BGI’s detection kit is eligible to be used immediately to expedite clinical testing for the novel coronavirus.
BGI is submitting a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its SARS-CoV-2 test and expects to receive formal EUA in the near future. BGI has been in regular communication with the FDA about its testing data since submitting information to the agency more than a week ago.
“We appreciate the FDA’s move to open up the market for our diagnostic test kits,” said BGI Genomics CEO Yin Ye. “Our goal is to deploy our maximum capability to support efforts to contain the virus worldwide. Our technology has been put to the test on the front lines of fighting this novel coronavirus outside the US. We are now bringing rapid and accurate testing capability at scale to bolster detection efforts throughout the US and help more patients receive accurate diagnosis.”
BGI has been on the forefront of testing for SARS-CoV-2. Following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China, BGI was among the first few companies that developed the diagnostic test that received emergency approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) on January 26, 2020, followed by CE-IVD marking on March 2, 2020. BGI quickly scaled up manufacturing and currently has a daily capacity of up to 300,000 reactions per day. BGI has performed over 500,000 SARS-CoV-2 tests in its own central laboratories in China and is distributing its SARS-CoV-2 detection kits to more than 50 countries and regions around the world.
BGI is bringing its full genomics expertise and resources to the fight against the 2019 novel coronavirus around the world. BGI’s long history of responses to public health crisis events includes decoding the genome of the SARS virus in 2003 and developing the virus detection kit in 96 hours, and helping fight the Ebola outbreak in 2014 in West Africa, where BGI quickly set up a front-line laboratory in Sierra Leone and helped the local team to develop Ebola virus detection kits.
 
About EUA
The Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR Kit for Detecting SARS-2019-nCoV has not been FDA cleared or approved. However, the FDA can issue an EUA to permit use of certain medical products that may be effective in diagnosing, treating or preventing a disease or condition, as in the case of the novel coronavirus when the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declares a public health emergency. HHS Secretary Alex Azar declared an emergency for COVID-19 on January 31. The test is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BGI.jpg,COVID-19|MedTech,0,0,Availability|BGI|Clinical Use|reports|RT-PCR|SARS-CoV-2 Test|US,publish,20/3/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/bgis-rt-pcr-sars-cov-2-test-now-commercially-available-for-clinical-use-in-the-united-states/,https://pharmashots.com/29294/bgi-reports-the-availability-of-rt-pcr-sars-cov-2-test-for-clinical-use-in-the-us/

 In 2018, NMPA has included the therapy in the first batch list of ‘urgently needed’ overseas medicines for accelerated approval
 Entyvio (IV) is a gut-selective mAb, designed to specifically antagonize the α4β7 integrin to intestinal (MAdCAM-1) but not VCAM-1 and has received marketing authorization in 60+ countries including the US and EU","March 23, 2020
Shanghai, China, and Osaka, Japan, March 23, 2020 – Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) (“Takeda”) has announced that the gut-selective biologic Entyvio® (vedolizumab) was approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). The approved indications are for adult patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD) who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to conventional therapies or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors.
Entyvio was included in the first batch list of ‘urgently needed’ overseas medicines for accelerated approval by the NMPA in 2018.
Sean Shan, President of Takeda China, said, “Many thanks to the NMPA for officially approving the availability of Entyvio for China’s patients. Its approval brings more treatment options to clinicians, and will enable more IBD patients to return to their normal daily lives.”
“The Chinese government’s determination to significantly improve access of innovative drugs, and to improve peoples’ quality of life is crystal clear. Including Entyvio in the first list of ‘urgently needed’ overseas drugs, and its accelerated approval process is a clear example of this,” Mr. Shan added. “For our part, Takeda is committed to continuing to develop and make available highly innovative medicines and will bring these novel solutions to China’s patients as fast as possible.”
About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).[1]Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, with CD potentially progressing over time.[2],[3] UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.[4],[5] CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.[4],[5] UC commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, loose bowel movements, including blood or pus.[4],[6] CD commonly presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.[2] The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to UC or CD.[4],[7],[8]
About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic and is approved in both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations.[9],[10] It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).[11] MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.[12] The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.[11] These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).[11],[13],[14] By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.[11]
Vedolizumab is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-antagonist.[9],[10] Vedolizumab has been granted marketing authorization in over 60 countries, including the United States and European Union, with more than 415,000 patient years of exposure to date.[15]
Therapeutic Indications for vedolizumab
Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
Important Safety Information for vedolizumab
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Special warnings and special precautions for use
Vedolizumab should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.
Infusion-related reactions
In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.
Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity. Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.
Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.
Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.
Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.
Please consult with your local regulatory agency for approved labeling in your country.

(Nasdaq: MSFT) on Friday announced they will leverage their existing partnership mapping population-wide adaptive immune responses to diseases at scale to study COVID-19. Finding the relevant immune response signature may advance solutions to diagnose, treat and prevent the disease, augmenting existing research efforts that primarily focus on the biology of the virus. These data will be made freely available to any researcher, public health official or organization around the world via an open data access portal.
“We can improve our collective understanding of COVID-19 by decoding the immune system’s response to the virus and the disease patterns that can be inferred from studying these data at the population level,” said Chad Robins, CEO and co-founder of Adaptive Biotechnologies. “Immune response data may enable detection of the virus in infected people not showing symptoms and improve triaging of newly diagnosed patients, potentially solving two of the challenges we are facing in the current diagnostic paradigm.”

To generate immune response data, Adaptive will open enrollment in April to collect de-identified blood samples, using a LabCorp-enabled mobile phlebotomy service, from individuals diagnosed with or recovered from COVID-19 in a virtual clinical trial managed by Covance. Immune cell receptors from these blood samples will be sequenced using Illumina platform technology and mapped to SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens that will have been confirmed by Adaptive’s proprietary immune medicine platform to induce an immune response. The immune response signature found from the initial discovery work and the initial set of samples will be uploaded to the open data access portal. Leveraging Microsoft’s hyperscale machine learning capabilities and the Azure cloud platform, the accuracy of the immune response signature will be continuously improved and updated online in real time as more trial samples are sequenced from the study.

To expedite the development and relevance of the immune response signature across the global population, the companies are seeking additional participation from institutions and research groups around the world to contribute blood samples to this open data initiative. Providence, a large health system with 51 hospitals, including the one near Seattle that treated the first U.S. COVID-19 patient, is an initial clinical collaborator.
“The solution to COVID-19 is not likely going to come from one person, one company or one country. This is a global issue, and it will be a global effort to solve it,” said Peter Lee, corporate vice president, AI and Research, Microsoft. “Making critical information about the immune response accessible to the broader research community will help advance ongoing and new efforts to solve this global public health crisis, and we can accomplish this goal through our proven TCR-Antigen mapping partnership with Adaptive.”
Timing and enrollment details about the upcoming study and the open data access portal will be coming soon. Institutions or collaborators interested in contributing blood samples can direct inquiries to COVID19ImmuneResponse@adaptivebiotech.com.

About the Adaptive and Microsoft partnership
Adaptive and Microsoft partnered in 2018 to create a TCR-Antigen Map, an approach to translating the genetics of the adaptive immune system to understand at scale how it works. Together we are using immunosequencing and machine learning to map T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences to diseases and disease-associated antigens. Using these data, we aim to develop a blood test for the early and accurate detection of many diseases, translating the natural diagnostic capability of the immune system into the clinic. In 2019, we confirmed clinical signals in two diseases, and established our first proof of concept in Lyme Disease. We expect to submit our first clinical application to the FDA in 2020.
About Adaptive Biotechnologies
Adaptive Biotechnologies is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on harnessing the inherent biology of the adaptive immune system to transform the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We believe the adaptive immune system is nature’s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our proprietary immune medicine platform reveals and translates the massive genetics of the adaptive immune system with scale, precision and speed to develop products in life sciences research, clinical diagnostics, and drug discovery. We have two commercial products, and a robust clinical pipeline to diagnose, monitor and enable the treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases.

29480,Sorrento Develops STI-4398 (COVIDTRAP Protein) to Prevent and Treat COVID-19,SORRENTO DEVELOPS STI-4398 (COVIDTRAP PROTEIN) FOR POTENTIAL PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SARS-COV-2 CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19),"The company has created a preclinical batch of the STI-4398 (COVIDTRAP) protein to begin testing its neutralization and blocking activity in preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus from infecting ACE2-expressing cells
 The in vitro cell studies for SARS-CoVID-2 virus infection and neutralization are anticipated to be conducted in the next few wks. in collaboration with world-leading coronavirus experts. STI-4398 is in the cGMP cell line development stage and could be ready for high yield production in Sorrento’s facilities in San Diego for clinical studies and commercialization following the regulatory approvals 
 STI-4398 is an ACE2-Fc protein targeting S1 domain of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and preserve the ACE2 enzyme activity in converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, resulting in reduced vasoconstriction and increased blood flow to the infected lung tissue","COVIDTRAPTM is a proprietary ACE2-Fc protein that binds to the S1 domain of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus;
COVIDTRAP is designed to block the SARS-CoV-2 virus from binding and infecting respiratory epithelial cells, which is expected to effectively interrupt the viral life cycle;
COVIDTRAP is engineered with a long half-life to provide prophylactic measures for at-risk populations (healthcare workers) with frequent exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus;
COVIDTRAP preserves the ACE2 enzymatic activity, which is important in maintaining normal blood pressure and healthy blood flow into the infected lung tissues when used in advanced COVID-19 patients; and
STI-4398 is in the cGMP cell line development stage and could be ready for large-scale production in Sorrento’s cGMP facilities in San Diego for human clinical trials and commercialization upon receipt of requisite regulatory approvals.
SAN DIEGO, March 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) announced it has produced a preclinical batch of the STI-4398 (COVIDTRAP) protein to immediately commence testing its neutralization and blocking activity in preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus from infecting ACE2-expressing cells.

STI-4398 is a proprietary ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)-Fc fusion protein (COVIDTRAP). The STI-4398 protein binds to the S1 domain of the spike protein, which is expected to block the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to bind the ACE2 receptors present on the target respiratory epithelial cells. Without the ability to penetrate target cells, the SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot replicate and spread itself. By interfering with the viral infection cycle, STI-4398 might be the most effective way to prevent an infection to progress to a fully advanced COVID-19 disease. This approach could be ideal in generating passive immunity and shielding at-risk populations, including healthcare providers, the elderly population or patients with compromised immune systems, from developing the COVID-19 disease after viral exposure.
The STI-4398 COVIDTRAP preserves the ACE2 enzyme activity in converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, resulting in reduced vasoconstriction and increased blood flow to the infected lung tissue. It could potentially confer organ protection and lessen severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Although STI-4398’s primary functionality is to interfere with the viral infection cycle, the COVIDTRAP protein with active ACE2 enzyme may have therapeutic potential for late-stage COVID-19 disease.
STI-4398 has been engineered to have a prolonged half-life in the human blood circulation, which may allow it to be used prophylactically to confer short-term and durable passive immunity (with repeated doses) to those that are regularly exposed to the virus (healthcare workers) or are at particular risk following an exposure event (elderly, patients with hypertension or immune-compromised patients).
In vitro cell studies for SARS-CoVID-2 virus infection and neutralization are expected to be conducted in the next few weeks in collaboration with world-leading coronavirus experts.
Sorrento scientists are in parallel working speedily to generate a stable CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) manufacturing cell line that would enable high-yield cGMP production of the COVIDTRAP fusion protein. Sorrento’s approximately 300,000 square feet of state-of-the-art R&D and cGMP facilities in San Diego, CA and Suzhou, China are dedicated to therapeutic antibodies and protein production and cell therapies, as well as its fill-and-finish cGMP facilities. These existing manufacturing infrastructures and capacity are available for rapid and significant scaled-up manufacturing to meet emergency demand following successful human trials. Sorrento currently anticipates it will complete the enabling studies for an expedited IND filing in the next few months.
“The COVIDTRAP candidate product developed by our scientists in the past month follows the similar approach we take to developing immune-oncology products for suppressing and/or killing off cancer cells by targeting specific tumor targets on cancer cells. We believe the same approach works for deadly viral diseases,” stated Dr. Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “Our immuno-therapy expertise is relevant and applicable to the COVID-19 disease. We are looking forward to quickly demonstrating our COVIDTRAP’s safety and efficacy in IND-enabling preclinical studies and clinical trials and make this potentially life-saving medicine available in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.”

March 23, 2020 02:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time
INCHEON, South Korea–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Celltrion Group today announced key milestones in its efforts to fight the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As part of its emergency preparedness plan to address the outbreak, which has infected over 200,000 people worldwide,1,2 Celltrion has successfully completed the first step of developing an antiviral treatment to fight COVID-19 and aims to launch a rapid self-testing diagnostic kit that could provide results within 15-20 minutes.
Celltrion has been selected as a preferred developer for a monoclonal antibody project to treat and prevent COVID-19 by the Korea Centers for Disease Control (KCDC). Korea was one of the first countries to be affected by the global pandemic.3 Celltrion has identified the library of antibodies sourced from the blood of recovered patients in Korea, which are thought to be involved in neutralising the virus and may contribute to recovery from COVID-19. These antibodies are undergoing further screening processes to identify those that are most effective in neutralising the virus causing COVID-19. Once identified these will form the basis of the antiviral treatment to be tested through pre-clinical and clinical trials around the world in the third quarter of 2020.
Furthermore, Celltrion plans to develop a ‘super antibody’ that can attach and neutralise all kinds of coronavirus related strains, such as those causing COVID-19 and SARS, enabling further protection against unforeseen or unexpected mutations. Celltrion hopes the ‘super antibody’ candidate could contribute towards preparedness for potential future pandemic situations.
Alongside therapeutic antibody development, Celltrion aims to launch a rapid self-testing diagnostic kit in the summer of this year. The kit will focus on the gene that encodes the surface spike (S) protein; an essential glycoprotein for viral entry into human host cells. The kit is designed to show results within 15-20 minutes, with optimised sensitivity, specificity and improved accuracy features. Once it has gained a CE mark, the rapid self-testing diagnostic kit will become available throughout Europe through Celltrion Healthcare. Celltrion plans to apply for device authorisation from the FDA in the US and other regulatory authorities after acquiring relevant data.
Ki-Sung Kwon, Head of R&D Division at Celltrion said, “Our COVID-19 antiviral treatment is designed to train the immune system to make antibodies that recognise and block the spike protein that the virus uses to enter human cells. Antibodies that bond to the COVID-19 antigen will also be used to develop a diagnostic kit. We implemented an emergency preparedness plan at the very start of the COVID-19 outbreak leveraging our unique antibody discovery, development and manufacturing technologies. We remain dedicated to supporting healthcare systems across the world and innovating to support patients throughout this pandemic.”

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation.

Roche accelerates delivery and production of Actemra
Roche is working around the clock to increase availability of COVID 19-tests
Roche calls on governments across the world to work closely with industry to keep manufacturing and supply running
Basel, 24 March 2020 – Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today provided an update on the various actions the company is taking to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

Roche initiates global phase III study and collects data on Actemra’s potential utility in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients
On March 19, 2020, Roche confirmed initiation of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the US Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). The study, COVACTA, will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) on top of standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo on top of standard of care.
This is the first global study of Actemra/RoActemra in this setting. In addition to the Roche trial, Roche is also carefully following independently-led clinical trials, on multiple medicines including Actemra, that are taking place around the world.
At the moment, there are no robust, well-controlled studies showing safety and efficacy of Actemra in clinical treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, and Actemra is not currently approved for this use.
Actemra Manufacturing and Supply
Despite some of the supply and logistics challenges due to COVID-19, Roche has been able to continue to deliver life-saving medicines to patients around the world, thanks to the resilience of its global network. Currently, we continue to see limited disruption, and are continually monitoring the situation.
With the announcement of new clinical trials, and a potential increase in demand for Actemra, Roche is working urgently to accelerate manufacturing capacity to maximize production of Actemra wherever possible with the goal of increasing available supply globally.
While Roche is ensuring a coordinated, global overview of additional supply requests, provision of medicines is managed on a country level according to local rules and regulations and in close collaboration with the authorities.
Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test to detect the novel virus that causes COVID-19 disease
As a leader in diagnostics, Roche is committed to providing testing solutions for the world’s most challenging healthcare emergencies. On March 12, 2020, Roche received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test to detect the novel virus that causes COVID-19 disease. The test is also available in markets accepting the CE mark.
Roche is committed to delivering as many tests as possible within the limits of supply and delivering its coronavirus tests to areas where they can be immediately effective. Tests will be shipped from Roche’s production sites to locations where appropriate infrastructure is in place and testing can begin without delay.
At the current maximum production rate, Roche can supply millions of tests per month on the cobas 6800/8800 instruments and on the MagnaPure / Lightcycler solution. Roche is working around the clock to increase that quantity as the company recognises the importance of patients having access to these critical tests.
To safeguard supply, Roche strongly advises to focus COVID-19 testing on patients with signs and symptoms of the disease, not broad testing of the healthy population.
Industry, governments and society must work together to tackle this pandemic
Roche is committed to doing all we can to ensure adequate supply of our medicines and tests during this pandemic, but we cannot do it alone. Roche is calling on governments across the world to work closely with industry to keep manufacturing and supply running, and to help us meet demand across the globe.

Ensure the free flow of vital goods across national borders to keep manufacturing and supply running;
Consider pragmatic temporary adjustments to regulations on packaging, reviews,
customs etc, to expedite delivery of urgently needed medical supplies;
Work together across governments internationally, in order to balance global needs.

 SmartPharm’s Gene mAb platform acts by neutralizing the coronavirus with an ability to produce protective Ab directly in the muscle of the individual. The companies anticipate the novel approach will enable faster progression to a clinical, pending agreement with the FDA","Collaboration to leverage synergies between Monoclonal Antibody and Non-Viral Gene Delivery Platforms
SAN DIEGO and BOSTON, March 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — In response to the government call for rapidly deployable countermeasures, Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, Sorrento) and SmartPharm Therapeutics Inc. (SmartPharm) today announced a research and development collaboration to develop a next-generation, gene-encoded antibody vaccine for COVID-19. The collaboration will utilize monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus discovered and/or generated by Sorrento that will be encoded into a gene for delivery utilizing SmartPharm’s non-viral nanoparticle platform.

“Over the past 10+ years, Sorrento has extensively utilized the G-MABTM Library, one of the largest and most diverse fully human antibody libraries in the biopharma space, for discovering potent immuno-oncology and anti-infective antibodies against over 100 drug targets. In the effort to more quickly resolve the global COVID-19 crisis, our company has initiated a rapidly accelerated program for the identification of potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antigens that may be used for either treatment or prophylaxis,” said Henry Ji, CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “We expect our platform to produce many candidate neutralizing antibodies for SmartPharm to incorporate into its powerful gene delivery platform. We look forward to our partnership with SmartPharm as part of our goal to make a meaningful impact in this truly global effort.”

“As a company founded by infectious disease physicians, including myself, we are passionate about applying our novel gene delivery platform to this national and global health crisis,” said Jose Trevejo CEO of SmartPharm Therapeutics. “Given the disproportionate mortality in elderly and immune-compromised, it is critical that we develop novel technologies that will better protect our populations that are particularly vulnerable to severe coronavirus infection.”

Unlike classical antigen-based vaccines, which rely on a patient’s immune system to establish efficacy, SmartPharm’s gene-encoded antibody platform is designed to directly neutralize the coronavirus by producing the protective antibody directly in the muscle of the individual. This gene-encoded monoclonal antibody delivery platform or Gene MAb™ bypasses the in vitro antigen production process and potential for vaccine-induced side-effects in immunized individuals. This is especially important in susceptible populations like the elderly, where antigen-based vaccines are significantly less effective for the prevention of respiratory infections such as influenza or coronavirus. The companies expect that this novel approach will enable faster progression to clinic, pending agreement with the FDA.

As part of the collaboration, Sorrento and SmartPharm expect to develop a gene-encoded antibody or antibodies that can be administered as a prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plans for the collaboration may include candidate development as well as filing of an IND application in the next few months.

 The current US supply of Actemra for approved indications is not expected to be impacted as Genentech is working with distributors to manage drug supply targeting the medical needs of the patients","Genentech will also provide 10,000 vials of Actemra to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile
Current U.S. supply of Actemra for approved indications is not expected to be impacted
South San Francisco, CA — March 23, 2020 —
Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra® (tocilizumab) plus standard of care in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
Additionally, to further support U.S. COVID-19 response efforts, Genentech will provide 10,000 vials of Actemra to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile for potential future use at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The company has robust business continuity and mitigation strategies in place, and current U.S. supply of Actemra for approved indications is not expected to be impacted. Genentech has also been working with distributors to manage product supply to enable both Genentech and our distribution partners to quickly fill orders to meet patient needs.
“We thank the FDA for rapidly expediting the approval of this clinical trial to evaluate Actemra in critically ill patients suffering from pneumonia following coronavirus infection and we’re moving forward to enroll as quickly as possible,” said Alexander Hardy, chief executive officer of Genentech. “Conducting this clinical trial in partnership with BARDA and providing Actemra to support the national stockpile, through the efforts of Secretary Azar and HHS, are important examples of how the U.S. government the biotechnology industry and healthcare communities are working together in response to this public health crisis.”
To date, several independent clinical trials have begun globally to explore the efficacy and safety of Actemra for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, this new trial is vital because there are no well-controlled studies and limited published evidence on the safety or efficacy of Actemra in the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19. In addition, Actemra is not currently approved for this use by the FDA.
For more information on how Genentech is responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic, please visit our COVID-19 response page.
About the Clinical Trial
Genentech is initiating a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study (COVACTA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous Actemra added to standard of care in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard of care. The primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status, mortality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) variables. Patients will be followed for 60 days post-randomization, and an interim analysis will be conducted to look for early evidence of efficacy.
About Actemra
Actemra was the first humanized interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have used one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate (MTX), that did not provide enough relief. The extensive Actemra RA IV clinical development program included five Phase III clinical studies and enrolled more than 4,000 people with RA in 41 countries. The Actemra RA subcutaneous clinical development program included two Phase III clinical studies and enrolled more than 1,800 people with RA in 33 countries. Actemra subcutaneous injection is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and for patients two years of age and older with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) or active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA). In addition, Actemra is also approved in the IV formulation for patients two years of age and older with active PJIA, SJIA or CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Actemra is not approved for subcutaneous use in people with CRS. It is not known if Actemra is safe and effective in children with PJIA, SJIA or CRS under two years of age or in children with conditions other than PJIA, SJIA or CRS.
Actemra is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare practitioner.
Important Safety Information
Actemra can cause serious side effects. Actemra changes the way a patient’s immune system works. This can make a patient more likely to get infections or make any current infection worse. Some people taking Actemra have died from these infections.
Actemra can cause other serious side effects. These include:

Tears of the stomach or intestines
Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)
Changes in blood test results, including low neutrophil (white blood cells) and platelet (platelets help the blood to clot) counts, and increases in certain liver function test levels and blood cholesterol levels
An increased risk of certain cancers by changing the way a patient’s immune system works
Hepatitis B infection
Serious allergic reactions, including death. These may happen with Actemra infusions or injections, even if they did not occur with an earlier infusion or injection. If a patient has had hives, a rash, or experienced flushing after injecting, the patient should tell their doctor or nurse before their next injection
Nervous system problems
Patients should not receive Actemra if they are allergic to Actemra or if they have had a bad reaction to Actemra previously.
Most common side effects in patients treated with Actemra:
Patients should tell their doctor if they have these or any other side effect that bothers them or does not go away:

Upper respiratory tract infections (like common cold and sinus infections)
Headache
Increased blood pressure (also called hypertension)
Injection site reactions

– CytomX to Receive $80 Million Upfront Payment and
Ability to Exercise Option for U.S. Co-Commercialization Rights –

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and TOKYO, March 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — CytomX Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTMX, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Sean McCarthy, D. Phil. “CytomX”) and Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) today announced they have entered into a strategic collaboration agreement focused on the discovery, research, development and commercialization of novel T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies targeting CD3 and tumor cell surface antigens for the treatment of cancer. The parties will utilize CytomX’s Probody® therapeutic technology platform, as well as its proprietary bispecific formats and CD3 modules.

“This collaboration with Astellas leverages CytomX’s deep expertise in targeting multiple antibody modalities to the tumor microenvironment,” said Sean McCarthy, D. Phil., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of CytomX. “We are excited about the use of our technology to assist Astellas in unlocking the potential of T-cell engaging bispecifics in the treatment of solid tumors, building on the growing proof of concept we have established for our platform.”

“At Astellas, immuno-oncology is a Primary Focus of our research and development strategy, and we are working on the development of next-generation cancer immuno-therapy using new modalities/technologies,” stated Naoki Okamura, Representative Director Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Astellas.“We look forward to the collaboration with CytomX, which will enable us to leverage both companies capabilities and expand our next-generation immuno-oncology therapeutic pipeline as we continue to dedicate our efforts to deliver innovative treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs.”

Probody® therapeutics are designed to remain inactive until they are activated by proteases in the tumor microenvironment. As a result, Probody® therapeutics are designed to bind selectively to tumors and minimize binding to healthy tissue, thereby reducing toxicities and potentially creating safer, more effective therapies. Probody T-cell engaging bispecifics are antibody constructs capable of directing cytotoxic T-cells to tumor microenvironments, leading to cell-mediated anti-cancer activity.

Under the agreement, CytomX and Astellas will collaborate on several initial programs. CytomX will lead research and discovery activities, up to clinical candidate selection, that will be funded by Astellas. Astellas will lead and fund preclinical and clinical development and commercialization activities. Astellas will make an upfront cash payment of $80 million to CytomX with CytomX eligible to receive future preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones of over $1.6 billion. CytomX is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on global net sales that range from high-single digits to mid-teens.

For a specified number of targets, prior to the initiation of the first pivotal clinical trial for a product directed toward such target, CytomX may exercise an option to co-fund a pre-determined portion of clinical development costs. For these products, CytomX is eligible to receive a pre-specified portion of profits in the United States and tiered low-double digit to mid-teen percentage royalties on net sales outside of the United States. CytomX may later elect to co-commercialize the products directed toward such targets in the United States.

About CytomX Therapeutics
CytomX is a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company with a vision of transforming lives with safer, more effective therapies. We are developing a novel class of investigational antibody therapeutic candidates, based on our Probody technology platform, for the treatment of cancer. As leaders in the field, our innovative technology is designed to turn previously undruggable targets into druggable targets and to enable more effective combination therapies. CytomX and its partners, comprised of leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, have developed a robust pipeline of potential best-in-class immunotherapeutic candidates against clinically validated targets and potential first-in-class therapeutic candidates against novel, difficult to drug targets. Five novel drug-candidates utilizing our Probody technology are in the clinic, with three in Phase 2 studies and two in Phase 1 studies. These clinical programs include cancer immunotherapeutic candidates against validated targets such as a PD-L1-targeting Probody therapeutic wholly owned by CytomX (CX-072) and a CTLA-4-targeting Probody therapeutic partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS-986249). The CytomX clinical stage pipeline also includes first-in-class Probody drug conjugate product candidates against previously undruggable targets, including a CD166-targeting Probody drug conjugate wholly owned by CytomX (CX-2009) and a CD71-targeting Probody drug conjugate partnered with AbbVie (CX-2029). CD166 and CD71 are among cancer targets that are considered to be inaccessible to conventional antibody drug conjugates due to their presence on many healthy tissues. In addition to its wholly owned programs, CytomX has strategic collaborations with AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

29578,Sorrento Signs an Exclusive License Agreement with Mabpharm for ACE-MAB to Treat COVID-19,SORRENTO COLLABORATES WITH MABPHARM ON DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ACE-MAB TO POTENTIALLY TREAT COVID-19,"The companies collaborate for the clinical development and commercialization of the ACE-MAB fusion protein that binds to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and treats the COVID-19
 Sorrento will be responsible for the development and commercialization of ACE-MAB in the NA and EU, while Mabpharm retains rights in the ROW, including the China and Japan
 ACE-MAB is a bi-specific fusion protein that consists of two functional arms, with one as Ab targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity and other is a truncated ACE2 protein targeting a different epitope of the spike protein","ACE-MABTM is a proprietary bi-specific fusion protein that binds to the spike protein of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which is expected to block SARS-CoV-2 from binding and infecting respiratory epithelial cells or ACE2-expressing cells to interrupt the viral life cycle
ACE-MAB is in the cGMP cell line development stage by our strategic partner, Mabpharm Limited, and could be ready for large-scale production in Mabpharm’s 30,000 m2 cGMP facilities in China for human clinical trials and commercialization upon receipt of requisite regulatory approvals
Sorrento has been granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize the ACE-MAB product candidate in the North American and European markets
SAN DIEGO, March 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) today announced it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with China-based antibody biopharmaceutical company, Mabpharm Limited (Hong Kong Stock Exchange: 2181HK, “Mabpharm”), for the clinical development and commercialization of the ACE-MAB fusion protein (Sorrento’s product code name STI-4920 and Mabpharm’s product code name CMAB020) for the potential treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Mabpharm has generated a fusion protein (CMAB020) that binds to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Designed as a bi-specific fusion protein, ACE-MAB has two functional arms. One arm (Ab) is a fully human antibody that targets the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity. The other arm (TR) is a truncated ACE2 protein that binds to a different epitope of the spike protein. The ACE-MAB fusion protein could also block the receptor binding domain (RBD) with CD147 to mitigate lung inflammation and cytokine storm. The dual-arm design could be a unique advancement, potentially providing binding to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is sufficient to prevent the virus from invading normal human cells. ACE-MAB retains the ACE2 enzymatic function, which could provide benefits such as reduced vasoconstriction and increased blood flow to infected lung tissue. The ACE2 arm competes with RBD binding to respiratory epithelial or other cells. It should preserve the ACE2 enzymatic activity, which is important in maintaining normal blood pressure and healthy blood flow into patients with infected lung tissue, which would include patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.

Under the exclusive license agreement, Sorrento will focus on the development and commercialization of ACE-MAB in the North American and European markets, while Mabpharm retains rights in the rest of the world, including the China and Japan markets.

“The license of the ACE-MAB fusion protein from our partner Mabpharm provides Sorrento with yet another potential therapeutic agent to combat COVID-19,” stated Dr. Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “Since the breakout of COVID-19, Sorrento has built a broad product candidate pipeline for the potential vaccination and treatment of COVID-19. We are looking forward to further evaluating the safety and efficacy in IND-enabling preclinical studies and clinical trials and making these potentially Life-Saving medicines available to the vast population affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

 Procysbi (cysteamine bitartrate) is a delayed-release capsules and delayed-release oral granules also a cystine-depleting agent indicated to treat nephropathic cystinosis in adults and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older
 Procysbi will continue to be available in 25 mg and 75 mg strengths while the 75mg and 300mg is expected to be available in H1’20'","DUBLIN–Horizon Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: HZNP) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PROCYSBI® (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release oral granules in packets for adults and children one year of age and older living with nephropathic cystinosis. This new dosage form provides another option for people living with cystinosis, in addition to the currently available PROCYSBI capsules.
Both the capsules and the packets contain the same PROCYSBI granules, also called microbeads, that provide 12 hours of cystine control. Providing oral granules in packets offers a tear-open option for those living with cystinosis who may have difficulty swallowing, need to sprinkle the granules on certain foods or liquids, or administer medication through a gastrostomy tube (g-tube). Families living with cystinosis are often challenged with managing multiple, different medications on daily basis and the oral granules in tear-open packets will provide an alternative option for accessing PROCYSBI day-to-day.
“We would like to thank the families and health professionals in the cystinosis community who provided feedback and guidance as the packets were developed and helped to ensure this alternative to opening individual capsules to remove the granules provides meaningful benefit,” said Jeffrey D. Kent, M.D., FACG, FACP, executive vice president, medical affairs and outcomes research, Horizon. “Having two options will allow families and physicians to select what is best for them and reflects our continued commitment to invest in creating solutions for patients and families based on their needs.”
PROCYSBI oral granules in packets in 75 mg and 300 mg strengths are expected to be available in the first half of the year. PROCYSBI capsules will continue to be available in 25 mg and 75 mg strengths.
About Nephropathic Cystinosis
Nephropathic cystinosis is a rare, life-threatening metabolic lysosomal storage disorder that causes toxic accumulation of cystine in all cells, tissues, and organs in the body. If untreated, elevated cystine accumulation leads to progressive, irreversible tissue damage and multi-organ failure, including kidney failure, blindness, muscle wasting and premature death. It is estimated that only about 2,000 people worldwide are currently diagnosed with nephropathic cystinosis. Nephropathic or “classic infantile” cystinosis – the most common and most severe form of the disease – is typically diagnosed in infancy and requires lifelong cystine depleting therapy.1
About PROCYSBI
PROCYSBI (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules and delayed-release oral granules is a cystine-depleting agent indicated for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in adults and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Patients with serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis to penicillamine or cysteamine.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome: Skin and bone lesions that resemble clinical findings for Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome have been reported in patients treated with high doses of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate or other cysteamine salts. Monitor patients for development of skin or bone lesions and reduce PROCYSBI dosing if patients develop these lesions.
Skin Rash: Severe skin rashes such as erythema multiforme bullosa or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Discontinue use if severe skin rash occurs.
Gastrointestinal (GI) Ulcers and Bleeding: GI ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Monitor for GI symptoms and consider decreasing the dose if severe symptoms occur.
Central Nervous System (CNS) Symptoms: CNS symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been associated with immediate-release cysteamine. Monitor for CNS symptoms; interrupt or reduce the dose for severe symptoms or those that persist or progress.
Leukopenia and/or Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels: Cysteamine has been associated with reversible leukopenia and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Monitor white blood cell counts and alkaline phosphatase levels; decrease or discontinue the dose until values revert to normal.
Benign Intracranial Hypertension: Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri; PTC) and/or papilledema has been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of PTC; interrupt or reduce the dose for signs/symptoms that persist, or discontinue if diagnosis is confirmed.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most common adverse reactions reported in PROCYSBI clinical trials (≥ 5%): were:

Patients 2 years of age and older previously treated with cysteamine: vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, conjunctivitis, influenza, gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, dehydration, ear infection, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, arthralgia, cough, and pain in extremity.
Patients 1 year of age and older naïve to cysteamine treatment: vomiting, gastroenteritis/viral gastroenteritis, diarrhea, breath odor, nausea, electrolyte imbalance, headache.
DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drugs that increase gastric pH may alter the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine due to the premature release of cysteamine from PROCYSBI and increase WBC cystine concentration. Monitor WBC cystine concentration with concomitant use.
Consumption of alcohol with PROCYSBI may increase the rate of cysteamine release and/or adversely alter the pharmacokinetic properties, as well as the effectiveness and safety of PROCYSBI.
PROCYSBI can be administered with electrolyte (except bicarbonate) and mineral replacements necessary for management of Fanconi Syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Lactation: Because of the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children from cysteamine, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with PROCYSBI.

29637,Merck KGaA's Tepmetko (tepotinib) Receives the Japanese MHLW's Approval for Advanced NSCLC with METex14 Skipping Alterations,TEPMETKO (Tepotinib) Approved in Japan for Advanced NSCLC with METex14 Skipping Alterations,"The approval is based on ongoing P-II VISION study assessing Tepmetko in 99 patients (including 15 Japanese patients) with NSCLC and METex14 skipping alterations 
 The P-II VISION study results: ORR as assessed by IRC (42.4%) in patients identified by LBx/ TBx; mDOR (12.4mos) for both LBx/TBx identified. Additionally, in the safety analysis of 130 patients, Tepmetko was well tolerated
 Tepmetko (500mg, qd) is an oral MET inhibitor in Japan to be approved for the line-agnostic treatment of advanced NSCLC with MET exon 14 (METex14) skipping alterations and has received FDA’s BT designation in Sept’2019 with its anticipated regulatory filing to the US FDA in 2020","Not intended for distribution in the USA, Canada or UK
TEPMETKO is the first and only therapy in Japan to be approved for line-agnostic treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon 14 (METex14) skipping alterations
In Phase II VISION study METex14 skipping alterations were identified by liquid or tissue biopsy
TEPMETKO has been approved in Japan on the basis of demonstrating meaningful benefit in objective response across different lines of treatment, and is administered as a once-daily oral dose
Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved TEPMETKO®* (tepotinib) for the treatment of patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with MET exon 14 (METex14) skipping alterations. TEPMETKO is administered 500 mg once daily as two 250 mg tablets. This is the first regulatory approval globally for an oral MET inhibitor indicated for the treatment of advanced NSCLC harboring MET gene alterations. TEPMETKO was previously granted SAKIGAKE ’fast-track’ designation and orphan drug designation by the MHLW.
“With TEPMETKO, we are pleased to offer the first approved MET inhibitor in Japan, and a new option that can change the course of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer harboring METex14 skipping alterations,” said Belén Garijo, CEO Healthcare and Member of the Executive Board of Merck. “With a focus on identifying these alterations in NSCLC patients with flexibility and precision, the companion diagnostic to TEPMETKO offers both liquid and tissue biopsy testing capabilities to best support the delivery of this targeted therapy to the patients who may benefit.”
The approval of TEPMETKO (tepotinib) in Japan is supported by data from 99 patients (including 15 Japanese patients) with NSCLC with METex14 skipping alterations enrolled in the ongoing single-arm Phase II VISION study.1 The primary endpoint, objective response rate as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), was 42.4% (95% CI: 32.5, 52.8) in patients identified by liquid biopsy (LBx) or tissue biopsy (TBx). The median duration of response based on independent assessment was 12.4 months for both LBx-identified (95% CI: 8.4 months, not evaluable) and TBx-identified patients (95% CI: 9.7 months, NE). In a safety analysis of 130 patients, tepotinib was well-tolerated; the most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were peripheral edema (53.8%), nausea (23.8%) and diarrhea (20.8%). TRAEs led to permanent discontinuation in 11 patients (8.5%).
“Identifying oncogenic drivers in order to guide the course of treatment for lung cancer patients is a clinical best practice; however, there previously was no approved therapy that specifically targeted MET alterations in metastatic NSCLC,” said Hiroshi Sakai, M.D., Director, Division of Thoracic Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, Japan. “With the approval of TEPMETKO, we now have a new treatment option that addresses this need, offering clinical benefit and duration of response with convenient once-daily oral dosing, representing real progress for patients with this aggressive type of lung cancer.”
Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide, with 2 million cases diagnosed annually,2 and is the second most common type of cancer in Japan.3 Alterations of the MET signaling pathway are found in various cancer types, including 3% to 5% of NSCLC cases, and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis.4-6
Merck has a strategic partnership with ArcherDX to develop a companion diagnostic featuring both liquid and tissue biopsy capabilities to identify METex14 skipping alterations among patients with NSCLC with high precision and accuracy prior to treatment. The companion diagnostic received approval by MHLW in March 2020, and it is the first and only companion diagnostic to be approved for the detection of MET gene alterations. ArcherDX is a genomic analysis company dedicated to democratizing precision oncology through a suite of products and services that are accurate, personal, actionable and easy to use in local settings.
Discovered in-house at Merck, tepotinib is an oral MET inhibitor that is designed to inhibit the oncogenic MET receptor signaling caused by MET (gene) alterations, including both METex14 skipping alterations and MET amplifications, or MET protein overexpression.
In September 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tepotinib in patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring METex14 skipping alterations who progressed following platinum-based cancer therapy. Merck plans to file tepotinib for regulatory review with the FDA in 2020. Tepotinib is also being investigated in the INSIGHT 2 study (NCT03940703) in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated, MET amplified, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that has acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKI.
*The brand name TEPMETKO® is not approved for use outside of Japan.

“Twirla is an important addition to available hormonal contraceptive methods, allowing prescribers to now offer appropriate U.S. women a weekly transdermal option that delivers estrogen levels in line with labeled doses of many commonly prescribed oral contraceptives,” said Dr. David Portman, a primary investigator on the SECURE clinical trial. “I’m pleased that Agile conducted a comprehensive study in a diverse population providing important data to prescribers and to women seeking contraception. It is vital to expand the full range of contraceptive methods and inform the choices that fit an individual’s family planning needs and lifestyle. I am excited healthcare providers can now include Twirla among available contraception options.”
Twirla is designed for weekly application to deliver a 30 mcg daily dose of ethinyl estradiol, a type of estrogen, along with a 120 mcg daily dose of levonorgestrel, a well-known progestin with a long history in the category. The newly approved patch can be worn on the abdomen, buttock, or upper torso (excluding the breasts).
“The FDA’s approval of Twirla will enable us to deliver on our short-term goal of establishing Agile in the contraceptive prescription market and working towards our longer-term mission to broaden our women’s health portfolio, including in areas of unmet need. We are grateful to the clinical trial patients, researchers, healthcare providers, and advocates, whose contributions helped us secure the approval of a new transdermal contraceptive option that may serve the contraceptive needs and preferences of many women,” said Al Altomari, chairman and chief executive officer, Agile Therapeutics. “We are proud to offer this new option and look forward to bringing Twirla to women and their healthcare providers.”
As part of Twirla’s approval, the FDA is requiring Agile to conduct a long-term prospective, observational post-marketing study comparing the risks for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism (ATE) in new users of Twirla to new users of other combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC). The FDA’s requirement for Twirla is similar to another post-marketing study requirement for a recently approved CHC. The final study report for the Twirla study is scheduled to be submitted to the FDA in November 2032, with interim safety data reporting to the FDA due in November 2026. Agile has also agreed to a post-marketing commitment (PMC) study to assess the residual drug content and strength of Twirla in a minimum of 25 women, which will analyze the Twirla ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel content after the prescribed wear and will monitor adhesion. The PMC is similar to residual drug studies requested of patch developers in the FDA’s November 2019 draft guidance entitled Transdermal and Topical Delivery Systems – Product Development and Quality Considerations. The Company plans to begin designing the post-approval studies and evaluating related costs during the first half of 2020.
With the approval of Twirla, Agile will accelerate its commercial activities. In the first quarter of 2020, Agile plans to initiate work with managed care and patient payors to gain market access for Twirla. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Company plans to hire and train an initial sales team. In parallel with these activities, Agile plans to complete the validation of its commercial manufacturing process and expects to ship initial product to wholesalers in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company believes that the potential new CHC users who have a BMI <30 kg/m2 represent a significant population of women. Based on the Company’s market research, analysis of the current and expected future U.S. contraceptive market, and review of other product launches in the category, the Company estimates that Twirla can potentially achieve a peak market share of 5-8%. As the Company prepares for the commercialization of Twirla, it will continue to analyze the contraceptive market and update its market research as it evaluates the commercial opportunity for Twirla.
About Twirla
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS and CONTRAINDICATED IN WOMEN WITH A BMI ≥ 30 KG/M2
Cigarette Smoking and Serious Cardiovascular Events
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, CHCs, including TWIRLA, are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. Contraindicated in Women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2
TWIRLA is contraindicated in women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. Compared to women with a lower BMI, women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 had reduced effectiveness and may have a higher risk for venous thromboembolism events (VTEs).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
TWIRLA is contraindicated and should not be used in women with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic disease, including women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2; have headaches with focal neurological symptoms, migraine with aura, women over 35 years of age with any migraine headache; liver tumors, acute viral hepatitis, or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis, or liver disease; undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding; pregnancy; current or history of breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancer; hypersensitivity to any components of TWIRLA; and use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paraparesis/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Conditions-
Women are at increased risk for a venous thromboembolic event (VTE) when using TWIRLA
Stop TWIRLA if an arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic event occurs
Stop TWIRLA if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately
Discontinue TWIRLA during prolonged immobilization and, if feasible, stop TWIRLA at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery
Start TWIRLA no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who are not breast-feeding
Before starting TWIRLA, evaluate any past medical history or family history of thromboembolism or thromboembolic disorders and consider whether history suggests inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathy
Arterial Events- CHCs increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, particularly among older women (> 35 years of age), smokers, and women with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or obesity.

Liver Disease- Discontinue TWIRLA if jaundice develops
Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment- Discontinue TWIRLA prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. TWIRLA can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.
Hypertension- Monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop TWIRLA if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women using CHCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use.
Gallbladder Disease- Studies suggest CHCs increase risk of developing gallbladder disease and may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.
Adverse Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects-
TWIRLA may decrease glucose tolerance. Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are using TWIRLA.
Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. TWIRLA may cause adverse lipid changes. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may have an increase in serum triglyceride concentrations when using TWIRLA, which may increase the risk of pancreatitis.
Headache- If a woman using TWIRLA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue TWIRLA if indicated. Consider discontinuation of TWIRLA if there is any increased frequency or severity of migraines during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).
Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea- Women using TWIRLA may experience unscheduled bleeding, especially during the first three months of use, or experience absence of scheduled bleeding. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on TWIRLA, or if scheduled bleeding does not occur, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or, in the case of unscheduled bleeding, malignancy.
Other Warnings and Precautions- Other warnings and precautions include, depression, cervical cancer, increased serum concentrations of binding globulins, hereditary angioedema, and chloasma. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The following serious adverse reactions occurred in <1% of women who received TWIRLA: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, major depression, suicidal ideation, appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis. A total of four VTEs in TWIRLA-treated patients were identified in the Phase 3 clinical trial. The most common adverse reactions (≥2%) in clinical trials for TWIRLA are application site disorders, nausea, headache, dysmenorrhea, and increased weight.
Patients should be counseled that TWIRLA does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of TWIRLA or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with TWIRLA.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
TWIRLA is indicated as a method of contraception for use in women of reproductive potential with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 for whom a combined hormonal contraceptive is appropriate.
Limitations of Use:
Consider TWIRLA’s reduced effectiveness in women with a BMI ≥ 25 to < 30 kg/m2 before prescribing TWIRLA. TWIRLA is contraindicated in women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.
This is not a comprehensive list of safety information related to TWIRLA.

Companies to collaborate to achieve delivery of siRNA molecules to liver, heart, lung and other tissues Silence retains the option to co-develop two programs discovered through the collaboration
Webcast and conference call today at 1pm GMT
LONDON – Silence Therapeutics plc (LON: SLN) (“Silence”) today announced a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca to discover, develop and commercialize small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics for the
treatment of Cardiovascular, Renal, Metabolic and Respiratory diseases. The collaboration draws on Silence’s extensive experience as a leader in the discovery, development and delivery of siRNA therapeutics together with AstraZeneca’s industry leading expertise in disease biology and target identification with the aim of developing first-in-class and differentiated therapeutics to address significant unmet need.
AstraZeneca will make an upfront cash payment of $60 million and an equity investment of $20 million in Silence. The parties anticipate initiating work on five targets within the first three years of the collaboration, with AstraZeneca having the option to extend the collaboration to a further five targets. Silence will harness its established GalNAc-siRNA platform to inhibit liver expressed gene targets and the
companies will collaborate to achieve targeted delivery of siRNA molecules to other tissues including heart, kidney and lung. Delivery of siRNA molecules to the liver hepatocytes is an established approach;
targeted delivery to these other tissue types represents a new and compelling opportunity to treat Cardiovascular, Renal, Metabolic and Respiratory diseases.
Under the collaboration, Silence will be responsible for designing siRNA molecules against gene targets selected by AstraZeneca, and for manufacturing of material to support GLP toxicology studies and Phase I
clinical studies. AstraZeneca and Silence will collaborate during discovery phase and AstraZeneca will lead clinical development and commercialization of molecules arising from the collaboration. Silence will have
the option to negotiate for co-development of two programs of their choice starting from Phase II. AstraZeneca will pay Silence an option fee of $10 million for each selected target at the point of candidate
nomination and thereafter for each target selected Silence will be eligible for up to $140 million in development milestones and up to $250 million in commercialization milestones as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from high single digit to low double digit. Iain Ross, Executive Chairman at Silence said “We are delighted to announce this collaboration with
AstraZeneca as it is a further validation of our proprietary siRNA platform. It not only provides us with an opportunity to collaborate on specific liver expressed gene targets but also to work with a leading company
to achieve targeted delivery of siRNA molecules to other tissues including heart, kidney and lung.” Mene Pangalos, EVP BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca said “This collaboration with Silence adds an
exciting new modality, siRNA, into our drug discovery toolbox. Importantly we can apply this drug modality across our key therapy areas in cardiovascular, renal and metabolism and respiratory to target novel
pathways not amenable to more traditional drug discovery approaches.”

– Biohaven to host investor conference call on Friday, February 28, 2020 at 8:00 am ET

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Feb. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved NURTEC™ ODT (rimegepant) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. NURTEC ODT is the first FDA-approved product for Biohaven, a company dedicated to advancing innovative therapies for neurological diseases.

A single quick-dissolving tablet of NURTEC ODT can provide fast pain relief and return patients to normal function within one hour, and deliver sustained efficacy that lasts up to 48 hours for many patients. NURTEC ODT disperses almost instantly in a person’s mouth without the need for water, offering people with migraine a convenient, discreet way to take their medication anytime and anywhere they need it. NURTEC ODT is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine. Biohaven expects topline results from its prevention of migraine trial later this quarter.
Vlad Coric, M.D., CEO of Biohaven commented, “The FDA approval of NURTEC ODT marks an important milestone for the migraine community and a transformative event for Biohaven. Millions of people suffering from migraine are often not satisfied with their current acute treatment, at times having to make significant tradeoffs because of troublesome side effects and reduced ability to function. NURTEC ODT is an important new oral acute treatment for migraine that offers patients the potential to quickly reduce and eliminate pain and get back to their lives.” Dr. Coric added, “We believe NURTEC ODT will be the first of many innovative Biohaven medicines to become available to treat devastating neurological diseases, a therapeutic category many other companies have abandoned. We are dedicated to helping patients with these conditions, who often have limited or no treatment options, live better, more productive lives.”
NURTEC ODT, with its novel quick-dissolve oral tablet formulation, works by blocking CGRP receptors, treating a root cause of migraine. NURTEC ODT is not an opioid or narcotic, does not have addiction potential and is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
NURTEC ODT may offer an alternative treatment option, particularly for patients who experience inadequate efficacy, poor tolerability, or have a contraindication to currently available therapies. More than 3,100 patients have been treated with rimegepant with more than 113,000 doses administered in clinical trials, including a one-year long-term safety study. In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, NURTEC ODT was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse reaction was nausea (2%) in patients who received NURTEC ODT compared to 0.4% of patients who received placebo.
Mary Franklin, Executive Director of the National Headache Foundation commented, “Everyone knows someone living with migraine, yet it remains an invisible disease that is often overlooked and misunderstood. Almost all people with migraine need an acute treatment to stop a migraine attack as it occurs, which can happen without warning. The approval of NURTEC ODT is exciting for people with migraine as it provides a new treatment option to help people regain control of their attacks and their lives.”
Peter Goadsby, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Neurology and Director of the King’s Clinical Research Facility, King’s College Hospital commented, “I see many patients in my practice whose lives are disrupted by migraine, afraid to go about everyday life in case of a migraine attack. Many feel unsure if their acute treatment will work and if they can manage the side effects. With the FDA approval of NURTEC ODT, there is renewed hope for people living with migraine that they can get back to living their lives without fear of the next attack.”
The FDA approval of NURTEC ODT is based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (Study 303) and the long-term, open-label safety study (Study 201). In the Phase 3 trial, NURTEC ODT achieved statistical significance on the regulatory co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from most bothersome symptom (MBS) at two hours post dose compared to placebo. NURTEC ODT also demonstrated statistical superiority at one hour for pain relief (reduction of moderate or severe pain to no pain or mild pain) and return to normal function. The benefits of pain freedom, pain relief, return to normal function and freedom from MBS were sustained up to 48 hours for many patients. Importantly, these benefits were seen with only a single dose of NURTEC ODT. Eighty-six percent of patients treated with NURTEC ODT did not require rescue medication (e.g. NSAIDS, acetaminophen) within 24 hours post dose. The long-term safety study assessed the safety and tolerability of rimegepant with multiple doses used over up to one year. The study evaluated 1,798 patients, who used rimegepant 75 mg as needed to treat migraine attacks, up to one dose per day. The study included 1,131 patients who were exposed to rimegepant for at least six months, and 863 who were exposed for at least one year, all of whom treated an average of at least two migraine attacks per month. The safety of treating more than 15 migraines in a 30-day period has not been established.
NURTEC ODT is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rimegepant, NURTEC ODT, or to any of its components. Hypersensitivity reactions with dyspnea and severe rash, including delayed serious hypersensitivity days after administration, occurred in less than 1% of subjects taking NURTEC ODT in clinical studies.

Sample packs containing two tablets will also be made available to healthcare providers. Patients with migraine should discuss with their primary care provider or neurologist whether NURTEC ODT is appropriate for them.
About NURTEC ODT
NURTEC™ ODT (rimegepant) is the first and only calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist available in a quick-dissolve ODT formulation that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The activity of the neuropeptide CGRP is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. NURTEC ODT is a CGRP receptor antagonist that works by reversibly blocking CGRP receptors, thereby inhibiting the biologic activity of the CGRP neuropeptide. The recommended dose of NURTEC ODT is 75 mg, taken as needed, up to once daily. For more information about NURTEC ODT, visit www.nurtec.com.
About Migraine
Nearly 40 million people in the U.S. suffer from migraine and the World Health Organization classifies migraine as one of the 10 most disabling medical illnesses. Migraine is characterized by debilitating attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that can be associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia). There is a significant unmet need for new acute treatments as more than 90 percent of migraine sufferers are unable to work or function normally during an attack.
About CGRP Receptor Antagonism
Small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of migraine. This unique mode of action potentially offers an alternative to current agents, particularly for patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans, or who have a poor response to triptans or are intolerant to them.
What is NURTEC ODT? 
NURTEC™ ODT (rimegepant) is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.
Limitations of Use
NURTEC ODT is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine.
Important Safety Information
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to NURTEC ODT or any of its components.
Warnings and Precautions: If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue NURTEC ODT and initiate appropriate therapy. Serious hypersensitivity reactions have included dyspnea and rash, and can occur days after administration.
Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reaction was nausea (2% in patients who received NURTEC ODT compared to 0.4% in patients who received placebo). Hypersensitivity, including dyspnea and rash, occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with NURTEC ODT.
Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A or inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP. Avoid another dose of NURTEC ODT within 48 hours when it is administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4.
Use in Specific Populations:
Pregnant/breast feeding: It is not known if NURTEC ODT can harm an unborn baby or if it passes into breast milk.

The I-Cell vaccine is expected to elicit both T cell and B cell immunities against SARS-CoV-2
Sorrento is in active discussions with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to gain guidance on rapid development of this novel vaccine (IND# 019724), with a goal to start enrolling in a human clinical trial as early as mid-year 2020
Sorrento anticipates its existing cGMP cell therapy manufacturing facilities will have the capacity to produce enough drug substance to meet the demand for millions of monthly doses of the final drug product (vaccine), if approved
The strategic approach that inspired the I-Cell cellular vaccination strategy has been published as a short communication in “Medicine in Drug Discovery” (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100026)
SAN DIEGO, March 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE, “Sorrento”) today announced it has been working on a novel decoy cellular vaccine for COVID-19 (STI-6991) and is in active discussions with the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research under IND#019724 regarding the required IND-enabling studies, CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and controls), clinical protocol and end-points for potential accelerated approval. Upon receiving guidance from the FDA, Sorrento intends to submit a full package for an IND filing that would enable human clinical trials to start as soon as possible.

The decoy cell strategy (I-Cell™, which means immune-training cells) has been conceptualized and developed by Sorrento scientists utilizing expertise acquired in the fight against cancer. Sorrento expects to utilize a well-known replicating cell line (human erythroleukemia, K562) to incorporate SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein or its S1 domain onto the cellular membrane so that the viral antigen is presented on a decoy cell surface to elicit both T cell and B cell immunities. The selected cell line has been used safely in cancer vaccination programs and is well characterized (clinical trials using K562 expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor have been used as a tumor vaccine). Upon expression of the viral protein as a surface marker, the decoy cell “looks like” the virus to a healthy person’s immune system. After irradiation to prevent the replication of the cells, the cells can be administered by intramuscular injection as a vaccine. In the presence of this “look alike” training cell, the recipient may develop a protective immune response and produce corresponding neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the vaccinated subject is later exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, his or her T cell immunity and neutralizing antibodies are expected to block the spike protein from attaching to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) on the normal human cell surface, thus potentially attenuating or preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection which causes COVID-19 disease.

A short communication explaining this vaccination approach was accepted for publication by Medicine in Drug Discovery (an Elsevier peer reviewed open access journal. The article can be found at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300130?via%3Dihub). Per the publication, “the overall strategy to utilize a viral antigen-expressing, non-replicating cellular system as both a carrier, and as an immunogenic antigen-presenting platform is novel. The view is that this platform will be recognized by the immune system, and a neutralizing antibody response will ensue. The most important aspect of the platform is that it should allow for dendritic cells to recruit T lymphocytes and induce Th1 cell polarization that if feasible will also induce a cytotoxic T cell response and thus clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strategy should be safe as they are using K562 cell line that is HLA negative. The platform appears to be readily scalable and would appear to provide uniform cell product. One key aspect is that will the vaccine prevent engraftment and proliferation after host implantation; the answer here appears to be yes as the cells will be irradiated post-expansion in order to abolish their replication ability and thus no in vivo cell growth. In sum an intriguing platform is put forth and if viable as it appears to be it could make an impact on the treatment of COVID-19.”1

Sorrento is currently working to demonstrate I-Cells’ ability to generate protective T cell and B cell immunities in an animal model. Sorrento has identified a leading infectious disease contract research organization to support the phase 1 clinical trial and accelerated timelines. Sorrento has begun process development, validation and scaled up manufacturing testing in its state-of-the-art cGMP cell therapy facilities in San Diego in anticipation of registrational clinical trials and commercialization.

Sorrento anticipates all IND requirements will be fulfilled in the next few months. Depending on government support and the FDA’s response, Sorrento believes it may be in a position to initiate human vaccination trials as early as mid-year 2020.

David Epstein, former CEO of Novartis Pharmaceuticals, a division of Novartis AG, who has been advising Sorrento, said, “This promising vaccination strategy is uniquely suited for rapid scale up and advancement into the clinic. I am hopeful because this novel approach can make a difference in the lives of so many.”

“We have developed a novel approach to vaccination that we believe can be a breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19. We believe using a human cell as a training agent is unique and likely to be effective for vaccination,” stated Dr Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics. “By utilizing an existing cell line that has previously been used to make cancer vaccines, we know we have a product candidate with a promising safety profile. We are very confident that, if our product candidate is approved, we will have the required capacity in place to produce enough doses to protect millions of people in the near term. Confirming that I-Cell works in humans is our top priority and our most immediate focus.”

ANJESO Is The Only Approved 24-Hour, Intravenous COX-2 Preferential NSAID that Offers Once-Daily Dosing

U.S. Commercial Launch Planned to Commence in Late April or Early May 2020

Management to Host Conference Call and Webcast Today at 4:30 p.m. ET

MALVERN, Pa., Feb. 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Baudax Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ:BXRX), a pharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics for acute care settings, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for ANJESO™ (meloxicam injection), which is indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain, alone or in combination with other non-NSAID analgesics.

“The approval of ANJESO marks a major advancement in the treatment landscape for managing moderate to severe pain,” said Gerri Henwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Baudax Bio. “With our nation currently in the midst of a national opioid epidemic, we are thrilled to be able to offer a novel, non-opioid therapeutic option with the potential to meaningfully impact the acute pain treatment paradigm. We expect to make ANJESO available to physicians and patients in late April or early May 2020.”

ANJESO is approved for the management of moderate to severe pain and will be administered as a once-a-day intravenous (IV) bolus push. ANJESO is the only available 24-hour, intravenous (IV) COX-2 preferential non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) and offers once-daily dosing. The active ingredient meloxicam is a long-acting, preferential COX-2 inhibitor that possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities, which are believed to be related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase type 2 pathway (COX-2) and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin biosynthesis.

“The safety and efficacy of ANJESO have been well-established through several mid- and late-stage clinical studies,” said Stewart McCallum, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Baudax Bio. “Moreover, data from our Phase III safety trial demonstrated that ANJESO is well tolerated and impacted opioid consumption compared to placebo, further highlighting its value to patients, providers and health systems.”

“The approval of ANJESO marks an important achievement for the medical community given the unmet need for non-opioid options in the pain treatment landscape,” said Dr. Keith Candiotti chair of the Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Medicine and Pain Management at the University of Miami. “While traditional opioid medications have proven effective at providing pain relief, the associated adverse side effects, including sedation and respiratory depression, have driven physicians to employ a multi-modal approach to treating post-operative pain. With 24-hour, durable pain relief and a safety profile comparable to placebo, ANJESO has the potential to serve as a meaningfully differentiated analgesic alternative.”

The ANJESO approval is supported by two Phase III efficacy studies and one double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III safety study. The results from these studies, as well as results from four Phase II clinical studies and other safety studies, comprised the NDA package.

The most common ADVERSE REACTIONS reported in ≥2% of patients treated with ANJESO and at a greater frequency than placebo included: constipation, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased and anemia.

Please see “News & Investors” section of the Company’s website at www.baudaxbio.com for full Prescribing Information in addition to the full Important Safety Information provided below.

Baudax expects ANJESO will be available in the U.S. in late April or early May 2020. For more information, visit www.baudaxbio.com.

ANJESO™ COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL TRIALS

Phase 3 Efficacy Study Evaluating ANJESO Following Bunionectomy Surgery

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 201 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a postoperative regimen of ANJESO (30mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, once every 24 hours for up to 3 doses following bunionectomy surgery, a representative hard tissue surgery. The ANJESO treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SPID48 (p=0.0034) compared to the placebo arm. The study also achieved 15 of the 19 secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in SPID6 (p=0.0153), SPID12 (p=0.0053), SPID24 (p=0.0084), SPID24-48 (p=0.0050), time to first use of rescue medication (p=0.0076), and several other rescue use and pain relief metrics during the first 48 hours, compared to placebo. The safety results demonstrated that ANJESO was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or bleeding events in the ANJESO-treated patients.

Phase 3 Efficacy Study Evaluating ANJESO Following Abdominoplasty Surgery

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 219 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a postoperative regimen of ANJESO (30mg bolus injection) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, once every 24 hours. The ANJESO treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SPID24 (p=0.0145) compared to the placebo arm. The study also achieved statistical significance for 10 of the secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in SPID12 (p=0.0434), time to perceptible pain relief (p=0.0050), subjects with ≥30% improvement at 24 hours (p=0.0178), number of times patients required rescue in the first 24 hours after randomization (p=0.0275), as well as number of times rescued from 24 to 48 hours (p=0.0009), and several other pain relief metrics, compared to placebo. The safety results demonstrated that ANJESO was well tolerated with no difference in serious adverse events (SAEs) related to bleeding for ANJESO treated patients versus placebo (1 each).

Phase 3 Safety Study Evaluating ANJESO Following Major Surgery

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial, included patients who had undergone major elective surgical procedures which were expected to result in hospitalization for at least 24-48 hours. Major surgical procedures included total hip and knee replacements, spinal, GI, hernia repair, and gynecologic surgeries, as well as a range of other surgeries. Patient demographics were balanced across treatment groups and included 40% male patients and about 23% of patients who were over age 65. Unlike the pivotal efficacy trials, minimum pain scores were not required for treatment. Sites were permitted to use opioids and other pain management modes according to their “standard of care” and meloxicam or placebo was added to this regimen. Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either ANJESO or IV placebo daily for up to 7 doses. A total of 721 patients received at least one dose of study medication. In patients age 65 and over, the percentage of patients reporting at least one AE was approximately 7% less in the ANJESO treatment arm compared to the placebo arm. The total occurrence of patients with at least one serious adverse event (SAE) was observed to be lower in the ANJESO group, 2.6%, (14/538 meloxicam patients) than in the placebo group, 5.5%, (10/183 placebo patients). In this safety study only two SAE events were listed as possibly related to study treatment. Both of these SAEs occurred in one placebo treated patient. No deaths were reported in either treatment group. Approximately 3% of patients in each study group discontinued.

INDICATION AND USAGE

ANJESO is indicated for use in adults for the management of moderate-to-severe pain, alone or in combination with non-NSAID analgesics.
Limitation of Use: Because of delayed onset of analgesia, ANJESO alone is not recommended for use when rapid onset of analgesia is required.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS
Cardiovascular Risk

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.
ANJESO is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
Gastrointestinal Risk

NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
ANJESO is contraindicated in patients with:

Known hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to meloxicam or any components of the drug product.
History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.
In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
Moderate to severe renal insufficiency patients who are at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Hepatotoxicity: Elevations of ALT or AST have been reported in patients with NSAIDs. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue ANJESO immediately if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.
Hypertension: NSAIDs including ANJESO can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events. Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure.
Heart Failure and Edema: NSAID use increased the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Avoid use of ANJESO in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. If ANJESO is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.
Post MI Patients: Avoid the use of ANJESO in patients with recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If ANJESO is used in these patients, monitor for signs of cardiac ischemia.
Renal Toxicity: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury. ANJESO is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency and is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency who are at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating ANJESO. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of ANJESO in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. If ANJESO is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.
Anaphylactic Reactions: Meloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.
Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: ANJESO is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity).
Serious Skin Reactions: NSAIDs, including ANJESO, can cause serious skin reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal and can occur without warning. Discontinue ANJESO at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity.
Hematologic Toxicity: Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs, including ANJESO, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking ANJESO with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of ANJESO and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended.
Angiotensin Converting Enzymes (ACE) Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), or Beta-Blockers: Concomitant use with ANJESO may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure.
ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with ANJESO in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function.
Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to ensure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most common adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials occurring in ≥ 2% of patients treated with ANJESO and at a greater frequency than placebo include: constipation, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, and anemia.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Pregnancy: Use of NSAIDs during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks gestation.
Infertility: NSAIDs are associated with reversible infertility. Consider withdrawal of ANJESO in women who have trouble conceiving.

About ANJESO™

ANJESO (meloxicam) injection is a proprietary, long-acting, preferential COX-2 inhibitor that possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities, which are believed to be related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase type 2 pathway (COX-2) and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin biosynthesis. ANJESO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2020 for the management of moderate to severe pain, alone or in combination with other non-NSAID analgesics. Because of the delayed onset of analgesia, ANJESO alone is not recommended for use when rapid onset of analgesia is required. The Company expects to launch ANJESO in late April or early May 2020. The ANJESO product approval was supported by two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials, a large double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III safety trial and four Phase II clinical efficacy trials, as well as other safety studies. As a non-opioid, Baudax Bio believes ANJESO has the potential to overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential, while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. ANJESO was designed using the NanoCrystal® platform, a technology that enables enhanced bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drug compounds. NanoCrystal® is a registered trademark of Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited (APIL).

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Esperion (NASDAQ:ESPR) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved NEXLIZET™ (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) tablet, an oral, once-daily, non-statin LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C), lowering medicine. NEXLIZET is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLIZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. NEXLIZET is the first non-statin, LDL-C lowering combination medicine ever approved. This approval follows the approval of NEXLETOL™ (bempedoic acid) tablet last week.

NEXLIZET contains bempedoic acid and ezetimibe and lowers elevated LDL-C through complementary mechanisms of action by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver and absorption in the intestine.

“The approval of NEXLIZET underscores Esperion’s commitment to providing patients and their healthcare providers with innovative non-statin medicines that fit into their everyday routines to lower elevated levels of bad cholesterol in adult patients with ASCVD or HeFH on maximally tolerated statins. This is the first non-statin combination medicine ever approved for lowering LDL-C,” said Tim M. Mayleben, president and chief executive officer of Esperion. “We are truly grateful to all of the patients and healthcare providers who put their confidence in Esperion’s team of lipid experts.”

LDL-C is a waxy, fat-like substance that’s found in the body. Elevated LDL-C contributes to a buildup of this fat in the arteries and can lead to cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke. Despite standard of care treatments, it is estimated nearly 15 million ASCVD or HeFH patients on maximally tolerated statins in the U.S. cannot achieve guideline recommended LDL-C levels.

“NEXLIZET provides significant additional LDL-C lowering for adult patients with ASCVD or HeFH when added to maximally tolerated statin medicine, including those patients for whom maximally tolerated statin may be no statin at all,” said Christie M. Ballantyne, M.D., chairman of Esperion’s Phase 3 Executive Committee and professor and chief of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “I believe this one-of-a-kind combination medicine which has two complementary, non-statin medications can provide highly effective additional reductions in LDL-C when added to statin therapy. It also has the conventional, oral, once-daily administration which can prove beneficial to patients struggling to meet their cholesterol goals with the currently available statin options in their daily regimen.”

The approval of NEXLIZET is supported by the Phase 3 Fixed Combination Drug Product LDL-C Lowering program, as well as safety data from the NEXLETOL (bempedoic acid) tablet global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program and the existing ezetimibe safety profile. NEXLIZET lowered LDL-C by a mean of 38 percent compared to placebo when added on to maximally tolerated statins. Results have been published in The European Journal of Preventative Cardiology.

NEXLIZET was generally well-tolerated in a pivotal Phase 3 study. Label warnings and precautions include hyperuricemia, with the development of gout in a small percentage of patients, as well as an increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. The most common adverse events reported in the development program (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) were generally reported at similar rates in patients who received placebo and were upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, diarrhea, arthralgia, sinusitis fatigue, influenza. The majority of adverse events reported with NEXLIZET were mild to moderate in severity. For additional information on NEXLIZET, please see Full Prescribing Information at Esperion.com.

Today’s approval further underscores Esperion’s commitment to deliver our medicines to adult patients suffering from ASCVD or HeFH and who are unable to reach their LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statins. Esperion is working with health insurance providers to help ensure broad insurance coverage and patient access to our medicines. Eligible patients with commercial drug insurance coverage for our medicines may pay as little as $10 per fill, up to a 3-month supply. To ensure access, both NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET will be priced at parity. Additionally, Esperion is committed to achieving the lowest branded tier coverage for Medicare patients. Esperion will provide resources to patients whose physician recommends treatment with NEXLETOL (bempedoic acid) or NEXLIZET. These resources include educational materials, a dedicated call center, as well as a co-pay program for eligible patients.

NEXLIZET will be commercially available for U.S. patients in July 2020. NEXLETOL will be commercially available for U.S. patients on March 30, 2020. Both NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET will be available by prescription only.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

Esperion’s Lipid Management Team will host a conference call and webcast on Thursday, February 27 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the approval and upcoming commercial launch. The call can be accessed by dialing (877) 312-7508 (domestic) or (253) 237-1184 (international) five minutes prior to the start of the call and providing the access code 1079274.

CLEAR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial

The effect of NEXLETOL or NEXLIZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Esperion initiated a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) to assess the effects of bempedoic acid on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiovascular disease (CVD) who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and are considered “statin averse.” The CVOT — known as CLEAR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial — is an event-driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that completed enrollment in August 2019 of 14,032 patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk at over 1,400 sites in 32 countries.

Esperion Therapeutics

Through scientific and clinical excellence, and a deep understanding of cholesterol biology, the experienced Lipid Management Team at Esperion is committed to developing new LDL-C lowering medicines that will make a substantial impact on reducing global cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death around the world. For more information, please visit www.esperion.com and follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/EsperionInc.

Esperion Therapeutics’ Commitment to Patients with Hyperlipidemia

High levels of LDL-C can lead to a build-up of fat and cholesterol in and on artery walls (known as atherosclerosis), potentially leading to cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke. In the U.S., 96 million people, or more than 37 percent of the adult population, have elevated LDL-C. There are approximately 18 million people in the U.S. living with elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy — including individuals considered statin averse — leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events1. In the United States, more than 50 percent of ASCVD patients who are not able to reach their LDL-C with statins alone need less than a 40 percent reduction to reach their LDL-C threshold2.

Esperion’s mission as the Lipid Management Company is to deliver oral, once-daily medicines that complement existing oral drugs to provide the additional LDL-C lowering that these patients need.

29709,GSK's Advil Dual Action in Combination with Acetaminophen Receives the US FDA's Approval for Pain Relief,FDA approves GSK's Advil Dual Action with Acetaminophen for over-the-counter use in the United States,"The approval is based on seven clinical studies including three of which were pivotal efficacy and safety studies in pain relief which involves assessing of ibuprofen (250 mg) + acetaminophen (500 mg) vs ibuprofen and acetaminophen monothx in patients with acute pain symptoms
 The study demonstrated that the FD combination achieved superior efficacy then the monotherapy in patients
 Advil Dual Action is combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen resulting to an exclusive pain reliever and will be available over-the-counter nationwide in 2020","First combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain relief to be available OTC in 2020
WARREN, N.J., Feb. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — GlaxoSmithKline (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Advil Dual Action with Acetaminophen as an over-the-counter (OTC) product for pain relief. The exclusive formula is now the first FDA-approved OTC combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the United States and will be available over-the-counter nationwide in 2020.
Franck Riot, Head of R&D, GSK Consumer Healthcare said: “For decades, many consumers have been using ibuprofen and acetaminophen to get the benefits of both active ingredients when safely treating their headaches, muscle aches, backaches, arthritis and other joint pain. Now Advil, the No. 1 selling OTC pain reliever, will offer US consumers the first-ever alternative option — a single, fixed-dose combination pain reliever. As the world-leader in pain relief, Advil Dual Action and our recently FDA-approved Voltaren Arthritis Pain gel, demonstrates GSK’s commitment to providing new safe, effective and convenient pain relief options for consumers.”
Advil Dual Action provides relief for multiple symptoms and is the first formulation that combines ibuprofen and acetaminophen, two powerful ingredients indicated for OTC pain relief that work in different ways.
The submission in support of today’s approval of Advil Dual Action was based on data from seven clinical studies, three of which were pivotal efficacy and safety studies in pain relief. The data supports a pain relief indication and demonstrates that the fixed-dose combination achieves superior efficacy compared to the individual monocomponents of ibuprofen (250mg) and acetaminophen (500mg) alone (as evidenced by appreciable improvements in acute pain symptoms across multiple pre-specified endpoints).
About Advil Dual Action
Advil Dual Action is an exclusive pain-fighting formula, combining ibuprofen and acetaminophen to fight pain in two ways. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) that targets pain at the source, temporarily reducing the production of prostaglandins, which cause swelling and pain signals. Acetaminophen is a pain reliever that blocks the transmission of pain signals to the brain. Advil Dual Action will be available over-the-counter nationwide in 2020.
GSK’s commitment to pain relief
We are the world leader in pain relief. With a portfolio of (systemic and topical) products to relieve pain, our range brings comfort and ease to millions. World-leading brands including Advil, Panadol and Voltaren; and beloved local brands like Excedrin in the US and Fenbid in China help people manage their symptoms so they can enjoy life to the fullest.

29714,Vir Biotechnology Signs a License Agreement with Xencor to Utilize Xtend Fc Technology in Antibodies Targeting COVID-19,Xencor and Vir Biotechnology Enter License Agreement for Use of Xtend XmAb Antibody Technology in Investigational Antibodies to Treat COVID-19,"Vir will get non-exclusive access to Xencor’s Xtend Fc technology for extending the half-life of novel Abs that the company is evaluating for treating patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
 Vir will be responsible for research, development, regulatory and commercial activities while Xencor continues to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing and planned clinical studies
 In Aug’2019, the two companies collaborated under which Vir got a non-exclusive license to Xtend technology for utilizing it in developing & commercializing Abs targeting influenza and hepatitis B virus infection","MONROVIA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Mar. 25, 2020– Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ:XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease, today announced it has entered into a technology license agreement with Vir Biotechnology, Inc., in which Vir will have non-exclusive access to Xencor’s Xtend™ Fc technology to extend the half-life of novel antibodies that Vir is investigating as potential treatments for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
“The COVID-19 crisis requires urgent and coordinated action by the biotechnology industry to develop new drugs and vaccines. Xtend Fc technology has demonstrated, in multiple antibodies and through numerous human clinical trials, the ability to extend antibody drug half-life and reduce dosing frequency in patients, an important feature in anti-viral therapy for pandemic use,” said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer at Xencor. “We are committed to broadly using Xtend technology, and our other XmAb® tools, to rapidly develop potential treatments for COVID-19. Vir’s antibody candidates, supported by their deep infectious disease expertise, are a promising approach for treating coronavirus infections.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Vir will be solely responsible for the activities and costs related to research, development, regulatory and commercial activities. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Xencor and Vir previously entered into a separate technology license agreement in August 2019, in which Xencor provided a non-exclusive license to Xtend technology for Vir’s use in developing and commercializing antibodies as potential treatments for patients with influenza and hepatitis B virus infection.
Xencor continues to evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing and planned clinical studies. The Company is currently maintaining preestablished guidance on 2020 corporate milestones and will provide additional updates as needed.
About Xtend™ XmAb® Fc Technology
Xencor’s Xtend™ XmAb® Fc domains increase circulating half-life by increasing binding affinity to the receptor FcRn. FcRn is present inside lysosomes in endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and functions to rescue antibodies from the degradation that makes most proteins short-lived in circulation. Half-life extension can be exploited to potentially improve therapeutic antibody performance in several ways, such as increasing dosing interval or decreasing drug quantities at the same dosing interval compared to a parent antibody. Xtend technology is currently in multiple clinical-stage programs and one approved therapy, Alexion’s Ultomiris® (ravulizumab-cwvz).
About Xencor, Inc.
Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Currently, 15 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor’s XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.

Additionally, Acacia’s Byfavo (remimazolam injection) is currently under FDA’s review for use in procedural sedation in adult with its anticipated PDUFA as Apr 05,2020","BARHEMSYS is the first and only antiemetic to be approved for the rescue treatment of PONV in patients who have failed prior prophylaxis using current standard of care1,2
An estimated 16 million surgical patients each year in the US suffer from PONV despite receiving prophylaxis3
BARHEMSYS is also approved for the prevention of PONV, either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class
Conference call scheduled for 10:00 am CET, Thursday 27 February
This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.

Cambridge, UK and Indianapolis, US – 27 February 2020: Acacia Pharma Group plc (“Acacia Pharma” or the “Company”) (EURONEXT: ACPH), a hospital pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new products aimed at improving the care of patients undergoing significant treatments such as surgery, other invasive procedures, or cancer chemotherapy, announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BARHEMSYS® (amisulpride injection) for the prevention and treatment of PONV in adult patients.

“The approval of our first product represents a significant milestone in Acacia Pharma’s evolution into an integrated hospital pharmaceutical company with strong development and commercialization capabilities,” commented Mike Bolinder, Acacia Pharma’s CEO. “I would like to thank the Acacia Pharma team and stakeholders that have delivered this new treatment option for the millions of adult surgical patients each year suffering from, or at risk of, PONV. Our goal is for BARHEMSYS to become established as the new standard of care in the US for the treatment of PONV in patients who have failed standard prophylaxis, the area of highest unmet need. The results of our extensive clinical program also allow us to offer BARHEMSYS as an option for the prevention of PONV in higher-risk patients and settings, where combination prophylaxis can be valuable. We are on target with our commercial preparations and expect to launch BARHEMSYS in the second half of this year.”

Professor TJ Gan, Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at Stony Brook University in New York, said: “PONV remains a major problem for surgical patients and there have been few therapeutic advances over the past 20 years. It is often considered by patients to be the most undesirable complication of surgery, even worse than pain. It is therefore very welcome to be able to add BARHEMSYS to the treatment arsenal, especially for rescue treatment of patients failing standard prophylaxis, where we previously had no approved agent.”

“We are delighted that BARHEMSYS has gained FDA approval,” said Acacia Pharma’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Gabriel Fox. “BARHEMSYS demonstrated significant benefits in the treatment and prevention of PONV in four pivotal trials. We are grateful to all the clinical investigators, hospital staff and, above all, patients who have made this approval possible through their participation in our clinical development program.”

BARHEMSYS is an intravenous formulation of the selective dopamine D2 and D3 antagonist amisulpride (2.5 mg/mL). The New Drug Application (NDA) submitted by Acacia Pharma for BARHEMSYS, which included four positive Phase 3 studies, contained data gathered from more than 3,300 surgical patients and healthy volunteers. The approval for BARHEMSYS covers the treatment of PONV in patients who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or who have not received prophylaxis and the prevention of PONV, either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class.

The Company owns global rights to BARHEMSYS and intends to directly commercialize the product in the US through its own sales channel, having built critical sales, marketing, medical, and operational infrastructure and capabilities over the past two years. The Company plans to launch BARHEMSYS in 2H 2020.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving patients who had failed the most commonly used antiemetic prophylaxis, a single 10 mg dose of BARHEMSYS (n=230) was significantly more effective than placebo (n=235) at treating patients (42% vs 29%; p=0.003).1 In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients at the highest risk of suffering from PONV (Apfel score 3 or 4), a single 5 mg dose of BARHEMSYS in combination with another antiemetic (n=572) significantly improved protection from PONV compared to placebo plus another antiemetic (n=575; 58% vs 47%; p<0.001).4

The most common side effects observed across the four pivotal studies, reported in at least 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS and at a higher rate than placebo were: infusion site pain (6% vs 4% with placebo), chills (4% vs 3%), hypokalemia (4% vs 2%), procedural hypotension (3% vs 2%), and abdominal distension (2% vs 1%). Serum prolactin concentrations were measured in one prophylaxis study where 5% (9/176) of BARHEMSYS-treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction compared to 1% (1/166) of placebo-treated patients.

Acacia Pharma’s second product, Byfavo™ (remimazolam injection), was recently in-licensed from Cosmo Pharmaceuticals NV and an NDA is currently under review by FDA for use in procedural sedation in adults. The application has a target PDUFA action date of 5 April 2020. Subject to approval, the Company also intends to launch Byfavo in the US during 2020 and to commercialize Byfavo using the same sales and marketing infrastructure.

About PONV

PONV is a common complication of surgery, occurring in approximately 30% of surgical patients and up to 80% of high-risk patients. It is associated with the use of anesthetic gases and opioid painkillers and is particularly common following gynecological, abdominal, breast, eye, and ear operations, especially those lasting an hour or more. PONV has been ranked as the most undesirable of all surgical complications in some patient surveys, even worse than pain.5

Acacia Pharma estimates that approximately 65 million surgical procedures are conducted in the US each year that are eligible for antiemetic use to prevent PONV. Based on market research, Acacia Pharma estimates that the total market in the US for high-risk prophylactic and rescue treatment comprises an estimated 34 million patients annually.3

About BARHEMSYS®

BARHEMSYS is a selective dopamine-2 (D2) and dopamine-3 (D3) receptor antagonist, which Acacia Pharma has developed and protected for the management of PONV.

BARHEMSYS is indicated in adults for:

treatment of PONV in patients who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or who have not received prophylaxis
prevention of PONV, either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class
www.BARHEMSYS.com

Important Safety Information for BARHEMSYS® (amisulpride) Injection

Contraindication

BARHEMSYS is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to amisulpride.

QT Prolongation

BARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg as a single intravenous (IV) dose infused over 1 to 2 minutes.

Avoid BARHEMSYS in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients taking droperidol.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias/cardiac conduction disorders, electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, and in patients taking other medicinal products (e.g., ondansetron) or with other medical conditions known to prolong the QT interval.

Adverse Reactions

Common adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 5 mg (n=748) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=741) in clinical trials for the prevention of PONV were: chills (4% vs. 3%), hypokalemia (4% vs. 2%), procedural hypotension (3% vs. 2%), and abdominal distention (2% vs. 1%).

Serum prolactin concentrations were measured in one prophylaxis study where 5% (9/176) of BARHEMSYS-treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction compared with 1% (1/166) of placebo-treated patients.

The most common adverse reaction, reported in ≥ 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 10 mg (n=418) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=416), in clinical trials for the treatment of PONV was infusion site pain (6% vs. 4%).

Use in Specific Populations

Lactation
Amisulpride is present in human milk. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed child and no information on the effects of amisulpride on milk production.

BARHEMSYS may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible increase in maternal milk production. In a clinical trial, serum prolactin concentrations in females (n=112) increased from a mean of 10 ng/mL at baseline to 32 ng/mL after BARHEMSYS treatment and from 10 ng/mL to 19 ng/mL in males (n=61). No clinical consequences due to elevated prolactin levels were reported.

To minimize exposure to a breastfed infant, lactating women may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 48 hours after receiving a dose of BARHEMSYS.

Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Renal Impairment
Avoid BARHEMSYS in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). The pharmacokinetics of amisulpride in patients with severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied in clinical trials. Amisulpride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and patients with severe renal impairment may have increased systemic exposure and an increased risk of adverse reactions.

No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment
(eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Drug Interactions

BARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent QT prolongation. To avoid potential additive effects, avoid use of BARHEMSYS in patients taking droperidol.
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval (e.g., ondansetron).
Reciprocal antagonism of effects occurs between dopamine agonists (e.g., levodopa) and BARHEMSYS. Avoid using levodopa with BARHEMSYS.

29739,AstraZeneca's Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) Receives MHLW's Approval for the Treatment of Hyperkalemia in Japan,Lokelma approved in Japan for the treatment of hyperkalaemia,"The MHLW’s approval is based on stand-alone studies in Japan and global clinical programs and is supported by DIALIZE study that demonstrated the efficacy on Lokelma in treating hyperkalemia patients with ESRD on hemodialysis
 The global clinical program result: @12mos. the median time to achieve normal potassium levels in the blood (22hrs.) with 98% achieving normal levels within 48hrs. The therapy demonstrated a reduction in blood potassium level in 1hr. with 1 dose and a sustained treatment effect for up to 1yr.
 Lokelma is an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension and acts as a highly selective potassium-removing medicine and is an approved therapy for the treatment of hyperkalemia in the US, EU, Canada, Hong Kong, China, Russia and Japan","Patients in Japan will benefit from Lokelma’s rapid and sustained potassium control
 
AstraZeneca’s Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) has been approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with hyperkalaemia (elevated levels of potassium in the blood).

The approval by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare was based on positive results from stand-alone studies in Japan and global clinical trial programmes. It was also supported by DIALIZE, a global trial for end-stage renal disease patients on haemodialysis, which demonstrated the positive efficacy and safety of Lokelma in the management of hyperkalaemia.

Lokelma is the first innovative non-resin potassium binder to be approved in Japan. Traditional resin-based binders are often associated with poor tolerability.

Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “More than 300,000 patients in Japan suffer from hyperkalaemia, typically as result of chronic kidney disease or as a side effect from medications for heart failure. This approval ensures that this broad patient population, including those suffering from hyperkalaemia and patients with hyperkalaemia on stable haemodialysis, can benefit from Lokelma’s rapid, sustained potassium control and tolerability.”

The global clinical trial programme showed that for patients receiving Lokelma, for up to 12-months in duration, the median time to achieving normal potassium levels in the blood was 2.2 hours, with 98% achieving normal levels within 48 hours from baseline.1 Lokelma demonstrated a rapid reduction of potassium in the blood as early as one hour with one dose and a sustained treatment effect for up to one year.2,3 In the DIALIZE trial, Lokelma demonstrated significantly improved control of pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia compared with placebo.4 Lokelma was well tolerated, with few serious adverse events.3,4 Results in Japanese patients were broadly consistent with those seen in the global programme.

Lokelma is approved for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in the US, EU, Canada, Hong Kong, China, Russia and Japan.

Hyperkalaemia

High levels of potassium in the blood (generally classified as >5mmol/l)5 characterise hyperkalaemia. The risk of hyperkalaemia increases significantly for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and for those who take common medications for heart failure (HF), such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, which can increase potassium in the blood. Hyperkalaemia occurs in 23% to 47% of patients with CKD and/or HF with an estimated 700 million and 64 million people, respectively, living with each condition worldwide.6,7

Lokelma

Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) is an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension, that acts as a highly selective potassium-removing medicine. It is administered orally, is odourless, tasteless and stable at room temperature. The Lokelma global clinical trials programme consists of multiple trials of up to 12-months duration. The Japan clinical data package included 11 trials; four pivotal trials that Japanese patients participated in and seven supportive overseas trials. The efficacy and safety of Lokelma in Japanese patients were evaluated primarily in Japan stand-alone trials and international trials including Japanese patients.

29758,Gates Foundation Collaborates with the Consortium of Life Sciences Companies to Address Challenges Against the Pandemic COVID-19,Novartis and life sciences companies commit expertise and assets to the fight against COVID-19 pandemic alongside Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,"Novartis along with multiple pharmaceutical companies work in collaboration with the Gates Foundation to accelerate the development, manufacturing and delivery of vaccines, diagnostics and other treatments to combat COVID-19
 The collaboration will bring a range of assets, resources, and expertise required to identify effective & scalable solutions targeting the pandemic
 Fifteen pharmaceutical companies will share their molecular compound libraries with the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator launched by the Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard for screening the potential of therapies against COVID-19","Collaboration to address product development and scale up challenges posed by current pandemic
Basel, March 26, 2020 — Today, Novartis and a consortium of life sciences companies announced an important collaboration to accelerate the development, manufacture and delivery of vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments for COVID-19 in response to the pandemic. The industry brings a range of assets, resources, and expertise needed to identify effective and scalable solutions to the pandemic that is affecting billions worldwide. Effects on health systems, economies, and livelihoods are significant, and effective response requires an unprecedented collaboration across government, academia, private sector, and philanthropy.
As co-chair of a consortium of life science companies headquartered across three continents, Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, said, “We feel a deep shared responsibility to see if there are specific areas where collaboration across the life sciences industry and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation can accelerate solutions to this pandemic. In addition to the individual contributions companies are already making, collective action is critical to ensure any promising studies into vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics are quickly scaled to people around the world who are affected by this pandemic.”
Trials of existing drugs, diagnostic tests, compounds, and investigational vaccines have begun around the world to identify interventions to slow or end the pandemic. Products that demonstrate efficacy will require clinical study, scale up of manufacturing, and distribution if proven effective. These are areas that the life sciences industry has extensive experience in managing for products that reach billions of people every day.
Mark Suzman, chief executive officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said, “We know that the private sector is where the technical skills from discovery to clinical trials to commercialization know-how sits. We look to harness that knowledge and experience, combine it where possible, to connect with national regulators and the World Health Organization to see if we can help flatten the curve of this pandemic and make sure the results reach everyone around the world, particularly those at highest risk and the poorest.”
Following a conference call with Gates Foundation leadership earlier this month, companies are working to identify concrete actions that will accelerate treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics to the field. As a first step, 15 companies have agreed to share their proprietary libraries of molecular compounds that already have some degree of safety and activity data – with the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator launched by the Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard two weeks ago to quickly screen them for potential against COVID-19. Successful hits would move rapidly into in vivotrials in as little as two months.
“This is an encouraging start in a critical area because if any of these compounds are shown to be effective against COVID-19 it dramatically accelerates the path to product approval and scale up,” said Suzman. “While each of the partners will also be pursuing other efforts in partnership with national governments and other partners, it is a great example of why we are optimistic that this unprecedented collaboration will provide a platform for a fundamentally different kind of partnership to help address this global health emergency.”
Companies participating in the collaboration include:
BD, Boehringer Ingelheim, bioMerieux, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GSK, J&J, Merck (MSD), Merck (Merck KGaA), Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi.

29769,PRA Health Sciences Launches COVID-19 Monitoring App to Track Symptoms,PRA Health Sciences Launches COVID-19 Monitoring Program,"PRA Health Science reports the availability of the COVID-19 Monitoring Program, a three-tiered mobile-app driven program tracking the individuals’ physical and psychological symptoms of COVID-19
 The app monitors an individual’s COVID-19 status and classifies them into three categories: the educational program, the quarantine program and the in-depth monitoring program
 The app will allow users to connect with their HCPs while maintaining social distancing. PRA is deploying the mobile app healthcare organizations & employers, further, the company is in discussions with academic institutions, governmental organizations, health departments and other private businesses to roll out the program","RALEIGH, N.C., March 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — PRA Health Sciences announced today the commercial availability of the COVID-19 Monitoring Program, a mobile app-driven, tiered initiative that allows employers, payers, providers and health systems to track the health and wellbeing of individuals who may be asymptomatic, exposed or diagnosed with COVID-19 during the pandemic.

Based on an individual’s COVID-19 disease status, they are assigned to one of three groups:

The educational program, which provides vital sign tracking, prevention techniques and mental health support for those who are asymptomatic.
The quarantine program, which delivers insights on what to watch for, addresses feelings of fear and isolation, and connects with a healthcare professional for those who have been exposed to COVID-19.
The in-depth monitoring program, which addresses symptom management, frequent monitoring by a healthcare professional and care coordination for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are still at home.
By downloading the program’s app on their personal mobile devices, participants in the program will be able to report key health metrics related to COVID-19 such as body temperature, heart rate and pulse oximetry. In addition, participants report on symptoms of COVID-19 like shortness of breath, fatigue and changes in coughing. Participants benefit from PRA’s nurse-led clinical call center staff, who monitor the information reported through the app on a daily basis. The trained staff can address physical symptoms, as well as the social and psychological impacts they may be experiencing.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the critical need for organizations of all sizes to be able to remotely assist individuals in monitoring their health and wellbeing,” said Kent Thoelke, Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at PRA Health Sciences. “Given the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are about to see our healthcare system and its infrastructure significantly stretched. With this program, individuals can have the peace of mind that they can connect with a healthcare professional from the comfort of their own homes while maintaining social distancing. Having the ability to interact with individuals remotely during this uncertain time is critical to maintaining the infrastructure and capability of the healthcare system as well as safety of patients and business continuity.”
The program, which was created by Care Innovations, a PRA Health Sciences company, can be deployed within days. Built on the cloud based Health Harmony Digital Health Platform, the program can also scale immediately and receive updated content as guidelines are changed.
PRA is deploying the COVID-19 Monitoring Program and mobile app to healthcare organizations, large employers, and the company is in discussions with academic institutions, governmental organizations, health departments and other private businesses to roll out the program.

PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) 0.92 mg for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease.1 ZEPOSIA, an oral medication taken once daily, is the only approved sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that offers RMS patients an initiation with no genetic test and no label-based first-dose observation required for patients.1,4,5 An up-titration scheme should be used to reach the maintenance dosage of ZEPOSIA, as a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays may occur.1
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves, creating damaging lesions that make it harder for signals to travel between each nerve cell.6,7 This “signal breakdown” can lead to symptoms and relapses.6,8
“With the FDA approval of ZEPOSIA, appropriate patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis will have another oral treatment option with meaningful efficacy to help address the disease’s hallmark relapses and brain lesions,”9 said Samit Hirawat, M.D., chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “ZEPOSIA has substantial clinical potential, and we are well positioned with our heritage in transformational science to ensure this innovative compound ultimately benefits as many patients as possible.”
The approval is based on data from the largest pivotal, head-to-head RMS studies with an active comparator to date: the randomized, active-controlled Phase 3 SUNBEAM™ (safety and efficacy of ZEPOSIA versus interferon beta-1a in relapsing multiple sclerosis) and RADIANCE™ (safety and efficacy of the selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator ZEPOSIA in relapsing multiple sclerosis) Part B clinical trials of more than 2,600 adults.1,2,3,10 In both trials – as compared to AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a), ZEPOSIA delivered powerful efficacy as measured by annualized relapse rate (ARR), as well as on the number and size of brain lesions.1,2,3
ZEPOSIA demonstrated a relative reduction in ARR versus AVONEX of 48% through one year and 38% at two years (absolute ARR of 0.18 versus 0.35 and 0.17 versus 0.28, respectively).1,2,3
At one year, treatment with ZEPOSIA reduced the number of T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced (GdE) brain lesions more than AVONEX (0.16 vs 0.43), a relative reduction of 63%, and reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions (1.47 vs. 2.84), a relative reduction of 48%.1,3
At two years, treatment with ZEPOSIA reduced the number of T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced (GdE) brain lesions more than AVONEX (0.18 vs 0.37), a relative reduction of 53%.1,2 ZEPOSIA also reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions vs AVONEX (1.84 vs 3.18), a relative reduction of 42%.1,2
There was no statistically significant difference in the three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression between ZEPOSIA- and AVONEX- treated patients over two years.1
ZEPOSIA demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability in the Phase 3 SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B trials.1,2,3 ZEPOSIA is contraindicated in patients who in the last six months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure; patients who have a presence of Mobitz type II second or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker; patients with severe untreated sleep apnea; and patients taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.1 ZEPOSIA is associated with the following Warnings and Precautions: increased risk of infections, bradyarrhythmia and atrioventricular conduction delays, liver injury, fetal risk, increased blood pressure, respiratory effects, macular edema, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, additive immunosuppressive effects from prior immune-modulating treatments, severe increase in disability after stopping ZEPOSIA, and immune system effects after stopping ZEPOSIA.1 Please see Important Safety Information for additional details. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥4%) were upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension.1
Before initiation of treatment with ZEPOSIA, all patients require assessments including a recent complete blood count including lymphocyte count (within six months or after discontinuation of prior MS therapy), an ECG to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present, a recent liver function test (within six months), and consideration of current and prior medications, including vaccinations.1 For patients with a history of uveitis or macular edema, an ophthalmic assessment is required.1
“Treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis is critical to address this devastating neurological disease.11 I’m excited, with the introduction of ZEPOSIA, I will have a new oral option to offer my RMS patients that has demonstrated efficacy and safety,”1 said Bruce Cree, M.D., Ph.D., M.A.S., professor of clinical neurology, University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Weill Institute for Neurosciences and clinical research director, UCSF MS Center.
“Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and often disabling disease that affects nearly one million people in the United States.9,12Ongoing treatment with disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number of disease attacks,”11 said Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research, National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “Each person can respond differently to these medications, which is why having treatment options is so important. We are pleased that there will now be another effective treatment option for people with MS.”
As the country’s healthcare system is dealing with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, Bristol Myers Squibb has made the decision to delay commercialization of ZEPOSIA. The Company made the decision based on what’s in the best health interest of our patients, customers and employees. Bristol Myers Squibb will continue to monitor the environment and will partner with the neurology community to inform launch timing.
A Marketing Authorization Application for ZEPOSIA for the treatment of adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the European Union is currently under review with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A regulatory decision from the EMA is expected in the first half of 2020.
About SUNBEAM™
SUNBEAM is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral ZEPOSIA (0.92 mg, equivalent to 1 mg) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a) for at least a 12-month treatment period.3 The study included 1,346 people living with RMS across 152 sites in 20 countries.3
The primary endpoint of the trial was annualized relapse rates (ARR) during the treatment period.3 The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months and number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 12.3
An analysis of the time to onset of three-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.1,2,3
About RADIANCE™
RADIANCE Part B is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral ZEPOSIA (0.92 mg, equivalent to 1 mg) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a) over a 24-month treatment period.2 The study included 1,320 people living with RMS across 150 sites in 21 countries.2
The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR over 24 months.2 The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 24 months.2
An analysis of the time to onset of three-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.1,2,3
About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves.6 The myelin damage disrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body.7 Ultimately, the nerves themselves may deteriorate — a process that’s currently irreversible.13
RMS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, is characterized by clearly defined attacks of worsening neurologic function.14 These attacks — often called relapses, flare-ups or exacerbations — are followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remissions), during which symptoms improve partially or completely with no apparent progression of disease.14 RMS is the most common disease course at the time of diagnosis.14 Approximately 85% of patients are initially diagnosed with RMS, compared with 10-15% with progressive forms of the disease.14
About ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod)
ZEPOSIA® is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5.1 ZEPOSIA blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood1 The mechanism by which ozanimod exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown but may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.1
ZEPOSIA is also in development for additional immune-inflammatory indications, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.15,16
Indication
ZEPOSIA is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Contraindications:

Patients who in the last 6 months, experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure or have a presence of Mobitz type II second or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker
Patients with severe untreated sleep apnea
Patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor
Infections: ZEPOSIA may increase the susceptibility to infections. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS therapy) complete blood count (CBC) including lymphocyte count before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Delay initiation of ZEPOSIA in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Consider interruption of treatment with ZEPOSIA if a patient develops a serious infection. Continue monitoring for infections up to 3 months after discontinuing ZEPOSIA

Herpes zoster was reported as an adverse reaction in ZEPOSIA-treated patients. Herpes simplex encephalitis and varicella zoster meningitis have been reported with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox), or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV), should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating ZEPOSIA. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with ZEPOSIA
Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) were reported in patients treated with another S1P receptor modulator. If CM is suspected, ZEPOSIA should be suspended until cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated.
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that typically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. No cases of PML were identified in active-controlled MS clinical trials with ZEPOSIA. PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators and other MS therapies and has been associated with some risk factors. If PML is suspected, withhold ZEPOSIA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. If confirmed, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued
In clinical studies, patients who received ZEPOSIA were not to receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS. Concomitant use of ZEPOSIA with any of these therapies would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression. When switching to ZEPOSIA from immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects
Use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months after treatment with ZEPOSIA. If live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, administer at least 1 month prior to initiation of ZEPOSIA
Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays: Since initiation of ZEPOSIA may result in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, dose titration is recommended to help reduce cardiac effects. Initiation of ZEPOSIA without dose escalation may result in greater decreases in heart rate. If treatment with ZEPOSIA is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought for those individuals:

with significant QT prolongation
with arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class 1a or III anti-arrhythmic drugs
with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension
with a history of Mobitz type II second-degree or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sinoatrial heart block
Liver Injury: Elevations of aminotransferases may occur in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain liver function tests, if not recently available (i.e., within 6 months), before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have hepatic enzymes checked and ZEPOSIA should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Caution should be exercised when using ZEPOSIA in patients with history of significant liver disease
Fetal Risk: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal studies, ZEPOSIA may cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 3 months after stopping ZEPOSIA
Increased Blood Pressure: Increase in systolic pressure was observed after about 3 months of treatment and persisted throughout treatment. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment and managed appropriately. Certain foods that may contain very high amounts of tyramine could cause severe hypertension in patients taking ZEPOSIA. Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking ZEPOSIA
Respiratory Effects: ZEPOSIA may cause a decline in pulmonary function. Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy, if clinically indicated
Macular edema: S1P modulators have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. Patients with a history of uveitis or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Patients with a history of these conditions should have an ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, prior to treatment initiation and regular follow-up examinations. An ophthalmic evaluation is recommended in all patients at any time if there is a change in vision. Continued use of ZEPOSIA in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated; potential benefits and risks for the individual patient should be considered if deciding whether ZEPOSIA should be discontinued
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): Rare cases of PRES have been reported in patients receiving a S1P receptor modulator. If a ZEPOSIA-treated patient develops unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms or any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase in intracranial pressure, a complete physical and neurological examination should be conducted. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued
Unintended Additive Immunosuppressive Effects From Prior Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Drugs:When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation. Initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA after treatment with alemtuzumab is not recommended
Severe Increase in Disability After Stopping ZEPOSIA: Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease should be considered after stopping ZEPOSIA treatment so patients should be monitored upon discontinuation
Immune System Effects After Stopping ZEPOSIA: After discontinuing ZEPOSIA, the median time for lymphocyte counts to return to the normal range was 30 days with approximately 90% of patients in the normal range within 3 months. Use of immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system, therefore caution should be applied when initiating other drugs 4 weeks after the last dose of ZEPOSIA
Most common Adverse Reactions (≥ 4%): upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension.

 The P-III ICARIA-MM study results: improvement in PFS (11.53 vs 6.47mos.); ORR (60.4% vs. 35.3%). In an additional analysis, the therapy showed benefits in patients with high-risk cytogenetics, those aged ≥75yrs. with renal insufficiency and who were refractory to lenalidomide
 Sarclisa is mAb targeting CD38 receptor on MM cells, act by inducing apoptosis & immunomodulatory activity and has received FDA’s approval on Mar 02, 2019. The EC will review the CHMP’s recommendation with its decision on MAA anticipated in the coming months","Positive CHMP opinion based on data from ICARIA-MM, the first randomized Phase 3 trial to evaluate an anti-CD38 in combination with pom-dex
Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death in adults by 40% compared to pom-dex alone in the trial
Sarclisa was approved by the FDA on March 2 in combination with pom-dex for the treatment of certain adults with RRMM
Multiple myeloma remains an incurable cancer associated with significant patient burden and need for additional treatments
Paris – March 27, 2020 – The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Sarclisa®(isatuximab). The CHMP recommends Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.

The European Commission (EC) will review the CHMP recommendation and a final decision on the Marketing Authorisation Application for Sarclisa in the E.U. is expected in the coming months. Sarclisa has not been approved for commercial use in the E.U. Sarclisa was approved in the US on March 2 in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex) for the treatment of adults with RRMM who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.

“Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma is a complicated disease that continuously develops resistance to treatment, creating a significant need for continued innovation,”said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Sanofi’s Global Head of Research & Development. “This positive CHMP opinion for Sarclisa brings us closer to our ambition to deliver a new treatment option for patients in Europe with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.”

Sarclisa Phase 3 Study Results in Patients with RRMM 

The CHMP positive opinion is based on data from ICARIA-MM, the first randomized Phase 3 trial to evaluate an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAB) in combination with pom-dex. In the ICARIA-MM study, Sarclisa added to pom-dex (Sarclisa combination therapy; n=154) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of progression free survival (PFS) with a median PFS of 11.53 months compared to 6.47 months with pom-dex alone (n=153; HR 0.596, 95% CI: 0.44-0.81, p=0.0010). Sarclisa combination therapy also demonstrated a significantly greater overall response rate compared to pom-dex alone (60.4% vs. 35.3%, p<0.0001). In additional analyses, Sarclisa combination therapy compared to pom-dex alone showed a treatment benefit consistent across select subgroups reflective of real-world practice, including patients with high risk cytogenetics, those aged 75 years and older, patients with renal insufficiency, and patients who were refractory to lenalidomide.

The most common adverse reactions (all grades occurring in 20% or more of patients) in patients who received Sarclisa combination therapy were neutropenia (96%), infusion-related reactions (39%), pneumonia (31%), upper respiratory tract infection (57%) and diarrhea (26%). Serious adverse reactions that occurred in more than 5% of patients who received Sarclisa combination therapy included pneumonia (25.3%) and febrile neutropenia (12.3%). Permanent discontinuation of Sarclisa combination therapy due to an adverse reaction (Grades 3-4) occurred in 7% of patients, and 3% of patients discontinued due to an infusion-related reaction.

Multiple Myeloma: A Significant Burden to Patients

Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy1, with more than 138,000 new diagnoses of multiple myeloma worldwide yearly.2 In Europe, approximately 39,000 patients are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year.3 Despite available treatments, multiple myeloma remains an incurable malignancy, and is associated with significant patient burden. Since multiple myeloma does not have a cure, most patients will relapse. Relapsed multiple myeloma is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory multiple myeloma refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.

About Sarclisa

CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on multiple myeloma cells and cell surface receptors, making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. Sarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma cells. It is designed to work through many mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. The clinical significance of these findings is under investigation.

Sarclisa is approved in the U.S. in combination with pom-dex for the treatment of adults with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. In the U.S., the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Outside of the U.S., Sarclisa is an investigational agent and its safety and efficacy have not been established by any regulatory authority worldwide.

Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the multiple myeloma treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The safety and efficacy of these additional uses have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority worldwide.

Medopad COVID-19 RPM

Now is the time for global collaboration to help ease the burden of COVID-19 on our healthcare systems, reduce disease spread through remote patient monitoring and maintain the continuity of care for at-risk populations.”

LONDON (PRWEB) MARCH 26, 2020

As healthcare systems are overwhelmed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, British healthtech company Medopad is offering immediate support by providing its Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) software at cost to NHS Trusts across the UK and global healthcare providers. Medopad has worked with clinicians from Imperial College, Guys and St Thomas’s NHS Foundation Trust and Johns Hopkins to create a readily available, out-of-box version of its modular RPM platform configured for tracking COVID-19 that can be deployed in days. Through its RPM software, Medopad helps healthcare systems monitor ill and at-risk patients, enable care for chronically ill patients and provide insights to healthcare systems to help them prioritise resources and respond more effectively.

To further support healthcare systems, Medopad is also working with its global partners, including Johns Hopkins and Tencent, to clinically validate digital biomarkers to identify individual patient risk for COVID-19 and monitor respiratory symptoms and disease progression using only a smartphone.

Monitoring COVID-19 Patients and Protecting the Vulnerable
The WHO, NHS, and FDA have formally recommended that healthcare systems use telemedicine and RPM during the COVID-19 public health emergency to reduce the strain on healthcare systems and limit disease spread. Medopad’s clinically validated RPM solutions are secure, infrastructure-ready and scalable to address the demands on healthcare systems and providers, enabling more global understanding of the disease. Medopad’s RPM solution is CE registered and under FDA enforcement discretion and is ready to be deployed in the EU, US, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and beyond for supporting patient care with chronic conditions and configurable for rare diseases.

Medopad’s app and clinician dashboard help track patient data and symptom progression to maintain ongoing patient care and support, flag patients with worsening symptoms and notify clinicians of a patient’s deteriorating health when they are out of the clinical setting. The patient’s mobile app allows them to opt-in to securely share personal health data, including vital signs such as temperature, respiration rate, and heart rate using their smartphone. Medopad has pioneered its RPM solution across fifteen NHS trusts in the UK in the past two years, working with Trusts like Chelsea and Westminster Foundation Trust on diseases like Heart Failure to to reduce the unpredictability of patients presenting at A&E by collecting data and information on heart failure patients when outside of hospital settings.

“As part of the NHSE Test Bed Programme we partnered with Medopad to empower our patients. Through the continuous monitoring of their health, we aim to reduce pressure on A&E and outpatients and avoid hospital admissions and reduce hospital bed days. During the COVID-19 crisis, Medopad’s solution can allow hospitals to continuously monitor and engage with their patients without the need to bring them into the healthcare system where there is an elevated risk of them contracting COVID-19,” commented Felix Vaal, Senior Project Manager for Digital Innovation, Chelsea and Westminster Trust.

Developing a COVID-19 Biomarker: Using a Smartphone to Monitor Symptoms and Disease Progression
Medopad is prioritising R&D efforts for novel technologies that could help reduce the spread and management of COVID-19. Medopad is collaborating with Johns Hopkins and key opinion leaders from Imperial College and other major academic partners to fast-track the development and validation of a digital biomarker to determine an individual risk profile for COVID-19.

“We have been working in collaboration with Medopad for over a year on a digital biomarker project. COVID-19 presents an opportunity for us to take this work further and develop a specific COVID-19 digital biomarker. The aim is to adjust the data points collected and focus specifically on cardio-respiratory diseases, diabetes and other conditions which compromise the immune system to identify those who are most at risk should they contract COVID-19,” added Alain Labrique, Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Medopad is also developing a way to use a smartphone’s gyroscope-powered motion sensors to accurately measure an individual’s heart and respiratory rate without the need for additional hardware by placing a phone on the patient’s chest wall for 30-60 seconds. Developing and validating this digital biomarker, combined with other data points, will enable more efficient COVID-19 patient monitoring and clinical team support by remotely tracking vital signs that indicate the severity of COVID-19.

Dan Vahdat, founder and CEO of Medopad, commented, “This is an unprecedented global health crisis that requires a global response. To do our part, Medopad is providing our platform and development efforts to aid in the fight of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have already had initial success detecting digital biomarkers for rare and chronic diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and are now shifting most of our resources towards COVID-19 efforts. Now is the time for global collaboration to help ease the burden of COVID-19 on our healthcare systems, reduce disease spread through remote patient monitoring and maintain the continuity of care for at-risk populations.”

Medopad is conducting feasibility studies and clinical trials to validate its digital biomarkers for detecting and assessing diseases and health conditions such as Parkinson’s with partners including Tencent, J&J, Bayer and more. It is now working with partners including Johns Hopkins and Tencent to fast-track the development and validation of a specific digital biomarker for COVID-19 using only a smartphone.

“The joint Medopad and Tencent Medical AI lab have been working for the last 2 years on various digital biomarker projects. COVID-19 presents an opportunity for us to modify some of our R&D work to showcase the power of using smartphones and simple devices to capture data directly from patients and the population at large and generating novel insights from it. Together with our academic partners, we are working on a number of digital biomarkers which can be done with only a smartphone to help unlock valuable data to better understand and treat COVID-19. While moving at pace, we continue to work closely with regulators and design our technology to maximise data privacy,” and Dr. David Wei Fan, Executive Director of Tencent Medical AI Lab.

29894,Sanofi Collaborates with Translate Bio to Develop Novel mRNA Vaccine Against COVID-19,Sanofi and Translate Bio collaborate to develop novel mRNA vaccine candidate against COVID-19,"Translate Bio will utilize its mRNA platform to discover, design, and manufacture SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates while Sanofi will provide its vaccine expertise in advancing the vaccine candidates for further development
 The collaboration leverages the existing 2018 agreement signed b/w the companies for developing mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases
 The collaboration marks the Sanofi’s second collaboration for developing vaccine candidates against COVID-19. Initially, the company has collaborated with BARDA to advance vaccine candidates in Feb’2020","The two companies will jointly investigate multiple candidates with the goal of advancing an efficacious and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine into clinical development
 
PARIS and LEXINGTON, MASS. – March 27, 2020 – Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, and Translate Bio (NASDAQ: TBIO), a clinical-stage messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics company, will collaborate to develop a novel mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. This collaboration leverages an existing agreement from 2018 between the two companies to develop mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases.
Translate Bio has begun to produce multiple mRNA constructs and will use its mRNA platform to discover, design, and manufacture a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. Sanofi will provide deep vaccine expertise and support from its external research networks to advance vaccine candidates for potential further development. Translate Bio has established 100 gram single-batch production with its clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics platform. Build-out is underway of dedicated manufacturing space through a contract manufacturing partner to accommodate at least two 250-gram batches per month. Depending on the final human dose, the mRNA platform of Translate Bio has excellent promise to meet the future demands for a pandemic response.
For Sanofi, this marks a second collaboration in its efforts to develop a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In February 2020, Sanofi announced a collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to advance a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The agreement with BARDA calls for Sanofi to initiate development of a recombinant, protein-based vaccine candidate against COVID-19.
“We are committed to leveraging different ways to address the COVID-19 public health crisis by testing treatments, as well as two vaccines using different platforms. We believe the more approaches we explore, the better our likelihood of success in achieving this goal,” said David Loew, Global Head of Vaccines at Sanofi. “Having sufficient installed capacity will be key to satisfy the strong demand for vaccines we will probably see, and based on the experience we’ve had under the collaboration to date, we believe the Translate Bio mRNA platform could help us meet that need.”
“The Translate Bio and Sanofi Pasteur teams have generated encouraging preclinical data across multiple infectious disease targets, as part of our ongoing mRNA vaccine collaboration. This work will serve as a strong foundation as we direct joint research efforts against COVID-19 to help address this public health threat,” said Ronald Renaud, Chief Executive Officer of Translate Bio. “Our collaborative efforts to combat COVID-19 will leverage Translate Bio’s innovative mRNA platform as well as Sanofi’s vaccine expertise and ongoing COVID-19 research with the goal of advancing a novel mRNA vaccine rapidly to the clinic.”
About mRNA Vaccines
Vaccines work by mimicking disease agents to stimulate the immune system; building up a defense mechanism that remains active in the body to fight future infections. mRNA vaccines offer an innovative approach by delivering a nucleotide sequence encoding the antigen or antigens selected for their high potential to induce a protective immune response. mRNA vaccines also represent a potentially innovative alternative to conventional vaccine approaches for several reasons – their high potency, ability to initiate protein production without the need for nuclear entry, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration using non-viral delivery. This approach potentially enables the development of vaccines for disease areas where vaccination is not a viable option today. Additionally, a desired antigen or multiple antigens can be expressed from mRNA without the need to adjust the production process offering maximum flexibility and efficiency in development.
About the Sanofi Pasteur/Translate Bio Collaboration
In 2018, Translate Bio entered into a collaboration and exclusive licensing agreement with Sanofi Pasteur Inc., the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, to develop mRNA vaccines for up to five infectious disease pathogens. This collaboration brings together Sanofi Pasteur’s leadership in vaccines and Translate Bio’s mRNA research and development expertise. Under the agreement, the companies are jointly conducting research and development activities to advance mRNA vaccines and mRNA vaccine platform development during a three-year research term. Translate Bio and Sanofi Pasteur have advanced the preclinical development vaccine programs including screening, optimization and production of mRNA and LNP formulations across multiple targets.
About Translate Bio

29908,Sanofi and Regeneron Expand Clinical Program of Kevzara (sarilumab) for the Treatment of COVID-19 Outside the US,First patient outside U.S. treated in global Kevzara (sarilumab) clinical trial program for patients with severe COVID-19,"The first patient has been treated as a part of the global clinical program evaluating Kevzara (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. The P-II/III clinical program has initiated in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada and Russia and is enrolling patients instantly
 The study outside the US will assess the safety and efficacy of Kevzara (IV) + SOC vs PBO + SOC and is anticipated to enroll ~300 patients with Regeneron leading US studies and Sanofi leading ex-US studies
 Kevzara is a mAb inhibiting IL-6 pathway by targeting the IL-6 receptor, currently approved in multiple countries for patients with RA, who have not responded to or tolerated previous therapy","Phase 2/3 trial initiated in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada and Russia and is enrolling patients immediately
Kevzara inhibits IL-6, which may play a role in driving the inflammatory immune response that causes acute respiratory distress syndrome observed in patients with severe COVID-19 infection
Sanofi is leading trials outside the U.S., while Regeneron is leading U.S. trials
PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – March 30, 2020 – The first patient outside of the U.S. has been treated as part of a global clinical program evaluating Kevzara® (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. The global clinical program has now been initiated in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and the United States – all countries that have been impacted by COVID-19.
This is the second multi-center, double-blind, Phase 2/3 trial as part of the Kevzara COVID-19 program, and the companies are continuing to work with health authorities around the world to secure initiation at additional sites. This follows Sanofi and Regeneron’s announcement earlier this month of the initiation of the first trial, which is U.S.-based.
“Sanofi and Regeneron are relentlessly working to rapidly initiate trials around the world that will help determine whether Kevzara has the potential to play a role in addressing the COVID-19 global health crisis. These trials will provide important data to determine whether Kevzara ameliorates the life-threatening complications of COVID-19 infections by counteracting the overactive inflammatory responses in the lungs when damaged by the virus. In these unprecedented times, we are deeply grateful for the daily collaboration with health authorities that are enabling us to conduct this clinical work so quickly,” said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Sanofi’s Global Head of Research and Development. “In addition to this clinical trial aiming to help critically ill COVID-19 patients, our work continues to bring forth a vaccine for disease prevention, along with efforts to provide other important Sanofi medicines that may help patients impacted by COVID-19.”
Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway by binding and blocking the IL-6 receptor. IL-6 may play a role in driving the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19 infection. The role of IL-6 is supported by preliminary data from a single-arm study in China using another IL-6 receptor inhibitor.
“Data from a single-arm study in China suggest that the interleukin-6 pathway may play an important role in the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Despite this encouraging finding, it’s imperative to conduct a properly designed, randomized trial to understand the true impact of Kevzara, which we are now doing through this global clinical trial program,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. “In addition to the Kevzara program, Regeneron continues to rapidly advance a novel antibody cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.”
The trial outside of the U.S. will assess the safety and efficacy of adding a single intravenous dose of Kevzara to usual supportive care, compared to supportive care plus placebo. The trial has an adaptive design with two parts and is anticipated to enroll approximately 300 patients. The trial will recruit hospitalized patients from several countries who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19 infection.
Scientists have preliminary evidence that IL-6 may play a key role in driving the inflammatory immune response that causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients critically ill from COVID-19. In an initial, non-peer-reviewed case series from China, a 21-patient cohort of COVID-19 patients experienced rapidly reduced fevers and 75% of patients (15 out of 20) reduced their need for supplemental oxygen within days of receiving another IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab). Based on these results, China updated its COVID-19 treatment guidelines and approved the use of that IL-6 inhibitor to treat patients with severe or critical disease.
The use of Kevzara to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 is investigational and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.
About the Trial
This Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial uses an adaptive design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Kevzara in adults hospitalized with serious complications from COVID-19. To enter the trial, patients must have pneumonia and be hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 that is classified as severe or critical, or who are suffering from multi-organ dysfunction. After receiving the study dose, patients will be assessed for 60 days, or until hospital discharge or death.
In the Phase 2 part of the trial, patients will be randomized 2:2:1 into three groups: Kevzara higher dose, Kevzara lower dose and placebo.
The Phase 2 findings will be utilized in an adaptive manner to determine transition into Phase 3, helping to determine the endpoints, patient numbers and doses.
If the trial continues with all three treatment arms to the end, it is expected to enroll approximately 300 patients, depending on the status of the COVID-19 outbreak and the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19.
About Kevzara® (sarilumab) Injection
Kevzara is currently approved in multiple countries to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded to or tolerated previous therapy.
Kevzara was jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. Kevzara is a fully-human monoclonal antibody. Kevzara binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor, and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity, joint destruction and other systemic problems. Kevzara is being investigated for its ability to reduce the overactive inflammatory immune response associated with COVID-19 based on evidence of markedly elevated levels of IL-6 in severely ill patients infected with coronaviruses.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KEVZARA® (sarilumab) INJECTION
KEVZARA can cause serious side effects including:
SERIOUS INFECTIONS: KEVZARA is a medicine that affects your immune system. KEVZARA can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have serious infections while using KEVZARA, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting KEVZARA. Your healthcare provider should monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with KEVZARA.
Before starting KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you:
think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, with or without a fever. Symptoms may include sweats or chills, muscle aches, a cough, shortness of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, if you feel very tired, or if you are being treated for an infection, get a lot of infections or have repeated infections
have diabetes, HIV, or a weakened immune system
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance of getting certain fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis)
have or have had hepatitis
After starting KEVZARA, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection.
CHANGES IN CERTAIN LABORATORY TEST RESULTS: Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before and after starting KEVZARA to check for low neutrophil (white blood cells that help the body fight off bacterial infections) counts, low platelet (blood cells that help with blood clotting and stop bleeding) counts, and an increase in certain liver function tests. Changes in test results are common with KEVZARA and can be severe. You may also have changes in other laboratory tests, such as your blood cholesterol levels. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests 4 to 8 weeks after starting KEVZARA and then every 6 months during treatment to check for an increase in blood cholesterol levels.
TEARS (PERFORATION) OF THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES: Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines. Some people using KEVZARA had tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go away.
CANCER: KEVZARA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS: Serious allergic reactions can happen with KEVZARA. Get medical attention right away if you have any of the following signs: shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling dizzy or faint; swelling of your lips, tongue or face; moderate or severe stomach (abdominal) pain or vomiting; or chest pain.
Do not use KEVZARA if you are allergic to Sarilumab or any of the ingredients of KEVZARA.
Before using KEVZARA, tell your healthcare provider if you
have an infection
have liver problems
have had stomach (abdominal) pain or a condition known as diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines
recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People who take KEVZARA should not receive live vaccines
plan to have surgery or a medical procedure
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if KEVZARA will harm your unborn baby
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you use KEVZARA. It is not known if KEVZARA passes into your breast milk
take any prescription or nonprescription medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements. It is especially important to tell your healthcare provider if you use any other medicines to treat your RA. Using KEVZARA with these medicines may increase your risk of infection
medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these
The most common side effects include:
injection site redness
upper respiratory tract infection
urinary tract infection
nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose
These are not all the possible side effects of KEVZARA. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. You are encouraged to report side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA at www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.
WHAT IS KEVZARA?

29926,AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) Receives the US FDA's Approval for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,Imfinzi approved in the US for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer,"The approval is based on P-III CASPIAN study assessing Imfinzi + etoposide and carboplatin / cisplatin CT, or Imfinzi + CT + tremelimumab vs CT as monothx. in 805 patients with ES-SCLC across 23 countries
 The Phase III CASPIAN study results: Imfinzi + SOC, reduction in risk of death by 27% with mOS (13.0 vs 10.3 mos.); increased in ORR (68% vs 58%). The safety and tolerability are consistent with the known safety profile
 Imfinzi (durvalumab) is mAb targeting PD-L1, acts by blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 & CD80, received its first approval in Singapore for ES-SCLC in Feb’2020 and is under review in combination with etoposide and carboplatin/ cisplatin as 1L treatment for ES-SCLC in the EU & Japan","Only PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy to demonstrate a significant survival benefit in combination with etoposide and a choice of carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy
AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) has been approved in the US as a 1st-line treatment for adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapies, etoposide plus either carboplatin or cisplatin (platinum-etoposide).
The approval by the Food and Drug Administration was based on positive results from the Phase III CASPIAN trial showingImfinzi in combination with SoC platinum-etoposide demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) versus SoC alone.
SCLC is a highly aggressive, fast-growing form of lung cancer that typically recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to chemotherapy.1,2
Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, said: “The US approval of Imfinzi brings a new medicine to extensive-stage small cell lung cancer patients in urgent need of new options. Imfinzi is the only immunotherapy to show both a significant survival benefit and improved response rate in combination with chemotherapy for these patients, an important step forward in treating this devastating disease.”
Jonathan Goldman, MD, Associate Professor of Hematology & Oncology, UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, California and a lead investigator in the Phase III CASPIAN trial, said: “Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer continue to face a poor prognosis, and finding new medicines to improve outcomes in this setting has been a formidable challenge. The CASPIAN trial enables clinicians to choose durvalumab in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin, making this an important new 1st-line treatment option for patients that is both effective and well-tolerated.”
The Phase III CASPIAN trial had two primary endpoints comparing experimental arms to SoC. In the Imfinzi plus SoC arm, the risk of death was reduced by 27% (equal to a hazard ratio of 0.73; 95% CI 0.59-0.91; p=0.0047), with median OS of 13.0 months versus 10.3 months for SoC alone. Results also showed an increased confirmed objective response rate in the Imfinzi plus SoC arm (68% versus 58% for SoC alone). The safety and tolerability for Imfinzi plus SoC was consistent with the known safety profiles of these medicines. The Imfinzi plus SoC data from the CASPIAN trial were published in The Lancet.3
The second experimental arm testing tremelimumab added to Imfinzi and SoC recently completed, but did not meet its primary endpoint. Details will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
The CASPIAN trial used a fixed dose of Imfinzi (1500mg) administered every three weeks for four cycles while in combination with chemotherapy and then every four weeks until disease progression. As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested following concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC in the Phase III ADRIATIC trial with data anticipated in 2021.
Imfinzi received its first approval based on the Phase III CASPIAN trial in Singapore for patients with ES-SCLC in February 2020. Imfinzi in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is currently under regulatory review for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the 1st-line setting based on the Phase III CASPIAN trial in the EU and Japan.
Small cell lung cancer
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one fifth of all cancer deaths.4 Lung cancer is broadly split into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with about 15% classified as SCLC.5 About two thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with ES-SCLC, in which the cancer has spread widely through the lung or to other parts of the body.6 Prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6% of all SCLC patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.6
CASPIAN
CASPIAN was a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, global, Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of 805 patients with ES-SCLC. The trial compared Imfinzi in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy, or Imfinzi and chemotherapy with the addition of a second immunotherapy, tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy alone. In the experimental arms, patients were treated with four cycles of chemotherapy. In comparison, the control arm allowed up to six cycles of chemotherapy and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation. The trial was conducted in more than 200 centres across 23 countries, including the US, in Europe, South America, Asia and the Middle East. The primary endpoint was OS in each of the two experimental arms.
Imfinzi
Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumour’s immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.
Imfinzi is approved in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after chemoradiation therapy in the US, Japan, China, across the EU and in many other countries, based on the Phase III PACIFIC trial. Imfinzi is approved for the 1st-line treatment of ES-SCLC in combination with SoC chemotherapy in the US and Singapore. Imfinzi is also approved for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer in the US and a small number of other countries.
As part of a broad development programme, Imfinzi is also being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, as a treatment for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer and other solid tumours.
Tremelimumab
Tremelimumab is a human monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine that targets the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Tremelimumab blocks the activity of CTLA-4, contributing to T-cell activation, priming the immune response to cancer and fostering cancer cell death. Tremelimumab is being tested in a clinical trial programme in combination with Imfinzi in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and liver cancer.
AstraZeneca in lung cancer
AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and potential new medicines in late-stage development for the treatment of different forms of lung cancer spanning different histologies, several stages of disease, lines of therapy and modes of action. We aim to address the unmet needs of patients with EGFR-mutated tumours as a genetic driver of disease, which occur in 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and EU and 30-40% of NSCLC patients in Asia, with the approved medicines Iressa (gefitinib) and Tagrisso (osimertinib), and its ongoing Phase III trials ADAURA, LAURA, and FLAURA2.7-9We are also committed to addressing tumour mechanisms of resistance through the ongoing Phase II trials SAVANNAH and ORCHARD which test Tagrisso in combination with savolitinib, a selective inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, along with other potential new medicines. Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate is in development for metastatic non-squamous HER2-overexpressing or HER2-mutated NSCLC including trials in combination with other anticancer treatments.
An extensive late-stage Immuno-Oncology programme focuses on lung cancer patients without a targetable genetic mutation which represents up to three-quarters of all patients with lung cancer.10 Imfinzi, an anti-PDL1 antibody, is in development for patients with advanced disease (Phase III trials POSEIDON and PEARL) and for patients in earlier stages of disease including potentially-curative settings (Phase III trials AEGEAN, ADJUVANT BR.31, PACIFIC-2, PACIFIC-4, PACIFIC-5, and ADRIATIC) both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab and/or chemotherapy. Imfinzi is also in development in the Phase II combination trials NeoCOAST, COAST and HUDSON in combination with potential new medicines from the early-stage pipeline.

Immuno-oncology (IO) is a therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the body’s immune system to attack tumours. The Company’s IO portfolio is anchored by immunotherapies that have been designed to overcome anti-tumour immune suppression. AstraZeneca believes that IO-based therapies offer the potential for life-changing cancer treatments for the clear majority of patients.
The Company is pursuing a comprehensive clinical-trial programme that includes Imfinzi as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of therapy, and where relevant using the PD-L1 biomarker as a decision-making tool to define the best potential treatment path for a patient. In addition, the ability to combine the IO portfolio with radiation, chemotherapy, small targeted molecules from across AstraZeneca’s Oncology pipeline, and from research partners, may provide new treatment options across a broad range of tumours.
AstraZeneca in Oncology
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in oncology and offers a quickly growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients’ lives and the Company’s future. With six new medicines launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, the Company is committed to advance oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to AstraZeneca’s main capabilities, the Company is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by the investment in Acerta Pharma in haematology.
By harnessing the power of four scientific platforms – Immuno-Oncology, Tumour Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates – and by championing the development of personalised combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

PsO who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy
 The P-III study results: patients achieving PASI 75 (89% vs 25%); patients achieving sPGA 0,1 (81% vs 11%); safety profile in pediatric patients is consistent with adult patients
 Taltz is a mAb targeting IL-17A cytokine, inhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor and has received its first FDA’s approval in Mar’2016 for mod. to sev. PsO and for active PsA & AS in adults in Dec’2017 & Aug’2019 respectively","Taltz is the first and only IL-17A antagonist approved to treat this population —

INDIANAPOLIS, March 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company(NYSE: LLY) announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has approved a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Taltz® (ixekizumab) injection, 80 mg/mL for the treatment of pediatric patients (ages 6 to under 18) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Psoriasis affects nearly 8 million people in the U.S.1 Many people living with psoriasis develop symptoms during childhood.2
“As I have often seen in my clinic, psoriasis is particularly challenging for children and adolescents, resulting in itchy and painful symptoms that can feel especially embarrassing for pediatric patients during a crucial developmental period in their young lives,” said Jennifer Cather, M.D., Modern Research Associates, Dallas, Texas. “In the Phase 3 pediatric study, half of patients treated with Taltz achieved completely clear skin after only 12 weeks of treatment. These results and the subsequent FDA approval make a strong case for Taltz as an effective treatment option for doctors to consider for pediatric patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.”
Taltz should not be used in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients. Taltz may increase the risk of infection. Other warnings and precautions for Taltz include pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis, hypersensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunizations. See Important Safety Information below.
“At Lilly, we are working to unite our compassion for individuals with our enthusiasm for scientific discovery in an effort to provide medicines that help make life better for people,” said Patrik Jonsson, senior vice president and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines. “We have over five years of data demonstrating that Taltz is a safe and effective treatment option for psoriasis in adults, and with this approval, we’re pleased to now be able to offer Taltz to more people living with this challenging condition.”
The safety, tolerability and efficacy of Taltz in patients ages 6 to under 18 was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study that included 171 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The co-primary endpoints of the study were the proportion of patients achieving a 75 percent improvement from baseline on their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) and a static Physician’s Global Assessment of clear or almost clear skin (sPGA 0,1) at Week 12.
Patients were randomized to receive Taltz (20 mg for <25 kg, 40 mg for 25-50 kg or 80 mg for >50 kg through Week 12, with 40 mg, 80 mg or 160 mg starting doses, respectively) or placebo. At 12 weeks, the proportion of patients achieving the co-primary endpoints was superior to placebo with statistically significant difference (P<0.001):
89 percent of patients treated with Taltz achieved PASI 75 compared to 25 percent of patients treated with placebo.
81 percent of patients treated with Taltz achieved sPGA 0,1 compared to 11 percent of patients treated with placebo.
Taltz also met all major secondary endpoints in the study (P<0.001), which included the proportion of patients achieving PASI 90, sPGA (0) and PASI 100 at Week 12, and at least a four-point improvement in Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS ≥4) among patients with baseline Itch NRS ≥4 at Week 12, as well as PASI 75 and sPGA 0,1 at Week 4.
Overall, the safety profile observed in pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis treated with Taltz every four weeks is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of the frequencies of conjunctivitis (3%), influenza (2%) and urticaria (2%). In this clinical trial, Crohn’s disease occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group (0.9%) than the placebo group (0%) during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period. Crohn’s disease occurred in a total of four Taltz-treated subjects (2.0%) in the clinical trial. The Taltz safety profile has been studied across 13 clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, with over 5,000 patients receiving Taltz, with a total exposure of over 17,000 patient-years.
“Due to limited pediatric psoriasis treatment options available, treating children and adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis can be challenging,” said Stacie Bell, chief scientific and medical officer, National Psoriasis Foundation. “Having more FDA approved pediatric psoriasis treatment options available is a positive step forward in helping relieve the burden of psoriasis for pediatric patients, their families and the health care providers that treat these young patients.”
Taltz was first approved by the FDA in March 2016 for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The FDA also approved Taltz for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis in December 2017 and for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis in August 2019.
Lilly will work with insurers, health systems and providers to ensure patients are able to access this treatment. Patients, physicians, pharmacists or other healthcare professionals with questions about Taltz should contact The Lilly Answers Center at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or visit www.lilly.com.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR TALTZ
Taltz is approved for the treatment of pediatric patients ages 6 to under 18 with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. In addition, Taltz is approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Taltz is also approved for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TALTZ
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Taltz is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Infections
Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials of adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs 23%). A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.
Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis
Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Taltz. Closely monitor patients receiving Taltz for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
Hypersensitivity
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each ≤0.1%), occurred in the Taltz group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post-marketing use with Taltz. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Taltz immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Patients treated with Taltz may be at an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. In clinical trials, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the Taltz group than the placebo group. During Taltz treatment, monitor patients for onset or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease and if IBD occurs, discontinue Taltz and initiate appropriate medical management.
Immunizations
Prior to initiating therapy with Taltz, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Taltz.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions (≥1%) associated with Taltz treatment are injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, and tinea infections. Overall, the safety profiles observed in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis were consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, with the exception of influenza and conjunctivitis in psoriatic arthritis and conjunctivitis, influenza, and urticaria in pediatric psoriasis.

About Taltz®
Taltz® (ixekizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with interleukin 17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor.3 IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Taltz inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.3
About the Phase 3 Pediatric Study
The FDA approval of Taltz in pediatric patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was based on a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of Taltz in patients from 6 to under 18 years of age. The co-primary endpoints of the study were the proportion of patients achieving a 75 percent improvement from baseline on their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) and a static Physician’s Global Assessment of clear or almost clear skin (sPGA 0,1) at Week 12. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving PASI 90, sPGA 0 and PASI 100 at Week 12, and at least a four-point improvement in Itch numeric rating scale (Itch NRS ≥4) among patients with baseline Itch NRS ≥4 at Week 12, as well as PASI 75 and sPGA 0,1 at Week 4.

PRINCETON, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency has adopted a positive opinion for ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease as defined by clinical or imaging features. ZEPOSIA is an oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity selectively to S1P subtypes 1 (S1P1) and 5 (S1P5). The CHMP recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union.
“This positive CHMP opinion reinforces that ZEPOSIA has the potential to become an important treatment option for patients with relapsing remitting MS with active disease. There remains a need for effective and safe therapies that impact both the relapses and brain lesions that are characteristic of this disease,” said Samit Hirawat, M.D., chief medical officer, Bristol Myers Squibb. “We look forward to the European Commission’s decision and the potential to bring ZEPOSIA to patients in the EU.”
The CHMP adopted the positive opinion based on data from the randomized, active-controlled Phase 3 SUNBEAM™ and RADIANCE™ Part B clinical trials, which enrolled more than 2,600 patients across 150 sites in more than 20 countries. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZEPOSIA for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) on March 25, 2020.
About SUNBEAM™
SUNBEAM is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ZEPOSIA (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI, respectively) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a) for at least a 12-month treatment period. The study included 1,346 people living with RMS across 152 sites in 20 countries.
The primary endpoint of the trial was annualized relapse rates (ARR) during the treatment period. The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months, number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 12 and percent change from baseline in whole brain volume at month 12. Cortical grey and thalamic volume changes were also prospectively assessed versus active comparator.
An analysis of the time to onset of three-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.
About RADIANCE™
RADIANCE Part B is a pivotal, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral ZEPOSIA (0.92 mg and 0.46 mg, equivalent to 1 mg and 0.5 mg ozanimod HCI, respectively) against weekly intramuscular AVONEX® (interferon beta-1a) over a 24-month treatment period. The study included 1,320 people living with RMS across 150 sites in 21 countries.
The primary endpoint of the trial was ARR over 24 months. The secondary MRI endpoints included the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 24 months, number of gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI lesions at month 24 and percent change from baseline in whole brain volume at month 24. Cortical grey and thalamic volume changes were also prospectively assessed versus active comparator.
An analysis of the time to onset of three-month confirmed disability progression was pre-specified using pooled data from both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B phase 3 trials.
About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers the nerves. The myelin damage disrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Ultimately, the nerves themselves may deteriorate — a process that’s currently irreversible. MS affects 700,000 people in Europe and approximately 2.5 million people worldwide.
Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by clearly defined attacks of worsening neurologic function. These attacks — often called relapses, flare-ups or exacerbations — are followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remissions), during which symptoms improve partially or completely with no apparent progression of disease. RRMS is the most common disease course at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 85 percent of patients are initially diagnosed with RRMS, compared with 10-15 percent with progressive forms of the disease.
About ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod)
ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod) is an oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5. ZEPOSIA blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood.The mechanism by which ZEPOSIA exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown but may involve the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.
ZEPOSIA is also in development for additional immune-inflammatory indications, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Contraindications:
Patients who in the last 6 months, experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure or have a presence of Mobitz type II second or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker
Patients with severe untreated sleep apnea
Patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor
Infections: ZEPOSIA may increase the susceptibility to infections. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS therapy) complete blood count (CBC) including lymphocyte count before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Delay initiation of ZEPOSIA in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Consider interruption of treatment with ZEPOSIA if a patient develops a serious infection. Continue monitoring for infections up to 3 months after discontinuing ZEPOSIA.

Herpes zoster was reported as an adverse reaction in ZEPOSIA-treated patients. Herpes simplex encephalitis and varicella zoster meningitis have been reported with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox), or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV), should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating ZEPOSIA. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with ZEPOSIA
Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) were reported in patients treated with another S1P receptor modulator. If CM is suspected, ZEPOSIA should be suspended until cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated.
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that typically occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. No cases of PML were identified in active-controlled MS clinical trials with ZEPOSIA. PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators and other MS therapies and has been associated with some risk factors. If PML is suspected, withhold ZEPOSIA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. If confirmed, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued
In clinical studies, patients who received ZEPOSIA were not to receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS. Concomitant use of ZEPOSIA with any of these therapies would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression. When switching to ZEPOSIA from immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects
Use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months after treatment with ZEPOSIA. If live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, administer at least 1 month prior to initiation of ZEPOSIA
Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays: Since initiation of ZEPOSIA may result in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, dose titration is recommended to help reduce cardiac effects. Initiation of ZEPOSIA without dose escalation may result in greater decreases in heart rate. If treatment with ZEPOSIA is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought for those individuals:

with significant QT prolongation
with arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class 1a or III anti-arrhythmic drugs
with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension
with a history of Mobitz type II second-degree or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sinoatrial heart block
Liver Injury: Elevations of aminotransferases may occur in patients receiving ZEPOSIA. Obtain liver function tests, if not recently available (i.e., within 6 months), before initiation of ZEPOSIA. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have hepatic enzymes checked and ZEPOSIA should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Caution should be exercised when using ZEPOSIA in patients with history of significant liver disease.
Fetal Risk: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on animal studies, ZEPOSIA may cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 3 months after stopping ZEPOSIA.
Increased Blood Pressure: Increase in systolic pressure was observed after about 3 months of treatment and persisted throughout treatment. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment and managed appropriately. Certain foods that may contain very high amounts of tyramine could cause severe hypertension in patients taking ZEPOSIA. Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking ZEPOSIA.
Respiratory Effects: ZEPOSIA may cause a decline in pulmonary function. Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy, if clinically indicated.
Macular edema: S1P modulators have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. Patients with a history of uveitis or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Patients with a history of these conditions should have an ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, prior to treatment initiation and regular follow-up examinations. An ophthalmic evaluation is recommended in all patients at any time if there is a change in vision. Continued use of ZEPOSIA in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated; potential benefits and risks for the individual patient should be considered if deciding whether ZEPOSIA should be discontinued.
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): Rare cases of PRES have been reported in patients receiving a S1P receptor modulator. If a ZEPOSIA-treated patient develops unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms or any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase in intracranial pressure, a complete physical and neurological examination should be conducted. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, treatment with ZEPOSIA should be discontinued.
Unintended Additive Immunosuppressive Effects From Prior Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Drugs:When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation. Initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA after treatment with alemtuzumab is not recommended.
Severe Increase in Disability After Stopping ZEPOSIA: Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease should be considered after stopping ZEPOSIA treatment so patients should be monitored upon discontinuation.
Immune System Effects After Stopping ZEPOSIA: After discontinuing ZEPOSIA, the median time for lymphocyte counts to return to the normal range was 30 days with approximately 90% of patients in the normal range within 3 months. Use of immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system, therefore caution should be applied when initiating other drugs 4 weeks after the last dose of ZEPOSIA.
Most common Adverse Reactions (≥ 4%): upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension.

 Under the new agreement, J&J and BARDA to invest ~1B in research, development & clinical testing of vaccines. J&J will utilize its validated vaccine platform and allocating resources to focus the efforts
 Additionally, J&J to establish new vaccine manufacturing capabilities in the US and production capacity outside the US to begin production of the vaccine, will enable to supply ~1B doses of vaccine globally","Johnson & Johnson and BARDA Together Commit More than $1 Billion to Novel Coronavirus Vaccine Research and Development; Company Expects to Initiate Phase 1 Human Clinical Studies of Vaccine Candidate at Latest by September 2020
Johnson & Johnson Will Establish New U.S. Vaccine Manufacturing Capabilities and Additional Production Capacity Outside the U.S. to Begin Production at Risk to Help Ensure Global Vaccine Supply
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., March 30, 2020 – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the Company) today announced the selection of a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate from constructs it has been working on since January 2020; the significant expansion of the existing partnership between the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA); and the rapid scaling of the Company’s manufacturing capacity with the goal of providing global supply of more than one billion doses of a vaccine. The Company expects to initiate human clinical studies of its lead vaccine candidate at the latest by September 2020 and anticipates the first batches of a COVID-19 vaccine could be available for emergency use authorization in early 2021, a substantially accelerated timeframe in comparison to the typical vaccine development process.
Through a landmark new partnership, BARDA, which is part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Johnson & Johnson together have committed more than $1 billion of investment to co-fund vaccine research, development, and clinical testing. Johnson & Johnson will use its validated vaccine platform and is allocating resources, including personnel and infrastructure globally, as needed, to focus on these efforts. Separately, BARDA and the Company have provided additional funding that will enable expansion of their ongoing work to identify potential antiviral treatments against the novel coronavirus.
As part of its commitment, Johnson & Johnson is also expanding the Company’s global manufacturing capacity, including through the establishment of new U.S. vaccine manufacturing capabilities and scaling up capacity in other countries. The additional capacity will assist in the rapid production of a vaccine and will enable the supply of more than one billion doses of a safe and effective vaccine globally. The Company plans to begin production at risk imminently and is committed to bringing an affordable vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use.
Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said, “The world is facing an urgent public health crisis and we are committed to doing our part to make a COVID-19 vaccine available and affordable globally as quickly as possible. As the world’s largest healthcare company, we feel a deep responsibility to improve the health of people around the world every day. Johnson & Johnson is well positioned through our combination of scientific expertise, operational scale and financial strength to bring our resources in collaboration with others to accelerate the fight against this pandemic.”
Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said, “We greatly value the U.S. government’s confidence and support for our R&D efforts. Johnson & Johnson’s global team of experts has ramped up our research and development processes to unprecedented levels, and our teams are working tirelessly alongside BARDA, scientific partners, and global health authorities. We are very pleased to have identified a lead vaccine candidate from the constructs we have been working on since January. We are moving on an accelerated timeline toward Phase 1 human clinical trials at the latest by September 2020 and, supported by the global production capability that we are scaling up in parallel to this testing, we expect a vaccine could be ready for emergency use in early 2021.”
Johnson & Johnson’s Lead COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate
Johnson & Johnson began efforts in January 2020, as soon as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) sequence became available, to research potential vaccine candidates. Research teams at Janssen, in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, part of Harvard Medical School, constructed and tested multiple vaccine candidates using the Janssen AdVac® technology.
Through collaborations with scientists at multiple academic institutions, the vaccine constructs were then tested to identify those with the most promise in producing an immune response in preclinical testing.
Based on this work, Johnson & Johnson has identified a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate (with two back-ups), which will progress into the first manufacturing steps. Under an accelerated timeline, the Company is aiming to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study in September 2020, with clinical data on safety and efficacy expected to be available by the end of the year. This could allow vaccine availability for emergency use in early 2021. For comparison, the typical vaccine development process involves a number of different research stages, spanning 5 to 7 years, before a candidate is even considered for approval.
For more than 20 years, Johnson & Johnson has invested billions of dollars in antivirals and vaccine capabilities. The COVID-19 vaccine program is leveraging Janssen’s proven AdVac® and PER.C6® technologies that provide the ability to rapidly develop new vaccine candidates and upscale production of the optimal vaccine candidate. The same technology was used to develop and manufacture the Company’s Ebola vaccine and construct our Zika, RSV, and HIV vaccine candidates which are in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical development stages.
Expanded Antiviral Research 
In addition to the vaccine development efforts, BARDA and Johnson & Johnson have also expanded their partnership to accelerate Janssen’s ongoing work in screening compound libraries, including compounds from other pharmaceutical companies. The Company’s aim is to identify potential treatments against the novel coronavirus. Johnson & Johnson and BARDA are both providing funding as part of this partnership. These antiviral screening efforts are being conducted in partnership with the Rega Institute for Medical Research (KU Leuven/University of Leuven), in Belgium.
As announced in February 2020, the Company and BARDA have been working closely with global partners to screen Janssen’s library of antiviral molecules to accelerate the discovery of potential COVID-19 treatments.
COVID-19 belongs to a group of viruses called coronaviruses that attack the respiratory system. There is currently no approved vaccine, treatment or cure for COVID-19.

29979,Abbott Receives FDA's Emergency Use Authorization for its Point-Of-Care Test to Detect Novel COVID-19 in Five Minutes,DETECT COVID-19 IN AS LITTLE AS 5 MINUTES,"Abbott has received the US FDA’s EUA for its molecular point-of-care test to detect novel COVID-19 and runs on its ID NOW platform, delivering positive results in just five mins. and negative results in 13 mins.
 The ID NOW Covid-19 test allows HCPs to perform molecular POC testing outside the hospital in outbreak hotspots. The company anticipates scaling up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests/day with its expected launch in next week
 This marks Abbott’s second FDA’s EUA, following its first EUA for RealTime SARS-CoV-2 test, which runs on m2000 RealTime molecular system for centralized lab environments. Combining both the tests, Abbott expects to produce ~5M tests in April","FDA grants emergency use authorization for fastest available molecular point-of-care test for novel coronavirus.

MAR 27 2020

Abbott has received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the fastest available molecular point-of-care test for the detection of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), delivering positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
What makes this test so different is where it can be used: outside the four walls of a traditional hospital such as in the physicians’ office or urgent care clinics.
The new Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 test runs on Abbott’s ID NOWTM platform—a lightweight box (6.6 pounds and the size of a small toaster) that can sit in a variety of locations.
Because of its small size, it can be used in more non-traditional places where people can have their results in a matter of minutes, bringing an alternate testing technology to combat the novel coronavirus.
We’re ramping up production to deliver 50,000 ID NOW COVID-19 tests per day, beginning next week, to the U.S. healthcare system.
This comes on the heels of our announcement last week of the availability of the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA test under FDA EUA, which runs on m2000 RealTime molecular system for centralized lab environments. Combined with ID NOW, Abbott expects to produce about 5 million tests in April.
Testing remains a crucial step in controlling the novel COVID-19 pandemic. Continuing to supply healthcare providers with new technologies to help curb the spread of infection is a top priority for public health officials and healthcare providers.
Taking molecular testing to the front lines
Molecular point-of-care testing for COVID-19 offers healthcare workers rapid results in more settings where people show up for care. Molecular testing technologies help detect the presence of a virus by identifying a small section of the virus’ genome, then amplifying that portion until there’s enough for detection. This process can cut testing wait time from hours, if not days, to as little as five minutes for positive results and 13 minutes for negative results.
When not being used for COVID-19 testing, ID NOW is the leading molecular point-of-care platform for Influenza A&B, Strep A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) testing. Our platform holds the largest molecular point-of-care footprint in the U.S. and is already widely available in physicians’ offices, urgent care clinics, and hospital emergency departments across the country.
“Through the incredible work of teams across Abbott, we expect to deliver 50,000 COVID-19 tests per day to healthcare professionals on the front lines, where testing capabilities are needed most,” said Chris Scoggins, senior vice president, Rapid Diagnostics, Abbott. “Portable molecular testing expands the country’s capacity to get people answers faster.”
The ID NOW COVID-19 EUA has not been FDA cleared or approved. It has been authorized by the FDA under an emergency use authorization for use by authorized laboratories and patient care settings. The test has been authorized only for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens, and is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ID-Now.jpg,COVID-19|MedTech,0,0,Abbott|COVID-19|Detect|Emergency Use Authorization|FDA|Five Minutes|Novel|Point-Of-Care Test|receives,publish,31/3/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/detect-covid-19-in-as-little-as-5-minutes/,https://pharmashots.com/29979/abbott-receives-fdas-emergency-use-authorization-for-its-point-of-care-test-to-detect-novel-covid-19-in-five-minutes/
29985,Bayer's Nubeqa (darolutamide) Receives the EC's Approval for Men with Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,Nubeqa (darolutamide) receives EU approval as a new treatment for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,"The EC’s approval is based on P-III ARAMIS study assessing Nubeqa (600mg, bid) + ADT vs PBO + ADT 1,509 patients in a ratio (2:1) with nmCRPC
 The P-III ARAMIS study results: improvement in 1EPs of MFS (40.4 vs 18.4mos.), showed a delay in time to pain progression. Time to cytotoxic CT and time to SSE also demonstrated a benefit in favor of Nubeqa at the time of final MFS analysis
 Nubeqa is an ARi that binds to the receptor with high affinity, thus inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer cells and is an approved therapy in the US, Brazil, Australia, Canada, and Japan","Oral androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi) Nubeqa® (darolutamide) approved for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease / Approval is based on Phase III ARAMIS trial results showing a statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival (MFS) for darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo plus ADT, and a favorable safety profile
Berlin, March 30, 2020 – Bayer today announced that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) for Nubeqa® (darolutamide), an oral androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi). The compound, which is developed jointly by Bayer and Orion Corporation, a globally operating Finnish pharmaceutical company, is indicated for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. Bayer is responsible for global commercialization, with a co-promotion of Bayer and Orion Corporation in certain European markets, e.g. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Scandinavia and Finland.
Nubeqa has a distinct chemical structure which inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells while limiting the burden of side effects on patients’ everyday lives. The EU approval is based on the pivotal Phase III ARAMIS trial data evaluating the efficacy and safety of darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to placebo plus ADT. Results demonstrated a highly significant improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint of metastasis-free survival (MFS) of darolutamide plus ADT, with a median of 40.4 months, versus 18.4 months for placebo plus ADT (p<0.001), and a favorable safety profile. Nubeqa is already approved in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, as well as Japan and filings in other regions are underway or planned.
“As men with nmCRPC typically have no symptoms and are leading active lives, it is important to have treatment options that delay the progression of their cancer while minimizing the burdensome side effects of treatment, allowing them to maintain their lifestyle with little disruption. Darolutamide provides a welcome new option with a favorable safety profile that helps patients to stay on therapy and allows us to meet these treatment goals,” said Karim Fizazi, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine at the Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.
Prostate cancer that is confined to the prostate region which is treated with ADT but keeps progressing without showing metastases, even when the amount of testosterone is reduced to very low levels in the body, is known as nmCRPC. In Europe over 67,000 men are estimated to have a CRPC diagnosis based on 2018 prostate cancer incidence numbers. About one-third of men with nmCRPC go on to develop metastases within two years.
“The approval of Nubeqa in Europe supports our commitment to delivering innovative medicines that are differentiated from current options and that address unmet medical needs, improve treatment outcomes and maintain quality of life for men at all stages of the prostate cancer continuum,” said Robert LaCaze, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of the Oncology Strategic Business Unit. “We expect to report results from the pre-planned OS analysis at an oncology meeting later this year.”
“We are pleased to collaborate with Bayer in combining our expertise in the development of Nubeqa® and look forward to our co-promotion in Europe to support patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and their healthcare professionals”, said Satu Ahomäki, Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations of Orion Corporation.
In the ARAMIS trial, overall survival (OS) and time to pain progression were additional secondary efficacy endpoints. At the time of final MFS analysis, a positive trend in OS was observed. OS data were not yet mature. Results from the pre-planned final OS analysis are expected to be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting in 2020. The MFS result was additionally supported by a delay in time to pain progression as compared to placebo plus ADT. All other secondary endpoints, time to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and time to a symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), also demonstrated a benefit in favor of darolutamide at the time of final MFS analysis.
Darolutamide plus ADT has demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The most frequent adverse reactions in the darolutamide plus ADT arm, that occurred with an absolute increase in frequency of ≥2% compared to placebo plus ADT, were fatigue/asthenic conditions (16% vs. 11%), pain in extremity (6% vs. 3%), and rash (3% vs. 1%). Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 9% of patients in both arms of the study.
About the ARAMIS trial
The ARAMIS trial is a randomized, Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral darolutamide in patients with nmCRPC who are currently being treated with ADT and are at high risk for developing metastatic disease. In the clinical study, 1,509 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 600 mg of darolutamide orally twice daily or placebo along with ADT. Patients with a history of seizure were allowed in the study.
About Nubeqa® (darolutamide)
Darolutamide was approved in March 2020 in the European Union under the brand name Nubeqa® for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. Nubeqa has also received regulatory approval in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada as well as Japan, and filings in other regions are underway or planned.
Nubeqa is an oral androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi) with a distinct chemical structure that binds to the receptor with high affinity and exhibits strong antagonistic activity, thereby inhibiting the receptor function and the growth of prostate cancer cells. The compound is also being investigated in a Phase III study in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (ARASENS). Information about these trials can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
About castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) 
Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men worldwide. In 2018, an estimated 1.2 million men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and about 358,000 died from the disease worldwide. Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men. Prostate cancer results from the abnormal proliferation of cells within the prostate gland, which is part of a man’s reproductive system. It mainly affects men over the age of 50, and the risk increases with age.
Treatment options range from surgery to radiation treatment to therapy using hormone-receptor antagonists, i.e., substances that stop the formation of testosterone or prevent its effect at the target location. However, in nearly all cases, the cancer eventually becomes resistant to conventional hormone therapy.
CRPC is an advanced form of the disease where the cancer keeps progressing despite ADT treatment, even when the amount of testosterone is reduced to very low levels in the body. In men with progressive nmCRPC, a rapid prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time has been consistently associated with reduced time to first metastasis and death.

29994,The US FDA Authorizes the Emergency Use of Antimalarial Drugs to Combat COVID-19,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: Daily Roundup March 30, 2020","The US FDA has issued the EUA to the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to be distributed and utilized to treat patients with COVID-19
 The SNS will distribute anti-malarial drugs to the states for doctors to prescribe it to adolescent and adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and who cannot be part of clinical studies
 The SNS will work with FEMA for donating doses to the states. Additionally, the EUA requires fact sheets, providing information regarding the anti-malarial therapies in treating COVID-19 to be made available to HCPs and patients, including the risks and drug interactions associated with the drugs","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced the following actions taken in its ongoing response effort to the COVID-19 pandemic:

On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile(SNS) to be distributed and used for certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19. These drugs will be distributed from the SNS to states for doctors to prescribe to adolescent and adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in treating COVID-19 be made available to health care providers and patients, including the known risks and drug interactions. The SNS, managed by ASPR, will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ship donated doses to states.
On March 29, 2020, the FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance that outlines an enforcement policy to help expand the availability and capability of sterilizers, disinfectant devices and air purifiers. The devices include those intended to make devices sterile, kill pathogens or other microorganisms and kill pathogens or microorganisms in the air. This policy reflects FDA’s commitment to ease burdens on health care providers and facilities as they face COVID-19.
The FDA amended the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Battelle Decontamination System for use in decontaminating compatible N95 respirators for reuse by health care personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This EUA is an important step forward in helping to reduce shortages in critical N95 respirators, by allowing for these important devices, when decontaminated, to be reused by medical professionals on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 30, 2020, the FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance to help expand the availability of surgical apparel for health care professionals, including gowns (togas), hoods, and surgeon’s and patient examination gloves during this public health emergency.
FDA and FTC issued warning letters to two companies for selling unapproved products claiming to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. One of the companies, Corona-cure.com, was warned for selling the product Coronavirus Infection Prevention Nasal Spray with misleading claims on its website that its product is safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. The agencies also warned Carahealth for selling its herbal products, including “Carahealth Immune,” with misleading claims of prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. We are particularly concerned that unapproved drugs that claim to cure, treat, or prevent serious conditions may cause consumers to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious or life-threatening harm. There is currently no approved treatment or preventative measure for COVID-19. FDA and FTC are closely monitoring social media, the online marketplace, and incoming reports for fraudulent COVID-19 products on the market.
The FDA issued an updated guidance, “Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Pandemic,” with an appendix adding questions and answers on this subject. We plan to update this appendix as new questions arise. This guidance is intended for industry, investigators and institutional review boards and was issued because we recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the conduct of clinical trials of medical products, including drugs, devices and biological products.
Diagnostics update to date: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 230 test developers who have said they will be submitting emergency use authorizations (EUA) requests to FDA for tests that detect the virus. To date, 20 emergency use authorizations have been issued for diagnostic tests, including Abbott Diagnostics Scarborough, Inc., ID NOW COVID-19, a rapid (13 minutes or less) test. Additionally, the FDA has been notified that more than 110 laboratories have begun testing under the policies set forth in our COVID-19 Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency Guidance. The FDA also continues to keep its COVID-19 Diagnostics FAQ up to date.
The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

30019,AstraZeneca's Lokelma Receives CHMP's Recommendation for Approval for Patients with Hyperkalemia on Stable Hemodialysis,Lokelma recommended for approval in EU for patients with hyperkalaemia on stable haemodialysis,"The EMA’s CHMP has adopted a positive opinion on a dosing and administration label update for AstraZeneca’s Lokelma to include patients with hyperkalemia on stable hemodialysis
 The recommendation is based on P-IIIb DIALIZE study assessing Lokelma (qd) vs PBO in 196 patients on non-dialysis days for 8wks. The study demonstrated that patients-maintained pre-dialysis potassium levels on at least 3 out of 4 dialysis treatments, following the long interdialytic interval and did not require urgent rescue therapy (41% vs 1%)
 Lokelma is an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension and acts as a highly selective potassium-removing medicine and is an approved therapy for the treatment of hyperkalemia in the US, EU, Canada, Hong Kong, China, Russia and Japan","Label update is based on data from Phase IIIb DIALIZE trial
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion on a dosing and administration label update for AstraZeneca’s Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to include patients with hyperkalaemia on stable haemodialysis.
The recommendation was based on data from the Phase IIIb DIALIZE trial, which showed a significant reduction in potassium levels pre-dialysis for patients receiving Lokelma, compared with placebo.1
Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, said: “Despite being on dialysis, many patients with renal disease still have high potassium levels, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. This recommendation underscores the clinical value that Lokelma could provide to physicians and patients who are looking to normalise potassium levels between dialysis sessions.”
In DIALIZE, 41% of patients receiving Lokelma maintained pre-dialysis potassium levels on at least three out of four dialysis treatments after the long interdialytic interval and did not require urgent rescue therapy. This compared with 1.0% of patients receiving placebo, making it a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement. The safety profile of Lokelmaobserved in DIALIZE was consistent with previous trials.1
Lokelma is a highly selective, oral potassium-removing agent currently approved in the US, EU, Canada, Hong Kong, China, Russia and Japan for the treatment of hyperkalaemia.
Hyperkalaemia
Hyperkalaemia is characterised by high levels of potassium in the blood, generally classified as greater than 5mmol/l.2 Many people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have hyperkalaemia despite being on haemodialysis and often experience fluctuations in their potassium levels.3,4 Patients with high variability in potassium levels between dialysis sessions are at significant risk of arrhythmias which can lead to cardiac arrest.3 Hyperkalaemia occurs in 23% to 47% of patients with CKD and/or heart failure with an estimated 700 million and 64 million people, respectively, living with each condition worldwide.5,6
DIALIZE
DIALIZE is the first ever randomised, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate a potassium binder in patients on stable haemodialysis. The Phase IIIb, multicentre, double-blinded trial investigated the efficacy of Lokelma versus placebo in 196 patients on haemodialysis with hyperkalaemia. Patients were randomised to receive Lokelma or placebo once daily on non-dialysis days for a treatment period of eight weeks. This included a four-week dose adjustment phase (starting at 5g and titrated weekly in 5g increments up to a maximum of 15g) and a four-week evaluation phase on stable dose.
The full results of the DIALIZE trial were published in September 2019 in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.
Lokelma
Lokelma is an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension, that acts as a highly selective potassium-removing medicine. It is administered orally, is odourless, tasteless and stable at room temperature. It has been studied in three double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials and in one 12-month open label clinical trial in patients with hyperkalaemia.

30055,Amgen Provides Update on its Clinical Activities and Medicine Supply Amid COVID-19 Pandemic,Amgen Update Regarding COVID-19 For Media,"Amgen anticipates no disruption in its supply of medicines for patients across the globe due to COVID-19 and is expected to have no shortage of its therapies
 The company has temporarily paused the enrollment/screening in clinical studies to ensure the safety of subjects or integrity of data during a pandemic
 Amgen reported that P-II study of AMG 510 for NSCLC, P-III study of Tezepelumab for Asthma in collaboration with AstraZeneca and P-III study of omecamtiv mecarbil for HF in collaboration with Cytokinetics are all fully enrolled, and does not anticipate any delays in obtaining results","March 31, 2020
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we are committed to doing everything we can to keep our staff and their families safe and to help the communities where we live and work reduce the number of people exposed to the virus. We are also committed to delivering an uninterrupted supply of our medicines for the patients who need them. If you are a patient, medical professional, employee, or member of the community, please see our COVID-19 Information Center page.

IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS
Early in March we activated our business continuity plans to avoid or minimize business disruption and ensure the well-being of our staff.
At this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic we cannot rule out future impact on our business. For example, since the pandemic was declared, we have observed fewer patient/doctor interactions and our representatives are having fewer visits with health care providers which may affect our sales in the future.
We will provide further updates on our business performance when we report our Q1 earnings.
SUPPLY OF OUR MEDICINES
Amgen continues to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world and we do not currently anticipate a shortage of our medicines due to COVID-19.
CLINICAL TRIALS AND R&D EFFORTS
We have clinical work ongoing at investigational sites across the globe.
An increasing number of clinical trial sites are restricting site visits and imposing restrictions on the initiation of new trials and patient visits to protect both site staff and patients from possible COVID-19 exposure.
Given the safety concerns around COVID-19 and the associated risk to maintaining normal clinical trial operations, we are making decisions study-by-study and country-by-country to minimize risk to the patients and facilities.
Accordingly, we have temporarily paused enrollment/screening in clinical trials where there is uncertainty around the ability of sites to ensure subject safety or data integrity at the present time.
We are allowing enrollment to continue in studies where there is the potential for significant benefit in a serious or life-threatening condition and where site resources allow new patients to be safely enrolled and closely monitored.
We are continuing study start-up activities where possible to allow rapid site activation and enrollment at the appropriate time.
Patients already enrolled in studies continue to receive study drug, and we remain focused on supporting our sites in providing care for these patients and providing continued investigational drug supply.
We are actively implementing remote and local procedures per recent FDA guidance and working with investigators for appropriate care of these patients in a safe manner consistent with agency guidelines.
The potentially pivotal AMG 510 Phase 2 non-small cell lung cancer study, the tezepelumab Phase 3 asthma study in collaboration with AstraZeneca, and the omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 heart failure study in collaboration with Cytokinetics are all fully enrolled, and thus we do not anticipate significant delays in obtaining results.
WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES
One component of the Amgen Foundation’s mission is to invest in strengthening communities where Amgen staff members live and work. To that end:
Amgen and the Amgen Foundation have committed up to $12.5 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts directly in the communities where our team members live and work.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla® (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this communication and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

CAMPBELL, Calif., March 31, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — VIVUS, Inc. (Nasdaq: VVUS; the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company, today announced the accelerated launch of the telemedicine and remote monitoring modules of the VIVUS Health Platform. Participating physicians will be able to use the VIVUS Health Platform to conduct virtual office visits, regardless of whether or not the patient is prescribed a VIVUS product. The Company expects to enroll 150-200 physicians into the new modules each week.

“Effective communication around health conditions, such as obesity, can be difficult under the best of circumstances, and are even more challenging in the current environment in which patients, physicians, and care facilities are adhering to social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These guidelines also make it difficult for cystic fibrosis patients, who are at increased risk of COVID-19 due to their compromised lung function, to consult with their healthcare providers,” said John Amos, Chief Executive Officer at VIVUS. “We have rapidly accelerated the launch of our telemedicine and remote monitoring modules to facilitate communication during this unprecedented pandemic and ensure that patients can receive optimum care without leaving their homes.”

The VIVUS Health Platform is designed to integrate pharmaceutical solutions, technology and clinical stakeholders to improve patient outcomes through increased information capture, resulting in enhanced patient access, increased adoption, and treatment durability. It includes the VIVUS Advantage Programs, which offer Patient Assistance Programs to facilitate access to medication for uninsured or underinsured patients with obesity or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and also allows patients prescribed VIVUS medications to have their prescriptions filled online and sent directly to their homes.

The telemedicine and remote monitoring modules are designed to leverage normal clinical practices without disrupting routine clinical operations. While the patient-physician interaction takes place virtually through the VIVUS Health Platform, powered by Vital Tech, all other activities, such as scheduling, patient administration, billing, etc., take place utilizing existing clinic processes and resources. The telemedicine module is configured for easy and rapid activation, allowing physician offices and clinics to implement the platform with minimal effort.

Remote patient monitoring is integrated into the VIVUS Health Platform through the Apple Health Kit, Apple Watch, and a wide variety of blue tooth-enabled health devices that will include weight scales, pulse oximeters, spirometers to measure lung function, and blood pressure cuffs. Data from these devices and the Apple Health Kit are transmitted and collated directly into the VIVUS Health Platform, which can be accessed by the patient’s physician. Physicians can utilize these data to monitor a patient’s vital functions, and can implement or adapt treatment to achieve or maintain target goals for important health metrics.

There are no upfront or monthly fees, and physicians pay a fee only for each telemedicine visit and/or for remote patient monitoring. The VIVUS Health Platform is also not limited by a patient’s health insurance plan.

“Obesity is an epidemic in its own right, and in this time of social distancing, patients may find it more difficult to adhere to a healthy diet and activity goals. Patients with cystic fibrosis are challenged day-to-day with the need to avoid respiratory infections, a challenge that is even more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic underscores the critical importance of helping patients manage health conditions that increase their susceptibility to other diseases,” added Santosh T. Varghese, MD, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer at VIVUS. “VIVUS is committed to addressing these challenges by increasing access to care through telemedicine, online fulfillment of prescriptions, and data collection from smart health devices that allow patients and healthcare providers to monitor health progress in real-time. Additionally, we are expanding this platform into the clinical trial space as we address the challenges of conducting studies in this new environment.”

Physicians interested in enrolling in the VIVUS Health Platform may contact VHP@vivus.com.

Ultragenyx to receive $200 million upfront, including $125 million in cash and $75 million via equity investment

NOVATO, Calif., March 31, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.(NASDAQ: RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel products for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced a strategic partnership and non-exclusive license and technology access agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited for Ultragenyx’s proprietary AAV-based gene therapy manufacturing technologies. Ultragenyx’s HeLa producer cell line (PCL) platform enables large commercial-scale AAV-based gene therapy product manufacturing that is intended to be highly reproducible, more consistent, and less expensive than other gene therapy manufacturing platforms. In addition, Ultragenyx has developed a proprietary HEK293 transient transfection system for AAV manufacture which is also a subject of the collaboration.
Under the license and technology access agreement, Ultragenyx granted Daiichi Sankyo a non-exclusive license to intellectual property, including know-how and patent applications, with respect to its HeLa PCL and HEK293 transient transfection manufacturing technology platforms for AAV-based gene therapy products. The parties will collaborate closely as part of a technology transfer plan to enable Daiichi Sankyo to use the technologies for its internal gene therapy programs. Ultragenyx retains the exclusive right to use its manufacturing technology for its current target indications and additional indications identified now and in the future.
“This new partnership with Daiichi Sankyo provides further validation of the value of Ultragenyx’s gene therapy-related technologies, especially our HeLa producer cell line platform that we believe is the most scalable mammalian cell AAV manufacturing system,” said Emil D. Kakkis, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. “We are encouraged that our proprietary technologies continue to enable the development of numerous programs, both internally and for our partners, to treat patients with serious unmet medical needs.”
“We are currently doing discovery research for gene therapy drugs using AAV vectors as one of our focused modalities toward sustained growth beyond achievement of our 2025 vision,” said Masayuki Yabuta, PhD, Executive Officer, Head of Biologics Division, Daiichi Sankyo. “In order to provide these drugs to patients in the future, manufacturing technology must be established early. Ultragenyx’s proprietary technology is particularly excellent in terms of stable quality, high production efficiency, and ability to accommodate mass production.”
Daiichi Sankyo will be responsible for the manufacture, development, and commercialization of products manufactured with the Ultragenyx technology, except that Ultragenyx receives an option to co-develop and co-commercialize rare disease products at the IND stage. Ultragenyx will also provide strategic consultation to Daiichi Sankyo on the development of both AAV-based gene therapy products and other products for rare diseases.
Under the terms of the agreements, Daiichi Sankyo will make an upfront payment of $125 million and will purchase $75 million of Ultragenyx common stock at a price of approximately $60 per share. Daiichi Sankyo will pay an additional $25 million upon completion of the technology transfer of the HeLa PCL and HEK293 platforms as well as single-digit royalties on net sales of products manufactured in either system. Daiichi Sankyo will reimburse Ultragenyx for all costs associated with the transfer of the manufacturing technology.

30106,BD and BioMedomics Launch Rapid Serology Test to Detect Exposure to COVID-19 in 15 Minutes,"BD, BioMedomics Announce Launch of Rapid Serology Test to Detect Exposure to COVID-19","BioMedomic develops and manufactures the POC tests that will be available through BD and distributed exclusively by Henry Schein to the HCPs in the US
 The POC test detects Abs in the blood to confirm current or past exposure to COVID-19. The test has been clinically validated at several hospitals and clinical laboratories in both the US and China
 The test is completed in four, simple steps. First, blood is collected via blood collection devices like BD Microtainer Contact-Activated Lancet. A few drops of blood are then transferred to the test cartridge, followed by 2-3 drops of a buffer, with its expected result in 15mins showing multiple lines for positive results and a single line for negative results","Point-of-care blood test detects evidence of present or past exposure in 15 minutes
FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J. and MORRISVILLE, N.C., March 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, and BioMedomics, a privately held, North Carolina-based clinical diagnostics company, today announced the release of a new point-of-care test that can detect antibodies in blood to confirm current or past exposure to COVID-19 in as little as 15 minutes.
The new test, developed and manufactured by BioMedomics, will be available through BD and distributed exclusively by Henry Schein, Inc. to health care providers throughout the United States.
BD, BioMedomics COVID-19 Test Procedures
BD, BioMedomics COVID-19 Test Procedures
The test does not require special equipment and may be used in a laboratory or at the point of care. The test detects antibodies in the blood that are produced by the body in response to coronavirus infection. These antibodies are typically present in the middle to later stages of COVID-19 infection, but may remain present after exposure, which helps clinicians determine who has been exposed to the coronavirus, even if a person didn’t exhibit any symptoms of the COVID-19 disease. Data on past exposure is important for researchers to more accurately understand the likely true occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection across a population. This information will be helpful in informing future strategies for combatting COVID-19.
“Serology tests are important because they provide an additional piece of information to aid in characterizing possible prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, especially since many infections are mild or asymptomatic in severity,” said Dave Hickey, president of Integrated Diagnostic Solutions for BD. “Initial evidence suggests that nearly all patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 will have developed a detectable antibody response within days of symptom onset, at which time a negative serologic test, along with molecular diagnostics, could be helpful in ruling out COVID-19. Our agreement with BioMedomics adds a rapid serology test that can augment current tests already on the market, and we are pleased to collaborate in this effort with Henry Schein, which has extensive knowledge of the point-of-care test field.”
The test is completed in four, simple steps. First, blood is collected through normal blood collection devices such as the BD Microtainer® Contact-Activated Lancet. A few drops of blood are then transferred to the test cartridge, followed by two to three drops of a buffer. The results can be read in 15 minutes, similar to how over-the-counter pregnancy tests show multiple lines for positive results and a single line for negative results.
“BioMedomics designed the test to be easy to use and provide results in minutes, with no special equipment necessary or the need to transport the sample to a laboratory for analysis,” said Frank Wang, CEO of BioMedomics. “Our test has been clinically validated at several hospitals and clinical laboratories in both the U.S. and China, and our published clinical data in the Journal of Medical Virology was one of the world’s first for a COVID-19 serology test. It has been used widely in China during the COVID-19 outbreak and is now ready to help combat coronavirus in the U.S. through our collaboration with BD. We are committed to doing our part to battle this disease and are excited to have BD as a partner to help deliver our high-quality rapid test to those who need it most.”
The test analyzes blood, serum or plasma samples for the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies associated with the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). IgM provides the first line of defense during viral infections, followed by the generation of adaptive, high-affinity IgG responses for long-term immunity and immunological memory. The detection of COVID-19 IgM antibodies tends to indicate a recent exposure to COVID-19, and detection of COVID-19 IgG antibodies indicates a later stage of infection, so this combined antibody test could also provide information on the stage of the disease in patients. Current guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude coronavirus infection. Depending on the clinical scenario, additional testing, such as those used on the BD MAX™ System may be considered to further evaluate the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
“We look forward to working with such an outstanding company as BD to help make the antibody test part of the standard of care,” said Stanley M. Bergman, Henry Schein’s chairman of the board and chief executive officer. “The test will help to identify people who have developed antibodies to the virus, which may inform future strategies regarding COVID-19.”
The test has not been reviewed by the FDA but is permitted for distribution and use under the public health emergency guidance issued by FDA on March 16, 2020, and BD expects to begin shipping tests in April. BD will have capacity to supply more than one million tests over the coming months, with the ability to scale up based on market demand and is working with medical products distribution company Henry Schein to make these tests available to medical care facilities throughout the United States. Health care providers can order the test and all collection devices needed to perform the test by contacting their BD or Henry Schein representatives.

30142,FDA Launches Emergency Program to Expedite the Development of COVID-19 Treatments,FDA Launches Program to Speed Development of COVID-19 Treatments,"The US FDA has launched Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP) to expedite the development of safe and effective drugs targeting COVID-19. FDA’s CTAP is a tool to bring new therapies to the patients as soon as possible
 Under CTAP, FDA is redeploying staff and streamlining processes to hasten the reviews of clinical trial protocols and single-patient expanded-access requests
 FDA unveiled that 10 therapeutic agents are in active trials and 15 agents in the planning stages. The FDA highlights some treatments that are currently being investigated for COVID-19 including Gilead’s remdesivir, Roche’s Actemra (tocilizumab) and Sanofi & Regeneron’s Kevzara (sarilumab)","The FDA unveiled a new initiative, dubbed the “Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Programme (CTAP),” designed to expedite the development of effective treatments for patients with COVID-19. Alex Azar, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said that “as part of this new program, the FDA is cutting red tape, redeploying staff and working day and night to review requests from companies, scientists and doctors who are working toward therapies.”
According to the FDA, CTAP is using “every tool” at the agency’s disposal to bring new therapies to patients as quickly as possible. These include triaging requests from developers and scientists working on new drug and biologic therapies, getting the relevant FDA staff in touch with them and providing rapid, interactive input to get studies under way quickly.
The agency noted, for example, that it “has reviewed study protocols within 24 hours in many cases and has reviewed single-patient expanded access requests generally within three hours.” It said it has also rearranged medical and regulatory staff to serve on review teams dedicated specifically to COVID-19 therapies and provided resources to help researchers submit emergency requests to use investigational products. In addition, the agency highlighted the potential of real-world data sources to complement traditional clinical studies, and as such, it is “advancing relationships with partners in the public and private sectors to rapidly collect and analyse information in areas such as illness patterns and treatment outcomes.”
Potential treatments currently being investigated for COVID-19 include antivirals such as Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir, while scientists are also evaluating other drugs, such as IL-6 receptor inhibitors, which include Roche’s Actemra (tocilizumab) and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ Kevzara (sarilumab), that may help reduce lung inflammation and improve lung function in infected patients.
The agency also pointed to interest in examining the potential of antibody-rich blood products such as convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin taken from blood donated by recovered patients.

About Remdesivir
Remdesivir is an investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity demonstrated both in vitro and in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens including Marburg, MERS, SARS, and more recently Ebola. The viral pathogens MERS and SARS are also coronaviruses and are structurally similar to the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. As this is a new virus, there are no approved medicines and little clinical trial data with potential treatments. The limited preclinical data for remdesivir in MERS and SARS indicates that the medicine may have potential activity against SARSCoV-2. Remdesivir is an investigational agent – it is not approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use.

Merck to Share Data from KEYNOTE-177 with Global Regulatory Authorities and at an Upcoming Medical Congress

KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-177 trial evaluating first-line treatment of KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer met one of its dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS). Based on an interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), KEYTRUDA monotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy (investigator’s choice of mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI, with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab). Based on the recommendation of the DMC, the study will continue without changes to evaluate overall survival (OS), the other dual primary endpoint. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with previously reported studies, and no new safety signals were identified.

“These head-to-head data with KEYTRUDA are the first time a single-agent, anti-cancer therapy, and particularly an anti-PD-1 monotherapy, achieved a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival over chemotherapy, including the current standard of care regimen of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab, in patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “These data in the first-line treatment setting provide further evidence of the benefits of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients whose tumors are MSI-H or dMMR. We look forward to sharing these data as quickly as possible with the medical community and regulatory authorities.”

In May 2017, KEYTRUDA became the first cancer therapy approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for use based on a biomarker, regardless of tumor type, in previously treated patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors.

Microsatellite instability (or MSI) is defined by the National Cancer Institute as a change that occurs in the DNA of certain cells (such as tumor cells) in which the number of repeats of microsatellites (short, repeated sequences of DNA) is different from the number of repeats that was in the DNA when it was inherited. The cause of microsatellite instability may be a defect in the ability to repair mistakes made when DNA is copied in the cell. This defect is also referred to as mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of colorectal cancer patients have tumors that score as either MSI-H or dMMR when testing is performed.

About KEYNOTE-177
KEYNOTE-177 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02563002) is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA monotherapy versus standard of care chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with MSI-H or dMMR advanced colorectal cancer. The dual primary endpoints are PFS and OS, and the secondary endpoint is ORR. The study enrolled 308 patients who were randomized to receive either:

KEYTRUDA (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks for up to 35 cycles of treatment [up to approximately two years]); or
Investigator’s choice of one of the following chemotherapy-based regimens: mFOLFOX6; mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each two-week cycle); mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab (400 mg/m2 IV, then 250 mg/m2 weekly in each two-week cycle); FOLFIRI; FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each two-week cycle); or FOLFIRI plus cetuximab (400 mg/m2 IV, then 250 mg/m2 weekly in each two-week cycle).
About Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer starts in the colon or the rectum, and these cancers are referred to as colon cancer and rectal cancer depending on where the cancer starts. Colorectal cancer often begins with growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called polyps, which can change into cancer over time. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide.It is estimated there were nearly 850,000 new cases of colorectal cancer and more than 880,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2018. In the United States, it is estimated there will be nearly 105,000 new cases of colon cancer and more than 43,000 new cases of rectal cancer, resulting in more than 53,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in 2020.The five-year survival rates for advanced/metastatic colon cancer and rectal cancer (stage IV) are estimated to be 14% and 15%, respectively.

About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg
KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib)

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib
KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia.

Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis.

Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions
Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction.

The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use.

Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.

Infusion-Related Reactions
KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions.

In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

− Vir to Lead Development of Potential Coronavirus RNAi Therapeutic Candidates Discovered by Alnylam, with Alnylam Retaining an Option for 50-50 Participation −

SAN FRANCISCO & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apr. 2, 2020– Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY) today announced an expansion to their broad multi-target existing collaboration for the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics for infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19. This expansion includes up to three additional targets focused on host factors for SARS-CoV-2, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2, both of which are considered critical for viral entry, with the potential for an additional host target to emerge from Vir’s functional genomics work.

Pursuant to an amendment to the collaboration agreement, the companies will utilize Alnylam’s recent advances in lung delivery of novel conjugates of siRNA – the molecules that mediate RNAi – together with Vir’s infectious disease expertise and established capabilities, to bring forward up to three additional host factor-targeting development candidates (DCs) to treat SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other coronaviruses as well. The two named targets include angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). ACE2 is known to be the viral entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, while TMPRSS2 is believed to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to facilitate cellular attachment. The third target is expected to emerge from Vir’s ongoing functional genomics efforts to identify novel host factors pertinent to coronaviral infection and targetable by siRNA, mAbs or small molecules.

As part of the original collaboration to advance investigational RNAi therapeutics to treat disease caused by coronavirus infection, Alnylam has designed and synthesized over 350 siRNAs targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Lead siRNAs have recently been identified by scientists at Alnylam and are now being further evaluated by scientists at Vir for anti-viral activity in support of DC selection. Upon DC selection, Vir will lead development efforts – working closely with Alnylam to generate the data required to enable the potential for rapid commencement of clinical studies.

“Vir is aggressively pursuing multiple platforms and multiple therapeutic strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We are excited about our partnership with Alnylam – which has already led to identification of promising siRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 – and we’re pleased to now expand our efforts to evaluate the anti-viral effects of siRNAs targeting human host factors,” said George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO of Vir. “We share a sense of urgency with Alnylam in advancing these efforts as quickly as possible and with the highest priority.”

“The biopharmaceutical industry needs to advance its full armamentarium of potential treatment approaches and strategies to address the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we are excited about the promise of targeting host factors critical for viral infection and replication, in addition to our efforts directly targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. “At this time of enormous public health need, we plan to act with the utmost urgency to broaden and accelerate our efforts with Vir to develop investigational RNAi therapeutics against COVID-19, and potentially future coronavirus diseases.”

Under the collaboration and license agreement, as amended, in addition to leading development of selected DCs, Vir will lead commercialization of any products emerging from the collaboration that gain regulatory approval. At clinical proof of concept, Alnylam will have an option to share equally in any profits and losses associated with the development and commercialization of each coronavirus program. Alternatively, Alnylam may elect to earn development and commercialization milestones and royalties on net sales of any products resulting from the collaboration in amounts agreed upon for each coronavirus program. These additional targets expand the companies’ collaboration and license agreement announced in 2017, and the subsequent amendment to that agreement announced in March 2020, to now develop novel siRNAs for up to nine infectious disease targets in total, including hepatitis B virus in the Vir-2218 (ALN-HBV02) program currently in Phase 1/2 studies.

About RNAi
RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors – that encode for disease-causing proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.

About RUXIENCE (rituximab biosimilar)

RUXIENCE is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilar to MabThera which works by targeting a protein called CD20, which is present on the surface of B lymphocytes, also known as B cells. When it attaches to CD20, rituximab helps destroy these B cells.

RUXIENCE safety information

Do not use RUXIENCE if you are allergic to rituximab or other proteins which are like rituximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, if you have a severe active infection at the moment or if you have a weak immune system.

RUXIENCE should also not be used if you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris.

Before starting treatment with RUXIENCE, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if:

you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, RUXIENCE could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. Patients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection
you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing problems
you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if:

you are taking medicines for high blood pressure
you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or immune-suppressive medicines
If you have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris, also tell your doctor if:

you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected by RUXIENCE help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you are given RUXIENCE
you had a lot of infections in the past or suffer from severeinfections
you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to travel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as RUXIENCE or in the months after you receive RUXIENCE
If you are not sure, talk to your healthcare professional before you are given RUXIENCE.

Like all medicines, RUXIENCE can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side effects are mild to moderate, but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of these reactions have been fatal.

Infusion reactions

RUXIENCE is given by intravenous infusion into your vein. During or within the first 24-hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less frequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness (nausea), tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat discomfort, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart attack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get worse.

Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you develop any of these symptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional treatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol.

Infections

You might get infections more easily during your treatment with RUXIENCE. Tell your doctor immediately if you get signs of an infection including:

fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell
memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, serious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML)
If you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris, you will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card you have been given by your doctor. It is important that you keep this Alert Card and show it to your partner or caregiver. Your doctor will also give you a patient booklet with more detailed information on the risks and symptoms of infections and PML.

Skin reactions

Very rarely, severe blistering skin conditions that can be life-threatening may occur. Redness, often associated with blisters, may appear on the skin or on mucous membranes, such as inside the mouth, the genital areas or the eyelids, and fever may be present. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.

Other very common side effects of RUXIENCE treatment include:

If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia:

bacterial or viral infections, bronchitis
low number of white blood cells, with or without fever or blood cells called “platelets”
feeling sick (nausea)
bald spots on the scalp, chills, headache
lower immunity – because of lower levels of antibodies called “immunoglobulins” (IgG) in the blood which help protect against infection
If you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis:

infections such as pneumonia (bacterial)
pain on passing water (urinary tract infection)
allergic reactions that are most likely to occur during an infusion, but can occur up-to 24-hours after infusion
changes in blood pressure, nausea, rash, fever, feeling itchy, runny or blocked nose and sneezing, shaking, rapid heartbeat, and tiredness
headache
changes in laboratory tests carried out by your doctor. These include a decrease in the amount of some specific proteins in the blood (immunoglobulins) which help protect against infection
If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis:

infections, such as chest infections, pain on passing water (urinary tract infections), colds and herpes infections
allergic reactions that are most likely to occur during an infusion, but can occur up-to 24-hours after infusion
diarrhea
coughing or shortness of breath
nose bleeds
raised blood pressure
painful joints or back
muscle twitches or shakiness
feeling dizzy
tremors (shakiness, often in the hands)
difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
swelling of the hands or ankles
If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris:

allergic reactions that are most likely to occur during an infusion, but can occur up to 24 hours after infusion
long lasting depression
loss of hair
RUXIENCE may also cause changes in laboratory tests carried out by your doctor. If you are having RUXIENCE with other medicines, some of the side effects you may get may be due to the other medicines.

Please refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for RUXIENCE for complete safety information.

30220,Celularity's New Cell Therapy Receives the US FDA's IND Approval for COVID-19,"Celularity Announces FDA Clearance of IND Application for CYNK-001 in Coronavirus, First in Cellular Therapy","Following the IND approval, Celularity will initiate P-I/II study assessing CYNK-001 in 86 patients with COVID-19. The company deems CYNK-001 is the first FDA’s IND cleared immunotherapy to treat COVID-19 infected adults
 Cell therapy works by boosting the body’s early immune response in a way it could target the coronavirus. CYNK-001 limits the SARS-CoV-2 replication and disease progression by eliminating the infected cells
 CYNK-001 is the only cryopreserved allogeneic, off-the-shelf NK cell therapy, being developed from placental hematopoietic stem cells and being investigated for hematologic cancers and solid tumors","WARREN, N.J., April 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — Celularity Inc. (“Celularity” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage company developing allogeneic cellular therapies from human placentas, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the use of its proprietary CYNK-001 in adults with COVID-19. With this, Celularity will commence a Phase I/II clinical study including up to 86 patients with COVID-19. The Company believes CYNK-001 is the first immunotherapy IND cleared by the FDA to treat COVID-19 infected adults.

“This IND represents a significant step toward a potential treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 virus, which is spreading globally at unanticipated rates,” said Robert Hariri, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, Chairman and CEO at Celularity. “With our initial clinical study, we will gain an understanding of the impact CYNK-001 can have on patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. We are hopeful to contribute to flattening the COVID-19 curve, expanding on the promising early results we’ve seen in our clinical studies in devastating cancers to patients with coronavirus.” Dr. Hariri also thanked the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) in his statement, “While most of its work occurs out of the public’s eye, CBER embodies the public service ideal amidst the current crisis. Thanks to the women and men of CBER for their tireless effort to guide us through the IND process.”

CYNK-001 is the only cryopreserved allogeneic, off-the-shelf Natural Killer (NK) cell therapy being developed from placental hematopoietic stem cells and is being investigated as a potential treatment option for various hematologic cancers and solid tumors. NK cells are a unique class of immune cells, innately capable of targeting cancer cells and interacting with adaptive immunity. CYNK-001 cells derived from the placenta are intrinsically safe and versatile and are currently being investigated as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

“Studies have established that there is robust activation of NK cells during viral infection regardless of the virus class,” says Celularity’s Chief Scientific Officer, Xiaokui Zhang, PhD. “CYNK-001 demonstrates a range of biological activities expected of NK cells, including expression of activating receptors such as NKG2D, DNAM-1 and the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46, which bind to stress ligands and viral antigens on infected cells. They also show the expression of cytolytic molecules perforin and granzyme B, which kill recognized infected cells. These functions suggest that CYNK-001 could provide a benefit to COVID-19 patients in terms of limiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and disease progression by eliminating the infected cells.”

Neutralizing antibodies defend healthy cells by interfering with the biological function of an invading virus. These antibodies may be used therapeutically to treat someone currently fighting the disease and can be given to people who have heightened risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as healthcare workers.

“Our strong history of collaboration with Adaptive gives us the ability to immediately mobilize our combined resources to help address the urgency in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. After swiftly obtaining viral gene sequences from hundreds of patients, Amgen was motivated to use these insights and quickly pair them with our drug development and manufacturing capabilities. Working with Adaptive and using their viral-neutralizing antibody platform will expedite our ability to bring a promising new medicine into clinical trials as quickly as possible,” said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer at Amgen.

Adaptive will extend its high throughput platform to rapidly screen the massive genetic diversity of the B cell receptors from individuals that have recovered from COVID-19. This enables the identification of tens of thousands of naturally occurring antibodies from survivors of COVID-19 to select those that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Amgen will then leverage its world-class antibody engineering and drug development capabilities to select, develop and manufacture antibodies designed to bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of Amgen located in Iceland, will provide genetic insights from patients who were previously infected with COVID-19.

“We are extremely motivated to join forces with our trusted partner, Amgen, to tackle this global health crisis,” said Chad Robins, chief executive officer and co-founder of Adaptive Biotechnologies. “This partnership expands our drug discovery capabilities, demonstrating the power and versatility of our immune medicine platform.”

The two companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enable the parties to start work immediately and are planning to execute a Collaboration and License Agreement. Terms of the agreement are not being disclosed. Both companies aim to accelerate the development of a potential antibody against COVID-19 as fast as possible for patients in need.

30234,Novartis and Incyte Intend to Initiate the P-III RUXCOVID Study of Jakavi (ruxolitinib) as a Treatment for Patients with COVID-19 Associated Cytokine Storm,Novartis announces plan to initiate clinical study of Jakavi in severe COVID-19 patients and establish international compassionate use program,"The P-III RUXCOVID study will assess Jakavi + SOC vs SOC as monothx. in patients with severe COVID-19 as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The collaborative study will be sponsored by Incyte in the US and Novartis outside the US
 The decision is based on preclinical evidence and preliminary reports from independent studies and is supported by data on the safety and efficacy of Jakavi in acute GVHD and MPNs. Additionally, Incyte intends to commence an open-label emergency Expanded Access Program (EAP) in the US to allow eligible patients with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm to receive ruxolitinib
 Novartis will establish an international compassionate use program for COVID-19 patient access to ensure no disruption in the supply of Jakavi for currently licensed indications. Jakavi (ruxolitinib) is JAK 1 & 2 tyrosine kinases inhibitor and is an approved therapy in 101 countries for patients with MF and 75+ countries for PV","New clinical trial to evaluate Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) in patients with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm 
Cytokine storm is a type of severe immune overreaction that can result from coronavirus infection and may contribute to respiratory compromise in patients with COVID-191-3
Pre-clinical and preliminary clinical evidence suggests Jakavi, a well-established JAK inhibitor, could reduce the number of patients requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation
Novartis to establish compassionate use program for COVID-19 patient access and undertake steps to ensure uninterrupted supply of Jakavi for currently licensed indications
Basel, April 2, 2020 — Novartis today announced plans to initiate a Phase III clinical trial in collaboration with Incyte to evaluate the use of Jakavi®(ruxolitinib) for treatment of a type of severe immune overreaction called cytokine storm that can lead to life-threatening respiratory complications in patients with COVID-191-3.

The decision is based on pre-clinical evidence and preliminary reports from independent studies, and is supported by extensive data on the safety and efficacy of Jakavi in conditions like acute graft versus host disease and myeloproliferative neoplasms. The proposed trial will assess Jakavi in combination with standard of care (SoC) therapy, compared to SoC therapy alone, in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

“Novartis is taking a number of steps to address the urgent needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the evaluation of our existing therapies to assess if any can be utilized beyond their approved indications,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “The potential that Jakavi could lead to faster recovery times for COVID-19 patients with fewer requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation is encouraging and absolutely merits further investigation. We now are moving rapidly to finalize the study plan and then to enroll eligible patients, as well as put in place a process to provide access for patients unable to participate in the trial.”

Given the rapid spread of the pandemic, and as plans for the study are finalized, Novartis also has set up an international compassionate use program for eligible patients, subject to local regulations. In addition, we are taking steps to manage the anticipated increase in COVID-19 related requests for Jakavi without interrupting access for patients taking the drug for its licensed indications. In the US, ruxolitinib access requests are coordinated by Incyte.

Novartis commitment and response to COVID-19
Novartis is deeply dedicated to the global effort to combat COVID-19 and doing our part to support the stability of global healthcare systems. We announced a broad set of measures including the creation of a global fund of USD 20 million to support communities around the world impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Novartis also has committed 130 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to support pandemic response. In addition, Novartis joined two key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard, as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership organized by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis is separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. To support access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19. More information about the Novartis response to COVID-19 is available on Novartis.com/coronavirus.

About Jakavi® (ruxolitinib)
Jakavi (ruxolitinib) is an oral inhibitor of the JAK 1 and JAK 2 tyrosine kinases. Jakavi is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea and for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF) (also known as chronic idiopathic MF), post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Jakavi is approved in 101 countries for patients with MF, including EU countries, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and in more than 75 countries for patients with PV, including EU countries, Switzerland, Japan and Canada. The exact indication for Jakavi varies by country. Additional worldwide regulatory filings are underway in MF and PV.

Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte Corporation for development and commercialization in selected indications outside the United States. Ruxolitinib is marketed in the United States by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi®for patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, for patients with intermediate or high-risk MF, and steroid-refractory acute GvHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older4.

The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in PV is 10 mg given orally twice daily. The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in MF is 15 mg given orally twice daily for patients with a platelet count between 100,000 cubic millimeters (mm) and 200,000 mm, and 20 mg twice daily for patients with a platelet count of >200,000 mm. Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy. There is limited information to recommend a starting dose for MF and PV patients with platelet counts between 50,000/mm and <100,000/mm. The maximum recommended starting dose in these patients is 5 mg twice daily, and patients should be titrated cautiously4.

Jakavi is a registered trademark of Novartis AG in countries outside the United States. Jakafi is a registered trademark of Incyte Corporation. The safety and efficacy profile of Jakavi has not yet been established outside of its approved indications.

Jakavi Important Safety Information for Treatment of Myelofibrosis (MF) and Polycythemia Vera (PV)

30280,GSK Collaborates with Innovax to Evaluate a Vaccine Against COVID-19 Pandemic,Update on GSK actions to support the global response to COVID-19,"The companies collaborated to assess recombinant protein-based COVID-19 XWG-03, being developed by Innovax with Xiamen University
 GSK will provide Innovax access to its adjuvant system for preclinical evaluation of the COVID-19 XWG-03. GSK’s adjuvants are additives used in vaccines to boost the body’s immune response to the relevant threat
 The COVID-19 XWG-03 is based on a series of truncated S (spike) proteins which will be screened during the pre-clinical testing and a lead candidate will be determined based on its immunogenicity. Additionally, in 2019, the companies collaborated to develop a vaccine for HPV to devise a successor to Cervarix","Message from Emma Walmsley, CEO, GSK
GSK is closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and is supporting global efforts to tackle the virus. Since the outbreak, we have been actively exploring ways to help, with our science and expertise, alongside protecting the health and wellbeing of our people and managing our global supply chains to support patients and consumers who depend on our products.

Supporting research and production of candidate COVID-19 vaccines

GSK’s initial response to the outbreak of COVID-19 has been to make our vaccine adjuvant technology available to scientists and organisations working on promising vaccine candidates and technology platforms. The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protecting more people.

Since announcing collaborations with the University of Queensland and Clover Biopharmaceuticals, we have expanded our collaborations and are now collaborating with several companies and research groups across the world, including in the USA and China.

Most recently, we have announced that GSK and Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co., Ltd. will collaborate to evaluate a recombinant protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate (COVID-19 XWG-03), being developed by Innovax with Xiamen University. GSK will provide Innovax with its pandemic adjuvant system for preclinical evaluation of the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 XWG-03 vaccine candidate technology is based on a series of truncated S (spike) proteins which will be screened during the pre-clinical testing and a lead candidate will be determined by immunogenicity data.

Early indications of the adjuvant’s benefit have been reported in the first pre-clinical experiments by one of the collaborations. GSK expects data to be reported from the various collaborations over the next 3 months and these data will inform next steps for clinical development of the candidate vaccines.

GSK is evaluating further collaboration opportunities with several other companies and institutions. The company is also exploring options to share available manufacturing capacity, to help provide scale manufacturing and production for an eventual vaccine.

What is an adjuvant?
An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response, thereby creating a stronger and longer lasting immunity against infections than the vaccine alone. The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it can reduce the amount of antigen required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and made available to more people.

Screening and research into new medicines

GSK is entering into the new collaborative research effort, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator. The aim of the Accelerator is to bring pharmaceutical companies and expert academic institutions into coordinated research programs, with the aim of bringing the most promising molecules forward that could be used to treat cases of COVID-19. GSK will contribute by making available compounds from its libraries for screening for activity against COVID-19.

In addition, GSK is evaluating its marketed pharmaceutical products and medicines in development to determine if any could be used beyond their current indications in response to the pandemic. This includes medicines with potential direct anti-viral activity and those with possible utility in prevention or treatment of secondary complications of COVID-19. The company is also evaluating options to make available its specialised R&D laboratory space to help in research and testing of COVID-19.

Helping frontline health workers and offering expertise

GSK is donating $10 million to The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, created by the UN Foundation and WHO, to support WHO and partners to prevent, detect, and manage the pandemic, particularly where the needs are the greatest. Amongst its objectives, the fund will enable distribution of essential supplies such as personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline health workers. GSK is also donating surplus reagents to support diagnostic testing to several countries and is preparing to do the same for surplus PPE.

GSK has also initiated new volunteering processes for people working at the company, to enable those with medical expertise to provide support to frontline health workers, whilst at the same time ensuring we protect supply and development of our medicines and vaccines. Initiatives have also been started to use salesforce personnel to help with delivery of PPE and testing equipment, and for specialists, such as procurement leaders, to work with national governments on developing supply chains.

Taking action to deliver high-demand consumer healthcare products

GSK Consumer Healthcare is prioritising actions in its supply chain to deliver more products that are in high demand, due to COVID-19. This includes increasing production for pain relief brands such as Panadol and multi-vitamins and dietary supplements such as Emergen-C and Centrum.

Further actions and updates

We will provide regular updates on our progress and our efforts to support the global response to COVID-19. We continue to monitor the situation closely and will take further actions to develop our response to the pandemic, including ideas and support for long-term, global pandemic preparedness. In doing so, we will continue to put the needs of patients and our people first at all times.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GSK-17.jpg,Biotech|COVID-19,GSK | Innovax,Vaccine,COVID-19|biotech|Against|Collaborates|Evaluate|Pandemic,publish,4/6/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/update-on-gsk-actions-to-support-the-global-response-to-covid-19/,https://pharmashots.com/30280/gsk-collaborates-with-innovax-to-evaluate-a-vaccine-against-covid-19-pandemic/
30291,EMA's CHMP Recommends Compassionate Use of Gilead's Remdesivir for COVID-19,EMA provides recommendations on compassionate use of remdesivir for COVID-19,"On Apr 02, 2020, EMA’s CHMP has recommended Gilead’s Remdesivir to be used for treating COVID-19 in compassionate use programmes in the EU
 Compassionate use programmes are intended to provide patients access to therapies that are under development and have not yet received a marketing authorization. The CHMP encourages Gilead to make remdesivir available in a transparent way to those Member States wishing to take part in international clinical studies or treat patients in compassionate use programmes
 Estonia, Greece, the Netherlands and Romania requested CHMP’s opinion on the conditions under which early access to Remdesivir via compassionate use could be offered to patients with COVID-19","During an extraordinary virtual meeting held on 2 April 2020, EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) gave recommendations on how the investigational antiviral medicine remdesivir should be used for treating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in compassionate use programmes in the European Union.

Compassionate use programmes, which are set up at the level of individual EU Member States, are intended to give patients with a life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously disabling disease and no available treatment options, access to treatments that are still under development and that have not yet received a marketing authorisation.

In this case Estonia, Greece, the Netherlands and Romania requested an opinion from the CHMP on the conditions under which early access to remdesivir through compassionate use could be given to patients with COVID‑19. In severe cases, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, multi-organ failure and death.

“Clinical trials remain the gold standard for the collection of robust data on the safety and effectiveness of investigational medicinal products, but the CHMP acknowledges the need for a harmonised approach to compassionate use in the EU to allow access to remdesivir for patients who are not eligible for inclusion in clinical trials”, said Dr Harald Enzmann, the chair of the CHMP. “The CHMP encourages the company to make remdesivir available in a fair and transparent way to those Member States wishing to take part in international clinical trials or treat patients in compassionate use programmes.”

Remdesivir has been shown to be active against SARS-CoV-2 and other types of coronavirus (i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in laboratory studies; however, there are currently only limited data on the use of remdesivir in patients with COVID‑19.

The aim of the CHMP’s recommendations for remdesivir is to ensure a common approach regarding the criteria and conditions of its use prior to authorisation of compassionate use programmes by Member States. The recommendations are for EU Member States that are considering setting up such a programme and their implementation is not mandatory. In addition to describing which patients may benefit from the medicine, the recommendations explain how to use remdesivir and give preliminary information on its safety.

The PDF iconsummary on compassionate use and PDF iconconditions of use of remdesivir in this setting are available on the Agency’s website.

More about the medicine

Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine which is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir is a ‘viral RNA polymerase inhibitor’ (a medicine that interferes with the production of viral genetic material, preventing the virus from multiplying). It has shown broad in vitro activity against different RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and was originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus disease.

Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead Sciences Ireland CU and is given by infusion (drip) into a vein.

More about the procedure

National competent authorities can ask EMA for an opinion on how to administer, distribute and use certain medicines for compassionate use under Article 83 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.",https://pharmashots.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gilead-8.jpg,COVID-19|Regulatory,EMA-CHMP | Gilead,Remdesivir,COVID-19|regulatory|Compassionate Use|Recommends,publish,4/6/2020,https://pharmashots.com/press-releases/ema-provides-recommendations-on-compassionate-use-of-remdesivir-for-covid-19/,https://pharmashots.com/30291/emas-chmp-recommends-compassionate-use-of-gileads-remdesivir-for-covid-19/

Human iPSCs possess the unique dual properties of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential into all cell types of the body. The Company’s first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event and selecting a single engineered iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, clonal master iPSC lines are a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf for patient treatment. As a result, the Company’s platform is uniquely capable of overcoming numerous limitations associated with the production of cell therapies using patient- or donor-sourced cells, which is logistically complex and expensive and is subject to batch-to-batch and cell-to-cell variability that can affect clinical safety and efficacy. Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 250 issued patents and 150 pending patent applications.
